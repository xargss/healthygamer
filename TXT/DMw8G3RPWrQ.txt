---------00:00----------
mind works you have a unique cognitive


---------00:01----------
fingerprint which is that you juggle a


---------00:03----------
lot of balls


---------00:04----------
i guess that you get pretty excited


---------00:05----------
about stuff


---------00:07----------
um and what


---------00:11----------
sorry 12 12 year old sense of humor


---------00:14----------
sorry


---------00:15----------
okay so um you know i'd say that


---------00:18----------
that


---------00:22----------
okay i just got up


---------00:28----------
welcome thank you glad to be here


---------00:33----------
i'm tired but i'm all right let me um


---------00:35----------
let me just


---------00:36----------
bring up my camera and yours for a


---------00:39----------
second


---------00:39----------
what time you're a couple hours ahead of


---------00:41----------
me right that would depend on where you


---------00:43----------
are i'm in texas


---------00:46----------
oh okay i'm in l.a so you're one hour or


---------00:48----------
two hours ahead of me two hours ahead of


---------00:50----------
you


---------00:51----------
two hours okay in the future in the


---------00:54----------
future


---------00:55----------
like the sunset all right


---------00:58----------
we're almost there so while i do this so


---------01:01----------
there's not awkward silence


---------01:03----------
i was wondering uh i've always wondered


---------01:05----------
with your streams


---------01:06----------
how you how


---------01:10----------
do you interact with chat because you


---------01:13----------
usually


---------01:14----------
deal with pretty heavy subject matter so


---------01:17----------
is it sort of just


---------01:18----------
there or do you i usually ignore chat


---------01:21----------
completely when i'm talking to someone


---------01:24----------
okay interesting


---------01:27----------
which is i'm i'm sad about on some level


---------01:31----------
but also like


---------01:32----------
i try to just give the person my full


---------01:34----------
attention


---------01:35----------
right i find that there's a lot to pay


---------01:38----------
attention to


---------01:39----------
then i interact with chat during slow


---------01:42----------
moments or sometimes


---------01:44----------
you know if something is going on like


---------01:46----------
you know someone is dodging a question


---------01:48----------
i will look at chat and see if they can


---------01:50----------
tell because now chat has learned like


---------01:52----------
they've learned what resistance looks


---------01:53----------
like they've learned what dodging is


---------01:54----------
looked like


---------01:55----------
they like begin to see patterns in the


---------01:57----------
person and so i'm kind of curious like


---------01:59----------
it's


---------02:00----------
actually quite remarkable how much


---------02:02----------
people have learned


---------02:03----------
that's cool um so do you like keep it cl


---------02:08----------
you keep it closed though or do you see


---------02:10----------
no i have i have a second monitor


---------02:13----------
over here okay and that i i usually


---------02:15----------
don't because sometimes like i need to


---------02:17----------
keep track because i won't you know i'll


---------02:18----------
have muted something by accident or


---------02:20----------
whatever so i need to have it somewhat


---------02:21----------
available but


---------02:23----------
usually right you know eyes forward


---------02:26----------
all right turn this down so welcome


---------02:30----------
thank you thank you and what what do you


---------02:33----------
go by


---------02:33----------
what should i call you sasha is good or


---------02:37----------
or if you hang around long enough uncle


---------02:41----------
uncle yes yes can you help me


---------02:45----------
yeah my chat affectionately refers to me


---------02:48----------
as uncle


---------02:49----------
uncle sasha or just uncle it can be


---------02:53----------
uncle sasha teo gray


---------02:55----------
it could just be uncle oh i see there's


---------02:58----------
a few variations


---------03:00----------
and how did you come to become an uncle


---------03:04----------
inside jokes you know twitch loves to


---------03:06----------
meme everything


---------03:08----------
so i don't know i i think it


---------03:12----------
just something i said and did pro but


---------03:14----------
probably over a period of time


---------03:17----------
um somebody commented you're like a cool


---------03:19----------
uncle


---------03:20----------
and it stuck and it it hasn't gone away


---------03:23----------
but i like it


---------03:24----------
awesome cool and and so you said you're


---------03:26----------
a little tired today


---------03:28----------
is that just because it's early in the


---------03:30----------
morning or yeah


---------03:32----------
that sadly yes yes so i'm already on i


---------03:35----------
brought coffee


---------03:36----------
yeah it'll be good um yeah so thank you


---------03:39----------
so much for accommodating you know the


---------03:41----------
central time zone appreciate oh don't


---------03:43----------
worry


---------03:45----------
of course and is there something in


---------03:46----------
particular you want to talk about today


---------03:48----------
or something that um


---------03:50----------
you think we should spend our time on


---------03:53----------
yes


---------03:54----------
so a couple things that i would like to


---------03:57----------
talk about


---------03:58----------
are procrastination okay and


---------04:01----------
parasocial relationships i think those


---------04:03----------
are two


---------04:05----------
uh things that are very relevant to me


---------04:09----------
um and my community though like it's


---------04:11----------
something that


---------04:12----------
we're all interested in and that we have


---------04:14----------
discussed in the past


---------04:16----------
and so what should we start with i will


---------04:18----------
do what should we start with


---------04:21----------
and chat okay and then then one other


---------04:24----------
thing


---------04:25----------
um that i did want to ask just so we can


---------04:28----------
also set it up for the people that like


---------04:29----------
maybe they're not part of my regular


---------04:31----------
community but they're just here lurking


---------04:32----------
hi lurkers


---------04:34----------
um is that


---------04:37----------
you you are a doctor but what you do on


---------04:40----------
twitch


---------04:41----------
um you have to fully disclose that it's


---------04:44----------
not therapy


---------04:45----------
right so i've heard some people say that


---------04:48----------
they're confused by this or that


---------04:52----------
if it's not therapy then what's the


---------04:54----------
point of


---------04:56----------
putting people on stream to provide


---------04:58----------
entertainment


---------04:59----------
so i think i'd i'd just like to hear


---------05:03----------
your thoughts on that yeah so we could


---------05:05----------
sort of set the foundation and also be


---------05:06----------
clear with everybody that's watching


---------05:08----------
that like


---------05:09----------
yeah we're having discussions and we're


---------05:10----------
being as open as


---------05:12----------
i feel comfortable with but um at the


---------05:14----------
same time it's not therapy and we don't


---------05:16----------
want people to take


---------05:17----------
that away and you know possibly


---------05:20----------
misinterpret things as well


---------05:22----------
can i so i can give you an answer but


---------05:24----------
can i ask you a couple of questions


---------05:26----------
just because i'm curious what you think


---------05:28----------
so what do you think i do on stream


---------05:31----------
so i've watched a few of your streams i


---------05:33----------
haven't watched them in a while


---------05:36----------
when i watch your streams i've


---------05:39----------
i've not done therapy so i can't say but


---------05:42----------
it feels like therapy to me okay and i


---------05:44----------
feel like i am learning something


---------05:46----------
and i feel a lot of people can relate to


---------05:48----------
that so


---------05:49----------
there is there can be a blurred line um


---------05:53----------
i think for everybody watching but i'm


---------05:56----------
also


---------05:57----------
emotionally intelligent enough to


---------05:59----------
understand that like


---------06:00----------
there are reasons there are disclosures


---------06:03----------
and people have to be safe


---------06:05----------
and people also that are chatting with


---------06:07----------
you probably have their own boundaries


---------06:08----------
just like i do as well


---------06:10----------
sure so and then what what do you think


---------06:13----------
so i understand you haven't


---------06:14----------
been to therapy before but what do you


---------06:16----------
think therapy is


---------06:20----------
that's a great question i think therapy


---------06:22----------
is a tool to help people


---------06:25----------
better understand what sets them back in


---------06:28----------
life


---------06:29----------
that's like the best way i can view it


---------06:32----------
or to work through problems that are


---------06:34----------
maybe maybe


---------06:35----------
affecting their life personally that


---------06:37----------
slows them down from growing in life


---------06:40----------
okay that's a wonderful answer right so


---------06:42----------
it's like


---------06:43----------
helping people move forward in life in


---------06:46----------
some way


---------06:47----------
yes so let's say


---------06:50----------
i'm teo gray and and is theo gray like


---------06:54----------
you know like if i have a problem like


---------06:56----------
who do i come to like we're like oh go


---------06:58----------
talk to theo gray like theo gray is like


---------07:01----------
is wise right theogrey will help you


---------07:02----------
like and and people come to your chat


---------07:05----------
and they're struggling with something


---------07:06----------
and like theo gray like steps in and


---------07:09----------
it's like hey


---------07:10----------
you know this is what you should do like


---------07:12----------
and you can really help someone in that


---------07:13----------
situation right


---------07:15----------
does that make you a therapist


---------07:17----------
definitely not


---------07:19----------
definitely not so then what


---------07:22----------
you know but like helping someone move


---------07:24----------
forward in life i i think that that's a


---------07:26----------
really good answer for what therapy is


---------07:27----------
but i would say that you know we do that


---------07:30----------
a lot of people who aren't therapists to


---------07:32----------
do that what do you think about that


---------07:34----------
i agree and i actually joke to some of


---------07:37----------
my close friends that sometimes i feel


---------07:38----------
like a therapist


---------07:39----------
because not so much with chat


---------07:42----------
necessarily but in real life


---------07:45----------
i can't tell you how many times people


---------07:47----------
come up to me


---------07:48----------
and they just expel their problems


---------07:53----------
and this has been something that has


---------07:55----------
happened to me since i was like 11 years


---------07:58----------
old ish


---------07:59----------
i don't know what it is what kind of


---------08:01----------
aura or thing i have around me but


---------08:03----------
people


---------08:04----------
love to tell me their problems like


---------08:05----------
people i've never met yep


---------08:07----------
and that's so do you want it


---------08:11----------
sorry go ahead do you want to talk about


---------08:13----------
that today


---------08:15----------
uh i know it's not procrastination or


---------08:18----------
potentially parasocial relationships but


---------08:21----------
i'm down to talk about it yeah okay yeah


---------08:24----------
all right so


---------08:25----------
let's just table that for a second but


---------08:27----------
we should definitely talk about it


---------08:28----------
because that's very interesting


---------08:30----------
uh so but so then then what you know if


---------08:33----------
people come to you


---------08:34----------
right people come out of the woodwork


---------08:36----------
you were


---------08:37----------
standing there eating a sandwich you


---------08:40----------
know


---------08:41----------
in in a park and someone comes to you


---------08:43----------
and they're like


---------08:44----------
diogray like everything is wrong with


---------08:46----------
and so


---------08:47----------
so you feel like their therapist you're


---------08:49----------
supporting them emotionally so then like


---------08:51----------
what


---------08:51----------
what what is the difference between you


---------08:53----------
and a therapist


---------08:55----------
qualified i don't have the experience or


---------08:58----------
or


---------09:00----------
the tools to really help somebody i


---------09:02----------
don't think


---------09:03----------
in the same way that a therapist could


---------09:06----------
and


---------09:06----------
okay so let's talk about that what what


---------09:09----------
way


---------09:10----------
could a therapist help them that you are


---------09:12----------
not trained in


---------09:15----------
the tools and education i think because


---------09:17----------
i i have spoken to


---------09:18----------
people that work in mental health um


---------09:20----------
that are qualified


---------09:22----------
so i know a little bit or i know enough


---------09:26----------
to understand that


---------09:27----------
a trained professional has the tools to


---------09:30----------
sort of like dig deep and i i hate this


---------09:33----------
word because it's overused right now but


---------09:35----------
unpack


---------09:36----------
like the reasons and motivations behind


---------09:38----------
somebody's um


---------09:41----------
problems i guess you could say so let's


---------09:43----------
say that for a moment that i am doing


---------09:45----------
therapy on twitch


---------09:46----------
so there's like an ethical concern with


---------09:48----------
that right because like


---------09:50----------
you know i'm talking with people


---------09:51----------
publicly and so if i'm a doctor


---------09:54----------
and we say that there's an ethical issue


---------09:56----------
there then that means that i'm not


---------09:57----------
allowed to stream on twitch right


---------09:59----------
does that make sense so then like if


---------10:02----------
someone wants to offer life advice


---------10:05----------
or wants to help people on twitch what


---------10:07----------
we're essentially saying is that the


---------10:09----------
more qualified you are


---------10:10----------
the less we are going to allow you to do


---------10:13----------
that


---------10:15----------
that sucks right that's interesting yeah


---------10:18----------
yeah so it's like like i can if i didn't


---------10:21----------
have an md degree like i could show up


---------10:23----------
here


---------10:23----------
and be like a spiritual cult leader


---------10:27----------
and and that would be totally fine like


---------10:30----------
that's like ethically completely


---------10:31----------
acceptable


---------10:32----------
but the more qualified i become the less


---------10:35----------
i am able to help people right i


---------10:39----------
and i do i actually wanted to talk to


---------10:40----------
you about that as well because


---------10:42----------
i've seen so many people on social media


---------10:47----------
it doesn't matter what platform


---------10:51----------
speak like they are in when you said


---------10:54----------
a group like a cult leader that just


---------10:56----------
makes me laugh because sometimes you do


---------10:58----------
get that feeling from people sometimes


---------11:00----------
they speak as if they are qualified but


---------11:03----------
you know maybe they took


---------11:04----------
some therapy they read a few self-help


---------11:06----------
books and then they realized wow like


---------11:08----------
this has helped me and that's great


---------11:10----------
that's super positive but then they they


---------11:12----------
present themselves as somebody who's


---------11:14----------
qualified


---------11:15----------
but they're really just sharing really


---------11:17----------
not always but


---------11:18----------
quite often superficial armchair


---------11:22----------
analysis of situations


---------11:23----------
and of life right and what do you think


---------11:26----------
about that


---------11:27----------
um it makes me laugh usually because i i


---------11:31----------
tend to see through those kind of things


---------11:33----------
um other times it's impressive


---------11:35----------
because you know we we do live in a


---------11:38----------
society where


---------11:40----------
we applaud people who are self-made so


---------11:42----------
sometimes it's actually pretty


---------11:44----------
impressive


---------11:45----------
uh but what i often find is that


---------11:49----------
these type of people end up


---------11:50----------
regurgitating a lot of


---------11:53----------
similar um small tidbits


---------11:57----------
of self-help advice and so


---------12:00----------
one of those things that i've been


---------12:02----------
hearing a lot in the past year


---------12:03----------
is about procrastination and i am


---------12:07----------
a master procrastinator good um


---------12:11----------
and so something that is your ayurvedic


---------12:13----------
dosha by the way do you know what


---------12:14----------
ayurveda does


---------12:15----------
no i don't okay we'll explain a little


---------12:17----------
bit


---------12:19----------
okay um so


---------12:23----------
so what i've heard a lot of these people


---------12:25----------
say is well you


---------12:27----------
you pro okay let's do it we're gonna


---------12:29----------
talk about procrastination


---------12:32----------
you procrastinate because and it always


---------12:35----------
leads into you procrastinate


---------12:36----------
because you are afraid of success


---------12:42----------
okay okay before we jump into


---------12:44----------
procrastination can we do that


---------12:45----------
can i share my ethical thing about


---------12:47----------
therapy and streaming


---------12:48----------
yes yeah yeah yeah it's totally


---------12:52----------
move from one into the other but let me


---------12:53----------
just kind of close that up for a second


---------12:55----------
yeah


---------12:56----------
so like i think it's interesting right


---------12:57----------
because what you're essentially saying


---------12:59----------
is that the less qualified you are the


---------13:01----------
more you are allowed to speak the fewer


---------13:02----------
ethical concerns you have


---------13:04----------
totally fine we're going to get into


---------13:06----------
that in a second so here's here's what


---------13:07----------
i'd say when you say that


---------13:09----------
clinicians i mean you know licensed


---------13:11----------
professionals are trained


---------13:13----------
so what really trained in that the


---------13:16----------
average


---------13:16----------
you know internet guru is not is


---------13:18----------
clinical illness


---------13:20----------
so if you look at like literally the you


---------13:23----------
know american psychiatric association's


---------13:25----------
definition of therapy it's like you know


---------13:28----------
an intervention that is designed to help


---------13:30----------
someone with a clinical illness


---------13:32----------
to treat depression schizophrenia


---------13:35----------
bipolar disorder addictions things like


---------13:38----------
that


---------13:39----------
so i think i know that what i do looks


---------13:42----------
and feels like therapy to some people


---------13:46----------
um probably overlaps at some but i don't


---------13:48----------
think that that's


---------13:49----------
i i think the real thing that you know


---------13:51----------
and that's because you guys just haven't


---------13:52----------
seen me do therapy like


---------13:54----------
if you saw me do therapy you'd


---------13:55----------
understand the difference and people who


---------13:57----------
have come into my office before


---------13:58----------
understand the difference there's a


---------14:00----------
longitudinal relationship there are


---------14:02----------
usually diagnoses involved there are


---------14:03----------
treatments involved


---------14:04----------
i don't treat anything i don't diagnose


---------14:06----------
anything and some people may feel like


---------14:08----------
that's a technicality like i'm skirting


---------14:09----------
that


---------14:10----------
but really it's not i mean i think that


---------14:13----------
part of what i've discovered and this


---------14:15----------
this also goes to a broader conversation


---------14:17----------
about mental health is that


---------14:18----------
somewhere along the way like if you


---------14:19----------
think about there are a lot of things we


---------14:21----------
do for our physical health that are not


---------14:23----------
medicine


---------14:25----------
and like that's totally fine but like


---------14:27----------
what do we do for our mental health that


---------14:28----------
isn't therapy


---------14:30----------
right right so like there's actually all


---------14:32----------
kinds of emotional nutrition like


---------14:34----------
emotional support like


---------14:36----------
theo gray case in point you know like


---------14:38----------
you fulfill


---------14:39----------
something for these people that a


---------14:41----------
therapist fills for some patients


---------14:44----------
but i don't think that that makes you a


---------14:46----------
therapist i think what we've actually


---------14:47----------
done


---------14:48----------
is broadened the umbrella of therapy to


---------14:50----------
include all things mental health


---------14:53----------
and just like physical health like


---------14:54----------
there's nutritionists there's personal


---------14:56----------
trainers


---------14:56----------
there's massage therapists there's


---------14:58----------
physical therapists there are medical


---------15:00----------
doctors there are surgeons


---------15:02----------
and so if we think about the physical


---------15:03----------
body there's so there's a chef


---------15:05----------
right like there's so many things that


---------15:07----------
we do to support our physical health


---------15:10----------
and as a society i think like therapists


---------15:12----------
have sort of


---------15:14----------
monopolized the mental health space


---------15:17----------
and i think now that we're you know


---------15:19----------
meditation is on the rise and stuff like


---------15:20----------
that so a lot of people get benefit


---------15:22----------
through that you know like a lot of


---------15:23----------
people get benefit from theo gray like


---------15:25----------
you know there's a lot of different


---------15:27----------
things out there that can support mental


---------15:29----------
health and so


---------15:30----------
you know i feel pretty good about what i


---------15:32----------
do because it's really not diagnosing or


---------15:34----------
treating illness like sometimes i'll get


---------15:36----------
close to that line but i'll purposely


---------15:38----------
not step over it


---------15:39----------
because i think that does change the


---------15:40----------
relationship um


---------15:42----------
you know and and i think that part of


---------15:44----------
the problem is that like i think more


---------15:46----------
people should be


---------15:48----------
doing what i'm doing


---------15:52----------
not less like it's it's you know i don't


---------15:54----------
yeah i think that like


---------15:55----------
you can support your mental health in


---------15:57----------
ways that are not therapy


---------15:59----------
um i agree um and and i'd also like to


---------16:03----------
add to that like


---------16:05----------
i i also don't think it's possible to


---------16:08----------
have


---------16:09----------
a real mental health therapy session


---------16:13----------
on camera with


---------16:16----------
for me personally you know when i know


---------16:19----------
i'm


---------16:19----------
i'm aware that our there are people


---------16:21----------
watching i would


---------16:23----------
i could never open up to you on camera


---------16:26----------
the same way i could open up to you as


---------16:28----------
if we had a private relationship


---------16:31----------
as patient and therapist right so like


---------16:35----------
i and i i think some people it's hard


---------16:37----------
for them to understand that but like any


---------16:38----------
time you put a camera on somebody they


---------16:40----------
will change


---------16:42----------
how does the camera change wait hold on


---------16:44----------
i was going to ask you


---------16:46----------
a question about how a camera changes


---------16:47----------
you but it occurred to me that that is


---------16:50----------
outside of the two topics that we had


---------16:52----------
discussed are you yeah okay if i ask you


---------16:54----------
that


---------16:55----------
sure yeah how does the camera change you


---------16:58----------
you see it for me personally when a


---------17:01----------
camera goes on


---------17:03----------
more i'm more


---------17:06----------
a little more i'll say a little more


---------17:08----------
energetic because in professional


---------17:10----------
settings people


---------17:11----------
said be more energetic but i definitely


---------17:14----------
um


---------17:16----------
it's like being on a stage you feel that


---------17:19----------
you're


---------17:19----------
putting on i don't want to say a show


---------17:21----------
because that's a little bit too extreme


---------17:23----------
but


---------17:24----------
you are presenting yourself you know


---------17:26----------
that people are watching you know that


---------17:27----------
people are listening


---------17:28----------
and so i'm not gonna sit here uh you


---------17:31----------
know


---------17:32----------
like hunched over lean back unless it's


---------17:34----------
a 12-hour stream


---------17:35----------
um i'm gonna present myself a certain


---------17:37----------
way


---------17:38----------
whereas if in real life i'm like


---------17:41----------
20 times more chilled than this


---------17:45----------
and i am very monotone


---------17:49----------
uh so there is a there is a big


---------17:50----------
difference and you see it too though


---------17:52----------
like


---------17:52----------
you see it with babies on social media


---------17:55----------
you just


---------17:56----------
you'll see parents recording their kids


---------17:57----------
and the minute that the toddler realizes


---------17:59----------
that there's a camera on them they light


---------18:01----------
up right they change


---------18:03----------
and philosophically speaking we all wear


---------18:06----------
masks


---------18:07----------
right so i i want to present


---------18:11----------
the version of myself that i want you


---------18:13----------
guys to see


---------18:14----------
and i and i think most people do that


---------18:16----------
whether or not they're aware of it


---------18:18----------
okay so let me ask you something sasha


---------18:22----------
so you try to present a version of


---------18:25----------
yourself makes perfect sense right like


---------18:27----------
that's


---------18:28----------
what we do as streamers and at the same


---------18:31----------
time i'm noticing that


---------18:32----------
people are drawn to you since the age of


---------18:34----------
11.


---------18:38----------
right so i'm kind of curious how do you


---------18:40----------
understand what they're


---------18:41----------
what are they seeing


---------18:45----------
that's that i ask myself all the time


---------18:47----------
and i don't really have an answer for


---------18:49----------
that


---------18:50----------
um maybe more so now like as an adult as


---------18:53----------
somebody who's in


---------18:55----------
the public eye i i understand like what


---------18:58----------
are they seeing they're seeing somebody


---------18:59----------
with experience


---------19:01----------
uh that has come from


---------19:05----------
that is best known as coming from an


---------19:07----------
industry that


---------19:08----------
a lot of people consider extreme or


---------19:10----------
taboo


---------19:11----------
but that i've also been able to grow and


---------19:14----------
have success outside of that so i feel


---------19:16----------
like there is a


---------19:17----------
level of trust that people feel


---------19:20----------
when they ask me questions so they trust


---------19:23----------
my advice based on my experience


---------19:26----------
so i'm gonna push back against that for


---------19:28----------
a second okay


---------19:29----------
so people come to you and you're saying


---------19:31----------
okay the reason they come to me is


---------19:33----------
because


---------19:34----------
i you know i've i've transitioned


---------19:37----------
industries i'm


---------19:38----------
experienced i'm whatever blah blah blah


---------19:40----------
whatever you just said right it's very


---------19:42----------
very well crafted very intelligent but


---------19:45----------
why did they come to you when you were


---------19:46----------
11.


---------19:48----------
that i can't figure out right so let's


---------19:51----------
speak and be careful because like if


---------19:53----------
they were coming to you then


---------19:54----------
like you can come up with all the


---------19:56----------
answers that you want now


---------19:58----------
right but like what makes you think it


---------20:00----------
wasn't the same thing that it was when


---------20:01----------
you were 11.


---------20:05----------
i get well when i really think back on


---------20:07----------
it like i'm


---------20:08----------
um there's a big age gap between my


---------20:12----------
siblings and i


---------20:14----------
um i'm the younger and i'm the youngest


---------20:18----------
but i felt like


---------20:21----------
i was held to my own i was held to


---------20:24----------
similar standards


---------20:25----------
so even though i was much younger i had


---------20:28----------
the


---------20:28----------
their wisdom to sort of look up to and i


---------20:31----------
was always


---------20:34----------
probably i don't wanna


---------20:37----------
i don't wanna stay serious but maybe


---------20:41----------
a little bit more um


---------20:44----------
what's the word i'm looking for a little


---------20:46----------
bit more mature than


---------20:47----------
some of my peers maybe but at the same


---------20:49----------
time not because i was a total


---------20:51----------
goof and loved to be loud and and


---------20:54----------
and stupid and funny you know like any


---------20:56----------
kid are you special


---------20:59----------
i don't


---------21:02----------
sorry i feel sick uh i'm laughing


---------21:05----------
because that feels like something so


---------21:07----------
sweet that my mom would ask me


---------21:10----------
okay am i special i think everyone's


---------21:13----------
special


---------21:14----------
i don't you know while i say these


---------21:17----------
things about like


---------21:19----------
about my current self as an adult i


---------21:21----------
don't want that to come off as


---------21:23----------
pompous um because at the end of the day


---------21:26----------
i'm still a human right and i still have


---------21:28----------
flaws and and i still have my own issues


---------21:32----------
and problems like


---------21:33----------
every human being does so it's not to


---------21:35----------
come off and say that like i


---------21:36----------
you know this is me and i am great for


---------21:38----------
these things but


---------21:40----------
do i think about like


---------21:48----------
life am i special yeah yes i'm special


---------21:51----------
everybody's special but you have to


---------21:52----------
you have to recognize that to motivate


---------21:55----------
yourself


---------21:57----------
to be positive but i don't


---------22:00----------
i'm i'm a very humble person


---------22:06----------
yeah so there's something interesting


---------22:07----------
that just happened right like there's an


---------22:09----------
answer to the question which is


---------22:13----------
if we really dig through the [ __ ]


---------22:15----------
the answer is yes


---------22:17----------
but there's the mask on top which is


---------22:20----------
like i'm not allowed to say yes because


---------22:22----------
then i'd come across


---------22:24----------
as pompous right yes


---------22:27----------
agreed and and this is where like sasha


---------22:30----------
i think that like what people and


---------22:31----------
this is the challenge i mean i i'm


---------22:35----------
you know i know you're successful in


---------22:36----------
everything but i i think that like


---------22:38----------
you're actually not showing the best


---------22:40----------
part of yourself


---------22:42----------
because there's something that people


---------22:43----------
have been like drawn to


---------22:47----------
since you were a child which you


---------22:48----------
purposely


---------22:50----------
push to the back when you present


---------22:53----------
yourself a particular way


---------22:56----------
what do you think about that


---------23:00----------
i think that's something i've never


---------23:01----------
thought about so it's


---------23:04----------
it's actually fascinating like what


---------23:06----------
could i be pushing back


---------23:08----------
right because you so yeah and i think i


---------23:11----------
don't have an answer to that


---------23:12----------
yeah yeah it's maybe we'll get there but


---------23:15----------
maybe we won't yeah


---------23:16----------
but i think it's just interesting


---------23:18----------
because i think what i'm hearing is that


---------23:20----------
almost i mean so this is where you know


---------23:22----------
if you wanted to run a cult you'd do a


---------23:23----------
very good job


---------23:24----------
because there there are people


---------23:28----------
i i've noticed this right so like like


---------23:31----------
there are people who


---------23:33----------
you know like that other humans are


---------23:35----------
drawn to


---------23:38----------
i'm sorry i'm laughing so hard because


---------23:40----------
uh


---------23:43----------
there's an inside joke in my in my


---------23:45----------
community we say


---------23:46----------
uh we're not a cult yeah and


---------23:50----------
it's just it's funny it's funny i'm not


---------23:52----------
surprised that people have joked about


---------23:54----------
you being a cult leader


---------23:56----------
because i think you have the makings of


---------23:58----------
a cult leader


---------24:00----------
i see that i see the um title now you


---------24:03----------
make it you make it seem as if


---------24:05----------
that's information that i need i already


---------24:07----------
had that information like i'm aware


---------24:09----------
we've figured this out already people


---------24:10----------
have been drawn to you since the age of


---------24:12----------
11.


---------24:13----------
this is what happens right so sometimes


---------24:16----------
people like you


---------24:18----------
wind up in positions of public


---------24:20----------
prominence


---------24:22----------
right so like that sometimes happens


---------24:24----------
like some people call this charisma


---------24:27----------
but i think the the real question is


---------24:28----------
when people come to you are you able to


---------24:30----------
help them


---------24:34----------
i hope so i hope so for sure


---------24:37----------
you hope for sure i hope so for sure and


---------24:41----------
i say that because again


---------24:42----------
it's so hard


---------24:45----------
i think there's a difference between


---------24:47----------
stream life and irl


---------24:49----------
so when somebody brings up a topic in


---------24:52----------
chat


---------24:53----------
um you know i don't of course i can't


---------24:55----------
answer everything or respond to


---------24:56----------
everything nobody can but um


---------24:58----------
when i see something that i feel like i


---------25:00----------
should respond to or that i can respond


---------25:02----------
to


---------25:03----------
or i can relate to i do try to give my


---------25:05----------
best advice but


---------25:07----------
i also know that it's hard to keep the


---------25:09----------
attention of people


---------25:11----------
um and i hope that the things that they


---------25:15----------
are getting


---------25:16----------
why do you think people like okay so


---------25:18----------
when people come to you and you try to


---------25:20----------
do your best to help them let's forget


---------25:21----------
about stream for a second let's talk


---------25:22----------
about


---------25:23----------
yeah non-mask let's talk about tio gray


---------25:27----------
right which is interesting because you


---------25:28----------
actually have a persona right like a


---------25:30----------
persona of like the friendly person that


---------25:32----------
people come to


---------25:34----------
um the person who's understanding and


---------25:36----------
supportive and and


---------25:37----------
you know and and so when you're that


---------25:40----------
person like do you think you help people


---------25:41----------
like forget about stream and


---------25:43----------
chat and stuff irl for sure yeah


---------25:47----------
so i know i mean i know i have like yeah


---------25:50----------
helped people get out of bad situations


---------25:54----------
and how do you understand how you're


---------25:56----------
able to do that


---------25:58----------
why is it that you're able to do that


---------26:00----------
whereas potentially other people may not


---------26:02----------
be able to


---------26:03----------
i'm very patient okay


---------26:07----------
and i'm a good listener


---------26:11----------
those are like the two immediate things


---------26:13----------
that come to mind


---------26:16----------
can i think about that for a second yeah


---------26:19----------
and i and i guess to add to that


---------26:24----------
uh i've lost my train of thought sorry i


---------26:26----------
think


---------26:27----------
if it comes back to me i'll bring it up


---------26:29----------
again


---------26:36----------
i get the sense that you know sure


---------26:38----------
you're a patient you're a listener but


---------26:40----------
that you kind of know


---------26:41----------
what they need to hear in that moment


---------26:48----------
yeah but i i'm


---------26:52----------
like you said cut through the [ __ ] i


---------26:53----------
also


---------26:55----------
i try not to sugarcoat things for people


---------26:58----------
yep right which is what they need to


---------27:00----------
hear yeah


---------27:02----------
so i i think that there's a certain so


---------27:04----------
it's interesting because what i'm


---------27:05----------
hearing you kind of say is that you're


---------27:06----------
like transparent and authentic with them


---------27:11----------
and that people respond very well to


---------27:16----------
because i i think you probably do a good


---------27:18----------
job of being compassionate but also not


---------27:20----------
sugar coating things


---------27:22----------
what would you say yeah i'm definitely


---------27:25----------
empathetic i can definitely i feel other


---------27:28----------
people's pain


---------27:29----------
intensely intensely it's insane


---------27:33----------
so much so that sometimes like i feel i


---------27:35----------
have to work on shutting that off


---------27:38----------
okay


---------27:41----------
yeah you have the makings of a of a cult


---------27:43----------
leader for sure


---------27:44----------
like these are the attributes so like


---------27:46----------
this is actually well described


---------27:48----------
in in some of these old yogic texts


---------27:51----------
right so you exhibit many of the things


---------27:53----------
because like you know like these like


---------27:54----------
these you know religious figures like


---------27:56----------
they start when they're young


---------27:58----------
like they'll like you know leave home at


---------28:00----------
the age of 10 and we'll like


---------28:02----------
climb the himalayas and things like that


---------28:03----------
and like some people express


---------28:05----------
this kind of um uh


---------28:08----------
you know they have like a certain


---------28:09----------
temperament where like people seem to be


---------28:11----------
drawn to them and


---------28:12----------
for whatever reason they have some


---------28:14----------
degree of like insight and you're kind


---------28:15----------
of


---------28:16----------
able to say the right things um you're


---------28:18----------
compassionate i don't know how you know


---------28:20----------
where this is going to go but i


---------28:21----------
definitely see that so one thing that


---------28:23----------
some of these old texts would say is


---------28:24----------
that you've done a lot of spiritual work


---------28:26----------
in a past life


---------28:28----------
have no idea what your religious beliefs


---------28:30----------
are you know we can go down that road if


---------28:32----------
you want to but


---------28:33----------
um you know that's how they would


---------28:35----------
describe what this turned because like


---------28:36----------
some of that


---------28:37----------
carries over to this life and so when


---------28:40----------
you're you know born you kind of


---------28:41----------
describe being a little bit more mature


---------28:44----------
and you you attribute it to all kinds of


---------28:46----------
things like you had older siblings and


---------28:48----------
stuff like that but i'd say it's like


---------28:49----------
temperamental i'd say it's personality


---------28:51----------
too that generally speaking you seem to


---------28:54----------
be pretty chill and pretty monotone


---------28:56----------
you're actually like


---------28:57----------
not that um


---------29:01----------
yeah so like those are all like


---------29:02----------
characteristics that are consistent with


---------29:05----------
spirituality and a past or a lot of


---------29:07----------
spiritual practice


---------29:08----------
in a past life and


---------29:12----------
yeah so i i mean i think that you just


---------29:14----------
gotta i would encourage you to think a


---------29:16----------
little bit about


---------29:18----------
you know there are advantages to putting


---------29:19----------
the mask on and and being higher energy


---------29:22----------
and there are advantages to offering


---------29:24----------
people what they expect


---------29:27----------
but i suspect that


---------29:30----------
the most that you have to offer actually


---------29:33----------
gets pushed to the back when you put on


---------29:35----------
the mask


---------29:39----------
and do you think do you think that's


---------29:43----------
again it's hard to distinct sometimes


---------29:45----------
hard to distinguish like do you


---------29:47----------
think that applies to both


---------29:50----------
irl and on stream


---------29:53----------
no i think it's more on stream because i


---------29:55----------
think irl you don't wear the mask and so


---------29:58----------
whatever it is it's kind of like a moth


---------30:00----------
to a flame right it's kind of weird it's


---------30:01----------
like


---------30:02----------
you're exuding some kind of signal that


---------30:04----------
makes like randos come to you and ask


---------30:05----------
for help


---------30:07----------
and and i know this because i've been


---------30:09----------
exuding the signal for many years too


---------30:11----------
and so like people would you know my


---------30:13----------
wife calls it collecting strays


---------30:15----------
that i collect strays like humans will


---------30:17----------
come to me and they'll be like


---------30:19----------
can you help me with this thing and and


---------30:22----------
it's been happening for a long time and


---------30:23----------
it took me a while to realize what that


---------30:25----------
was is that you know i can be a cult


---------30:26----------
leader too


---------30:28----------
that's why you just have to be careful


---------30:29----------
because you have to know what you're


---------30:31----------
dealing with so you don't actually


---------30:32----------
become a cult


---------30:35----------
um yeah i think um i think part of


---------30:38----------
a large part of that is


---------30:42----------
tos and so


---------30:45----------
there's so many


---------30:49----------
abstract rules of what we can and can't


---------30:52----------
talk about


---------30:53----------
that it makes it difficult sometimes to


---------30:55----------
go in depth with things


---------30:57----------
um other days i just want a game


---------31:02----------
sure i just want to cook you know and i


---------31:06----------
and i don't want to do that or be that


---------31:09----------
um but there are other things that


---------31:13----------
that i am within this realm of helping


---------31:15----------
people that


---------31:16----------
i am passionate about but i feel like


---------31:22----------
are difficult to discuss on stream


---------31:24----------
because of those rules


---------31:25----------
like i always i feel like we're always


---------31:26----------
having to watch what we say


---------31:28----------
and i feel like it's only gotten worse


---------31:30----------
over the past year um


---------31:33----------
so that's yeah that's can you tell me


---------31:36----------
more that makes it hard


---------31:39----------
what's gotten worse over the past year i


---------31:41----------
feel like the


---------31:42----------
enforcement of these


---------31:47----------
enforcement of rules has become in


---------31:50----------
somebody


---------31:50----------
i just thought of the court of my eyes


---------31:52----------
somebody said arbitrary yes i meant


---------31:53----------
arbitrary not abstract thank you


---------31:55----------
um there feels like there's a lot of


---------31:57----------
arbitrary rules


---------31:58----------
uh that we're not even aware of or that


---------32:02----------
the rules are arbitrarily enforced and


---------32:06----------
every day you see on twitter a streamer


---------32:07----------
saying like


---------32:09----------
i got banned and i don't know why


---------32:12----------
and i still don't know you know and it's


---------32:14----------
temporary but still i don't know why


---------32:16----------
and so i do feel like i i have to be


---------32:20----------
really careful when it comes to the


---------32:22----------
subject that


---------32:23----------
subject matter that we speak about um we


---------32:26----------
as content creators are at the mercy


---------32:28----------
of of these platforms right


---------32:32----------
um while it's great we are able to be


---------32:34----------
here and and


---------32:35----------
do what we do and make a living doing it


---------32:38----------
on the other hand


---------32:39----------
um these are major corporations that


---------32:42----------
you know at the end of the day they


---------32:44----------
dictate their own rules and it doesn't


---------32:45----------
matter if it's twitch or any other


---------32:47----------
social media platform


---------32:48----------
it's just the way it is and a lot of


---------32:50----------
voices are also suppressed like


---------32:52----------
i am shadow band everywhere so to have


---------32:56----------
what does that mean shadow band means


---------32:59----------
that on the internet your name is


---------33:01----------
blocked


---------33:03----------
uh from being from like smart search and


---------33:06----------
auto search


---------33:08----------
so you know when you type something in


---------33:10----------
on the internet and you write like


---------33:13----------
cute k and then it autofills


---------33:16----------
kittens and it drops down you click on


---------33:18----------
it so


---------33:19----------
that's one thing that's a form of shadow


---------33:22----------
banning but it also means that they


---------33:24----------
block all of your social media profiles


---------33:26----------
from being seen by other people like


---------33:28----------
they they literally cut your reach off


---------33:31----------
even to the people that already follow


---------33:33----------
you so it makes it very difficult to


---------33:35----------
have


---------33:36----------
organic growth and have people find you


---------33:39----------
um so knowing that


---------33:44----------
and then also knowing what i have on


---------33:46----------
twitch


---------33:48----------
it makes it very difficult to be able to


---------33:50----------
like have more open and


---------33:52----------
um sometimes adult let's say adult


---------33:54----------
conversations right like conversations


---------33:56----------
that are meant


---------33:57----------
for grown-ups without and i say that and


---------34:00----------
i know people are going to laugh but


---------34:01----------
like


---------34:02----------
seriously it's not only 13 year olds on


---------34:04----------
twitch


---------34:05----------
right so there's a lot of there's


---------34:08----------
a lot of a lot of frustrating things


---------34:10----------
that happen


---------34:14----------
you're quite analytical yeah


---------34:18----------
sometimes too much i i'm getting the


---------34:22----------
sense that you


---------34:23----------
calculate a lot like i'm hearing you


---------34:26----------
kind of


---------34:28----------
you know really be aware of what the


---------34:30----------
different variables of the equation are


---------34:35----------
it's impressive um


---------34:40----------
thanks also seems like a little bit of


---------34:42----------
an uphill battle


---------34:45----------
does it feel that way sometimes


---------34:48----------
every day


---------34:52----------
every day every day yeah my uh


---------34:55----------
my catchphrase is a lot of continua


---------34:57----------
which loosely translates to the struggle


---------35:00----------
continues


---------35:03----------
what's it like to struggle every day


---------35:07----------
i try not to um


---------35:11----------
while that means a lot to me i try it's


---------35:14----------
a fight right like


---------35:15----------
there are days where i feel like yeah


---------35:17----------
today i'm gonna take over the world and


---------35:19----------
i'm gonna


---------35:20----------
yes brain uh you know like this is it i


---------35:23----------
i have


---------35:24----------
confidence and i'm motivated and then


---------35:25----------
there's other days where you feel


---------35:27----------
exhausted


---------35:28----------
and you and you want to go move


---------35:33----------
to a foreign country and like invest all


---------35:35----------
your time in helping other people


---------35:37----------
and live on a farm right or like live in


---------35:39----------
the wilderness


---------35:40----------
helping build homes for people that's


---------35:42----------
how you start a cult


---------35:44----------
get yourself a patch patch land in the


---------35:46----------
wilderness


---------35:49----------
start growing your own food become


---------35:51----------
self-sustaining


---------35:54----------
dude okay sorry no we'll talk about that


---------35:56----------
later i don't want to get off topic what


---------35:58----------
man go for you can't leave me hanging


---------36:00----------
okay so


---------36:02----------
uh a few years ago i became


---------36:05----------
um and this is gonna sound so culty but


---------36:08----------
i


---------36:08----------
i um i improved my quality of life and


---------36:12----------
health


---------36:12----------
with uh herbs and essential oils


---------36:17----------
long story short i was having like


---------36:18----------
non-stop allergy attacks


---------36:20----------
and they felt like flus right so they


---------36:24----------
would just completely knock me out


---------36:25----------
and after trying all western medicines


---------36:28----------
um i started like


---------36:29----------
just researching alternative methods of


---------36:32----------
feeling on my own


---------36:34----------
and in that process


---------36:37----------
i was looking for some oils some


---------36:39----------
essential oil


---------36:41----------
and i found a random website


---------36:45----------
of a of a


---------36:48----------
alleged let me speak carefully here


---------36:51----------
of an alleged cult at the time when i


---------36:54----------
ordered


---------36:55----------
i didn't think it was that i just


---------36:56----------
thought it was you know a place where


---------36:59----------
you can buy some oils when the oils


---------37:02----------
arrived


---------37:03----------
then i said hmm this is weird let me


---------37:05----------
look it up


---------37:07----------
so um yeah it's like the purple


---------37:09----------
something


---------37:11----------
it has it hasn't even a cult sounding


---------37:13----------
name wait but


---------37:14----------
what what about the arrival like did it


---------37:16----------
come with cultists where


---------37:18----------
like what about the i'm so confused i'm


---------37:20----------
envisioning an amazon


---------37:22----------
package with some bottles of essential


---------37:23----------
oils inside


---------37:25----------
oh no no no no it arrived in


---------37:28----------
i just threw it away so i don't have one


---------37:29----------
but it arrived in um


---------37:32----------
an empty recycled


---------37:37----------
battery package right and then they


---------37:40----------
filled the


---------37:41----------
clearly like they filled the oils from a


---------37:43----------
larger source


---------37:44----------
and put them in so very homemade looking


---------37:47----------
and then they taped around the battery


---------37:50----------
package


---------37:51----------
to reseal it and it was just the way it


---------37:54----------
was packaged and put together i was like


---------37:56----------
this is weird i didn't even use it


---------37:57----------
because i don't want to use something


---------38:00----------
that's not sealed


---------38:01----------
right when you say a battery package are


---------38:03----------
we talking like a


---------38:05----------
carton of duracell yes


---------38:08----------
yes there's like energizer paper bottom


---------38:11----------
oh yes yeah


---------38:14----------
yeah and now like recently i was


---------38:17----------
thinking about it i was like man that


---------38:18----------
would make a great documentary and


---------38:20----------
somebody's doing it


---------38:21----------
like at the time nobody was talking


---------38:23----------
about this place and then


---------38:24----------
somebody else discovered it as well and


---------38:27----------
wow they're trying to do a documentary


---------38:28----------
yeah


---------38:28----------
interesting so your allergies got better


---------38:31----------
with with herbs and stuff


---------38:34----------
oh yeah yeah like night and day


---------38:37----------
quality of life completely changed


---------38:41----------
i find myself being curious about what


---------38:42----------
worked for you but i don't know if


---------38:44----------
that's skirting tos


---------38:46----------
if you say something no be because it's


---------38:49----------
personal


---------38:50----------
okay so even like


---------38:53----------
i say that to my chat because i've


---------38:54----------
talked about this with them before like


---------38:57----------
this is what worked for me i'm not a


---------38:58----------
doctor i'm not an herbalist


---------39:00----------
i cannot tell you what to do for you you


---------39:02----------
can say that but i can't


---------39:04----------
because i'm a doctor okay so


---------39:07----------
there you go chat i said it


---------39:10----------
uh but i yeah i mean i'm you know you


---------39:13----------
don't have to tell me now but i'm always


---------39:14----------
looking for


---------39:15----------
solutions for allergies for like other


---------39:16----------
patients and a lot of what i recommend


---------39:18----------
to patients actually comes from


---------39:20----------
patients so someone will tell me like oh


---------39:22----------
like this actually worked for me and


---------39:24----------
then i'll do some research and i'll kind


---------39:25----------
of see like okay it's interesting


---------39:27----------
you know is there some data to support


---------39:28----------
it is there some evidence behind it and


---------39:30----------
if


---------39:30----------
if i get a strong personal


---------39:31----------
recommendation from a person


---------39:33----------
and then find some evidence that


---------39:35----------
supports it then sometimes i'll make a


---------39:38----------
recommendation to a future patient so


---------39:41----------
i'm really curious because i think


---------39:42----------
allergies are tend to be hard to kick


---------39:44----------
yeah and i'm not actually allergic to uh


---------39:48----------
like any food necessarily um


---------39:51----------
it's just like and they call


---------39:53----------
environmental allergies and rhinitis


---------39:56----------
like it's it could be a cigarette


---------39:57----------
somebody smoking a cigarette


---------39:59----------
and i start sneezing for 20 minutes


---------40:04----------
anyway did you want to talk about like


---------40:06----------
procrastination and parasocial


---------40:07----------
relationships are we just going


---------40:09----------
you know off the range and into cult


---------40:11----------
land i'm fine with either


---------40:13----------
yeah let me let me ask you about so


---------40:17----------
i just want to get your opinion on on


---------40:19----------
procrastination


---------40:21----------
okay because as i was saying earlier for


---------40:24----------
people that might have missed it


---------40:26----------
excuse me i've seen a lot of people


---------40:29----------
on social media that are really


---------40:31----------
influencers they're not


---------40:32----------
qualified professionals in any way talk


---------40:35----------
about procrastination and a common theme


---------40:37----------
that i keep hearing


---------40:38----------
is that you procrastinate because you're


---------40:41----------
afraid of success


---------40:44----------
what do you think about that i i think


---------40:47----------
that can apply to some people but it


---------40:49----------
absolutely does not apply to me why do


---------40:51----------
you think you procrastinate


---------40:54----------
and that is something that i


---------40:58----------
i probably have not asked myself enough


---------41:01----------
of i i really truly


---------41:06----------
i don't know it's just something and


---------41:08----------
it's something in my brain


---------41:10----------
that happens and i've


---------41:14----------
i set timers for myself i set alarms for


---------41:17----------
myself


---------41:18----------
and then i'll still find ways to


---------41:20----------
procrastinate okay


---------41:23----------
um can you tell me can you just give me


---------41:25----------
an example of something you're


---------41:26----------
procrastinating on


---------41:35----------
yes like uh i need to and it can be


---------41:38----------
really small things but


---------41:43----------
i need to create a list of


---------41:47----------
codes for instance um


---------41:52----------
for my stream and this is something that


---------41:55----------
one of my mods who also helps me with my


---------41:56----------
youtube


---------41:58----------
has been reminding me to do for means


---------42:01----------
i see okay so okay the one answer i do


---------42:04----------
have


---------42:04----------
is that i i think i'm overwhelmed a lot


---------42:08----------
so sometimes i don't know where to start


---------42:12----------
other times i i genuinely forget


---------42:16----------
i feel like i do so many different


---------42:17----------
things and i don't have a nine-to-five


---------42:20----------
desk job


---------42:21----------
i end up um


---------42:25----------
probably sort of burning myself out and


---------42:29----------
not


---------42:29----------
really taking a lot of down time so i'm


---------42:31----------
sort of always all over the place like


---------42:33----------
okay i gotta do this i gotta do this


---------42:36----------
and i don't keep lists as organized


---------42:40----------
as i probably should so i think that


---------42:42----------
those things contribute to me feeling


---------42:44----------
overwhelmed and not knowing where to


---------42:45----------
start with things


---------42:47----------
okay why are you overwhelmed


---------42:51----------
well hold on let me just think about


---------42:52----------
this before i ask you more questions


---------42:54----------
i'm trying to decide whether i should


---------42:57----------
just give you answers or ask you


---------42:58----------
questions


---------43:01----------
both


---------43:06----------
what makes you feel overwhelmed


---------43:12----------
oh where would we could be here all day


---------43:14----------
that's why i was thinking about the


---------43:16----------
question


---------43:17----------
so so


---------43:17----------
[Music]


---------43:20----------
here here's what i'd like to do sasha


---------43:22----------
but you let me know if you're okay with


---------43:24----------
this okay


---------43:25----------
one is um i think that there's stuff


---------43:27----------
that you're struggling with


---------43:29----------
um maybe not struggling is not the right


---------43:30----------
word there's there are things that you


---------43:32----------
deal with that sound


---------43:34----------
challenging to me but that conversation


---------43:36----------
is going to be more


---------43:38----------
personal in nature um it


---------43:41----------
i we may be closer to getting you to


---------43:44----------
open up a little bit


---------43:46----------
i just but you've said that you don't


---------43:48----------
potentially want to do that so i we


---------43:50----------
don't have to go there


---------43:51----------
uh i will for sure um give you like a


---------43:55----------
15 to 30 minute spiel on procrastination


---------43:58----------
that i'm like 80


---------43:59----------
confident will help you a lot okay


---------44:03----------
um and we can just do that at the end


---------44:06----------
because i think i've already i mean i


---------44:07----------
have a good sense of


---------44:09----------
what you're you know what's going on


---------44:10----------
here um yeah


---------44:12----------
and and you know it can also be helpful


---------44:14----------
for your like viewers and stuff because


---------44:16----------
we'll explain


---------44:16----------
you know like how procrastination for


---------44:18----------
example is an umbrella term


---------44:20----------
so it's like an emergent phenomenon


---------44:22----------
that's based on all kinds of different


---------44:25----------
different processes and so you'll get


---------44:27----------
like a particular


---------44:28----------
instagram person who will say like oh


---------44:30----------
it's caused by this no it's not caused


---------44:32----------
by that that's like


---------44:33----------
death is caused by cancer like yeah


---------44:35----------
that's true but it's also caused by all


---------44:36----------
kinds of other things


---------44:38----------
exactly right exactly so how do you


---------44:40----------
diagnose so like there are


---------44:42----------
you know three discrete kinds of


---------44:43----------
procrastination that i tend to like


---------44:46----------
diagnose and work with


---------44:47----------
i mean it's not really like a medical


---------44:48----------
diagnosis but like i've sort of seen


---------44:50----------
three routes to procrastination


---------44:52----------
that tends to help like 70 of people


---------44:56----------
and then there are additional buckets


---------44:58----------
which result in procrastination like


---------45:00----------
feeling overwhelmed


---------45:01----------
which just is just you just don't have


---------45:03----------
and we can kind of talk about that


---------45:04----------
principle i mean there's


---------45:05----------
a i think a discussion on


---------45:07----------
procrastination can be like a 12-hour


---------45:09----------
lecture


---------45:10----------
yeah where you go through neuroscience


---------45:12----------
and different circuits of the brain and


---------45:13----------
like


---------45:14----------
you know it all applies um but i mean


---------45:17----------
i'm kind of


---------45:18----------
finding a lot of uh curiosity about like


---------45:21----------
you know it being an uphill battle every


---------45:23----------
day you feeling overwhelmed but i just


---------45:25----------
want to make sure that you're


---------45:26----------
comfortable talking about that


---------45:27----------
and if you're not that's totally cool we


---------45:29----------
can just steer clear what do you think


---------45:34----------
yeah we can dig into it a little bit um


---------45:37----------
and then if i'm not comfortable you'll


---------45:39----------
probably realize that immediately


---------45:41----------
yep so i may just like now i'm going to


---------45:45----------
signal to you whether we're going to


---------45:46----------
talk about it or like i'll ask you for


---------45:48----------
permission okay


---------45:49----------
you know i'll probably check in with you


---------45:51----------
and if i see that maybe things are


---------45:52----------
becoming uncomfortable


---------45:54----------
then i will signal to you again


---------45:57----------
and then one thing that we need to be


---------45:59----------
really careful about


---------46:00----------
okay because there is the presenter that


---------46:03----------
may not want to disappoint people


---------46:07----------
so we have to be careful that that


---------46:09----------
person is not the one


---------46:10----------
answering the questions yes


---------46:15----------
and feel free to say that's not an


---------46:18----------
answer


---------46:18----------
okay so is that um is that perfect


---------46:23----------
okay so that works okay so let's be


---------46:26----------
careful because you're allowed to


---------46:27----------
disappoint us


---------46:28----------
yes okay and and another thing that


---------46:32----------
one of my mods just reminded me of as


---------46:35----------
well is that


---------46:37----------
um squirrel


---------46:41----------
i get distracted a lot


---------46:44----------
a lot that'll be part of the 30-minute


---------46:46----------
explanation


---------46:47----------
okay okay


---------46:51----------
yeah so tell me what i mean so it sounds


---------46:53----------
like you're overwhelmed by a lot of


---------46:54----------
stuff


---------46:56----------
yeah i mean i do like i said i do


---------47:00----------
so many different things


---------47:04----------
that it is really hard for me sometimes


---------47:06----------
to figure out


---------47:08----------
how how to prioritize things


---------47:12----------
okay what makes you do a lot of


---------47:14----------
different things


---------47:19----------
well it goes back to not having a


---------47:20----------
nine-to-five job so


---------47:22----------
constantly either trying to


---------47:26----------
create new content make sure i show up


---------47:28----------
to stream because that is


---------47:29----------
an obligation too you know as much as i


---------47:31----------
do enjoy it at the end of the day


---------47:33----------
um uh


---------47:36----------
people like to say that they stream just


---------47:38----------
for fun


---------47:39----------
and it is a job too


---------47:43----------
you know um so knowing that like i have


---------47:45----------
certain expectations that i have to meet


---------47:47----------
but then there's also things creatively


---------47:49----------
that


---------47:50----------
i would like to do and i would like to


---------47:52----------
fulfill um for myself


---------47:55----------
um and i've always been independent


---------47:59----------
like i've always been


---------48:03----------
self-sustained uh


---------48:07----------
i don't have like a team of a thousand


---------48:10----------
people or


---------48:11----------
20 people doing everything for me


---------48:14----------
right and i just report to them and show


---------48:16----------
up like i am hands-on


---------48:18----------
and now thankfully because of my stream


---------48:21----------
i do actually have a small team of


---------48:22----------
people that like help me with um


---------48:24----------
like social media and youtube stuff but


---------48:27----------
still like i feel like i'm


---------48:29----------
always


---------48:32----------
if it's not one thing it's another and


---------48:34----------
that's work life


---------48:36----------
that's not even personal life


---------48:39----------
okay so so


---------48:44----------
i want to understand when you so i'm


---------48:46----------
hearing that you have a lot of stuff on


---------48:47----------
your plate


---------48:48----------
yes so how does something wind up on


---------48:51----------
your plate to begin with


---------48:54----------
i put it there okay so let's understand


---------48:58----------
that


---------49:00----------
okay so this is not a problem of


---------49:02----------
prioritization


---------49:03----------
it's like here i am like at the buffet


---------49:05----------
i've got a plate full of food like i


---------49:07----------
don't know what to eat first


---------49:09----------
yeah so this is why people have trouble


---------49:11----------
with procrastination because they look


---------49:13----------
at the current situation and they ask


---------49:15----------
themselves


---------49:16----------
how do i fix this that's not where the


---------49:18----------
money is the question is how did you


---------49:20----------
wind up here in the first place


---------49:22----------
that's what you need to fix right right


---------49:26----------
right don't try to dig yourself out of


---------49:27----------
this hole because like


---------49:29----------
it's jumping in that's the problem it's


---------49:31----------
like you know okay so so you know


---------49:33----------
like let's just think about something


---------49:35----------
like what's something you know what how


---------49:36----------
do things end up on your plate


---------49:40----------
i think part of it is survival


---------49:44----------
so like some of it is just pure


---------49:47----------
economics i know that i


---------49:50----------
i don't have i don't have a thousand


---------49:54----------
things to fall back on


---------49:55----------
right okay meaning i don't have a


---------49:59----------
i don't have this and i i keep saying


---------50:01----------
nine to five job because it's easy


---------50:03----------
for me to sort of paint this like


---------50:05----------
picture and delineation


---------50:07----------
where i'm i don't have a salary to fall


---------50:10----------
back on right


---------50:12----------
so for me it's i always have to follow


---------50:16----------
and chase new i don't want to say trends


---------50:19----------
because that's so not me but


---------50:20----------
yes like trends and technology trends


---------50:24----------
and streaming and


---------50:25----------
trends and content because they change


---------50:27----------
so vastly so


---------50:28----------
like always catching up with those


---------50:30----------
things


---------50:32----------
because they are essential to what i do


---------50:34----------
to make a living


---------50:35----------
is overwhelming especially when you


---------50:37----------
don't have like i said


---------50:38----------
i don't have a team of a thousand people


---------50:42----------
doing things these things for me and


---------50:44----------
especially when


---------50:45----------
what happens if you don't stay on top of


---------50:47----------
trends i'm going to interrupt you from


---------50:49----------
time to time if that bothers you please


---------50:51----------
let me know


---------50:51----------
it's fine yeah that's fine uh


---------50:57----------
what happens when you don't say on


---------50:59----------
trends well i'm trying i guess this is


---------51:00----------
like speaking to me


---------51:06----------
personally


---------51:09----------
you've i mean it's it's sounds really


---------51:12----------
simple but like if you don't stay on top


---------51:15----------
of trends


---------51:15----------
then how is your content being seen by


---------51:18----------
people


---------51:21----------
and that's like again this is like a


---------51:23----------
very this is uh this is


---------51:24----------
a career thing this is the reason that


---------51:27----------
i'm going to interrupt you is because i


---------51:29----------
think your mind is operating at a level


---------51:32----------
that is way higher up than where we need


---------51:35----------
to be function


---------51:36----------
where we need to look at so like on a


---------51:40----------
given day


---------51:41----------
when you wake up in the morning and your


---------51:43----------
mind says


---------51:44----------
i need to keep up with what's going on


---------51:48----------
like you have some thought like that i


---------51:50----------
am assuming like what goes through your


---------51:52----------
head


---------51:52----------
like can we get like very microscopic


---------51:54----------
with like what's what's happening in


---------51:55----------
your head


---------51:58----------
can try um


---------52:04----------
the it's it's about how can i


---------52:08----------
how can i bring relevant


---------52:12----------
value to what i'm doing today and


---------52:15----------
right so if it's on stream for instance


---------52:17----------
because that's


---------52:18----------
my main focus right now


---------52:22----------
how do i make my streams better and


---------52:26----------
okay i or i do a lot of cooking on


---------52:29----------
stream too so like


---------52:30----------
what can i do uh


---------52:34----------
that people will will be interested in


---------52:37----------
um and then that's like okay well i know


---------52:39----------
that there's


---------52:40----------
these specific groups of people tend to


---------52:43----------
come in


---------52:44----------
in numbers so i know that i have to


---------52:45----------
focus on very specific things not always


---------52:47----------
the


---------52:48----------
exact thing that i want to do and it's


---------52:50----------
the same with games right like you're


---------52:51----------
always having to keep up with


---------52:53----------
there's a new game release and it


---------52:54----------
becomes sometimes like you want to


---------52:56----------
finish this other thing and that sounds


---------52:58----------
so so trivial but it's not


---------53:01----------
because things are relevant today and


---------53:03----------
then


---------53:04----------
by next friday they're no longer


---------53:06----------
relevant


---------53:08----------
okay so um but then there's also sorry


---------53:11----------
sorry to cut you off but then there's


---------53:12----------
also like just the over


---------53:15----------
like everything else happening in the


---------53:16----------
world right can you tell me about that


---------53:22----------
i with social media and with the amount


---------53:25----------
of information


---------53:25----------
that we have whether it's covid or


---------53:28----------
whether it's


---------53:29----------
and this is going to make me cry but


---------53:31----------
like damn


---------53:36----------
the injustices in our country that have


---------53:38----------
been happening


---------53:40----------
um the fact that it's like 20 21 and


---------53:43----------
we're still here


---------53:45----------
and sometimes feeling so helpless


---------53:51----------
that stuff becomes overwhelming and i'm


---------53:52----------
not even


---------53:54----------
the primary person affected by those


---------53:56----------
things


---------53:57----------
and then i feel guilty because i say ah


---------54:00----------
you shouldn't be crying you need to be


---------54:02----------
out there doing something


---------54:03----------
to help people and use your privileges


---------54:05----------
to help people


---------54:08----------
and that becomes overwhelming


---------54:13----------
okay so and so so sometimes yeah it's


---------54:17----------
like


---------54:18----------
you want to just the thing that you


---------54:21----------
depend on for a career is the same thing


---------54:22----------
that sometimes you want


---------54:24----------
to just completely ignore because


---------54:27----------
it's it's hard sometimes to keep those


---------54:29----------
balances


---------54:31----------
it's hard a lot of times can you help me


---------54:33----------
understand um


---------54:38----------
i understand you got emotional there for


---------54:40----------
a second


---------54:42----------
um i'm gonna go ahead and say


---------54:48----------
i didn't see that one coming so


---------54:51----------
[Laughter]


---------54:53----------
i was just confused by your your


---------54:55----------
statement about


---------54:56----------
and then there's all the other i was


---------54:58----------
like what other stuff you know i was


---------55:00----------
with you


---------55:01----------
sorry about that i'm not gonna ask you


---------55:05----------
more questions


---------55:06----------
about that right now if that's okay with


---------55:07----------
you that's great with me thank you


---------55:10----------
okay i hate crying in front of people


---------55:18----------
why


---------55:21----------
because it's weak son


---------55:26----------
um just because you put a funny voice on


---------55:29----------
it doesn't make it


---------55:30----------
i know that is part of it


---------55:34----------
and that's just like i i don't like to


---------55:37----------
uh


---------55:37----------
be vulnerable in front of people i just


---------55:40----------
don't


---------55:42----------
is does crying make you vulnerable


---------55:47----------
i think so okay that's what's important


---------55:50----------
what you think is


---------55:51----------
important


---------55:53----------
[Music]


---------56:00----------
sasha i'm getting some degree of like


---------56:03----------
desperation


---------56:04----------
driving what ends up on your plate like


---------56:07----------
i'm getting the sense that


---------56:08----------
it's sort of like survival of the


---------56:10----------
fittest and you sort of don't have a


---------56:12----------
backup plan


---------56:13----------
is that how it feels sometimes for sure


---------56:17----------
yeah and so do you think


---------56:21----------
that's that motivates you to put things


---------56:23----------
on your plate


---------56:25----------
absolutely okay


---------56:28----------
so this once again i'm going to give you


---------56:30----------
the option to opt into or opt out of


---------56:33----------
um and


---------56:36----------
you know whatever happens today sasha i


---------56:38----------
think if you're okay with it i may just


---------56:41----------
summarize some thoughts and dm you in


---------56:43----------
the event that you want to see a


---------56:44----------
therapist i think there are a lot of


---------56:45----------
things that you could talk about in a


---------56:47----------
private setting


---------56:48----------
like themes that maybe you could explore


---------56:49----------
with someone um yeah is it okay if i do


---------56:52----------
that


---------56:53----------
sure okay um


---------56:56----------
so yeah i mean


---------56:59----------
can we because i i think that a lot of


---------57:02----------
you know so if we


---------57:03----------
let me just share my thinking so you


---------57:04----------
feel overwhelmed by a lot of stuff


---------57:06----------
and i think a lot of that depends on


---------57:08----------
like how much stuff you're juggling now


---------57:10----------
there's actually like a cognitive and


---------57:11----------
even genetic


---------57:13----------
reason why you your mind functions the


---------57:16----------
way that it does


---------57:17----------
this is coming up for air by the way so


---------57:19----------
i'm gonna work very intellectually for a


---------57:21----------
second okay


---------57:22----------
we're gonna take the heat off of you and


---------57:23----------
we're gonna just talk about


---------57:24----------
procrastination okay


---------57:26----------
so um and then


---------57:30----------
so like basically like there's there's a


---------57:31----------
way that your mind works you have a


---------57:33----------
unique cognitive fingerprint which is


---------57:34----------
that you juggle a lot of balls


---------57:36----------
i guess that you get pretty excited


---------57:38----------
about stuff


---------57:40----------
um and what


---------57:44----------
sorry 12 12 year old sense of humor


---------57:47----------
sorry


---------57:48----------
okay so um you know i'd say that


---------57:52----------
that


---------57:54----------
okay i just caught up


---------57:59----------
nice


---------58:03----------
so i was about to say you have a lot of


---------58:04----------
balls in the air but you know


---------58:08----------
because i use this and out like they're


---------58:09----------
baked in at this point so you know


---------58:10----------
you're you're juggling a lot of uh


---------58:12----------
like you've got a lot of different


---------58:13----------
projects going on right and so


---------58:15----------
so there are people whose cognitive


---------58:17----------
fingerprint is like you get excited


---------58:19----------
about things very easily and it's like


---------58:20----------
oh like let's do this like this sounds


---------58:22----------
really cool like let me do this like


---------58:23----------
this sounds really cool like let me do


---------58:24----------
this and then um


---------58:27----------
so that's fine but i think that there's


---------58:29----------
actually more to it than that like


---------58:31----------
that's your cognitive fingerprint your


---------58:33----------
mind is always gonna excel


---------58:34----------
actually because i guess that you get


---------58:36----------
bored easily and you need like some


---------58:37----------
degree of variety


---------58:39----------
um but the the thing that i i really


---------58:42----------
think that we


---------58:43----------
can work on is like this idea that every


---------58:45----------
day is an uphill battle


---------58:47----------
because i suspect that some of that


---------58:49----------
sentiment


---------58:50----------
comes from actually like a lack of


---------58:52----------
security


---------58:53----------
about what's gonna happen for you


---------58:56----------
and and some of that lack of security


---------58:59----------
may actually


---------59:00----------
in an unhealthy way because like there's


---------59:02----------
like this panic of like


---------59:04----------
if i don't do this thing


---------59:07----------
then what could happen and so that


---------59:10----------
driving force is gonna get you to like


---------59:13----------
take as much as you can but then your


---------59:15----------
plate gets overwhelmed


---------59:18----------
absolutely so oddly enough i think if


---------59:21----------
you want to get out of this you have to


---------59:23----------
address the feeling of like i have to do


---------59:26----------
this or


---------59:29----------
you know it'll all come crumbling down


---------59:31----------
or


---------59:34----------
yes i agree i don't disagree with that


---------59:36----------
at all uh


---------59:37----------
but i will say actually


---------59:43----------
since i started streaming


---------59:48----------
my mods are going to laugh at me 100 but


---------59:52----------
since i started streaming i feel like


---------59:53----------
i've been a lot better


---------59:57----------
because although it's not a 9 to 5 job


---------60:02----------
it it


---------60:05----------
it's provided some structure a very


---------60:08----------
loose structure


---------60:10----------
because i can still you know


---------60:14----------
show up at any given time


---------60:17----------
so it's not like i have to be at a


---------60:18----------
specific place at the same time every


---------60:20----------
day but i do feel like it has given me


---------60:21----------
some structure but now


---------60:23----------
it's it's learning how to balance um


---------60:27----------
showing up and then also giving myself a


---------60:31----------
break


---------60:31----------
which is actually something i wanted to


---------60:33----------
ask you about as well


---------60:34----------
and somebody it's a question that um


---------60:37----------
somebody from our community had but i


---------60:39----------
felt like


---------60:40----------
i could really relate to is like when do


---------60:42----------
you know to take a break


---------60:45----------
what because i i'm taking a break and


---------60:48----------
what keeps you from taking a break and


---------60:50----------
like


---------60:54----------
and when is it okay to go back some


---------60:56----------
that's definitely something that i


---------60:58----------
struggle with


---------60:59----------
when is it okay to go back to work yeah


---------61:02----------
like when is it okay to take a break and


---------61:04----------
when is it okay to go back and


---------61:07----------
especially again i keep going back to


---------61:09----------
like this this world that is just so


---------61:11----------
different from a traditional job like


---------61:14----------
what that can be difficult this job


---------61:21----------
you you make your own rules


---------61:24----------
and that can sometimes work against you


---------61:28----------
and it can make it very difficult to


---------61:29----------
live like to have


---------61:35----------
you make your own rules so


---------61:38----------
sometimes we need outside perspective to


---------61:41----------
help us to help guide us


---------61:43----------
right this is something that i love


---------61:44----------
about collaborating is that when i


---------61:46----------
collaborate with people on things


---------61:48----------
it gives me another perspective and then


---------61:50----------
it can inspire me


---------61:52----------
to think differently about things what


---------61:54----------
rules do you make up for yourself sasha


---------62:00----------
i don't know if i'm i'm like i'm really


---------62:01----------
prepared to answer that because i feel


---------62:03----------
like i'm gonna


---------62:04----------
jump around that like i was about to say


---------62:06----------
something and then it just sounded


---------62:09----------
ridiculous but my rules are that i have


---------62:13----------
no rules


---------62:16----------
so sasha i i


---------62:19----------
i'm confused is your reluctance to


---------62:22----------
answer


---------62:23----------
because you're not happy with how the


---------62:25----------
presentation would go


---------62:28----------
no i just don't i actually don't think i


---------62:29----------
have an answer for that at the moment


---------62:31----------
like i would have


---------62:32----------
came to your head that was it that i


---------62:35----------
have no rules


---------62:36----------
like yeah i think that that's what


---------62:39----------
like when you said it's so hard to


---------62:41----------
create roles when you're


---------62:47----------
it's hard to set rules for yourself when


---------62:49----------
you're doing it on your own


---------62:50----------
yep it is


---------62:54----------
it's like for instance today we had a


---------62:55----------
meeting 10 30 is our


---------62:57----------
our co-stream no problem i'm there


---------63:02----------
like that's not a problem but if last


---------63:05----------
night i said to myself


---------63:07----------
i'm gonna end my stream at a reasonable


---------63:09----------
hour


---------63:10----------
and i'm gonna wake up and go hiking in


---------63:12----------
the morning


---------63:14----------
you better believe that that snooze


---------63:16----------
button is being hit


---------63:18----------
ten times and then i'm gonna go hiking


---------63:21----------
at night


---------63:22----------
yep so so who is the sasha


---------63:26----------
who is the sasha that that says to


---------63:28----------
herself


---------63:30----------
that i'm going to end my stream at a


---------63:31----------
reasonable hour and wake up at the


---------63:33----------
morning


---------63:33----------
can you tell me about her the one that


---------63:36----------
has to be responsible


---------63:37----------
to other people than just herself


---------63:41----------
i don't think no i think that's a


---------63:42----------
different one i know it sounds weird


---------63:45----------
so i think you're good at being


---------63:46----------
responsible to other people


---------63:48----------
yes i think you're bad at being


---------63:50----------
responsible towards yourself


---------63:52----------
yes that's what i mean sorry if i yeah


---------63:56----------
i may have misunderstood so but but tell


---------63:58----------
me about the one that tries to get you


---------64:00----------
to do stuff for yourself


---------64:04----------
like why does she say those things


---------64:10----------
it's that's a question that i'm asking


---------64:12----------
myself i really don't know


---------64:14----------
with that i truly do what what what's in


---------64:16----------
your head why would you say to yourself


---------64:18----------
that you want to end stream at a


---------64:19----------
reasonable hour


---------64:22----------
i'm that was like partly a joke but


---------64:25----------
because i can't just blame it on the


---------64:27----------
stream


---------64:27----------
but um


---------64:33----------
i'm saying that because i did say that


---------64:34----------
last night like bef when i ended my


---------64:36----------
stream i said okay like i could keep


---------64:37----------
going in theory


---------64:40----------
and keep playing this game but i know


---------64:43----------
that i need


---------64:44----------
to go to sleep so i can be on time


---------64:48----------
and be arrested right um


---------64:53----------
whereas like on fridays and saturdays


---------64:55----------
when i stream


---------64:57----------
i don't have to do that and as long as


---------64:59----------
like my mods are cool


---------65:00----------
and they're down to hang i can keep


---------65:02----------
going for another hour or two


---------65:04----------
and then i know that like okay tomorrow


---------65:05----------
i can sleep in a little bit


---------65:07----------
and then i'll just start my stream


---------65:09----------
excuse me a little bit later the next


---------65:10----------
day


---------65:12----------
and okay so


---------65:16----------
all right hmm


---------65:22----------
can you tell me what i'm gonna switch


---------65:23----------
gears on you for a second okay


---------65:25----------
can you tell me what feels like an


---------65:27----------
uphill battle


---------65:33----------
what feels like an uphill battle


---------65:38----------
i go back to like content creation


---------65:42----------
in general what i do


---------65:48----------
uh or at least like what i'm doing now


---------65:53----------
that can feel like an uphill battle


---------65:55----------
because


---------65:56----------
again it goes back to what we were


---------65:58----------
talking about earlier


---------66:02----------
how do you


---------66:10----------
how do you run a business because that's


---------66:12----------
what it is


---------66:14----------
but also stay true to yourself


---------66:18----------
knowing that there are a million


---------66:21----------
algorithms working against you


---------66:25----------
so that feels like an uphill battle a


---------66:28----------
lot like


---------66:28----------
me and my a couple of the my mods and


---------66:31----------
people that work with me on


---------66:33----------
my youtube stuff like we are constantly


---------66:35----------
analyzing these things


---------66:36----------
and talking about okay we'll have an


---------66:37----------
idea but we can't do that idea because


---------66:40----------
that means that it can't be monetized


---------66:44----------
and like i said you can hear a million


---------66:46----------
people say they


---------66:47----------
they stream for fun but at the end of


---------66:50----------
the day


---------66:51----------
it is still a business


---------66:54----------
so i think that constantly juggling like


---------66:57----------
what


---------66:58----------
what brings you


---------67:01----------
a spiritual fulfillment if you will that


---------67:03----------
makes you happy that


---------67:05----------
also what sucks is like


---------67:08----------
i know that there as we were talking


---------67:10----------
about earlier there are people that


---------67:13----------
there's that have a sense of trust with


---------67:15----------
me


---------67:16----------
so like there are things that we would


---------67:17----------
like to talk about that then we can't


---------67:19----------
talk


---------67:19----------
about so those things definitely become


---------67:23----------
frustrating


---------67:24----------
do you feel like um that that you're


---------67:28----------
further restricted by being shadow


---------67:30----------
banned


---------67:31----------
like does that does that like set you


---------67:34----------
yeah help yeah yeah absolutely


---------67:38----------
can you explain that to me please well


---------67:41----------
that's like


---------67:42----------
again that's something that i the me to


---------67:46----------
the you know


---------67:47----------
talking to the public is that i want to


---------67:48----------
be really clear about is


---------67:51----------
it's not um it's not an egotistical


---------67:54----------
bruise whatsoever


---------67:57----------
it's it's simply the fact that


---------68:02----------
i cannot continue


---------68:05----------
i can but not in the way that everybody


---------68:08----------
else can


---------68:08----------
i can't continue to create things


---------68:12----------
and have them be seen in the same way


---------68:14----------
that the average person can


---------68:17----------
so i'm hearing that you're held to a


---------68:18----------
different standard


---------68:20----------
absolutely and


---------68:24----------
and i brought that on myself for sure


---------68:26----------
but the internet is also what brought me


---------68:28----------
here


---------68:30----------
so there's this real duplicity right


---------68:32----------
like


---------68:35----------
they're in there seems to be so much


---------68:37----------
fake allyship


---------68:39----------
of every


---------68:43----------
every minority group


---------68:46----------
and i consider myself part of the lgbtq


---------68:48----------
community


---------68:50----------
i was a sex worker so


---------68:53----------
there seems to be all of this outside


---------68:56----------
visible support


---------68:59----------
for groups during certain times of the


---------69:01----------
year


---------69:03----------
but then if you actually try to have


---------69:04----------
these conversations


---------69:06----------
those same people that put up that


---------69:07----------
little flag on their website are


---------69:08----------
suppressing your voice


---------69:12----------
how does that feel


---------69:15----------
makes me angry


---------69:18----------
what are you angry about it makes me


---------69:21----------
angry that


---------69:22----------
people claim to stand for something and


---------69:25----------
then


---------69:27----------
the very things they claim to stand for


---------69:32----------
they suppress


---------69:36----------
okay i'm noticing emotions again


---------69:40----------
um so sasha i think that i


---------69:48----------
uh so i'm gonna if it's okay with you


---------69:50----------
i'm gonna state an actual preference


---------69:52----------
that i want to continue talking about


---------69:53----------
this because


---------69:54----------
this feels incredibly important to me


---------69:58----------
um and at the same time since there are


---------70:00----------
emotions we're gonna pause


---------70:01----------
and we're gonna see if you're okay with


---------70:03----------
it because like i think what you're


---------70:04----------
saying is like


---------70:05----------
really really important we're talking


---------70:07----------
about double standards we're talking


---------70:09----------
about


---------70:10----------
hypocrisy we're talking about um


---------70:15----------
you know like do we really want to be


---------70:17----------
accepting of people because that means i


---------70:19----------
know it sounds crazy


---------70:20----------
being accepting of people means that we


---------70:22----------
need to accept people


---------70:24----------
yeah funny right


---------70:27----------
and you know accepting people is


---------70:29----------
something that sounds


---------70:31----------
good but the truth is my experience as a


---------70:34----------
psychiatrist


---------70:35----------
accepting people is very hard it's not


---------70:37----------
pretty


---------70:39----------
yeah it requires it's not like a good


---------70:41----------
thing like accepting people is like


---------70:44----------
hard it's painful it requires


---------70:48----------
it's not like a you know black and white


---------70:51----------
sort of like oh like let's be accepting


---------70:52----------
like it sucks to accept


---------70:54----------
no no and i mean like


---------70:58----------
from from an outside view what's so


---------71:00----------
crazy


---------71:02----------
what's weird is like i can take


---------71:04----------
criticism from strangers i can take


---------71:06----------
criticism from


---------71:09----------
anonymous people on the internet


---------71:12----------
but that side of it is so frustrating


---------71:15----------
because i


---------71:17----------
like my whole motivation for getting in


---------71:20----------
the industry when i was in it was to


---------71:21----------
empower people part of it was catharsis


---------71:24----------
part of it was self-discovery but to


---------71:26----------
also empower people


---------71:28----------
and to feel like i have to


---------71:31----------
constantly guard and watch everything i


---------71:34----------
say and do


---------71:36----------
because then i can't keep sharing that


---------71:40----------
message


---------71:40----------
is is stressful


---------71:45----------
but then also like


---------71:49----------
at the end of the day going back to the


---------71:51----------
fact that it is a business


---------71:52----------
right so like how how are you supposed


---------71:54----------
to do the thing


---------71:55----------
not everybody gets to do the things they


---------71:56----------
love for work so i do try to ground


---------71:59----------
myself in that and remind myself like


---------72:00----------
okay i'm i'm lucky for


---------72:03----------
what i do have right and the things that


---------72:05----------
i can do


---------72:07----------
um like how do you continue that message


---------72:10----------
how do i continue that message


---------72:11----------
yeah dude this is like okay


---------72:15----------
i'm about to get frustrated with you is


---------72:17----------
that okay


---------72:19----------
okay i mean what can you say can you say


---------72:22----------
no


---------72:22----------
no because here's the thing sasha like


---------72:26----------
okay like there's the business right but


---------72:27----------
what i really hear


---------72:28----------
is that like there's there's like a real


---------72:31----------
you which is being muzzled by a business


---------72:33----------
you


---------72:34----------
and i'm not saying that that's unwise


---------72:36----------
because i'm hearing


---------72:37----------
that very clearly like you can't let


---------72:42----------
yourself out right because like you're


---------72:44----------
gonna be punished in a way that other


---------72:45----------
people won't


---------72:46----------
you're kind of like you've already got


---------72:48----------
two strikes against you and so you can't


---------72:50----------
afford to take that third strike and i


---------72:53----------
i completely get that um


---------72:56----------
at the same time there's a part of me


---------72:57----------
that's like a little bit


---------73:00----------
i don't think that that's who you were


---------73:02----------
meant to be


---------73:04----------
right so i i think like look when i


---------73:06----------
think about what is your contribution to


---------73:08----------
this


---------73:09----------
world i think your contribution to this


---------73:13----------
world feels


---------73:14----------
very strongly to me to be like those


---------73:16----------
conversations actually that you're not


---------73:18----------
allowed to have


---------73:19----------
now i'm not saying that you should go


---------73:21----------
and have them but i think that there's


---------73:23----------
like something to be said for the fact


---------73:25----------
that like you're considering these


---------73:26----------
conversations i think you


---------73:28----------
you know you clearly are a thoughtful


---------73:30----------
person and like if we really


---------73:32----------
think about like what do people need


---------73:35----------
i suspect what people need i mean hell


---------73:37----------
we started this whole


---------73:38----------
this conversation with like me having


---------73:40----------
conversations that people thought were


---------73:41----------
unacceptable


---------73:43----------
right so that may be but i mean i've


---------73:45----------
seen immense value to having


---------73:47----------
conversations that people


---------73:49----------
haven't had before or people think that


---------73:52----------
is a little bit like out of line


---------73:55----------
and i'm not saying you should go by that


---------73:57----------
i mean just out of line


---------73:59----------
like like so talking with people about


---------74:01----------
their personal feelings


---------74:03----------
in a very authentic way on the internet


---------74:05----------
with thousands of people watching is a


---------74:06----------
big no-no


---------74:09----------
you know i spoke with my colleagues and


---------74:10----------
i was like what do you guys think about


---------74:12----------
this some of them said it was a bad idea


---------74:13----------
some of them said it was important you


---------74:15----------
know they gave me a lot of good advice


---------74:16----------
and like


---------74:17----------
helped me like understand a lot of the


---------74:19----------
ethics of like how can we protect people


---------74:21----------
like


---------74:21----------
for example sometimes we'll have


---------74:23----------
conversations with people before they


---------74:24----------
come on stream


---------74:25----------
where they're allowed to say i don't


---------74:27----------
want to talk about this i don't want to


---------74:28----------
talk about this i don't want to talk


---------74:29----------
about this


---------74:30----------
so that you know they're not put in a


---------74:32----------
position and we kind of steer away like


---------74:33----------
there are a lot of things that we do


---------74:35----------
to make this a safer experience yeah and


---------74:38----------
at the same time i think the


---------74:39----------
conversation is important to have


---------74:41----------
now what i'm hearing is that you're


---------74:42----------
paranoid about being canceled which i


---------74:44----------
think probably makes sense is that fair


---------74:47----------
to say


---------74:49----------
uh not canceled in the


---------74:52----------
not my version of cancelled i mean not


---------74:55----------
in how i interpret cancel


---------74:57----------
like it's just a simple fact that for


---------74:59----------
instance


---------75:00----------
um i'll just tell you like straight up


---------75:03----------
like the other day i was talking


---------75:05----------
to a couple of my online friends


---------75:08----------
that helped me with my youtube stuff


---------75:10----------
about wanting to start


---------75:12----------
a new um i don't know what yet right


---------75:16----------
like


---------75:16----------
either something in a written form like


---------75:20----------
a blog or a video series


---------75:21----------
or um somebody mentioned like a podcast


---------75:26----------
right


---------75:26----------
that has to do with like sexual health


---------75:28----------
and wellness


---------75:31----------
and having conversations


---------75:34----------
um with like guests or just giving my


---------75:37----------
own


---------75:38----------
feedback and telling my own stories um


---------75:41----------
but then the first thing is like well


---------75:45----------
how are people going to hear about it


---------75:47----------
how are people going to listen to it


---------75:49----------
because


---------75:49----------
anything that has to do with that even


---------75:51----------
if it's in a


---------75:52----------
with sexual subject matter


---------75:56----------
automatically is


---------76:00----------
on every social media platform


---------76:02----------
completely


---------76:04----------
suppressed to the bottom


---------76:07----------
so how do how do i continue something


---------76:09----------
new if i c if i can't even approach it


---------76:13----------
uh and have people be aware of its


---------76:18----------
existence


---------76:20----------
how does it feel to be in that situation


---------76:26----------
again frustrating makes me angry for


---------76:29----------
sure


---------76:31----------
because then you see


---------76:35----------
here we go here's something that i think


---------76:36----------
everybody uh everybody can relate to


---------76:38----------
because then you see


---------76:39----------
other people that um


---------76:43----------
they magically come out of nowhere


---------76:45----------
because they have a


---------76:46----------
foundation that started elsewhere


---------76:49----------
and then they can start talking about


---------76:51----------
these things and they can take that risk


---------76:53----------
because they already have this other


---------76:54----------
foundation to fall back on


---------76:59----------
why don't you that's exactly okay so now


---------77:02----------
there's a theme right so


---------77:03----------
like what makes it so


---------77:06----------
what makes i do feel like i have a


---------77:08----------
foundation it's not that i don't


---------77:10----------
it's just that it's one that is not um


---------77:14----------
these days


---------77:18----------
i like i have to compare it to like when


---------77:20----------
i first


---------77:22----------
i've been in the public eye since i was


---------77:23----------
18 right so the internet and technology


---------77:25----------
has changed so much


---------77:27----------
it used to be a lot easier to


---------77:30----------
discover different people or discover


---------77:32----------
people like you or discover people that


---------77:33----------
shared your same


---------77:34----------
interests and talk about those things


---------77:39----------
so that a lot of those tools have sort


---------77:42----------
of been stripped by the way


---------77:44----------
the internet and social media works now


---------77:48----------
i'm sorry can you say that i'm just


---------77:52----------
noticing that i i think maybe there's


---------77:53----------
something


---------77:55----------
i should be understanding or knowing


---------77:57----------
sorry


---------77:58----------
like but it goes back to just um like


---------78:01----------
shadow banning right like there's just


---------78:02----------
certain subjects


---------78:04----------
that can't be discussed on the internet


---------78:06----------
okay or if you do


---------78:08----------
they're not um they're not monetizable


---------78:12----------
so like i can't sit here and say i have


---------78:14----------
this great idea in this passion project


---------78:16----------
and and then stop streaming you know a


---------78:20----------
few days a week


---------78:21----------
and put time into that


---------78:24----------
how does it feel because then it's like


---------78:26----------
it's like a pe it then becomes a passion


---------78:28----------
project essentially


---------78:29----------
so so can we talk about these other


---------78:31----------
people who are able to like


---------78:33----------
break into the scene and sort of am i


---------78:35----------
hearing you kind of say that they're


---------78:36----------
able to have the conversations and kind


---------78:38----------
of it's easier for them to make the


---------78:41----------
content because they don't have


---------78:43----------
the handicap that you have for lack of a


---------78:46----------
better term


---------78:47----------
yeah but that was a little that was a


---------78:48----------
little probably superficial but like


---------78:51----------
yes i have seen people um


---------78:54----------
that are are


---------78:58----------
regular let's say like regular


---------79:00----------
influencers


---------79:02----------
that aren't so much from the streaming


---------79:04----------
side of things um


---------79:06----------
that then go off and decide that they're


---------79:10----------
going to have an authority on a subject


---------79:14----------
like this i have seen that it's not all


---------79:16----------
the time but i think that's everybody


---------79:17----------
right like we all go on our phones


---------79:19----------
because we're all bombarded by social


---------79:21----------
media and we say oh why can't i have


---------79:23----------
that


---------79:23----------
like we're all guilty of that


---------79:28----------
but that specific area yes it's


---------79:31----------
frustrating to see


---------79:32----------
that sometimes people can do that yeah


---------79:35----------
you're doing something very sneaky here


---------79:37----------
which is that when you have an authentic


---------79:38----------
feeling


---------79:39----------
you actually devalue it very quickly by


---------79:42----------
generalizing it


---------79:45----------
okay so like let's just follow along


---------79:46----------
like you said that like so you have a


---------79:48----------
particular background you have a


---------79:50----------
particular experience that arguably


---------79:52----------
makes you an authority


---------79:53----------
you also have something that you're kind


---------79:55----------
of passionate about and


---------79:57----------
um sorry


---------80:00----------
just i have to be careful about what


---------80:02----------
colloquialisms


---------80:03----------
i use yes


---------80:06----------
i'm sorry i think i understand a little


---------80:08----------
bit about


---------80:09----------
um i i think oh wow i just had a


---------80:12----------
revelation


---------80:13----------
i can't no wonder you it's so [ __ ]


---------80:16----------
exhausting


---------80:21----------
um because what i was going to say is is


---------80:24----------
i was going to use the phrase put your


---------80:26----------
money where your mouth is um


---------80:28----------
but and then it occurred to me that like


---------80:30----------
well you just did yeah and and then like


---------80:33----------
i noticed myself filtering


---------80:34----------
and then i was just thinking about like


---------80:36----------
oh like i'm filtering this much now like


---------80:38----------
what must it be like for you to filter


---------80:40----------
because you've got a filter way more


---------80:42----------
than i do i imagine


---------80:44----------
yeah with that kind of stuff though like


---------80:45----------
i laugh at you know like we


---------80:47----------
we're very open to make jokes about that


---------80:49----------
kind of stuff because you can right like


---------80:50----------
they're innuendos


---------80:52----------
like innuendos you can get away with so


---------80:54----------
much more it's like cartoons


---------80:56----------
yeah and at the same


---------80:59----------
but anyway kind of going back to like


---------81:01----------
like i think i'm hearing you sort of


---------81:03----------
say a couple of things sasha and i'm


---------81:05----------
hearing you kind of just skirt the edge


---------81:07----------
and then pull away


---------81:08----------
so i don't know if that's sort of like a


---------81:09----------
boundary issue but i'm going to just


---------81:11----------
share it like because i i think that


---------81:13----------
what i'm hearing is that you're


---------81:14----------
passionate about something there are


---------81:15----------
some issues that are important to you i


---------81:17----------
think you


---------81:18----------
sort of have you've kind of grown into


---------81:21----------
this role of content creator and you


---------81:22----------
think that like you can kind of combine


---------81:24----------
your platform with like


---------81:25----------
issues that are important to you and


---------81:28----------
that one of those topics could be


---------81:29----------
something like


---------81:30----------
sexual health um and that


---------81:34----------
you know when you when we kind of own


---------81:36----------
that a little bit like you also say oh


---------81:38----------
but it's social media and everyone sees


---------81:40----------
things that people like you know like oh


---------81:42----------
i wish i could be doing this


---------81:43----------
and so you got to be a little bit


---------81:44----------
careful there i wouldn't devalue


---------81:45----------
yourself because


---------81:46----------
if what i'm also hearing is is


---------81:50----------
you know are there a bunch of uneducated


---------81:51----------
people who are pretending to be experts


---------81:54----------
in domains that you feel like you're


---------81:56----------
qualified to give like


---------81:58----------
good guidance on


---------82:03----------
yes yes


---------82:06----------
something you said there was like


---------82:08----------
bringing something up and


---------82:10----------
i lost my train of thought again i got


---------82:12----------
distracted but


---------82:14----------
i'm trying to bring it back i bet you if


---------82:16----------
i went another remote remember it


---------82:22----------
um


---------82:27----------
let me try to say it again yeah maybe


---------82:28----------
that will help so so you were talking


---------82:30----------
about


---------82:32----------
you know how there are people like who


---------82:33----------
will


---------82:35----------
so you have certain things that you're


---------82:36----------
passionate about you have some some


---------82:38----------
things that you're interested in you're


---------82:39----------
a content creator maybe that you can


---------82:41----------
combine those two


---------82:42----------
you think about maybe like starting a


---------82:44----------
podcast or something


---------82:45----------
and you're not able to or it's


---------82:48----------
challenging for you to do so because of


---------82:49----------
some of the shadow banning etc and then


---------82:52----------
other rand yeah go for it so it's


---------82:55----------
um i don't like to wallow in my own


---------82:59----------
self-pity


---------83:01----------
so yeah like i probably do downplay it


---------83:04----------
yep


---------83:05----------
because i don't want to be that person


---------83:07----------
that becomes fixated on things because


---------83:09----------
i've seen people like that and i've met


---------83:11----------
people like that and they're


---------83:13----------
impossible to be around so now i'm very


---------83:15----------
careful because i never want to become


---------83:17----------
that person


---------83:18----------
and i think social media is overwhelming


---------83:20----------
for all of us


---------83:21----------
sasha when did you stop wallowing in


---------83:23----------
your self-pity


---------83:33----------
i was 15


---------83:38----------
13 14 15 something like that can you


---------83:41----------
tell me about that


---------83:45----------
uh for sure a lot of it this is one of


---------83:48----------
the places where you may want to say no


---------83:50----------
no no it's totally fine um


---------83:54----------
it's just how i was raised


---------83:57----------
and i like that though i like that


---------83:59----------
because it


---------84:01----------
i don't feel like i was um


---------84:05----------
i wasn't given like these concessions


---------84:06----------
that because you're a girl


---------84:09----------
you should be treated differently it was


---------84:11----------
like okay pick yourself up


---------84:13----------
you're done crying


---------84:16----------
take a deep breath life happens


---------84:20----------
move on suck it up and move [ __ ] it up


---------84:23----------
and i and i think that's


---------84:25----------
you know


---------84:29----------
i like that personally it doesn't work


---------84:31----------
on everybody


---------84:32----------
for sure you know but


---------84:36----------
um i think life has enough life throws


---------84:39----------
enough curveballs at you


---------84:40----------
that like there are going to be times


---------84:42----------
where you can't control it


---------84:44----------
so as much as you can it's a good thing


---------84:47----------
to be able to say okay


---------84:49----------
let's move on why do you have to be so


---------84:56----------
strong


---------85:02----------
that's a great question


---------85:15----------
damn you're good


---------85:18----------
i knew i liked you but i was damn


---------85:28----------
the real like really truly


---------85:31----------
i come from a neighborhood where you


---------85:33----------
have to be strong like there are there


---------85:35----------
are no options


---------85:38----------
i know that like that i can give you a


---------85:41----------
very black and white concrete answer on


---------85:46----------
i'd love to hear about that if you feel


---------85:48----------
okay talking about it but


---------85:51----------
um i mean


---------85:54----------
i don't want to talk about it too in


---------85:56----------
depth but um


---------85:58----------
yeah i come from a super disenfranchised


---------86:00----------
neighborhood


---------86:03----------
i think i'll leave it at the fact that


---------86:06----------
like


---------86:11----------
everyone i grew up with it sounds like a


---------86:14----------
movie but like


---------86:17----------
not everyone but a lot of the people i


---------86:19----------
grew up with are either


---------86:28----------
in prison


---------86:33----------
or dead or


---------86:36----------
spun out


---------86:48----------
so that's why i'm strong not why i feel


---------86:51----------
like i have to be strong that's why i


---------86:53----------
know i'm strong


---------86:54----------
and that i can like confidently say


---------86:57----------
without


---------86:58----------
backtracking on it


---------87:04----------
how do you deal with other people being


---------87:07----------
sympathetic towards you


---------87:13----------
if i were to say something like you know


---------87:15----------
i feel sad that you had to grow up in


---------87:16----------
those circumstances


---------87:20----------
how would you


---------87:24----------
i don't like it i don't like it unless i


---------87:27----------
know that they come from


---------87:28----------
a similar situation what do you dislike


---------87:31----------
about it


---------87:38----------
my immediate answer my head was that i


---------87:40----------
don't like pity


---------87:42----------
i don't need your [ __ ] pity i don't i


---------87:45----------
don't want your [ __ ] pity i don't


---------87:47----------
i really don't because i


---------87:50----------
uh like


---------87:53----------
i've made it this far


---------87:58----------
i don't need pity i really don't i have


---------88:00----------
a


---------88:01----------
very small but important


---------88:06----------
number of people in my life that i will


---------88:09----------
lean on


---------88:15----------
i respect you a lot


---------88:18----------
thanks how do you feel about respect


---------88:21----------
from other people


---------88:24----------
that doesn't bother me so much you


---------88:28----------
see this is why they call me like the


---------88:29----------
the uncle thing is starting to


---------88:31----------
come out here too i think


---------88:39----------
i like a lot of feelings i have when i


---------88:41----------
look at them i say like


---------88:42----------
i feel like a lot of very valuable


---------88:46----------
things i learned


---------88:48----------
for the way that i was taught


---------88:51----------
um


---------88:55----------
is usually something that happens with


---------88:56----------
boys


---------88:58----------
what does that mean


---------89:04----------
like i would it goes back to


---------89:07----------
the pity thing like never


---------89:13----------
i don't know i just i feel like some of


---------89:14----------
the really important conversations that


---------89:16----------
i had with my


---------89:18----------
the figures in my life


---------89:22----------
um so i'm crying because i'm thinking


---------89:25----------
about my dad


---------89:29----------
who passed away um


---------89:36----------
you know like i mean it was told to me


---------89:39----------
like you don't have to be treated


---------89:41----------
differently because you're a girl


---------89:48----------
but also like some of these some of


---------89:50----------
these things that were instilled in me


---------89:53----------
i mean i know i know that like other


---------89:56----------
these things weren't being told to other


---------89:58----------
kids or to other girls


---------90:01----------
specifically how do you feel about being


---------90:04----------
treated differently


---------90:07----------
i'm so fortunate


---------90:11----------
i felt lucky how did you feel back then


---------90:16----------
lucky because it was um


---------90:22----------
my womb you know it was my my rock


---------90:28----------
i felt protected by it i felt special


---------90:31----------
and i'm saying that funny because you in


---------90:34----------
a funny way because you


---------90:35----------
asked that earlier but


---------90:40----------
i'm just kind of thinking a little bit


---------90:42----------
about you know a 13 year old or 14 year


---------90:45----------
old girl


---------90:47----------
and who's treated a little bit more like


---------90:49----------
a boy and sees that


---------90:51----------
she's not treated like a girl and i can


---------90:54----------
understand


---------90:54----------
how that's made you into the strong


---------90:58----------
and capable person that you are today


---------91:01----------
and i can also imagine that you know at


---------91:04----------
the age of 14


---------91:06----------
that can be annoying and that there can


---------91:09----------
be a wanting to be


---------91:11----------
like everyone else yeah


---------91:14----------
for sure


---------91:18----------
i'm also kind of noticing a theme of


---------91:20----------
like you know there's


---------91:21----------
you and then there's everyone else like


---------91:23----------
it doesn't sound


---------91:25----------
because when we were talking about you


---------91:26----------
know content creators and what they can


---------91:28----------
get away with and what you can get away


---------91:29----------
with and being shadow banned and


---------91:31----------
i mean there's a very real reality


---------91:34----------
sounds stupid to say but there's a


---------91:37----------
there's a you know there's a very real


---------91:40----------
situation in that you are


---------91:41----------
different right your circumstances


---------91:43----------
you're different the standards against


---------91:45----------
which you're measured


---------91:46----------
is different and i can see that you've


---------91:48----------
sort of like risen to the challenge and


---------91:50----------
you've


---------91:50----------
you've faced it head-on and


---------91:55----------
you know and at the same time like


---------92:00----------
i'm wondering like what happened to that


---------92:02----------
14 year old who just wanted to be a


---------92:04----------
little bit


---------92:06----------
more normal


---------92:12----------
i don't really see it that way how do


---------92:14----------
you see it


---------92:18----------
i i say those things but i like both of


---------92:26----------
i don't know this is interesting because


---------92:28----------
now han i'm going to backtrack because


---------92:31----------
some of my closest friends always told


---------92:33----------
me i was weird


---------92:41----------
maybe there is something there that like


---------92:43----------
you know


---------92:45----------
i noticed recently probably because i


---------92:48----------
have been


---------92:48----------
very disciplined um throughout the


---------92:50----------
pandemic of like


---------92:51----------
not doing anything and not being social


---------92:53----------
except


---------92:54----------
like two little bubbles um


---------92:57----------
so i noticed when i'm just at the


---------92:59----------
grocery store checking out somewhere


---------93:01----------
like i am awkward sometimes


---------93:03----------
yeah but that's maybe a whole different


---------93:05----------
conversation


---------93:06----------
but i don't know i i feel like i was i


---------93:09----------
feel like that's


---------93:10----------
minimal because i still feel like i was


---------93:13----------
pretty


---------93:14----------
okay do you sometimes wish your life was


---------93:18----------
different


---------93:20----------
no help me understand that a little bit


---------93:26----------
because for as difficult as as difficult


---------93:29----------
as


---------93:31----------
thriving can be in a business context


---------93:36----------
i wouldn't want it any other way because


---------93:38----------
i did know from a young age that


---------93:41----------
i didn't want a nine-to-five job


---------93:44----------
so as difficult as it can be i


---------93:48----------
i find that i do tend to thrive in chaos


---------93:52----------
and i do tend to thrive with um you know


---------93:57----------
working in defense can it become


---------94:00----------
exhausting


---------94:01----------
yeah what does that mean worth it in


---------94:03----------
your defense


---------94:05----------
that there's something always pushing


---------94:07----------
against you


---------94:08----------
right


---------94:12----------
so can it can definitely become


---------94:14----------
exhausting


---------94:15----------
sure and that's probably why i can tend


---------94:17----------
to feel overwhelmed


---------94:20----------
for sure


---------94:23----------
but i wouldn't i wouldn't change it


---------94:30----------
can i think for a second yeah


---------94:34----------
can i can i go to the bathroom yeah sure


---------94:37----------
yeah


---------94:38----------
i'm gonna get some water too i'll be


---------94:39----------
right back


---------94:43----------
do we be respectful or do we be helpful


---------94:46----------
i think we're going to have to go with


---------94:48----------
the respectful


---------94:50----------
blue i got cold all right um


---------94:56----------
so i i think uh sasha i was debating


---------94:59----------
about you know whether to take this


---------95:00----------
further i'm leaning against it


---------95:03----------
um so i i know you've been willing at


---------95:06----------
every step of the way to sort of like


---------95:08----------
i've asked a couple times for permission


---------95:10----------
you seem to be like


---------95:11----------
going for it and and i appreciate that


---------95:14----------
but


---------95:15----------
i have a feeling that if i keep on


---------95:16----------
asking you questions you're gonna end up


---------95:18----------
in a place that may be helpful to you


---------95:20----------
but i'm


---------95:21----------
not sure you'll be entirely happy with


---------95:23----------
it


---------95:24----------
okay um


---------95:28----------
i i i want to like so the direction of


---------95:30----------
that those questions have to do with


---------95:32----------
like


---------95:33----------
so here's what i see okay


---------95:36----------
you are a force of nature


---------95:39----------
right not a cult leader um


---------95:43----------
maybe one day and and i i


---------95:47----------
what i'm hearing in in your story is a


---------95:49----------
lot of triumph


---------95:51----------
um but also a healthy amount of


---------95:53----------
adversity


---------95:55----------
and even today i'm hearing like a lot of


---------95:57----------
challenges that you face and you kind of


---------95:59----------
like


---------95:59----------
are your best self when you were you


---------96:02----------
know when


---------96:03----------
when your chips are down like you know


---------96:06----------
you're good at playing on defense you're


---------96:08----------
a survivor you're not just a survivor


---------96:11----------
you like thrive


---------96:12----------
in adverse circumstances like um you


---------96:15----------
know just think about what you said that


---------96:17----------
like most of the people that you grew up


---------96:18----------
with are in prison or


---------96:20----------
are dead like and and here you are you


---------96:23----------
become


---------96:25----------
you know a force to be reckoned with


---------96:28----------
and so i i see a lot of strength and


---------96:30----------
there's a lot there to respect


---------96:36----------
and i think the challenge is that you've


---------96:38----------
become


---------96:39----------
strong it's part of who you are it's


---------96:42----------
part of your identity


---------96:45----------
but i think something was lost somewhere


---------96:47----------
along the way


---------96:49----------
like in that you know like


---------96:55----------
in you becoming a titan you had to kind


---------96:58----------
of like grow up


---------96:59----------
for lack of a better term yeah yeah


---------97:02----------
and and so there's a part of me that


---------97:04----------
does feel some degree of like empathic


---------97:06----------
sadness which i know like really


---------97:08----------
rubs you the wrong way um


---------97:13----------
and there's a part of me that says that


---------97:15----------
like ultimately i i think that


---------97:18----------
what i see as a way forward for you is


---------97:21----------
like


---------97:22----------
being able to accept people's compassion


---------97:24----------
a little bit


---------97:25----------
more


---------97:29----------
you know and i know you hate it


---------97:32----------
and and this can kind of tie to things


---------97:34----------
like so i'm not going to give you more


---------97:35----------
compassion because i think it would be


---------97:37----------
really hard for you to handle


---------97:39----------
um


---------97:43----------
but you know you can look at your story


---------97:45----------
as a story of triumph but i think it's


---------97:48----------
also like a little bit dishonest to just


---------97:50----------
look at it as a story of triumph


---------97:53----------
that there's a lot of hurt a lot of


---------97:55----------
unfortunate stuff


---------97:56----------
a lot of things that


---------98:00----------
you know i would hope that one day


---------98:01----------
you're able to regret some of your


---------98:03----------
decisions


---------98:06----------
you know i know it sounds kind of weird


---------98:08----------
but like i don't think that anyone


---------98:11----------
there's things i regret oh okay


---------98:15----------
don't get me wrong okay don't get me


---------98:18----------
wrong


---------98:19----------
probably not the not like the most


---------98:22----------
obvious ones that people would assume


---------98:24----------
but there are things i definitely regret


---------98:26----------
just not uh


---------98:28----------
let's say like not from um


---------98:32----------
like to be clear as day not from my


---------98:35----------
choice


---------98:35----------
in getting into the adult industry like


---------98:38----------
i want to be clear as days


---------98:39----------
about that because people assume all


---------98:41----------
sorts of stuff so


---------98:43----------
not about that but about a lot of other


---------98:45----------
things yeah i wasn't necessarily


---------98:47----------
referring to anything in particular


---------98:49----------
i didn't think you were either but i for


---------98:51----------
for the


---------98:52----------
for the lurkers to know so sometimes i


---------98:55----------
think that people who


---------98:56----------
you know live lives of strength


---------99:00----------
that a part of that strength requires


---------99:04----------
you to like


---------99:05----------
have no regrets yeah like


---------99:08----------
like and and i i think that ultimately


---------99:10----------
like being a


---------99:11----------
truly like authentic person like we're


---------99:12----------
all human we all screw up we all make


---------99:14----------
mistakes


---------99:16----------
um and i think regret is actually like


---------99:18----------
the avoidance of regret i think actually


---------99:19----------
leads to some amount of toxicity


---------99:22----------
um well you can't grow i don't think


---------99:25----------
yeah it's like you know we learn


---------99:27----------
hopefully learn from our mistakes


---------99:31----------
i i also think that you know if things


---------99:34----------
are


---------99:34----------
unfair for you are we allowed to


---------99:42----------
feel for you there or no


---------99:48----------
yeah yeah of course like i wouldn't


---------99:52----------
what would i what would i say to that


---------99:54----------
you know


---------99:56----------
i'm sorry you're in the situation you're


---------99:57----------
in oh


---------99:59----------
thank you how does that feel for you


---------100:05----------
because i have a certain level of trust


---------100:06----------
with you already


---------100:08----------
um that's


---------100:12----------
that doesn't bother me as much as it


---------100:14----------
would coming from


---------100:16----------
i mean i know we don't know each other


---------100:18----------
in real life but like we have


---------100:20----------
briefly talked in different situations


---------100:23----------
before today so like


---------100:26----------
it doesn't bother me as much as that


---------100:28----------
coming from


---------100:29----------
a total stranger or a friend of a friend


---------100:32----------
i'm gonna try to qualify that statement


---------100:34----------
a little bit more you let me know how it


---------100:36----------
feels okay


---------100:38----------
so sasha i think it sounds really tough


---------100:40----------
to be like


---------100:42----------
so you've made some choices and and i


---------100:44----------
think you


---------100:46----------
i'm happy to hear that you kind of don't


---------100:48----------
regret them let that you've lived this


---------100:49----------
life


---------100:50----------
that has had some challenges and you


---------100:52----------
become the person that you are and the


---------100:53----------
person that you are


---------100:54----------
is analytical capable entrepreneurial


---------100:59----------
dedicated um that you're trying to make


---------101:01----------
the world a better place and i think it


---------101:03----------
really


---------101:04----------
sucks that you're being held to


---------101:07----------
somewhat of an unfair standard that


---------101:10----------
people who talk real big about


---------101:12----------
supporting people and accepting people


---------101:14----------
actually like


---------101:15----------
secretly punish you for particular


---------101:17----------
things


---------101:19----------
and it sounds like really really hard


---------101:22----------
and unfair to be


---------101:24----------
you know in the position you're in and


---------101:26----------
i'm also a little bit afraid


---------101:30----------
of


---------101:32----------
um i'm a little bit afraid that despite


---------101:35----------
the fact that you've come this far


---------101:37----------
that some of the things that you deal


---------101:38----------
with may actually be like insurmountable


---------101:41----------
at some point


---------101:42----------
that you may not be able to walk this


---------101:44----------
tight rope because it seems to me like


---------101:46----------
you're balancing very carefully


---------101:49----------
and so there's a part of me that's


---------101:50----------
afraid that since the tightrope that


---------101:52----------
you're walking is so damn thin and so


---------101:54----------
damn high


---------101:56----------
that like you know i have faith in you


---------102:00----------
and at the same time i'm also terrified


---------102:02----------
for you


---------102:15----------
i mean i guess i could say that i'm i'm


---------102:17----------
like fortunate that i don't feel alone


---------102:19----------
in this


---------102:21----------
that's important you always have to talk


---------102:24----------
about


---------102:25----------
what you have to be grateful for for


---------102:28----------
sure


---------102:32----------
can you talk about the other stuff


---------102:39----------
what what other what do you mean by that


---------102:43----------
what are you feeling right now


---------102:47----------
i just think about like


---------102:57----------
walking a tightrope is an interesting


---------102:59----------
way to put it for sure


---------103:01----------
um but like


---------103:05----------
i'm i i say i'm glad i'm not alone in


---------103:09----------
that because i couldn't do it on


---------103:11----------
my on my own while i might like do


---------103:14----------
the business side of things and i and i


---------103:16----------
feel like i put all these things on my


---------103:17----------
plate


---------103:18----------
i do have the support i need and i know


---------103:21----------
that i'm not alone


---------103:23----------
in experiencing these things as well


---------103:28----------
i know that there are other people i


---------103:30----------
might not know them but i know they


---------103:31----------
exist


---------103:32----------
so i have to keep that perspective


---------103:36----------
to stay strong


---------103:41----------
yeah i don't think you need to stay


---------103:43----------
strong


---------103:47----------
sorry i'm laughing because somebody said


---------103:49----------
she i glanced over somebody said


---------103:51----------
she's not alone she's the coolest


---------103:54----------
yeah not a cult not a cult


---------103:57----------
not yet


---------104:00----------
one day uh once you have a compound


---------104:05----------
right compound you have to call it that


---------104:09----------
welcome to the compound castle gray


---------104:11----------
school um


---------104:14----------
yeah no um


---------104:22----------
and i and i think the this would


---------104:24----------
actually be an interesting


---------104:28----------
or a good moment rather to bring up um


---------104:30----------
parasocial relationships


---------104:32----------
if you have time for that sure let's


---------104:34----------
bring it up because


---------104:36----------
it's something that um like we've


---------104:39----------
touched on


---------104:40----------
on stream before


---------104:43----------
and i think it's something that we're


---------104:47----------
all


---------104:48----------
as a society still learning about and


---------104:51----------
how to deal with it


---------104:55----------
and


---------105:01----------
it's you get her a guitar too it's um


---------105:10----------
like we talk i talk about all these


---------105:14----------
the uphill battles right the defense and


---------105:18----------
thriving but then there is also this


---------105:23----------
great community


---------105:24----------
that i have and that a lot of people


---------105:26----------
have on on their streams as well


---------105:29----------
um so it's interesting to me because i


---------105:31----------
feel like


---------105:34----------
even though there's a few core people


---------105:35----------
and i'm not talking so much about the


---------105:37----------
chat necessarily but like


---------105:39----------
my mods and the people that helped me


---------105:40----------
behind the scenes


---------105:42----------
like we have truly built something


---------105:44----------
special that


---------105:48----------
until today throughout like all of


---------105:50----------
social media


---------105:52----------
all my experience on it has not existed


---------105:55----------
so that's interesting to me um


---------106:03----------
and i'd kind of like to get your


---------106:04----------
perspectives on on that but also just


---------106:07----------
like this relationship that


---------106:09----------
i have with my community and what you


---------106:12----------
think would be the best way


---------106:14----------
like if we see problems how to deal with


---------106:16----------
them because i feel like actually


---------106:19----------
like my mods and i we do sort of


---------106:22----------
walk this tight rope with how to treat


---------106:26----------
people


---------106:26----------
because we do have to be sensitive and


---------106:30----------
sometimes people overstep boundaries


---------106:32----------
where it's very clear you know what to


---------106:34----------
do and you know what needs to be done


---------106:35----------
in other times


---------106:38----------
this it's more difficult to deal with


---------106:43----------
can you give me an example um


---------106:46----------
[Music]


---------106:48----------
people in the past


---------106:53----------
have overstepped


---------106:58----------
boundaries that we've laid out as a


---------107:03----------
community


---------107:04----------
[Music]


---------107:06----------
um


---------107:08----------
in ways that can become really scary and


---------107:10----------
frightening because it tells me that


---------107:13----------
maybe i'm doing something wrong that i'm


---------107:16----------
not


---------107:16----------
delivering a clear enough message that


---------107:19----------
like


---------107:20----------
while i do look forward to seeing people


---------107:23----------
and a lot of


---------107:24----------
people that are in almost every single


---------107:26----------
one of my stream


---------107:27----------
a majority of those people respect the


---------107:29----------
boundaries


---------107:32----------
and sometimes


---------107:38----------
it's almost like an unspoken like


---------107:41----------
sometimes those boundaries feel like an


---------107:42----------
unspoken


---------107:44----------
um they feel unspoken you know like we


---------107:49----------
we know what to expect the majority of


---------107:52----------
people know what to expect


---------107:54----------
and every so often there are people that


---------107:56----------
that don't know but then of course like


---------107:58----------
we have the mods that they do make it


---------108:00----------
clear like


---------108:02----------
to not do certain things right whether


---------108:03----------
it's on twitch or on


---------108:05----------
on discord after the fact but um


---------108:09----------
i get i don't know if it's so much of a


---------108:11----------
purse


---------108:13----------
like for me specifically but as a whole


---------108:15----------
like where do you see this going as a


---------108:17----------
society like


---------108:18----------
how do we so how do we send a positive


---------108:22----------
message but also like know when to cut


---------108:24----------
it off


---------108:25----------
so sasha can you define for me what a


---------108:27----------
parasocial relationship


---------108:29----------
is yes um


---------108:32----------
in the case of i'll give myself as an


---------108:35----------
example here


---------108:36----------
i'm here i represent something to the


---------108:40----------
people


---------108:41----------
that watch my streams


---------108:46----------
but the relationship is not reciprocated


---------108:50----------
in a way that our irl relationship would


---------108:53----------
be


---------108:53----------
right like i am not friends with these


---------108:57----------
people in real life


---------108:58----------
i am friendly with them but i don't


---------109:01----------
actually know them


---------109:05----------
um


---------109:08----------
and so what what i'm hearing is that it


---------109:10----------
has some of the attributes


---------109:12----------
of a real-life relationship but


---------109:15----------
by virtue of it being an online


---------109:17----------
relationship there's something like you


---------109:18----------
know it doesn't translate a hundred


---------109:20----------
percent


---------109:22----------
so yeah exactly you know you can start


---------109:24----------
to appreciate other people


---------109:26----------
interact with them they have their own


---------109:27----------
personalities some of them are trolls


---------109:29----------
some of them are funny some of them are


---------109:31----------
compassionate


---------109:32----------
and so you can communicate with them you


---------109:33----------
can interact with them you can form some


---------109:35----------
kind of relationship with them


---------109:39----------
but it's not it doesn't come with


---------109:42----------
everything


---------109:43----------
that a real social relationship comes


---------109:45----------
with yeah i i shouldn't even say real


---------109:47----------
social because i think it's just a


---------109:48----------
different kind of


---------109:50----------
an in-person social relationship and


---------109:53----------
that there are some


---------109:55----------
most people tend to sort of understand


---------109:58----------
that there are some unspoken boundaries


---------110:00----------
but that some people really don't


---------110:01----------
understand those boundaries


---------110:05----------
so this is where we've talked with


---------110:07----------
several streamers about parasocial


---------110:09----------
relationships and i have some thoughts


---------110:11----------
but i think what's really missing from


---------110:13----------
this conversation is what we really need


---------110:15----------
to do is get


---------110:16----------
i don't know if this is you know tos


---------110:19----------
friendly but like


---------110:20----------
i think the the if we really want to


---------110:21----------
understand parasocial relationships we


---------110:23----------
have to understand the other side of the


---------110:24----------
story too


---------110:26----------
so this is where like you know i think


---------110:29----------
that like


---------110:30----------
understanding what is in the mind of


---------110:32----------
someone who does not respect a boundary


---------110:35----------
is very important like that's the


---------110:38----------
missing part of the equation for me


---------110:41----------
right so like like and this is where i


---------110:44----------
think we've had


---------110:45----------
you know some we've had some people on


---------110:48----------
stream that have


---------110:49----------
certainly posted on our subreddit and


---------110:51----------
stuff about like you know


---------110:54----------
feeling lonely and and giving lots of


---------110:57----------
money to particular content creators


---------111:00----------
in the hopes that um you know it'll


---------111:03----------
it'll they're looking to fill some kind


---------111:07----------
of void or connection


---------111:09----------
and and so so we we have some experience


---------111:13----------
with this but i think that's just an


---------111:14----------
important part of the equation


---------111:16----------
um but let me ask you i mean what do you


---------111:19----------
think is gonna happen


---------111:22----------
like what do you what do you think


---------111:27----------
i don't know i mean


---------111:33----------
like i said i i tried


---------111:37----------
removing try i do my best to


---------111:41----------
be clear about these things on stream we


---------111:43----------
create


---------111:44----------
commands uh that like guests can use and


---------111:48----------
that moderators can use but that's only


---------111:50----------
in my i can only control what


---------111:53----------
or you know try to control or observe


---------111:56----------
and and


---------111:57----------
cultivate the community that i have not


---------112:00----------
other people's


---------112:02----------
um so i think


---------112:06----------
i think twitch is cool because we have


---------112:08----------
all these tools at our disposal so


---------112:10----------
um it makes it a lot cleaner


---------112:14----------
and makes the rules um


---------112:18----------
you know the rules are there they're up


---------112:20----------
front


---------112:21----------
we're not hiding things from people um


---------112:24----------
but you go on other forms of social


---------112:26----------
media and a lot of people don't do that


---------112:27----------
and or it's impossible because those


---------112:29----------
tools don't exist on other forms of


---------112:30----------
social media


---------112:32----------
um


---------112:36----------
yeah it's it's i i guess a question too


---------112:40----------
i have is just like


---------112:43----------
am i doing enough to make those things


---------112:47----------
clear i i don't know i don't know what


---------112:50----------
you're should it


---------112:52----------
should we


---------112:56----------
just look let me yeah let me take a stab


---------112:59----------
at this okay so can i just share like


---------113:01----------
some thoughts about how i understand


---------113:02----------
parasocial relationships


---------113:05----------
and what we need to do about it so like


---------113:08----------
the first thing is that i think that


---------113:09----------
from a neuroscience perspective there's


---------113:12----------
a reason why these things are happening


---------113:14----------
so as human beings we tend to like


---------113:16----------
associate


---------113:18----------
things with other things i know it


---------113:19----------
sounds like such a simple


---------113:21----------
sentence but you know so for example


---------113:25----------
um you know a classic thing that we'll


---------113:27----------
kind of get into is like


---------113:28----------
being friend zoned or [ __ ] zoned right


---------113:31----------
where like


---------113:33----------
there'll be and it's usually like a dude


---------113:34----------
who gets friend-zoned i'd say like most


---------113:36----------
of the cases i hear about


---------113:38----------
tend to be with men and i think there's


---------113:39----------
actually like a a neuroscientific and


---------113:42----------
like


---------113:42----------
developmental reason for that i don't i


---------113:44----------
don't think it's it's not the y


---------113:46----------
chromosome it's more that


---------113:47----------
you know men tend to be socialized to


---------113:51----------
expect emotional intimacy and only is


---------113:54----------
a very small number of cases so


---------113:57----------
emotional


---------113:58----------
intimacy is okay with mom usually


---------114:01----------
not even okay with sisters not okay with


---------114:04----------
brothers oftentimes not okay with dad


---------114:08----------
maybe like emotional intimacy is okay


---------114:09----------
with grandma


---------114:11----------
and then like romantic partners so those


---------114:13----------
are the people


---------114:14----------
with whom i'm allowed to feel social


---------114:16----------
like we're like coded that way we're


---------114:18----------
programmed yeah


---------114:19----------
and so oftentimes what happens is is if


---------114:22----------
you look at


---------114:23----------
you know i may i'm not trying to offend


---------114:25----------
anyone it's just general anecdotal


---------114:27----------
observations and a little bit of data to


---------114:28----------
back this up but frankly not very much


---------114:31----------
i think the way that um you know girls


---------114:34----------
are raised or were


---------114:35----------
raised was different right so there's


---------114:37----------
more emotional intimacy within


---------114:39----------
friendships there


---------114:40----------
and so then you get into this situation


---------114:42----------
where like i you know


---------114:44----------
working with the people that i have what


---------114:45----------
i've noticed is that


---------114:47----------
emotional intimacy between a man and a


---------114:50----------
woman in their early 20s


---------114:51----------
means different things yeah so for the


---------114:54----------
woman it's like completely acceptable to


---------114:56----------
have a friend that you emotionally


---------114:58----------
confide in


---------114:59----------
and for a dude it can be really


---------115:00----------
confusing because they're they're kind


---------115:02----------
of like


---------115:04----------
it's they're under the impression


---------115:05----------
whether it's correct or incorrect or


---------115:07----------
programmed or genetic i have no idea


---------115:09----------
but somewhere along the way they have


---------115:10----------
this programming in their mind that if


---------115:12----------
i'm emotionally intimate with someone


---------115:14----------
that also comes with feelings of romance


---------115:16----------
and sex


---------115:18----------
and so there's kind of like a


---------115:19----------
communication breakdown here


---------115:21----------
a breakdown of expectations and i think


---------115:24----------
something similar happens in parasocial


---------115:26----------
relationships


---------115:27----------
so what happens is our brains are wired


---------115:29----------
to associate


---------115:31----------
certain things with other things like


---------115:33----------
for example


---------115:34----------
a hundred years ago if i had an inside


---------115:37----------
joke with someone


---------115:39----------
what other things would i have with them


---------115:43----------
the short answer is a lot right because


---------115:46----------
an inside joke is


---------115:47----------
only possible when there are other like


---------115:50----------
check marks of a relationship that have


---------115:51----------
developed like i have to see them for a


---------115:53----------
while


---------115:54----------
i have to be to a certain degree like


---------115:55----------
vulnerable like we have to have like


---------115:57----------
some kind of common cause or like


---------115:59----------
you know like inside jokes come with a


---------116:01----------
certain


---------116:02----------
if you think about when do you unlock


---------116:04----------
the inside joke in a relationship


---------116:06----------
you unlock it like after you're at a


---------116:09----------
high level of friendship


---------116:11----------
yeah you know and and it reminds me this


---------116:13----------
like funny quote from the office where


---------116:16----------
where michael scott i don't know if


---------116:17----------
you've watched the office and he kind of


---------116:19----------
talks about the


---------116:20----------
inside jokes and he's like i've always


---------116:21----------
wanted to be a part of one


---------116:23----------
you know and and it's kind of like this


---------116:26----------
this idea that like an inside joke


---------116:28----------
comes with other stuff yeah we sort of


---------116:31----------
programmed that way and so enter twitch


---------116:32----------
chat


---------116:33----------
where like now we have inside jokes but


---------116:35----------
it doesn't seem to be coming with the


---------116:37----------
other stuff


---------116:39----------
yes and so i think people start to get


---------116:41----------
like kind of


---------116:42----------
i don't know if confused is the right


---------116:44----------
word but there's like kind of like a


---------116:45----------
programming does not compute error


---------116:47----------
because usually when i have an


---------116:49----------
inside joke with them it also means that


---------116:52----------
like i'm allowed to text them at any


---------116:54----------
hour of the day


---------116:55----------
right right like there are certain


---------116:57----------
associations that come


---------116:59----------
and so i think what happens with social


---------117:00----------
media is that like we're finding ways to


---------117:03----------
like short-circuit some of our


---------117:04----------
programming


---------117:05----------
or like hijack actually hijack is a


---------117:08----------
maybe a better word


---------117:09----------
hijack some of our programming and


---------117:11----------
certainly video games do do this


---------117:12----------
neuroscientifically where like


---------117:13----------
if we think about the drive for


---------117:15----------
achievement so we have this thing called


---------117:18----------
um the intent to mastery


---------117:21----------
which is a very very simple hard wired


---------117:25----------
core of your brain kind of thing which


---------117:27----------
is like if i have a


---------117:28----------
six month or four month old and i hand


---------117:31----------
them a ball


---------117:32----------
they will try to hold it and if they


---------117:35----------
drop it


---------117:35----------
what do they do


---------117:38----------
any idea huh cry right


---------117:43----------
sure the answer i was looking for well


---------117:45----------
that's a fair one


---------117:46----------
the answer that i was looking for is


---------117:48----------
they pick it up right so like


---------117:50----------
like if a kid stumbles like they're


---------117:52----------
gonna like everyone learns how to walk


---------117:54----------
right like no one


---------117:56----------
no one like gives up on learning how to


---------117:57----------
walk if you think about it it's like


---------117:59----------
really really hard you fall


---------118:01----------
over and over and over again so like we


---------118:03----------
have this


---------118:04----------
hard-wired part of our mind that's like


---------118:06----------
i want to get better at this


---------118:08----------
i need to get better at this and i have


---------118:09----------
to become a master


---------118:11----------
and then if you look at video games what


---------118:12----------
video games have done is like let's give


---------118:13----------
people like


---------118:14----------
achievements that they can grind for a


---------118:16----------
decade


---------118:18----------
and it kind of taps into that


---------118:20----------
neuroscience circuit of like wanting to


---------118:22----------
master something


---------118:23----------
which if we didn't have this part of our


---------118:25----------
brain like we wouldn't learn how to walk


---------118:27----------
yeah right and and so in the parasocial


---------118:30----------
way i think we have a similar


---------118:32----------
hijacking going on where like now you


---------118:34----------
have some degrees of intimacy like now


---------118:37----------
sasha like there are people watching at


---------118:38----------
home


---------118:39----------
that despite you know all of our best


---------118:43----------
efforts and i probably i mean honestly


---------118:45----------
sometimes you caught me off guard i


---------118:46----------
really can't blame myself but sometimes


---------118:48----------
i had a feeling


---------118:49----------
i knew what was gonna happen if i asked


---------118:51----------
you a question


---------118:52----------
and so they've seen a vulnerable part of


---------118:54----------
you and so what's that gonna trigger


---------118:56----------
in their mind right like normally like


---------118:59----------
when do i get to see


---------119:00----------
someone bear their vulnerable self it


---------119:03----------
comes at a certain tier of relationship


---------119:06----------
and so now like in some brands out there


---------119:09----------
we've unlocked that reward but the


---------119:13----------
underlying foundation of the


---------119:14----------
relationship is not there


---------119:16----------
and that's what gets confusing for


---------119:17----------
people because at this point they feel


---------119:19----------
like they know you


---------119:21----------
sasha yeah they know you so well


---------119:25----------
and they're not exactly wrong right


---------119:27----------
because they do know


---------119:28----------
some things about you and there's a lot


---------119:30----------
of authenticity and i think part of what


---------119:31----------
makes you like a successful content


---------119:33----------
creator


---------119:34----------
a successful personality is sure you've


---------119:36----------
got a mask but i think you know how to


---------119:39----------
let enough of the authenticity bleed


---------119:41----------
through


---------119:42----------
right i don't think you have to pretend


---------119:44----------
to have fun like i think you genuinely


---------119:46----------
enjoy doing some right things that you


---------119:48----------
do and there's like


---------119:49----------
there's like a calculated authenticity


---------119:51----------
there and so when people


---------119:52----------
see that calculated authenticity it's


---------119:54----------
still an authentic there's an


---------119:56----------
authenticity there's an


---------119:57----------
intimacy to it and then that triggers


---------120:00----------
like


---------120:00----------
certain neurological or like


---------120:03----------
sociological like programming


---------120:06----------
and then some people are able to


---------120:08----------
navigate that


---------120:11----------
activation of that programming pretty


---------120:13----------
well and they know how to respect a


---------120:14----------
boundary


---------120:15----------
and some people get a little bit more


---------120:18----------
confused yeah and i think that's why


---------120:22----------
parasocial relationships happen


---------120:25----------
and and it's interesting because you you


---------120:27----------
know there is a certain like connection


---------120:29----------
to your community even that you feel


---------120:31----------
right like oh


---------120:32----------
100 right so so like if we think about


---------120:35----------
you know why is that happening it's


---------120:36----------
because the same thing is happening in


---------120:38----------
your mind that when you're vulnerable


---------120:40----------
and everyone sends hearts you know in


---------120:42----------
the chat


---------120:43----------
and then it's like there's a certain


---------120:44----------
part of you that feels like


---------120:46----------
accepted appreciated loved you know


---------120:49----------
and then like it's sort of like like and


---------120:52----------
then


---------120:53----------
there are some streamers who


---------120:56----------
let the confusion get the better of them


---------120:58----------
and there are some streamers who


---------121:00----------
maintain boundaries


---------121:02----------
right yeah and then like there are some


---------121:03----------
streamers and then we had um


---------121:05----------
i think we had someone on


---------121:08----------
like over a year ago who was like a mod


---------121:11----------
in someone's community and then the


---------121:12----------
person got really big


---------121:14----------
and then they felt like they were owed


---------121:17----------
more


---------121:18----------
and like felt like they got abandoned


---------121:20----------
and left behind and all


---------121:21----------
they sacrificed a lot to like you know


---------121:23----------
bring this person like


---------121:25----------
help this person succeed and then they


---------121:26----------
felt like they were discarded afterward


---------121:28----------
and things like that


---------121:29----------
um so i think there are some streamers


---------121:32----------
that you know will


---------121:34----------
muddy that boundary a little bit like


---------121:36----------
i'm still confused about


---------121:39----------
what happens when


---------121:42----------
like do you ever like what happens when


---------121:44----------
you see people from your


---------121:45----------
chat at twitchcon you know i've actually


---------121:49----------
never been to twitchcon


---------121:50----------
either have i so i don't know but i've


---------121:52----------
been to other


---------121:53----------
you know i've i dj well pandemic i


---------121:56----------
haven't dj in a long time but i dj


---------121:58----------
but there's a different boundary there


---------122:00----------
too because most of the time


---------122:02----------
i'm on a stage you know i'm separa i'm


---------122:04----------
physically separated


---------122:05----------
but then sometimes it's like the club


---------122:07----------
asks you to do um


---------122:09----------
like autographs afterwards you know or


---------122:11----------
take some pictures


---------122:13----------
um so even then that feels boundary to


---------122:17----------
me right because it's sort of like


---------122:18----------
you're there as a dj but like i i don't


---------122:21----------
i don't know like what would happen you


---------122:22----------
know if you run into someone on the


---------122:24----------
street


---------122:26----------
and uh i'm


---------122:29----------
like it depends how people approach me


---------122:31----------
really okay i have a


---------122:33----------
i'm pretty sensitive to things so like


---------122:35----------
if if they feel


---------122:36----------
safe to me and they're respectful


---------122:40----------
i'm pretty open but like if i'm


---------122:46----------
talking to somebody and eating


---------122:49----------
a pasta or eating a taco and this has


---------122:52----------
happened and you put a camera in my face


---------122:54----------
like that's you know that


---------122:56----------
that's not okay yeah of course


---------123:00----------
but if you like if you're respectful in


---------123:02----------
your approach it's it changes my


---------123:04----------
attitude for sure um


---------123:09----------
so so just going back to the parasocial


---------123:11----------
relationship i think it like it comes


---------123:12----------
down to like the fact that this


---------123:15----------
relationship checks some of the boxes


---------123:19----------
from a normal relationship and i even


---------123:22----------
hesitate to


---------123:23----------
to because you asked me the question


---------123:24----------
what's going to happen i hesitate to use


---------123:26----------
the word normal because i think what


---------123:27----------
we're gonna


---------123:28----------
what we're gonna discover is like you


---------123:30----------
know back in the day there was like


---------123:32----------
marriage


---------123:32----------
and then there was like people getting


---------123:34----------
engaged and then you have a girlfriend


---------123:35----------
and so like


---------123:36----------
like you know in india the concept of a


---------123:38----------
girlfriend was


---------123:39----------
is not it wasn't existent


---------123:42----------
yeah like i remember telling my mom so i


---------123:45----------
hid my girlfriend from my mom for years


---------123:48----------
and then like telling her like oh yeah


---------123:50----------
she's my girlfriend and she was like


---------123:52----------
she's your friend and i'm like no she's


---------123:54----------
my girlfriend and she's like


---------123:56----------
does that mean that you're getting


---------123:58----------
married and i was like


---------124:01----------
no and then she was like wait i'm


---------124:02----------
confused


---------124:04----------
what's the point of having a girlfriend


---------124:05----------
if you're not gonna get married


---------124:07----------
yeah and it was just like it's like a


---------124:10----------
new construction that is not like did


---------124:12----------
not exist


---------124:13----------
before right and she was just like so


---------124:15----------
confused because she's like


---------124:17----------
there are friendships and there are


---------124:18----------
marriages and there's nothing in between


---------124:21----------
yeah and so now what's happening is


---------124:23----------
there's like a real life relationship


---------124:25----------
and there's a parasocial relationship


---------124:27----------
and i think both of those are going to


---------124:29----------
become


---------124:30----------
like new versions of stuff right now


---------124:32----------
there are open relationships and friends


---------124:34----------
with benefits and there are


---------124:35----------
so many different things that like like


---------124:37----------
if you think about friends with benefits


---------124:39----------
that's an example of like


---------124:40----------
it used to be that sexual activity came


---------124:43----------
with certain stuff


---------124:45----------
and now people have evolved to say that


---------124:47----------
okay we can have


---------124:48----------
sexual activity without the other stuff


---------124:50----------
you can have friendship and sexual


---------124:52----------
activity


---------124:53----------
and so i my sense is that the parasocial


---------124:55----------
relationship is


---------124:56----------
has already become a thing and it will


---------124:58----------
continue to become a thing


---------125:00----------
and and even as social media gets more


---------125:03----------
sophisticated it will become more of a


---------125:04----------
thing because i think what social media


---------125:06----------
platforms are discovering


---------125:07----------
is that the the stronger the parasocial


---------125:10----------
relationship


---------125:10----------
probably the higher the user engagement


---------125:15----------
well it's yeah it's interesting these


---------125:16----------
things like you said these things have


---------125:18----------
always existed it's the same with like


---------125:23----------
i mean going to see somebody at a


---------125:24----------
concert right


---------125:26----------
yeah i mean there's this thing still


---------125:30----------
does exist


---------125:31----------
but with social media and specifically


---------125:34----------
with a live


---------125:35----------
interaction it totally changes the game


---------125:38----------
yeah so i think i think the


---------125:39----------
the sorry to cut cut you off there but i


---------125:42----------
just wanted to like


---------125:43----------
completely echo your point because i


---------125:44----------
think that if you think about the brain


---------125:47----------
right like if i


---------125:48----------
you know if i'm a huge fan of like pearl


---------125:51----------
jam


---------125:52----------
and and like i can listen to this dude's


---------125:55----------
music and i can feel really connected to


---------125:56----------
them like


---------125:57----------
there is there's only so much stuff in


---------126:00----------
my brain


---------126:00----------
that gets checked yeah and then like if


---------126:04----------
i see him at a concert then like more


---------126:06----------
stuff gets checked and just like you


---------126:07----------
said with live interaction like


---------126:09----------
what someone can do sasha is they can


---------126:12----------
talk to you and you will respond to them


---------126:15----------
yeah right and when someone when someone


---------126:18----------
comes and talks to you


---------126:20----------
on a regular basis and you respond to


---------126:22----------
them


---------126:23----------
and you guys joke together and then like


---------126:27----------
you


---------126:28----------
come on our stream and you share some


---------126:30----------
stuff and now they


---------126:31----------
know you more and they feel like they


---------126:34----------
really know you like they're like it's


---------126:36----------
they're not wrong right like they're


---------126:37----------
they're checking these boxes


---------126:39----------
of a relationship consistency inside


---------126:42----------
jokes


---------126:43----------
laughing together having a good time


---------126:44----------
together being there


---------126:46----------
remember when dot dot dot remember that


---------126:49----------
time


---------126:50----------
and then like if you think about what's


---------126:51----------
a real relationship like those are all


---------126:53----------
of the check boxes


---------126:56----------
so i think it's going to get in a sense


---------126:58----------
quote unquote worse


---------126:59----------
but i think that parasocial because


---------127:01----------
people are going to figure out how to


---------127:02----------
have like more interaction


---------127:04----------
right like we're going to figure out how


---------127:06----------
to you know we're going to have like


---------127:07----------
more inside jokes and we're going to


---------127:08----------
have like


---------127:09----------
like emotes and we're going to have more


---------127:11----------
stuff that can be like this is because


---------127:12----------
like i think a big part of the


---------127:13----------
parasocial relationship is


---------127:15----------
it's ours sasha it's not yours it's it's


---------127:17----------
not mine it's ours


---------127:21----------
i like that too yep like i do get


---------127:24----------
something out of that


---------127:25----------
it does make me happy and like i find


---------127:28----------
myself


---------127:31----------
telling my irl friends and family


---------127:34----------
things that happen on stream all the


---------127:36----------
time like it does become


---------127:39----------
a sure very important part of my life so


---------127:40----------
now we begin to see that there is


---------127:42----------
actually some degree of reciprocity


---------127:45----------
right that it's not just one way that


---------127:48----------
like they're making you


---------127:49----------
laugh and you're making them laugh yeah


---------127:52----------
that when they're having a bad day


---------127:55----------
diogray shows up and when you're having


---------127:58----------
a bad day maybe the more observant


---------128:00----------
members of your chat notice and they


---------128:02----------
send you some


---------128:03----------
support and there's like absolutely a


---------128:05----------
reciprocity


---------128:07----------
yeah now as to what to do about it


---------128:11----------
i think also because sorry to cut you


---------128:14----------
off but i don't want to forget like


---------128:16----------
i i see people or


---------128:20----------
not just on twitch but um on other


---------128:23----------
platforms as well like call people their


---------128:26----------
besties


---------128:27----------
or call them um


---------128:31----------
or or like say i love you


---------128:35----------
yeah you mean the creators or the


---------128:39----------
yeah yeah yeah the creators saying that


---------128:42----------
to their community


---------128:43----------
i mean they're like again there are a


---------128:47----------
few people that i've actually


---------128:48----------
become internet friends with that i do


---------128:51----------
love like i have love for them even


---------128:52----------
though i've never met them


---------128:54----------
but then there's the actual chat side of


---------128:56----------
things that


---------128:58----------
that in my opinion becomes so dangerous


---------129:02----------
what's dangerous about it i think it


---------129:05----------
sets


---------129:06----------
it it's


---------129:10----------
it's raw it feels wrong on so many


---------129:12----------
levels


---------129:13----------
what feels wrong about it


---------129:18----------
i'm probably speaking i mean it makes me


---------129:21----------
think of just my own experiences like


---------129:22----------
i've dealt with


---------129:24----------
real stalkers irl and cyber stalkers


---------129:28----------
so i know what being online


---------129:32----------
what the territory is you know what


---------129:34----------
comes with being online


---------129:35----------
and that is one of the very negative


---------129:37----------
side effects of it


---------129:38----------
or hopefully not for everybody but it


---------129:40----------
can be a very negative side effect


---------129:42----------
and i feel like that kind of


---------129:46----------
sometimes there feels like this


---------129:47----------
overabundance of um


---------129:51----------
fake positivity and i see it a lot and


---------129:54----------
also in people that like


---------129:55----------
we're gonna manifest this and while


---------129:57----------
that's all great you also have to


---------129:59----------
remember like that


---------130:00----------
life throws things at us and we have to


---------130:01----------
be prepared to deal with those things


---------130:03----------
when we


---------130:03----------
when we don't get what we manifested


---------130:05----------
right and i feel like


---------130:07----------
setting up a community by telling them


---------130:09----------
that you love them


---------130:10----------
and then that and that they are your


---------130:13----------
best


---------130:14----------
friends i think it's unfair to those


---------130:17----------
people


---------130:19----------
but it's well i i think the real


---------130:22----------
challenge there is that for some


---------130:23----------
streamers they


---------130:24----------
really do feel that way


---------130:28----------
right so i think that a lot of streamers


---------130:30----------
are lonely


---------130:33----------
and that some of the best connections


---------130:35----------
that they do feel


---------130:37----------
are like with their chat yeah


---------130:40----------
and i think that there's a lot of


---------130:42----------
because you know i'm not trying to


---------130:44----------
i recognize i'm sort of disagreeing i


---------130:46----------
agree that it's unhealthy but


---------130:48----------
but i think that like we have to


---------130:49----------
understand that


---------130:51----------
real-life relationships are complicated


---------130:55----------
and part of what's happening


---------130:58----------
and and part of what's nice about like


---------131:01----------
you know these relationships that you


---------131:02----------
have with people online is it's like


---------131:04----------
it it can be so much more simple


---------131:08----------
yeah much cleaner so much more fun


---------131:10----------
[Laughter]


---------131:12----------
yeah none of the baggage you're right


---------131:15----------
it's like i'm gonna we're just gonna


---------131:16----------
hang out and chat we're gonna be vibing


---------131:18----------
and then there's something


---------131:19----------
in your brain that's like why would i


---------131:21----------
want to hang out with real people who


---------131:23----------
are just so


---------131:24----------
filled with drama when i can just be


---------131:25----------
vibing with twitch chat and that's just


---------131:27----------
like


---------131:28----------
i feel it i absolutely feel it right


---------131:31----------
yeah


---------131:32----------
so yeah i think our brain gets confused


---------131:35----------
yeah or that the signals mean different


---------131:37----------
things now


---------131:40----------
right and and it's hard because like if


---------131:42----------
you really think about it i mean a lot


---------131:44----------
of like you know a lot of


---------131:45----------
online support can be so


---------131:49----------
um i mean i i see this a lot


---------131:53----------
i i suspect that a lot of that streaming


---------131:57----------
actually


---------131:58----------
cultivates almost a particular kind of


---------132:00----------
like mental illness called borderline


---------132:02----------
personality disorder


---------132:04----------
where like like this is uh this is a


---------132:06----------
kind of


---------132:07----------
illness where i mean it's not it's an


---------132:10----------
illness we call it that but


---------132:12----------
it's something where like your sense of


---------132:14----------
worth is determined by the way that


---------132:15----------
you're treated that's basically the way


---------132:17----------
that i kind of think about it


---------132:19----------
and so i think that when our brains are


---------132:21----------
exposed to


---------132:22----------
a lot of judgment that's how people sort


---------132:25----------
of get borderline personality disorder


---------132:26----------
they sort of like get traumatized or


---------132:28----------
abandoned early in life


---------132:30----------
and then i think like essentially what


---------132:31----------
the internet does is like cultivates


---------132:33----------
that same kind of growth


---------132:36----------
because we get exposed to so much


---------132:37----------
judgment and the interesting thing is


---------132:39----------
that if you have that vulnerability


---------132:42----------
a lot of times people with bpd feel


---------132:44----------
really good about themselves when people


---------132:46----------
treat them well


---------132:47----------
and so now you suddenly have this source


---------132:50----------
of like you can


---------132:53----------
you know call to the


---------132:56----------
internet and the internet will answer


---------132:59----------
your call


---------133:00----------
and shower you with love and support


---------133:04----------
and and we'll say like no you are


---------133:06----------
wonderful like we do love you you're


---------133:08----------
fantastic


---------133:09----------
and if you have that kind of emotional


---------133:11----------
need


---------133:12----------
and you become like you know you can


---------133:14----------
kind of tap into it and i don't really


---------133:15----------
blame the people because it's like it's


---------133:16----------
their brain right they're like


---------133:18----------
they're looking to feel a certain way


---------133:20----------
and the internet can help them feel that


---------133:21----------
way


---------133:23----------
so i think it's going to get in a sense


---------133:26----------
worse but i also think that there


---------133:28----------
are certain things that we're gonna have


---------133:30----------
to do like we're gonna have to evolve as


---------133:32----------
humans


---------133:33----------
to deal with this um and this is where


---------133:36----------
you know personally i'd like to spend


---------133:38----------
more time with people who are


---------133:40----------
on the other side of the social


---------133:43----------
relationship


---------133:44----------
yeah right like talk to people and be


---------133:46----------
like you know how does it feel and then


---------133:48----------
like hopefully through that


---------133:49----------
as many people listen they'll be like oh


---------133:51----------
crap


---------133:52----------
that sounds like me like i do that too


---------133:55----------
and then


---------133:56----------
we'll sort of start to understand and


---------133:57----------
like hopefully help those people because


---------133:59----------
i i don't in a sense like


---------134:01----------
i blame them kind of if they violate


---------134:02----------
boundaries and don't respect things like


---------134:04----------
i think that's you know you should be


---------134:05----------
held accountable for your actions


---------134:07----------
but also as someone who has you know


---------134:10----------
worked in prisons and stuff like that i


---------134:12----------
i've i've come to appreciate that


---------134:15----------
you know the psychological drives that


---------134:18----------
cause us to do


---------134:20----------
bad things probably can


---------134:24----------
be helped in some way so like i'm all


---------134:27----------
for like punishing a crime but at the


---------134:29----------
same time like rehabilitating the


---------134:31----------
criminal


---------134:31----------
absolutely absolutely um


---------134:34----------
so you're calling twitch you're calling


---------134:37----------
chat criminals


---------134:38----------
i'm


---------134:42----------
i'm sorry to ruin a good moment but i


---------134:44----------
just i couldn't let that joke


---------134:46----------
go somebody else was gonna do it if i


---------134:49----------
didn't do it


---------134:50----------
i think i think there are a lot of


---------134:52----------
things but i don't think criminal is one


---------134:53----------
of them no no no i'm joking i'm joking


---------134:55----------
i'm just joking


---------134:56----------
you have to have some humor in there but


---------134:58----------
yeah it's fast it's really fascinating


---------135:02----------
yeah i mean i i was about to ask you you


---------135:06----------
know if there's someone in your


---------135:07----------
community


---------135:08----------
yeah but i don't think we should do that


---------135:10----------
but you know i think like


---------135:11----------
like in general we should think about


---------135:13----------
having people who


---------135:14----------
are on the other side of a parasocial


---------135:16----------
relationship like


---------135:18----------
you know we've done that a little bit on


---------135:20----------
stream i think it's something we could


---------135:21----------
do more


---------135:22----------
but i think we have to understand like


---------135:23----------
what's going on in these people's heads


---------135:25----------
like


---------135:25----------
probably explain to them i mean explain


---------135:28----------
makes it sound like you know we have all


---------135:29----------
the answers but


---------135:30----------
i think kind of try to figure out like


---------135:32----------
we because we have to do something


---------135:34----------
and so the la i guess so there's a


---------135:36----------
systems perspective right where you can


---------135:38----------
sort of


---------135:39----------
equip tools and things like that um


---------135:42----------
but there's also i think like a very


---------135:44----------
human component to it that we have to


---------135:46----------
explore


---------135:46----------
that's just the lens that i look at


---------135:50----------
yeah i mean i think it'd be cool in the


---------135:52----------
future um


---------135:54----------
to see if anybody from my community


---------135:56----------
would be open to talking about that


---------135:59----------
as well i think that obvious not i think


---------136:03----------
we all have been able to observe that


---------136:05----------
the pandemic has only made things worse


---------136:06----------
because it's forced us


---------136:08----------
inside and for some of us that are


---------136:10----------
already maybe more introverted


---------136:12----------
myself included i mean i'm i'm i'm


---------136:15----------
i'm somewhere in the middle like i have


---------136:16----------
no problem being


---------136:19----------
alone you know um


---------136:23----------
but for this period of time it's a


---------136:25----------
different story so


---------136:26----------
we've all been feeling that isolation


---------136:29----------
even if we do have


---------136:30----------
family you know even if we do have


---------136:34----------
a support system but


---------136:38----------
it's it's really fascinating and i feel


---------136:40----------
like now though


---------136:41----------
um personally


---------136:44----------
between myself and my mods we've


---------136:47----------
we've sort of been able to now identify


---------136:49----------
like red flags


---------136:51----------
um it took a while it took a while like


---------136:54----------
longer than you would probably think but


---------136:56----------
i


---------136:56----------
i also i know part of that is that we've


---------136:58----------
been we've tried to be very


---------137:00----------
gentle with people to understand that


---------137:02----------
maybe somebody is


---------137:03----------
suffering from mental health issues or


---------137:04----------
things like this so we want to tread


---------137:06----------
lightly and be careful but


---------137:09----------
now we've sort of been able to identify


---------137:12----------
certain behaviors where


---------137:13----------
we understand that it's easier to cut it


---------137:16----------
off


---------137:18----------
right when you see it happening uh i


---------137:20----------
mean i i think it could be very


---------137:22----------
educational if you would share with us


---------137:24----------
what those red flags might be but at the


---------137:26----------
same time


---------137:27----------
i feel like that could be a mistake in


---------137:29----------
some way it i can tell you something


---------137:32----------
because it's going to be very sort of


---------137:33----------
vague anyways which is


---------137:35----------
um there's just certain


---------137:40----------
it's very instinctual but there's


---------137:42----------
certain like


---------137:47----------
ways of writing or patterns that you


---------137:50----------
start to pick up on and you'll see


---------137:52----------
things and say well that kind of reminds


---------137:53----------
me of this other problem we had and we


---------137:56----------
let that problem extend


---------137:58----------
so let's not even


---------138:02----------
give it a chance to grow let's just cut


---------138:05----------
it off so


---------138:05----------
that's very vague i know it's not like a


---------138:08----------
clear example of


---------138:09----------
of what we've dealt with but um there's


---------138:11----------
just certain behaviors and patterns that


---------138:13----------
we


---------138:13----------
tend to pick up on now yeah so i'm


---------138:17----------
all saying i'll say it like if i see


---------138:19----------
something like we have a


---------138:21----------
you know a way to communicate between us


---------138:23----------
it's like uh let's just


---------138:25----------
like let's just flag this or


---------138:28----------
or another mod we'll say like we're


---------138:30----------
flagging this


---------138:32----------
internally and if anything else happens


---------138:35----------
then we're just gonna


---------138:36----------
ban yeah


---------138:39----------
so i'm i'm hearing that you know


---------138:40----------
subconsciously your brain has done some


---------138:42----------
pattern recognition


---------138:45----------
yeah right so you guys have seen enough


---------138:47----------
of it where to where you know sort of


---------138:48----------
like


---------138:49----------
what it looks like what it smells like


---------138:51----------
kind of like you know you can sniff it


---------138:53----------
out now


---------138:54----------
um yeah so i think that there's a lot of


---------138:57----------
room for research like i think it would


---------138:59----------
be really cool to actually do a study


---------139:01----------
where we asked streamers


---------139:02----------
like we could probably like you know put


---------139:05----------
assemble


---------139:06----------
like common red flags we could also do a


---------139:09----------
study


---------139:09----------
on um actually i i think we should i


---------139:13----------
think it'd be very cool to do a study on


---------139:15----------
people who are on


---------139:16----------
you know the the chatting end of the


---------139:19----------
parasocial relationship and like you


---------139:21----------
know do a qualitative research study


---------139:23----------
where you take 30 people


---------139:24----------
you ask them what is this experience


---------139:26----------
like for you like how do you feel where


---------139:28----------
does it come from


---------139:29----------
you know things like that um you can


---------139:31----------
also like we discovered all kinds of


---------139:33----------
interesting things


---------139:34----------
uh we're hopefully publishing a paper on


---------139:37----------
incel


---------139:37----------
soon um starting to do a paper


---------139:41----------
hopefully on i think we've got a we've


---------139:43----------
got a project in the works on


---------139:44----------
pornography addiction and i think


---------139:46----------
especially in the pornography addiction


---------139:48----------
very


---------139:49----------
some very surprising results in terms of


---------139:52----------
like things that you would not expect


---------139:53----------
like really simple things like being


---------139:55----------
exposed to pornography


---------139:56----------
at a very young age


---------140:00----------
from the consumer perspective yeah yeah


---------140:02----------
so


---------140:03----------
so like you know you'll have like


---------140:05----------
eight-year-olds who are shown


---------140:06----------
pornography and that's even before


---------140:08----------
they've started to like


---------140:09----------
experience like you know that they


---------140:11----------
haven't they're nowhere near puberty


---------140:13----------
and yeah but it does something in the


---------140:15----------
brain


---------140:17----------
and also that pornography addiction


---------140:19----------
doesn't seem to have really much to do


---------140:20----------
with being


---------140:22----------
you know sexually attracted to anything


---------140:23----------
it really seems to be more of a


---------140:26----------
shortcut to like a dopamine release in


---------140:28----------
the brain


---------140:29----------
and like emotional suppression so


---------140:31----------
there's a lot of assumptions that


---------140:33----------
pornography and perversion in some way


---------140:35----------
are like related but


---------140:36----------
it appears that for pornography it's


---------140:38----------
it's not the same


---------140:40----------
um so i can confirm huh


---------140:43----------
can confirm


---------140:47----------
i don't quite know what you mean by that


---------140:48----------
but okay


---------140:50----------
yeah i'm i'm also sort of a perv but


---------140:52----------
like


---------140:53----------
in a healthy way okay yeah well so my


---------140:55----------
point is that


---------140:56----------
you know i think perversion is a whole


---------140:58----------
separate thing it's just that people


---------141:00----------
yeah expected these things to be


---------141:01----------
associated exactly


---------141:03----------
and they don't they aren't necessarily


---------141:06----------
um and with parasocial relationships i


---------141:08----------
imagine if we spent the time like


---------141:09----------
looking we could start to figure out you


---------141:11----------
know what's going on here


---------141:14----------
but yeah that's sorry you got me


---------141:18----------
spilling


---------141:19----------
for a second no it's really cool i mean


---------141:22----------
i wanted to ask you these things and i


---------141:23----------
know a lot of people


---------141:24----------
um a lot of people wanted to hear about


---------141:28----------
this


---------141:28----------
i think it was very insightful and


---------141:30----------
hopefully helpful for some people as


---------141:32----------
well


---------141:32----------
now i know i offered you a 15 to 30


---------141:36----------
minute spiel on why you procrastinate


---------141:37----------
and how to fix it do you still want that


---------141:40----------
if you're down yes um i would have to go


---------141:43----------
to the bathroom really quickly though go


---------141:45----------
for it cool okay


---------141:47----------
all right let's do it let me figure it


---------141:50----------
out


---------141:52----------
okay


---------141:55----------
i was just in teaching mode


---------141:59----------
and so you know once i get started


---------142:03----------
it's hard to stop me and i'm sure that


---------142:05----------
that was a funny joke


---------142:08----------
but my mind was not able to once i get


---------142:10----------
into teaching mode


---------142:14----------
there's so little i understand about


---------142:16----------
innuendo


---------142:19----------
so ready to get started yeah


---------142:22----------
okay so the first thing uh sasha is i i


---------142:25----------
want to explain to you


---------142:27----------
a little bit about traditional indian


---------142:29----------
medicine or ayurveda


---------142:31----------
so before i went to medical school you


---------142:34----------
sound familiar are you familiar with


---------142:35----------
that or


---------142:36----------
now okay that's what you asked me


---------142:38----------
earlier yeah


---------142:40----------
okay okay yes i don't know a lot about


---------142:42----------
it but


---------142:43----------
okay um it was the way you pronounce it


---------142:46----------
i


---------142:46----------
i obviously butcher it and so


---------142:50----------
yeah sometimes people people will


---------142:51----------
pronounce it ayurveda


---------142:53----------
yes so um what i'm gonna try to do real


---------142:57----------
quick


---------142:58----------
is okay yeah i'm just getting prepped


---------143:01----------
okay so the first thing is that


---------143:03----------
not everyone's mind is the same


---------143:06----------
i know it sounds obvious but like you


---------143:08----------
know how like some people have


---------143:10----------
what we call fast metabolisms and they


---------143:12----------
can eat whatever they want to and not


---------143:14----------
put on a whole bunch of weight


---------143:15----------
and then other people are big boned


---------143:18----------
right


---------143:18----------
and they're people who can eat salads


---------143:20----------
all day and they'll still be like


---------143:22----------
you know above average in terms of


---------143:23----------
weight and the other interesting thing


---------143:25----------
is that like obviously there are these


---------143:27----------
classes of people that may have


---------143:31----------
something of a oh one second


---------143:33----------
i was on the wrong way up um so there


---------143:36----------
are these different classes of people


---------143:38----------
right so like and it may run in families


---------143:40----------
but there are people from like africa


---------143:42----------
that have fast metabolisms


---------143:43----------
and people completely unrelated from


---------143:45----------
like croatia that have fast metabolisms


---------143:48----------
so this is a variance within the


---------143:50----------
population of the human species


---------143:52----------
yeah turns out that fast metabolism


---------143:54----------
people and big bone people actually


---------143:56----------
share particular genes so they're


---------143:59----------
actually like these different classes of


---------144:01----------
people so


---------144:02----------
a couple thousand years ago in ancient


---------144:03----------
india there were a group of


---------144:05----------
doctors ayurvedic doctors who sort of


---------144:07----------
noticed that human beings have like


---------144:09----------
these shared


---------144:10----------
qualities and and so


---------144:13----------
what they decided is like in order to


---------144:15----------
understand them because they couldn't


---------144:17----------
you know do a genetic analysis back then


---------144:18----------
they started using elements


---------144:20----------
to explain like these attributes of


---------144:24----------
people


---------144:24----------
so what they said is that there are some


---------144:26----------
people who are like the wind and these


---------144:28----------
people are vata so they are they tend to


---------144:31----------
be prone to things like dry skin


---------144:33----------
they tend to be prone to things like


---------144:34----------
allergies they tend to have fast


---------144:36----------
metabolisms


---------144:37----------
they also tend to have eyes that are


---------144:40----------
bigger than their stomach


---------144:42----------
which means that they feel very very


---------144:43----------
hungry but then actually don't need to


---------144:45----------
eat a whole lot of food


---------144:47----------
they also notice cognitive correlations


---------144:50----------
that these people have so that they get


---------144:51----------
interested in things very easily but get


---------144:53----------
bored and things very easily


---------144:55----------
that these people tend to be quick


---------144:57----------
studies but


---------144:58----------
also forget if they don't get like you


---------145:01----------
know


---------145:02----------
repeated like they learn easy to forget


---------145:06----------
okay right and so then so they came up


---------145:09----------
and they said like oh this person is


---------145:10----------
like the wind


---------145:12----------
okay and then they also like notice that


---------145:13----------
there are other people so some people


---------145:15----------
are more argumentative


---------145:16----------
they're more driven they're


---------145:18----------
medium-bodied they tend to have certain


---------145:20----------
physical problems with like


---------145:21----------
indigestion the back teeth their back


---------145:24----------
teeth tend to be quite yellow


---------145:26----------
all kinds of interesting correlations


---------145:28----------
that they made


---------145:29----------
and then the third type is like the


---------145:31----------
earth type so these people tend to be


---------145:33----------
big boned


---------145:34----------
they tend to be like slow to learn but


---------145:36----------
slow to forget


---------145:38----------
they tend to be quite resilient and can


---------145:40----------
tolerate


---------145:41----------
punishing situations for long periods of


---------145:44----------
time


---------145:45----------
but are also slow to like get out of bad


---------145:48----------
situations so they'll like


---------145:49----------
stay in unhealthy relationships for


---------145:51----------
prolonged periods of time


---------145:53----------
whereas the vata folks the wind folks


---------145:54----------
will be like yeah i'm into this person


---------145:56----------
and yeah i'm not into that person


---------145:57----------
anymore


---------145:59----------
and so what they noticed were that these


---------146:01----------
these sort of elemental forces and if


---------146:03----------
you look at any human being you can kind


---------146:05----------
of rank


---------146:06----------
their their wind their fire and their


---------146:08----------
earth


---------146:09----------
and so some people may have a dominant


---------146:11----------
fire some people may have like a


---------146:13----------
dominant wind and fire


---------146:14----------
some people may have you know any


---------146:16----------
combination


---------146:18----------
and that disease essentially manifests


---------146:21----------
from your levels getting too high or too


---------146:24----------
low


---------146:25----------
so like people who have a high amount of


---------146:27----------
vata


---------146:28----------
if their vata increases a little bit


---------146:30----------
more they will have things like


---------146:32----------
allergies


---------146:33----------
they'll have things like adhd they'll


---------146:35----------
have things like anxiety


---------146:37----------
they'll have insomnia but not the kind


---------146:39----------
where it's hard to fall asleep


---------146:41----------
the kind where it's hard to stay asleep


---------146:43----------
or they have interrupted sleep


---------146:46----------
that vatas have dreams of flying for


---------146:48----------
example there are all kinds of weird


---------146:50----------
correlations do you have dreams of


---------146:52----------
flying oh yeah


---------146:54----------
okay oh yeah so you are you


---------146:57----------
are sasha my friend a textbook vata and


---------147:00----------
a lot of what you describe


---------147:01----------
as procrastination is a manifestation of


---------147:04----------
your vata mind


---------147:05----------
you talked so many times about not being


---------147:08----------
a nine to fiver


---------147:09----------
vatas hate the nine to five they can't


---------147:12----------
do the nine to five


---------147:13----------
it's just not how their mind is you can


---------147:16----------
work


---------147:18----------
from midnight till midnight


---------147:22----------
one day a week but you would rather do


---------147:25----------
that


---------147:26----------
than nine to five five days a week like


---------147:28----------
that's so that's just the vata mindset


---------147:31----------
right so it's like it's like you so you


---------147:34----------
have to think about yourself like the


---------147:35----------
wind and the wind blows really hard in


---------147:37----------
one direction


---------147:38----------
and then stops and blows this way


---------147:42----------
and then that way right so the first


---------147:45----------
thing to understand


---------147:46----------
is that you have avata mind so your


---------147:48----------
temperament


---------147:49----------
is going to be a little bit more


---------147:51----------
procrastination oriented because


---------147:54----------
vatas also thrive with crises and


---------147:56----------
deadlines


---------147:58----------
they they do their best work their mind


---------148:00----------
is sort of like


---------148:02----------
eh i can't get excited about that oh


---------148:04----------
[ __ ] it's happening tomorrow let's go


---------148:07----------
right like yes so so the vata mind is


---------148:10----------
going to be prone to what we


---------148:12----------
call quote-unquote procrastination but i


---------148:14----------
don't think that's really the right way


---------148:15----------
to think about it i think the reason we


---------148:16----------
call it procrastination


---------148:18----------
is because our society is structured


---------148:22----------
for bitters and kaphas for the most part


---------148:25----------
so like if we think about like you know


---------148:27----------
the nine to five like where does that


---------148:29----------
come from it's because


---------148:30----------
bit those which tend to be good managers


---------148:32----------
by the way vatas are like very difficult


---------148:34----------
as managers because they're all over the


---------148:36----------
place so fitness are really good the


---------148:37----------
fire types are really good at imposing


---------148:39----------
organization and structure


---------148:41----------
so like the people who like being like


---------148:43----------
the manager tend to be like a little bit


---------148:45----------
more bitter or kapha oriented


---------148:47----------
and so they created a system that worked


---------148:49----------
for them and then we pushed all the


---------148:52----------
vatas into the system


---------148:53----------
so school is another good example of


---------148:55----------
like it's eight to three and like that's


---------148:57----------
the way it should be whereas there's


---------148:58----------
actually


---------148:59----------
overwhelming evidence that starting


---------149:01----------
school at eight o'clock is actually bad


---------149:03----------
for learning and bad for kids


---------149:05----------
yeah there's no need to study for that


---------149:07----------
many hours a day


---------149:10----------
so anyway coming back to you so i think


---------149:12----------
the first thing to understand is that


---------149:14----------
if you want to quote unquote


---------149:16----------
procrastinate less


---------149:18----------
you should balance your vata the more


---------149:20----------
your wind element


---------149:21----------
raises the more procrastination prone


---------149:24----------
you will become


---------149:25----------
and by procrastination prone i mean that


---------149:27----------
there will be times of your life where


---------149:29----------
your mind is prone to wander


---------149:32----------
and like it can't sit still right so


---------149:34----------
like you can


---------149:35----------
eat certain things that will help your


---------149:37----------
mind like be


---------149:38----------
calmer and more grounded like your


---------149:41----------
procrastination is going to be


---------149:42----------
inversely proportional to the degree


---------149:44----------
that you're grounded


---------149:46----------
okay that's the first thing so like you


---------149:48----------
can sort of


---------149:49----------
you know yeah so that's vata okay


---------149:53----------
so a couple of solutions there one is


---------149:55----------
you can lower your vata you can be more


---------149:57----------
grounded but the other thing to


---------149:58----------
recognize


---------149:59----------
is that your mind is going to optimally


---------150:02----------
function when you're juggling a few


---------150:03----------
different things


---------150:04----------
that's just how it works okay so now


---------150:08----------
let's get to


---------150:09----------
um a little bit more on you


---------150:12----------
so the first thing to understand about


---------150:14----------
procrastination is that it's the vata


---------150:15----------
mindset okay we're gonna leave the


---------150:17----------
ayurveda stuff


---------150:18----------
over here for now um and so we can talk


---------150:21----------
about balancing your your vata and stuff


---------150:23----------
like that but then


---------150:24----------
when we think about procrastination you


---------150:26----------
had started sasha i believe with


---------150:28----------
it's some kind of fear of success right


---------150:31----------
that's what i've heard a lot of people


---------150:33----------
say and that's something that


---------150:35----------
personally i cannot identify with so


---------150:39----------
uh and this is i've read the alchemist


---------150:42----------
okay um what do you why do you think you


---------150:45----------
procrastinate


---------150:48----------
uh when he asked me that earlier it took


---------150:51----------
me a minute but then i i went back to


---------150:53----------
um it came to me which is i feel like i


---------150:57----------
am


---------150:57----------
i get overwhelmed and so it's hard for


---------151:00----------
me


---------151:00----------
to be decisive um


---------151:05----------
and figure out what is the most


---------151:07----------
important task at hand


---------151:09----------
okay so so here are a couple of things


---------151:11----------
so like we talked about before i think a


---------151:13----------
big solution to your


---------151:15----------
procrastination if you're overwhelmed


---------151:17----------
and having trouble


---------151:18----------
prioritizing you've already lost the


---------151:20----------
battle


---------151:21----------
because the problem is how stuff gets on


---------151:23----------
your plate


---------151:24----------
right right right so this is where um


---------151:28----------
you know we're not gonna i'm just gonna


---------151:31----------
offer a couple of hypotheses


---------151:33----------
these could be right these could be


---------151:34----------
wrong but i think that


---------151:36----------
there's a certain desperation that you


---------151:38----------
have because i


---------151:40----------
i'm gonna sort of like analyze you a


---------151:41----------
little bit here okay so this is


---------151:42----------
something you should definitely talk to


---------151:44----------
with talk through with a therapist if


---------151:46----------
you feel like this resonates with you


---------151:48----------
but what i'm getting the sense of is


---------151:49----------
because of something about your


---------151:51----------
background and because you're walking a


---------151:53----------
tightrope


---------151:54----------
i feel like that emotional feeling of


---------151:57----------
walking a tightrope


---------151:59----------
doesn't allow you to pass on


---------152:01----------
opportunities


---------152:06----------
right because you feel like i have to


---------152:07----------
grow i have to adapt i have to stay up


---------152:09----------
with the trends


---------152:11----------
um we don't really need to go into that


---------152:13----------
my point is that in terms of like


---------152:14----------
not fearing it's a fear of success like


---------152:17----------
you


---------152:18----------
and this will become clear in a second i


---------152:19----------
don't think yours is a fear of success


---------152:21----------
what i get from you is more of like


---------152:23----------
a desperation of like being on the


---------152:26----------
tightrope and


---------152:27----------
like you don't have a choice does that


---------152:30----------
sort of make sense


---------152:32----------
it does the thing that i'll oh slightly


---------152:36----------
disagree with there


---------152:38----------
is that like um not being able to say no


---------152:41----------
because i've actually been very aware of


---------152:45----------
that over the past i would say like


---------152:47----------
four or five years and it's something


---------152:49----------
i've really worked on and


---------152:51----------
learning to say no okay so


---------152:55----------
but that being said what you're saying


---------152:57----------
is all the other things i am still


---------152:59----------
putting on my plate


---------153:01----------
right so i'm still putting this and one


---------153:03----------
last thing before i forget


---------153:05----------
but you i just want to say it and then


---------153:06----------
we can go back to time management


---------153:08----------
and then we can circle back to that


---------153:10----------
though yeah so so this is where i'd say


---------153:12----------
that you know if you've learned how to


---------153:13----------
say


---------153:13----------
no and you still wind up with too many


---------153:16----------
things on your plate


---------153:18----------
how does that happen right because i


---------153:20----------
think that it's not about saying


---------153:22----------
i don't know it still feels to me like


---------153:26----------
there's an emotional driver which


---------153:30----------
is determining how much stuff ends up on


---------153:32----------
your plate in the first place


---------153:38----------
right so like i i maybe it's not


---------153:39----------
emotional but i would explore that so


---------153:42----------
like let's just put emotional driver we


---------153:43----------
don't need to go there


---------153:44----------
right now okay so now i'm going to talk


---------153:47----------
more generally so i tend to think about


---------153:49----------
procrastination like a couple different


---------153:50----------
kinds of procrastination okay


---------153:53----------
so the first is what i would call


---------153:55----------
idealistic procrastination


---------153:59----------
so what this means is that some people


---------154:06----------
don't act because they're not ready


---------154:10----------
so like for example if i want to apply


---------154:12----------
for a job


---------154:13----------
and i procrastinate on applying for a


---------154:15----------
job the reason that i'm procrastinating


---------154:17----------
because i want to wait until my resume


---------154:19----------
is good like i need to revise my resume


---------154:21----------
like i can send


---------154:22----------
a crappy resume today or i can send the


---------154:25----------
perfect resume tomorrow


---------154:27----------
so i'm not going to apply for a job


---------154:29----------
until everything is ideal


---------154:32----------
yes right so like this is where like you


---------154:34----------
have this


---------154:35----------
you have this idea in your mind of


---------154:38----------
how this task should be executed yes


---------154:41----------
right


---------154:41----------
idea or even fantasy of execution


---------154:45----------
yes i can relate to that and that's


---------154:48----------
something that i've also


---------154:50----------
been working on is


---------154:53----------
is letting go of certain things and


---------154:56----------
understanding that


---------154:57----------
like nothing can always be perfect


---------155:01----------
yeah so like like it's the chase for


---------155:03----------
perfection that keeps people paralyzed


---------155:06----------
in the moment


---------155:07----------
mm-hmm right like i know it sounds kind


---------155:09----------
of weird but like sometimes you know


---------155:12----------
sometimes i'll it almost feels to be


---------155:14----------
like you take a 100


---------155:16----------
chance at an f as opposed to a 20 chance


---------155:19----------
at an a


---------155:21----------
and it's like people people are like


---------155:23----------
yeah i'd rather like i want to do it


---------155:24----------
perfectly or


---------155:26----------
not at all and that's where you know


---------155:28----------
because you have this idea of like what


---------155:29----------
you want it to look like


---------155:31----------
what it'll accomplish like i'm going to


---------155:32----------
do such a like it's going to be so


---------155:35----------
great when i do it but i haven't


---------155:38----------
set that circumstance up so i'm just not


---------155:41----------
going to do it


---------155:42----------
or haven't been good with time


---------155:46----------
management to allow yourself


---------155:48----------
to be prepared we'll get to time


---------155:51----------
management later okay


---------155:53----------
so idealistic procrastination is


---------155:54----------
something that i i kind of think


---------155:56----------
of is like it this is a little bit


---------155:58----------
psychological it's cognitive


---------156:00----------
right and it's actually like attachment


---------156:02----------
based


---------156:03----------
and what i mean by that is we're


---------156:04----------
attached to a particular


---------156:07----------
outcome so like we're attached to it


---------156:09----------
being a certain way like


---------156:10----------
like my favorite example is one that i i


---------156:12----------
have in my head all the time


---------156:14----------
i will start going to the gym once i'm a


---------156:16----------
little bit in shape


---------156:18----------
because oh god yeah right yeah and so if


---------156:20----------
you kind of think about it it's


---------156:22----------
the attachment to like not wanting to


---------156:24----------
look


---------156:25----------
out of shape when you go to the gym that


---------156:28----------
keeps you from going to the gym


---------156:30----------
so oddly enough the solution here is a


---------156:32----------
little bit more like


---------156:33----------
grief like you got to just let that go


---------156:35----------
and like learn to take an l


---------156:38----------
yeah right you gotta just be like you


---------156:40----------
know what it's gonna suck


---------156:42----------
yep um or al i guess


---------156:46----------
so so that's where where i i would say


---------156:49----------
like so this is different


---------156:50----------
because it's not really emotional it's


---------156:51----------
like i want this thing to happen


---------156:53----------
perfectly and you have to let go of like


---------156:55----------
you have to grieve that perfect outcome


---------156:58----------
to be able to move forward


---------157:00----------
yeah okay so another good example is i


---------157:03----------
have i'm working with someone who's


---------157:04----------
going to enroll in college once they get


---------157:07----------
their like sleep schedule


---------157:09----------
fixed right and so their sleep schedule


---------157:12----------
never gets fixed so that


---------157:13----------
they never go to college it's a form of


---------157:15----------
idealistic procrastination


---------157:18----------
so second is avoidance procrastination


---------157:22----------
so this is closer to what the instagram


---------157:25----------
folks or whatever social media folks are


---------157:27----------
saying


---------157:27----------
so this tends to be based in emotions


---------157:32----------
so this is sort of like like the


---------157:34----------
avoidance procrastination is actually a


---------157:35----------
protective mechanism


---------157:38----------
and what it's protecting you from is


---------157:40----------
like a particular emotion so for example


---------157:43----------
let's say i want to ask someone out but


---------157:45----------
i'm afraid of rejection so i don't ask


---------157:47----------
them out


---------157:48----------
and i tell myself i really want to ask


---------157:50----------
him out i really want to ask him out i


---------157:51----------
really want to ask him out so in a sense


---------157:52----------
you could call that procrastination


---------157:54----------
because i never get up


---------157:55----------
off my ass and ask someone out but what


---------157:58----------
i'm really trying to do is like


---------158:01----------
avoid the emotional possibility of


---------158:04----------
rejection


---------158:05----------
yeah so sometimes when i talk to people


---------158:08----------
who want to you know find a job


---------158:10----------
like they feel stupid going in


---------158:13----------
and like asking for um


---------158:17----------
they feel stupid like going in and like


---------158:20----------
asking for a job application they don't


---------158:22----------
need to feel stupid but they just do


---------158:24----------
so a lot of times like how do you tell


---------158:27----------
if you have avoidance procrastination


---------158:29----------
if people use umbrella terms like if


---------158:31----------
they call themselves bad


---------158:33----------
lazy stupid or incompetent and that's


---------158:35----------
the reason they're procrastinating


---------158:38----------
that is likely to be an avoidance


---------158:40----------
procrastination the things that


---------158:42----------
avoided procrastinators tell themselves


---------158:44----------
is usually diagnosing them within


---------158:47----------
themselves with an unfixable problem


---------158:49----------
like


---------158:50----------
i'm lazy that's why i procrastinate and


---------158:53----------
like laziness is like it's an attribute


---------158:55----------
of who you


---------158:56----------
are there's nothing to do about it


---------158:57----------
there's there's no


---------159:00----------
you know it's kind of just like so like


---------159:02----------
oh i you


---------159:03----------
drew the short straw you're lazy in life


---------159:05----------
sucks to be you


---------159:06----------
you know it sort of doesn't you can't do


---------159:08----------
anything about it


---------159:10----------
um does that make sense yes so


---------159:14----------
the other thing that that these people


---------159:15----------
tend to do is rational


---------159:17----------
a lot of rational justifications


---------159:20----------
so they'll give themselves lots of


---------159:22----------
reasons why they're not doing something


---------159:24----------
but at the end of the day it's usually


---------159:26----------
emotional oh


---------159:28----------
you know like and it may even look like


---------159:29----------
idealistic procrastination it's sort of


---------159:31----------
like


---------159:31----------
yeah i'll ask this person out once i get


---------159:34----------
in shape and sure that's like there's an


---------159:36----------
idealistic component to it but it's


---------159:37----------
really


---------159:38----------
what's really driving that is like the


---------159:40----------
fear of like being rejected


---------159:42----------
and what they're trying to do is like


---------159:44----------
control circumstances so that they can


---------159:45----------
avoid emotions


---------159:47----------
this is another sign right yeah


---------159:50----------
and this is where like like asking


---------159:52----------
someone out i'm gonna wait till i'm sure


---------159:54----------
they're in love with me before i even


---------159:55----------
ask them out


---------159:57----------
because i'm afraid of the rejection yeah


---------160:00----------
and maybe there's fear of success in


---------160:02----------
your case there may be an emotional


---------160:03----------
driver which could be like avoidance


---------160:05----------
procrastination


---------160:06----------
i don't really think that's the case


---------160:07----------
with you i'll we'll get back to you in a


---------160:08----------
second


---------160:09----------
um and then the third


---------160:13----------
oh this may be you sasha operational


---------160:17----------
procrastination


---------160:18----------
okay


---------160:22----------
this is more frontal but


---------160:25----------
what i mean is frontal lobe sorry so i


---------160:27----------
was just gonna ask do you mean frontal


---------160:28----------
lobe okay


---------160:29----------
yeah okay so this is where like so vatas


---------160:31----------
tend to be prone to this type


---------160:33----------
because frontal lobe problems also


---------160:35----------
manifest as like anxiety and adhd


---------160:38----------
so like this is kind of like an adhd


---------160:40----------
procrastination


---------160:41----------
tends to be falls under this category


---------160:44----------
but what i would say is um


---------160:48----------
so this is the kind where like so i have


---------160:50----------
a three-year-old and i have a


---------160:52----------
five-year-old


---------160:52----------
and if i tell the five-year-old to clean


---------160:55----------
clean up their room


---------160:56----------
they're able to do that but if i tell


---------160:59----------
the three-year-old to clean your room


---------161:01----------
she's not really able to do that does


---------161:02----------
that make sense


---------161:04----------
yeah what's the difference between the


---------161:07----------
three-year-old and five-year-old why can


---------161:08----------
the five-year-old clean their room but


---------161:09----------
the three-year-old can't


---------161:11----------
that's i would say the age is the first


---------161:14----------
thing i think of like a five-year-old is


---------161:15----------
a little bit more independent


---------161:17----------
they can safe you know they can focus


---------161:20----------
for longer periods of time


---------161:21----------
compared to a toddler who's just only


---------161:24----------
been walking for a while and


---------161:26----------
is still pretty dependent on parents


---------161:28----------
yeah so if we look at like


---------161:30----------
what the age means right what's the


---------161:32----------
difference between a three-year-old's


---------161:34----------
brain and a five-year-old's brain


---------161:35----------
you've sussed it out instinctively


---------161:37----------
perfectly right so that


---------161:38----------
the five-year-old can kind of stay


---------161:40----------
focused but if you really think about it


---------161:43----------
what stay focused


---------161:44----------
means is actually breaking down the task


---------161:47----------
into its component parts so this is


---------161:50----------
where like people feel


---------161:51----------
overwhelmed if they're operational


---------161:54----------
procrastinators


---------161:55----------
and what that means is like the


---------161:57----------
five-year-old understands that cleaning


---------161:59----------
the room is putting away the toys


---------162:01----------
putting away the books and putting away


---------162:03----------
my stuffed animals i can tell the


---------162:06----------
three-year-old


---------162:08----------
put away your stuffed animals and she


---------162:10----------
can understand that


---------162:11----------
but she's not able to take the abstract


---------162:14----------
of cleaning the room


---------162:16----------
and breaking it down into its component


---------162:18----------
pieces


---------162:20----------
and so when she looks at the dirty room


---------162:22----------
her mind is


---------162:23----------
overwhelmed with like how do i break


---------162:26----------
down this task and execute on it


---------162:29----------
does that make sense yes absolutely


---------162:33----------
so like when we think about something


---------162:34----------
like um and this is also like a problem


---------162:36----------
in gamers too so gamers are prone to


---------162:38----------
this


---------162:39----------
because video games operationalize stuff


---------162:42----------
for us


---------162:43----------
right okay here's the quest go collect


---------162:46----------
eight of these things


---------162:47----------
then go here then go here then go here


---------162:50----------
then go here


---------162:51----------
so we're not really taught how to like


---------162:53----------
abstract out things from start to finish


---------162:56----------
even our sandbox games basically like


---------162:59----------
teach us how to play in the sandbox


---------163:01----------
right it's not truly free form


---------163:03----------
so when you take gamers and you tell


---------163:05----------
them to go find a job there are actually


---------163:08----------
a thousand small tasks


---------163:11----------
but the our minds actually are not like


---------163:14----------
natural at breaking up those tasks so


---------163:17----------
finding a job


---------163:18----------
feels overwhelming because we don't know


---------163:21----------
how to break it down into its component


---------163:22----------
parts


---------163:24----------
so does that sound like that describes


---------163:26----------
you


---------163:28----------
yeah definitely and i


---------163:31----------
yeah go ahead and i feel like i i do


---------163:35----------
better


---------163:36----------
when um


---------163:39----------
i waver a lot so like i'll have really


---------163:42----------
disciplined


---------163:43----------
stints where i have lists and i have


---------163:45----------
checklists


---------163:46----------
and sub checklists and i got like the


---------163:49----------
stuff that is for


---------163:50----------
me uh in my personal life just like


---------163:53----------
random stuff that has to be done and


---------163:54----------
then the stuff that i want to do


---------163:58----------
professionally creatively


---------164:03----------
and then i'll fall off yeah so that's it


---------164:08----------
okay that's where i mean i'd say that


---------164:12----------
that sounds very about that of me so


---------164:14----------
here's what i'd suggest for you


---------164:16----------
okay the first is that like you know


---------164:18----------
maybe there's some weird emotional [ __ ]


---------164:19----------
in there


---------164:20----------
who knows if it's not what floats your


---------164:22----------
boat no big deal


---------164:24----------
sorry i i'm i'm done with the ipad part


---------164:27----------
uh i'm yeah i'm just a senior sorry


---------164:30----------
yeah it's okay um so here's what i'd say


---------164:32----------
sasha for you


---------164:33----------
if you procrastinate like the first


---------164:35----------
thing to understand is that you're gonna


---------164:37----------
be the most successful


---------164:38----------
when you have external prompts so you're


---------164:42----------
gonna respond well to crises and


---------164:43----------
deadlines


---------164:44----------
the next thing to understand is that


---------164:46----------
procrastination is not a problem


---------164:48----------
procrastination is actually a solution


---------164:52----------
so if our brain so this is like


---------164:54----------
literally what happens our brain has


---------164:55----------
this circuit


---------164:56----------
that tries to figure out how to be


---------164:58----------
efficient and so what


---------165:00----------
your brain tells you when you're in like


---------165:01----------
let's say you're in school and it's like


---------165:03----------
i could start studying today and i can


---------165:04----------
get an a and i can study one hour a day


---------165:06----------
for 30 days


---------165:07----------
but our brain is actually like you know


---------165:09----------
what we can get a b if you just cram the


---------165:10----------
night before


---------165:12----------
and so if you actually think about an


---------165:14----------
energy investment doing things perfectly


---------165:16----------
is not efficient it's actually


---------165:20----------
very inefficient because why would i


---------165:22----------
want to study 30 hours for an a when i


---------165:24----------
can squeak by with a b with six


---------165:26----------
like why would i do that so


---------165:29----------
in your case i'd say be careful about


---------165:32----------
why things get on your plate is number


---------165:33----------
one


---------165:34----------
see if there's some kind of desperation


---------165:36----------
there's some kind of like


---------165:37----------
because we see this a lot with streamers


---------165:38----------
where like you feel like you you know


---------165:40----------
you can't


---------165:41----------
afford to pass sounds like you've


---------165:43----------
learned how to say no


---------165:45----------
second thing to think about in terms of


---------165:47----------
your procrastination is what i would do


---------165:48----------
is pick like three or four things and


---------165:50----------
rotate between them


---------165:52----------
so what you'll find is that the way for


---------165:54----------
you to work 80 hours a week


---------165:56----------
is to have four different projects that


---------165:58----------
work 20 hours that you need 20 hours a


---------166:00----------
week


---------166:01----------
if you devote yourself to one project


---------166:03----------
for 40 hours a week


---------166:04----------
you will do a worse job than four


---------166:07----------
projects


---------166:08----------
at 20 hours a week even though


---------166:10----------
technically you're working half as much


---------166:13----------
in one scenario it's just gonna not


---------166:16----------
bring


---------166:17----------
out the like the interest


---------166:20----------
right like when you get excited about


---------166:22----------
something well i also like


---------166:24----------
my mind immediately goes to


---------166:28----------
when you know you should stop working on


---------166:29----------
something because your brain and body


---------166:31----------
are tired but you


---------166:32----------
push through because you just want to


---------166:34----------
finish and get it over with and then you


---------166:36----------
make mistakes


---------166:37----------
that then add hours to having to finish


---------166:40----------
that


---------166:40----------
that's where that is so so i think your


---------166:43----------
problem with sasha you don't need to


---------166:45----------
motivate


---------166:46----------
yourself to work so people who have a


---------166:48----------
problem with procrastination think that


---------166:50----------
i need to motivate myself


---------166:52----------
when i don't feel like working right


---------166:56----------
it's actually the exact opposite you


---------166:58----------
need to demotivate yourself


---------167:00----------
at the right times and then your


---------167:01----------
procrastination will get way better


---------167:03----------
you need to restrain your motive it's


---------167:05----------
two sides of the same coin


---------167:07----------
you need to restrain your motivation


---------167:08----------
when you get excited


---------167:11----------
when it's time to stop you need to


---------167:13----------
restrain yourself


---------167:15----------
and stop so procrastination in your


---------167:18----------
in your case i don't think is like it's


---------167:19----------
not about a lack of motivation it's


---------167:21----------
actually about a lack of restraint


---------167:26----------
and i think that as you have fewer


---------167:28----------
things


---------167:29----------
like because like you said okay i want


---------167:31----------
to finish it now i made a bunch of


---------167:32----------
mistakes so the next day your to-do list


---------167:34----------
has been inflated


---------167:36----------
with stuff that should have never like


---------167:38----------
it would have been easier to just stop


---------167:40----------
and finish it today


---------167:42----------
yeah right and and so like i would i


---------167:44----------
really reign in your vata and then


---------167:48----------
also try to cultivate kind of a system


---------167:50----------
around it which is like


---------167:52----------
you know get other people to like be


---------167:54----------
beholden to other people and you'll do a


---------167:56----------
good job


---------167:57----------
yeah because left to your own devices


---------167:59----------
it's going to be a mess


---------168:01----------
let other people like you know


---------168:05----------
my team is really good about like


---------168:07----------
forcing me into meetings they just throw


---------168:08----------
something on my calendar because they've


---------168:10----------
learned


---------168:11----------
unfortunately that if they like ask me


---------168:13----------
to do something it's never gonna happen


---------168:14----------
if they're just like


---------168:15----------
hey i need you to show up at this time


---------168:18----------
and it feels weird because


---------168:19----------
i outrank them in some way but they have


---------168:21----------
to give me orders and we figured out


---------168:23----------
that that's what works best


---------168:25----------
yeah um i don't know if that was helpful


---------168:28----------
for not but that's my spiel


---------168:30----------
yeah it is helpful it's interesting and


---------168:33----------
i was just


---------168:33----------
helpful for people watching too um


---------168:40----------
i wanted to figure out a way to pose


---------168:42----------
this but like i don't know


---------168:44----------
it's coming out more as a statement so i


---------168:45----------
don't want to say it like


---------168:48----------
sense but i kind of go i'm go my mind


---------168:51----------
keeps going back to that question that


---------168:52----------
was posed earlier


---------168:54----------
which was like let me just bring it up


---------168:56----------
because i don't i don't want to


---------168:57----------
paraphrase


---------168:58----------
it one second


---------169:15----------
okay so the the actual question was how


---------169:18----------
long should breaks actually be


---------169:19----------
and how long should you work before


---------169:21----------
taking them so i mean i


---------169:23----------
that's kind of that's a little bit broad


---------169:26----------
because that can mean like


---------169:27----------
in a work day or that could mean always


---------169:30----------
you know


---------169:30----------
um so yeah so that depends on your


---------169:33----------
ayurvedic dosha so this is the problem


---------169:35----------
with questions that people ask


---------169:37----------
like like western science is about on


---------169:39----------
average what works for the most number


---------169:41----------
of people


---------169:42----------
so when the fda comes up with a 2 000


---------169:44----------
calorie a day recommendation


---------169:47----------
that's not going to work as well for the


---------169:48----------
fast metabolism people versus the big


---------169:50----------
bone people


---------169:51----------
so when should you take breaks so what


---------169:53----------
i'll literally do when i do like


---------169:54----------
corporate consulting is we'll do


---------169:55----------
ayurvedic analyses of everyone's doshas


---------169:59----------
and then what we'll do is i'll tell them


---------170:00----------
like if you're avata you should take


---------170:02----------
frequent short breaks you should plan on


---------170:05----------
working four


---------170:06----------
two hour blocks in the day start early


---------170:09----------
start at six a.m try to finish like as


---------170:12----------
early as possible


---------170:13----------
so like vata's also come online fast and


---------170:16----------
run out of stamina fast


---------170:19----------
so how often should you take breaks you


---------170:22----------
should take them frequently because


---------170:23----------
you're prone to burnout like if you push


---------170:25----------
yourself


---------170:26----------
you're going to pay for it the next day


---------170:28----------
so you need like pre-emptive breaks


---------170:30----------
if you're a bitter leaving tasks undone


---------170:33----------
is going to be very infuriating


---------170:35----------
so you've got to like push through like


---------170:37----------
work like pithas are decent nine to


---------170:39----------
fivers


---------170:40----------
and and if you're kapha if you're like


---------170:42----------
the earth element like you probably need


---------170:44----------
you can go a longer time without a break


---------170:47----------
but then you probably need a long break


---------170:51----------
when it's time for a break so as avata


---------170:53----------
when i go on a 10-day vacation


---------170:55----------
i've i've i'm done relaxing on day five


---------171:00----------
and i'm like i'm gonna do some work now


---------171:04----------
yeah so like the vata is like but a boy


---------171:06----------
like i need three day weekends


---------171:08----------
every week because on day four i'm like


---------171:10----------
oh my god i've worked so


---------171:13----------
long on tuesday morning it's like oh


---------171:15----------
when is the weekend


---------171:17----------
you know yeah and then by like by sunday


---------171:20----------
morning if i like don't work on friday


---------171:21----------
by sunday morning i'm like let me get


---------171:22----------
back to work


---------171:23----------
let's go you know so yeah frequent


---------171:26----------
breaks that are shorter for vatas


---------171:30----------
you know medium length breaks at decent


---------171:32----------
intervals nine to five


---------171:33----------
evenings off and then for kapha's like


---------171:35----------
you can work seven days


---------171:37----------
ten days go for it and then take like


---------171:39----------
four days off


---------171:41----------
you know it sort of depends that's what


---------171:43----------
i'd say yeah


---------171:44----------
and then a question that i have that


---------171:46----------
kind of ties into all this is


---------171:50----------
um i kind of started to mention it but


---------171:55----------
i feel like i'm really um


---------171:59----------
like i go through these moments like i


---------172:00----------
said where when i'm really disciplined


---------172:02----------
with like


---------172:03----------
let's say it's a list for example and


---------172:05----------
these are the things that need to be


---------172:06----------
accomplished


---------172:07----------
these are the things that i just want to


---------172:09----------
accomplish


---------172:10----------
um when i'm really proactive at staying


---------172:14----------
on top of that


---------172:16----------
and i can actually see like things being


---------172:19----------
crossed out


---------172:20----------
done done done it makes me feel good so


---------172:23----------
it motivates me to continue


---------172:25----------
and then something will happen like a


---------172:28----------
disrupter in life will happen


---------172:32----------
it is so hard for me to pick


---------172:35----------
back up where i left off so that


---------172:37----------
disruptor is a separate conversation so


---------172:39----------
this goes to


---------172:41----------
okay so let's just analyze that in two


---------172:43----------
ways the first is


---------172:44----------
you gotta be careful about the


---------172:46----------
motivation of checking something off


---------172:50----------
because when you check something off


---------172:52----------
what do you feel like doing


---------172:57----------
it depends but usually like it i want to


---------173:00----------
keep going


---------173:01----------
so what's your problem you need to learn


---------173:04----------
how to restrain yourself


---------173:07----------
because like you're like yeah let's keep


---------173:08----------
going let's go let's go


---------173:10----------
yeah and then you may run out of steam


---------173:12----------
before you realize it so i'd say really


---------173:14----------
be careful


---------173:15----------
when you check when you're done with


---------173:17----------
your work for the day sasha you have to


---------173:18----------
learn how to restrain yourself and be


---------173:20----------
done with the work for the day


---------173:21----------
don't keep on adding on work that's why


---------173:22----------
your plate is so terrible


---------173:24----------
yes it's restrained your problem is like


---------173:28----------
you're so motivated that you take on new


---------173:30----------
projects and then you're overwhelmed


---------173:33----------
and then i'm like or like then the next


---------173:35----------
day i'm exhausted


---------173:36----------
and then it's hard for me to get the day


---------173:38----------
started so this is where you got to be


---------173:40----------
careful because you say something throws


---------173:42----------
me off


---------173:42----------
but the question is what is the


---------173:46----------
stat yeah hey we have a meeting oh [ __ ]


---------173:49----------
sorry


---------173:50----------
we have a meeting i thought it was a


---------173:51----------
four ah okay


---------173:53----------
i'll just finish this up and then then


---------173:55----------
um i gotta apparently i have a meeting


---------173:57----------
case in point see i didn't restrain


---------173:58----------
myself we were supposed to we were


---------174:00----------
supposed to stop an hour ago


---------174:04----------
so i got excited and and so i have a


---------174:06----------
crisis


---------174:07----------
and deadline that comes and like


---------174:08----------
restrains me


---------174:10----------
perfect this is great yeah exactly so


---------174:13----------
i'll i'll just


---------174:14----------
illustrate this like so i'd be careful


---------174:15----------
about your motivation and what you tack


---------174:18----------
on because then you say when something


---------174:19----------
throws you off


---------174:22----------
what you know how is your reserve energy


---------174:24----------
when that disrupter comes


---------174:27----------
because if you were overly motivated


---------174:29----------
yesterday it's going to be


---------174:30----------
easier to get thrown off and then what


---------174:32----------
happens is we look at the disrupter


---------174:34----------
but we don't like we look at the wave


---------174:36----------
that knocked us off but we don't look at


---------174:38----------
the health of our boat


---------174:40----------
yeah so what you really need to focus on


---------174:41----------
is like you know having a steady boat


---------174:43----------
restraining yourself and then you'll be


---------174:45----------
more resilient against disruptions that


---------174:48----------
being said


---------174:48----------
you know disruptions are absolutely


---------174:50----------
thing and sometimes you can have a great


---------174:51----------
boat and you can still have


---------174:53----------
you know a tsunami and you'll you know


---------174:54----------
it's over but


---------174:56----------
anyway does that make sense yes


---------174:58----------
definitely


---------174:59----------
okay yeah so restrain yourself do less


---------175:02----------
not more


---------175:03----------
and that goes yeah this i'll have to


---------175:06----------
continue with chat


---------175:07----------
too but like that i think goes back into


---------175:09----------
time management


---------175:12----------
my lack of it my lack of it i have to go


---------175:14----------
now


---------175:15----------
because i've done a bad job at time


---------175:17----------
management


---------175:18----------
and so the way that i stay successful is


---------175:21----------
by having


---------175:22----------
crises okay she's yeah sorry sasha we


---------175:25----------
gotta


---------175:25----------
you gotta feel it okay all right thank


---------175:28----------

---------175:33----------
