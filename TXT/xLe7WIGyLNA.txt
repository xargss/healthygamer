---------00:01----------
this is a little bit this is gonna be a


---------00:04----------
little bit tricky because we're gonna do


---------00:06----------
pseudonym us car so there's about a two


---------00:09----------
to three ratio so like 62% of people


---------00:12----------
want to do something else


---------00:13----------
32% want to do seer Namaskar so we're


---------00:16----------
definitely gonna do Syrian mus car I'll


---------00:17----------
teach you guys maybe one other thing but


---------00:20----------
I want you guys to understand this very


---------00:22----------
clearly so sooner in a mus car is like


---------00:24----------
the thing that you should do every day


---------00:26----------
it should be like brushing your teeth


---------00:28----------
and so we definitely want to do that


---------00:31----------
every day but I will teach you guys


---------00:32----------
other stuff so we we learned a backbend


---------00:35----------
kind of awesome we can learn we've done


---------00:37----------
a couple things on stream like the Basia


---------00:39----------
which we can do I'll definitely start


---------00:40----------
teaching you guys Brown I am and so will


---------00:43----------
teach you guys more stuff I get that


---------00:45----------
y'all ready for something else but I


---------00:47----------
don't I would I don't want you guys to


---------00:50----------
forget that like some things should be


---------00:53----------
done every day and be a little bit


---------00:55----------
careful so when you think about why your


---------00:58----------
mind wants to learn something besides


---------01:00----------
Surya Namaskar like what is it are you


---------01:01----------
guys getting bored of it are you curious


---------01:03----------
do you want to learn more do you think


---------01:04----------
more is better so think about all those


---------01:07----------
things like where does your curiosity


---------01:08----------
come from and I think ultimately Surya


---------01:10----------
Namaskar is really the most important


---------01:14----------
practice but since you guys want to


---------01:15----------
learn something else and we've been


---------01:16----------
doing it for a week I'll teach you guys


---------01:18----------
something else okay so let's let's start


---------01:24----------
with yoga all right okay hopefully this


---------01:34----------
will be a little bit better cuz I'm back


---------01:38----------
at my old set up with more stable


---------01:40----------
internet okay


---------01:51----------
all right you guys right so let's start


---------01:56----------
so start by standing up straight feet


---------02:00----------
shoulder-width apart close your eyes


---------02:02----------
just feel the stability of kind of being


---------02:06----------
here for a second and we're gonna apply


---------02:13----------
our same rules as before so you guys can


---------02:15----------
watch me do it if you don't feel


---------02:17----------
comfortable watch one round and if not


---------02:21----------
if you all feel kind of ready to go then


---------02:25----------
you can do it with me so let's start by


---------02:29----------
putting our feet together anchor


---------02:32----------
yourself in your instability no must the


---------02:36----------
position and then we're going to begin


---------02:41----------
so arms up biceps to your ears feel the


---------02:47----------
stretch


---------02:47----------
feel your body waking up feel your back


---------02:51----------
and then bend down to touch your toes


---------03:04----------
feel the stiffness let your head hang


---------03:11----------
and then right leg back and look up good


---------03:26----------
try to keep your palms flat toes curled


---------03:30----------
back straight and look up left leg back


---------03:37----------
look up push-up position stay straight


---------03:43----------
and then down toes knees chest forehead


---------04:01----------
and push up hips to the ground


---------04:05----------
feet flat shoulders out neck curled up


---------04:22----------
you


---------04:24----------
and then to downward-facing dog are both


---------04:26----------
awesome put your heels flat into the


---------04:29----------
ground and that right leg forward


---------04:46----------
look up it sort of put your you can move


---------04:50----------
your hips a little bit to feel stretch


---------04:52----------
in different areas you should form a


---------04:55----------
line between your two hands and your


---------04:56----------
foot and then we're back up to touching


---------05:02----------
your toes as you exhale let yourself


---------05:07----------
sink further see how much further you


---------05:12----------
can go compared to what we started then


---------05:15----------
back up nice and straight and then back


---------05:29----------
down so now we're going to turn I'm


---------05:36----------
going to go ahead and do one round


---------05:38----------
sideways okay just so you guys can see


---------05:40----------
what things look like from a sideways


---------05:42----------
angle now we'll begin round two so now


---------05:48----------
what we're going to do is incorporate


---------05:49----------
well let's do round two and then we'll


---------05:52----------
do round three with some specific


---------05:53----------
breathing okay so let's begin again up


---------05:58----------
go a little bit faster this time


---------06:01----------
feel the stretch down see so as you


---------06:10----------
loosen it up you're going to kind of be


---------06:13----------
able to go down a little bit more right


---------06:16----------
leg back right so this is sort of right


---------06:21----------
leg back and then you can kind of sink


---------06:23----------
in a little bit or up just feel that


---------06:25----------
difference left leg back push up


---------06:34----------
position so you want to stay nice and


---------06:35----------
straight further up you go the easier


---------06:40----------
it's gonna be but we want to stay nice


---------06:41----------
and straight okay and then down toes


---------06:49----------
knees chest for them but it's a little


---------06:52----------
bit of ear


---------06:56----------
and then feet flattened hips down push


---------07:01----------
up shoulders rounded out


---------07:16----------
and then feet toes back on the ground


---------07:19----------
and then downward-facing dog if that's


---------07:24----------
what this posture is I don't really know


---------07:25----------
so try to put your butt in the air heels


---------07:30----------
down so you don't want to be like this


---------07:32----------
heels down right leg forward look up


---------07:50----------
and then feet together hang down tuck


---------07:55----------
your toes come back up fingers towards


---------08:04----------
the sky feel that stretch and then back


---------08:09----------
to baseline then must stay position okay


---------08:14----------
and now we're gonna do round three all


---------08:19----------
right


---------08:24----------
so round three we're going to


---------08:27----------
incorporate a little bit of breath so


---------08:29----------
we're going to move a little faster this


---------08:31----------
time and what I want you guys to do is


---------08:33----------
essentially with each alternate pose you


---------08:37----------
want to breathe out and breathe in now


---------08:39----------
practically what you're probably going


---------08:40----------
to have to do we're probably gonna take


---------08:41----------
breaths in between but when we go up


---------08:43----------
we're going to breathe in when we go


---------08:45----------
down we're gonna breathe out when we put


---------08:47----------
one leg back we're gonna breathe in when


---------08:50----------
we go down let me think about this


---------08:59----------
so yeah that's not gonna quite work so


---------09:02----------
we want to I'll tell you guys to breathe


---------09:04----------
in or breathe out and glue John Nelson


---------09:09----------
should be excavation okay so for most


---------09:12----------
poses we're gonna kind of do opposites


---------09:14----------
of breathing in and breathing out and


---------09:17----------
then for some cases we're gonna kind of


---------09:19----------
recenter and relax and start with a full


---------09:21----------
breath okay so I'll explain so the first


---------09:25----------
let's adopt our position then start


---------09:28----------
right breathing in and then out right


---------09:34----------
back out


---------09:37----------
other go down and breathe in brush up


---------09:45----------
and breathe out


---------09:49----------
buddy then I put it out breathe in and


---------10:03----------
out and then back to centre


---------10:16----------
let's do another round okay we're gonna


---------10:18----------
do two more


---------10:22----------
it can maybe doing the breath song but


---------10:24----------
who cares so breathe in out left leg


---------10:33----------
back in go in out in now and then back


---------11:04----------
to these


---------11:12----------
in the third round okay so get ready in


---------11:18----------
out in out in out in out in out back to


---------11:50----------
base


---------11:57----------
now we're going to go back into


---------11:58----------
shavasana so go ahead and lay down


---------12:15----------
and feel the vitality kind of coursing


---------12:17----------
through you is your body wakes up let's


---------12:22----------
pump it now been breathing well moving


---------12:28----------
in rid of some of the sluggishness


---------13:19----------
and now go ahead and come back it's


---------13:24----------
April 1st probably should have done


---------13:27----------

---------13:30----------

---------13:57----------
let's go ahead and build on our


---------13:59----------
meditation practice from yesterday so I


---------14:04----------
don't want you guys to take your middle


---------14:06----------
finger and place it over your forehead


---------14:20----------
start to peel the energizing between


---------14:23----------
your eyebrows


---------14:56----------
and come back down now focus on your


---------14:59----------
forehead spot between your eyebrows


---------16:34----------

---------21:47----------

---------21:54----------
that's ok baby will stream today in


---------21:56----------
accent sad yeah you guys can blame your


---------22:00----------
your colleagues for wanting to you know


---------22:03----------
learn things and be professional okay


---------22:05----------
not my fault all right so let's talk


---------22:08----------
today we're gonna talk about the pattern


---------22:10----------
model okay


---------22:10----------
so bad handwriting POG totter MA


---------22:17----------
so Dharma is the son script word for


---------22:20----------
duty or responsibility


---------22:27----------
and why is harm important so generally


---------22:33----------
speaking the compass that we use in life


---------22:35----------
in terms of like what we're trying to do


---------22:37----------
and what we're trying to not do is to


---------22:40----------
avoid pain and seek pleasure okay so


---------22:53----------
this is like this is basically how we we


---------22:55----------
live our life and this is the way that


---------22:56----------
our brain is wired okay so this is the


---------23:00----------
result of brain wiring and if we think


---------23:04----------
about this for a second you know what


---------23:05----------
are the foods that we enjoy eating and


---------23:07----------
what are the foods that we don't enjoy


---------23:08----------
eating generally speaking our brain


---------23:10----------
gravitates towards foods that are


---------23:12----------
pleasurable and away from foods that are


---------23:15----------
like unpleasurable so we you know tend


---------23:17----------
to like sweet fatty things and avoid


---------23:27----------
bitter or astringent things astringent


---------23:34----------
is actually one of the tastes that we


---------23:36----------
don't really talk about very much in the


---------23:37----------
West but there are more than five tastes


---------23:42----------
so astringent is the taste of like


---------23:47----------
unripe fruit so if you guys have like an


---------23:50----------
unripe fruit like you know it's sort of


---------23:51----------
sour but it also makes your mouth kind


---------23:53----------
of pucker or dry that taste is called


---------23:56----------
astringent so this is kind of how we're


---------23:59----------
wired like if we think about you know if


---------24:02----------
a child falls down and gets hurt that is


---------24:05----------
going to be painful and then the child


---------24:07----------
is going to avoid that and if a child


---------24:09----------
makes a step forward and is successful


---------24:12----------
you know we're gonna praise the child


---------24:14----------
and then the child is really gonna like


---------24:16----------
that and then they're gonna kind of see


---------24:19----------
go towards that right so neuro


---------24:20----------
scientifically we're wired to avoid pain


---------24:23----------
and see pleasure so what does that what


---------24:27----------
does that kind of mean for us like I


---------24:28----------
think the challenge here is that if if


---------24:30----------
we're wired to avoid pain and seek


---------24:32----------
pleasure what that means is that


---------24:34----------
essentially we're


---------24:38----------
going to avoid bad boring painful stuff


---------24:49----------
right like this is kind of this sort of


---------24:51----------
makes sense like we don't want to do


---------24:53----------
something that's gonna make us feel a


---------24:54----------
shame we don't want to do something


---------24:56----------
that's gonna make us feel fearful so


---------24:58----------
like basically what we tend to avoid is


---------25:00----------
boredom number one frustration number


---------25:05----------
two what was the third thing and wordy


---------25:12----------
number three right so like sure you can


---------25:15----------
talk about emotions like fear shame


---------25:19----------
anger but generally speaking when people


---------25:23----------
are avoiding tasks this is not actually


---------25:26----------
what their experiences this is what


---------25:28----------
their experiences right if I ask you


---------25:31----------
like why don't you go to the library day


---------25:33----------
and study your answer isn't gonna be


---------25:36----------
fear shame or anger it's gonna be


---------25:38----------
boredom like I'm bored this is boring


---------25:40----------
boring boring boring boring boring


---------25:42----------
boring boring boring boring why don't


---------25:44----------
you apply for 50 jobs because it's


---------25:46----------
frustrating frustrating frustrating


---------25:48----------
frustrating frustrating frustrating


---------25:50----------
so with this meet that like the tricky


---------25:52----------
thing though is that if we think about


---------25:54----------
moving forward in life moving forward in


---------25:56----------
life tends to so let's just talk about


---------25:58----------
pleasure for a second actually so let's


---------26:00----------
talk about pleasure and so what we do is


---------26:02----------
we seek pleasurable activities right so


---------26:04----------
this includes video games YouTube like


---------26:12----------
social media and then like you know


---------26:19----------
streaming services this can also include


---------26:24----------
drugs it can include eating unhealthy


---------26:31----------
[Music]


---------26:35----------
the last thing here I'm gonna add is


---------26:36----------
hard right and things that are kind of


---------26:40----------
pleasurable or things that are easy


---------26:42----------
right so let's include hark okay


---------26:59----------
so what this means is like your brain is


---------27:02----------
kind of wired to pick this category more


---------27:06----------
than this cat oh sorry the other way


---------27:07----------
around your brain is wired to pick this


---------27:11----------
category more than that category and


---------27:13----------
what this results in is a grand old


---------27:15----------
feeling of being oh stuck I may have to


---------27:20----------
switch to the other notes that therefore


---------27:23----------
you are stuck so your life is sort of


---------27:26----------
categorized by you know picking this


---------27:32----------
stuff over this stuff and so this is


---------27:37----------
this results in you kind of being stuck


---------27:39----------
in life you can't move forward so then


---------27:45----------
what happened this is you guys like ask


---------27:47----------
these questions right we ask all these


---------27:48----------
questions like how do i how do I switch


---------27:50----------
this around is there some way that I can


---------27:52----------
switch things around how do I get


---------27:58----------
motivation willpower discipline all this


---------28:08----------
kind of stuff right this is where you


---------28:10----------
guys think the answer is because what


---------28:12----------
you do is you observe some people in the


---------28:14----------
outside world and the people that that


---------28:17----------
actually manage to do this your


---------28:24----------
perception is that this is motivation


---------28:29----------
will or this one or all that good stuff


---------28:34----------
or smart your perception is that this is


---------28:40----------
basically pick your positive trait that


---------28:43----------
you do not have that's what our mind


---------28:45----------
does right we


---------28:47----------
look at this curve and we say like oh


---------28:49----------
that person is and you can you can


---------28:51----------
insert whatever you want to you can


---------28:52----------
insert any positive trait that you like


---------29:02----------
it's kind of interesting right and you


---------29:04----------
say oh like that person is disciplined


---------29:06----------
and I'm not and that's why this person


---------29:09----------
has is successful when I'm not okay now


---------29:12----------
the question is is so like the problem


---------29:15----------
with this is like how do you how do you


---------29:17----------
get this stuff right I mean this stuff


---------29:20----------
up here on the top right like how do you


---------29:22----------
get this it's hard so you guys can talk


---------29:26----------
about like we can talk about motivation


---------29:27----------
willpower discipline we have and you can


---------29:29----------
work on those things and those do help


---------29:31----------
but what I really like about Parma is if


---------29:35----------
you guys want to turn this thing around


---------29:38----------
thought of us the easy way to do it


---------29:41----------
so Dharma is the force that allows you


---------29:44----------
to pick this stuff over this stuff


---------29:47----------
without willpower motivation etc Dharma


---------29:55----------
is the thing that naturally causes you


---------29:57----------
to not necessarily seek pain but let's


---------30:02----------
put it accept pain and give up pleasure


---------30:10----------
this is what the enema allows you to do


---------30:13----------
okay so let's talk a little bit about


---------30:16----------
how that happens so I've told this story


---------30:19----------
several times but like let's let's talk


---------30:21----------
about something that's a little bit more


---------30:23----------
timely so let's say that you're you know


---------30:26----------
so I've seen some of these things on


---------30:27----------
social media and stuff but let's say you


---------30:29----------
that you're a doctor and so if you're a


---------30:31----------
doctor you do a lot of things that


---------30:33----------
actually like really suck so good


---------30:35----------
examples are 24-hour calls other


---------30:40----------
examples are dealing with insurance


---------30:42----------
companies one of my least favorites


---------30:50----------
okay Oh etc


---------30:55----------
so and then like nowadays you know like


---------30:58----------
doctors are even like separated from


---------30:59----------
their own families because of COBIT and


---------31:01----------
stuff like that and so the question is


---------31:04----------
like how are you able to do this so


---------31:05----------
there's definitely like you know a lot


---------31:07----------
of things that allow you to do this so


---------31:09----------
one is money


---------31:10----------
one is prestige right there are all


---------31:14----------
kinds of things that like will gravitate


---------31:16----------
towards this so you can say this is kind


---------31:18----------
of long-term stuff but generally in my


---------31:20----------
experience when you're actually on call


---------31:23----------
and you know when you're in our 22 of


---------31:27----------
call when you're like at our 22 and then


---------31:32----------
like why why is it that you're able to


---------31:33----------
like function there it's because you


---------31:37----------
know there's a patient who needs you


---------31:38----------
[Music]


---------31:41----------
and if you guys think about this like


---------31:45----------
you actually do a good job when there's


---------31:46----------
someone who needs you so if you think


---------31:58----------
about it this causes you to be your best


---------32:01----------
self


---------32:04----------
this is what kind of brings the best


---------32:06----------
part out of you right like you won't


---------32:07----------
cook a meal for yourself but I mean I


---------32:09----------
mean I'm sure a lot of you do but if you


---------32:11----------
think about like you know cooking a


---------32:12----------
fresh home-cooked meal for someone who's


---------32:15----------
sick that's that allows you to like wake


---------32:19----------
up or go to the grocery store or cook


---------32:21----------
for them and deliver it to them like if


---------32:22----------
a friend of yours needs help moving


---------32:24----------
moving or they need help with this or


---------32:26----------
that or like you your best self often


---------32:28----------
comes out due to someone needing you


---------32:31----------
because that's like your duty or


---------32:32----------
responsibility and I'll give you guys


---------32:35----------
just kind of a another sort of classic


---------32:37----------
example so this is the one that I


---------32:39----------
usually use so let's say that there's a


---------32:41----------
gun okay and let's say here is me and


---------32:48----------
generally speaking you know our response


---------32:52----------
is to run away from the gun I suppose I


---------32:55----------
should label this in case people don't


---------32:57----------
have audio because what does the gun


---------32:59----------
mean the gun means pain death suffering


---------33:05----------
kind of lost opportunity and so


---------33:12----------
basically what I want to do this is


---------33:17----------
moving okay is run away from the gun


---------33:21----------
and if we think about it this is a


---------33:23----------
no-brainer like facing a gun can be


---------33:25----------
really really hard and our instinctive


---------33:27----------
reaction is to run away right so then


---------33:29----------
I'm running away from this so what


---------33:32----------
happens if my kid is involved right so


---------33:36----------
suddenly like this actually gets worse


---------33:38----------
like everything here increases once you


---------33:41----------
add my kid to this scenario but how do


---------33:43----------
my actions change right suddenly instead


---------33:48----------
of running away moving toward the gun so


---------33:55----------
if you just think about it like this


---------33:56----------
isn't complicated the stimulus is the


---------34:00----------
same in fact the stimulus is even worse


---------34:02----------
but our natural inclination changes


---------34:06----------
drastically


---------34:07----------
once our power mode becomes involved and


---------34:09----------
this is the essence of it like it's not


---------34:11----------
that complicated


---------34:12----------
Dharma is that which allows you to


---------34:16----------
accept pain and give up pleasure and the


---------34:20----------
problem right now is that you guys don't


---------34:21----------
accept pain and give up pleasure you


---------34:23----------
avoid pain and you seek pleasure which


---------34:26----------
keeps you doing these kinds of


---------34:27----------
activities and so the secret of Dharma


---------34:30----------
is that once you find your Dharma like


---------34:33----------
you're able to do you're able to make


---------34:35----------
this choice more and more and more right


---------34:40----------
this choice becomes easier you start to


---------34:42----------
pick this instead of this and so the


---------34:48----------
question that becomes so we're gonna see


---------34:51----------
if okay so hmm I wonder if we should do


---------34:53----------
questions as we go so let's just pause


---------34:55----------
there for a second I'm gonna invite


---------34:59----------
Casper Thomas and Lucas okay let's have


---------35:06----------
them do hop in to do questions and then


---------35:09----------
I'm gonna keep talking so we're gonna


---------35:11----------
try something a little bit different


---------35:12----------
today okay so try to keep try to keep


---------35:16----------
your


---------35:19----------
questions topic focus please


---------35:24----------
so that's okay you can accept pain and


---------35:27----------
accept pleasure so let's let's just


---------35:29----------
think so then the question becomes so


---------35:30----------
now a lot of people have a question for


---------35:32----------
me which is like I've talked about


---------35:33----------
antara a lot on stream so then the next


---------35:35----------
question becomes how do I fine what's


---------35:44----------
wrong with this find my the Dharma okay


---------35:52----------
I see we're getting a lot of questions


---------35:57----------
hold on do I need to turn off screen


---------35:59----------
share to talk to people let's see let's


---------36:03----------
see what happens yeah I pick randomly


---------36:07----------
[Music]


---------36:09----------
yeah sure it would be smarter to grab


---------36:11----------
the kid and run but I mean my point is


---------36:14----------
that that I'm facing the danger whereas


---------36:17----------
before I was running away from it and


---------36:19----------
even if that involves running away from


---------36:20----------
it but it's like I'm gonna put myself


---------36:22----------
between the kid in the gun so let's talk


---------36:26----------
a little bit about and we'll see this is


---------36:28----------
this working in terms of questions do I


---------36:30----------
need to turn off screen share let's see


---------36:32----------
for a second okay


---------36:48----------
okay I don't know why people aren't able


---------36:51----------
to get in I'm gonna invite a lot Elias


---------36:56----------
Thomas and Joe


---------36:59----------
[Music]


---------37:13----------
okay I don't know what's the deal there


---------37:18----------
okay here we go


---------37:20----------
Eliza's in the room


---------37:30----------
isn't this is kind of distracting


---------37:32----------
absolutely so I'm trying something new


---------37:34----------
we're gonna see if we can sort of flow


---------37:36----------
questions in and simulate more of a


---------37:38----------
classroom environment cuz usually when I


---------37:40----------
teach I'm kind of like I answer


---------37:42----------
questions as people raise their hands so


---------37:44----------
I'm gonna try that and see how this


---------37:46----------
works okay now everyone's flooding in


---------37:47----------
alright so we'll give people just a


---------37:49----------
second and then we'll get how do we find


---------37:51----------
our Dharma we'll try this and then at


---------37:54----------
the end I'll pull you guys about whether


---------37:56----------
you want to take questions at the end or


---------37:58----------
you guys like questions in the middle am


---------38:07----------
I free to speak or yeah go for it


---------38:10----------
oh okay so I guess my question is like


---------38:15----------
the presumption of Dharma is that you're


---------38:18----------
going to be like more motivated to seek


---------38:22----------
discomfort because you're doing it for


---------38:24----------
like the benefit of somebody else but


---------38:28----------
what if like you aren't


---------38:29----------
I mean suppose somebody isn't motivated


---------38:32----------
to help others like do you like is it


---------38:35----------
possible that there are people like that


---------38:36----------
in Chapter one including me and what


---------38:40----------
would your Dharma be in that case so


---------38:42----------
your Dharma isn't necessarily to help


---------38:44----------
other people my point is that Dharma is


---------38:47----------
what allows you to accept pain and give


---------38:52----------
up pleasure so for example we'll get to


---------38:54----------
this in a second so I think that the


---------38:57----------
reason I use the example of helping


---------38:59----------
others is because it's something that


---------39:00----------
people can clearly understand like in my


---------39:04----------
scenario why I would want to avoid a gun


---------39:06----------
and then why I would want to step in


---------39:08----------
front of a gun like it in one moment it


---------39:11----------
flips around what my natural inclination


---------39:13----------
is and what I do right so but that's


---------39:17----------
just one example of Dharma there are all


---------39:19----------
kinds of Karma's so the second thing is


---------39:21----------
like what if your entire mo what if you


---------39:22----------
don't like helping people


---------39:24----------
I don't think helping people is Dharma


---------39:26----------
so the question is is there anyone in


---------39:28----------
life that you have a duty or


---------39:30----------
responsibility to support or help and if


---------39:34----------
you don't that's okay so I think that


---------39:37----------
like this is also where I haven't harm


---------39:39----------
up to my kid because I have a kid if I


---------39:41----------
didn't have a kid I wouldn't have much


---------39:42----------
to a kid


---------39:44----------
so I don't think that it's just helping


---------39:46----------
people and we'll kind of get to that


---------39:47----------
like how do you find your Dharma I think


---------39:49----------
you can absolutely have a tottemo to


---------39:51----------
yourself or you can have a Dharma to a


---------39:53----------
call like a calling right so you can so


---------39:57----------
we'll kind of get to this but I think


---------39:59----------
that like for a lot of you guys your


---------40:01----------
Dharma is actually to study and grow and


---------40:04----------
develop yourself and we'll talk a little


---------40:06----------
bit more about how to focus that but


---------40:08----------
you're the hard one doesn't have to be


---------40:09----------
to help other people like there are


---------40:11----------
monks who are sitting in the Himalayas


---------40:12----------
who are like sitting in caves and


---------40:14----------
meditating all day that's their Dharma


---------40:16----------
but their Dharma doesn't involve any


---------40:18----------
other people they don't see people for


---------40:19----------
like decades and that's completely fine


---------40:22----------
hmm okay thank you right so you can be


---------40:25----------
like an author in a cabin in the woods


---------40:27----------
and in your heart you have a story to


---------40:30----------
tell and that's what you devote yourself


---------40:33----------
to and it doesn't involve other people


---------40:34----------
it's just there's a story that lives


---------40:36----------
within you that you need to like birth


---------40:38----------
and bring into the world which is a


---------40:40----------
completely acceptable thought ah yeah


---------40:44----------
the author example makes it clear Thanks


---------40:47----------
yeah so it doesn't have to be to help


---------40:48----------
people that's just the simplest example


---------40:50----------
that people can understand great


---------40:51----------
question thank you thank you all right


---------40:54----------
we're gonna go with Alexander yeah near


---------40:59----------
me yeah yeah all right um so I'm just


---------41:01----------
having some difficulty figuring out what


---------41:04----------
my Dharma is I guess sure because I I'm


---------41:09----------
doing all kinds of things in my life


---------41:11----------
that like I don't know I feel like I


---------41:13----------
started doing them because my parents


---------41:15----------
wanted me to like I'm 29 and I work as a


---------41:17----------
software developer


---------41:19----------
and I'm building a house and I don't


---------41:22----------
know just like a lot of things are going


---------41:25----------
right but like I'm still getting over


---------41:27----------
depression it's though so I don't I


---------41:29----------
don't know what my Dharma is in all of


---------41:31----------
this I guess it's just their short way


---------41:33----------
to put it and it's still very taxing


---------41:37----------
sometimes like I'm I'm really rough hard


---------41:40----------
on myself and yeah I don't know I just


---------41:44----------
think is like I don't see my Dharma in


---------41:47----------
this situation that they're still


---------41:49----------
difficulty and like doing all these


---------41:52----------
tasks and not feeling like pressured and


---------41:55----------
yeah yes the first thing is


---------41:58----------
you know whether you feel difficulty or


---------42:01----------
not is irrespective of your Dharma right


---------42:04----------
so the whole point behind Dharma is it's


---------42:06----------
that which allows you to choose the


---------42:09----------
difficult path instead of the easier


---------42:10----------
path now in your case I think that this


---------42:13----------
sort of makes sense


---------42:15----------
and I don't know exactly what so we'll


---------42:17----------
kind of get to how to find your Dharma


---------42:19----------
that's really why we're sort of doing a


---------42:20----------
lecture about this but you know I I


---------42:23----------
think that my question to you would be


---------42:26----------
like is there some is there any kind of


---------42:28----------
calling that you have like what is it


---------42:30----------
that that when you kind of when you


---------42:33----------
think about your life and you think like


---------42:35----------
I wish I dot dot dot how do you finish


---------42:38----------
that sentence mm-hmm and the answer is a


---------42:42----------
negative that's not sufficient right I


---------42:45----------
wish I didn't work as a computer


---------42:47----------
programmer like that's not a sufficient


---------42:49----------
like the question is I wish I what yeah


---------42:52----------
I I wish I could travel more or could


---------42:56----------
help people more like yeah okay I want


---------43:01----------
one of those like I feel strongly about


---------43:02----------
both of those I think the traveling is


---------43:05----------
mostly because it just gets me into a


---------43:07----------
place where I feel more comfortable so I


---------43:10----------
don't think that's like the right one I


---------43:12----------
think the right one is like helping


---------43:13----------
people more because like in the past


---------43:15----------
I've needed help okay and okay like I


---------43:19----------
didn't get it for a very long time until


---------43:21----------
like two years ago I finally did but


---------43:23----------
yeah so Alexander I think unfortunately


---------43:26----------
answering your question is gonna take up


---------43:29----------
because it's sort of an individual


---------43:31----------
explanation and I want to focus on broad


---------43:33----------
principles that apply to other people so


---------43:36----------
I'd say like hopefully the rest of the


---------43:37----------
lecture is gonna be helpful to you but


---------43:40----------
I'd say that further and we'll kind of


---------43:41----------
get to this like I'm gonna talk about a


---------43:43----------
couple of things which I want you to


---------43:44----------
kind of keep an eye out for the first is


---------43:46----------
that karma and karma are related and


---------43:48----------
we'll get to that and that you know your


---------43:52----------
Dharma is not something that it's not


---------43:54----------
like you wake up one day and you find a


---------43:55----------
Dharma and then you're set for life like


---------43:57----------
that's not how it works


---------43:58----------
it's sort of an evolving process where


---------44:00----------
right now your thought are Mazda find


---------44:02----------
your Dharma and oddly enough I wouldn't


---------44:04----------
say that you should focus on helping


---------44:05----------
people unless you actually have a way to


---------44:07----------
help people like that it's gonna come


---------44:09----------
later so I've always wanted to help


---------44:11----------
people too


---------44:11----------
but helping people involved becoming


---------44:14----------
qualified to help people in a particular


---------44:16----------
way first right so like one thing that I


---------44:19----------
can just think of is if you're a


---------44:20----------
programmer there are a couple hundred


---------44:21----------
people on our discord that are like


---------44:24----------
meets and they don't they want to learn


---------44:26----------
programming so I think our mods actually


---------44:28----------
put together a programming workshop so


---------44:31----------
that's an example of like a group of


---------44:32----------
people in our community stepped up and


---------44:34----------
realize that they're like hundreds or


---------44:37----------
thousands of people in our community


---------44:38----------
that are stuck and that they can


---------44:40----------
actually help them by teaching the


---------44:41----------
programming I think that that's a


---------44:43----------
wonderful example of like living your


---------44:45----------
Dharma in the moment


---------44:47----------
oddly enough I'd recommend that if you


---------44:49----------
should if you want to travel you should


---------44:50----------
probably travel actually rather than


---------44:52----------
trying to help people because trying to


---------44:53----------
help people just sort of randomly it's


---------44:54----------
not like it's not like I'm gonna go you


---------44:58----------
know I'm not gonna go looking for people


---------45:00----------
I mean I guess unless I'm Batman I'm not


---------45:01----------
gonna go looking for people who are like


---------45:03----------
pointing guns at other people and try to


---------45:05----------
step in their path like arbitrary


---------45:06----------
helping arbitrarily helping people is


---------45:08----------
just that's not Dharma alright I use


---------45:11----------
that because I have a specific duty and


---------45:13----------
the issue is that you probably you want


---------45:15----------
to help people but who do who do you


---------45:16----------
have a specific duty to help do you have


---------45:18----------
anyone not you should be it's kind of I


---------45:21----------
guess like we'd have to get pretty deep


---------45:23----------
into it but I've been two years sober so


---------45:26----------
I go to like a a meeting so like there's


---------45:28----------
opportunities there yeah so that's so


---------45:31----------
that's the kind of question you should


---------45:33----------
be asking yourself right it's like what


---------45:35----------
what in this moment who can I help and


---------45:37----------
if the answer is like not really many


---------45:39----------
people then I would focus on travel okay


---------45:44----------
yeah alright take care man thank you


---------45:46----------
yeah a nice trip buddy thanks David


---------45:55----------
hello Hey okay so you can hear me yep


---------46:00----------
sorry little nervous so my question


---------46:04----------
isn't as broad as I don't you might not


---------46:08----------
like but uh about like a little over a


---------46:11----------
year ago my grandpa passed away and I


---------46:13----------
don't know so now it's just me and my


---------46:15----------
grandma and I feel like I have a Dharma


---------46:19----------
to kind of like step up and like fill


---------46:23----------
the shoes that


---------46:25----------
did around the house sorry I'm just kind


---------46:29----------
of like but my mom isn't kind of like


---------46:34----------
she doesn't want that she's kind of like


---------46:35----------
she's taking on their responsibilities


---------46:37----------
like I'm the parent like I want you to I


---------46:40----------
can go on and live your life and do all


---------46:42----------
that stuff but like I want to figure out


---------46:47----------
like how I can start that conversation


---------46:49----------
with her start which conversation with


---------46:52----------
her like that I'm okay like setting


---------46:58----------
aside my life for now like to kind of


---------47:00----------
like help her out because I feel like


---------47:02----------
that's like what I have to do okay so I


---------47:08----------
think I mean so your question is not


---------47:11----------
your question is about how to have a


---------47:13----------
conversation with your mom about what


---------47:15----------
you feel your Dharma is well like I feel


---------47:18----------
like I have a Dharma to her and I'm not


---------47:21----------
is that like reasonable sure what is


---------47:25----------
your Dharma to her to to provide as


---------47:29----------
she's she's smoked for a long time so


---------47:32----------
she's like had really bad lungs and she


---------47:35----------
needs like oxygen tanks and so and what


---------47:37----------
is she what is your mom advocating that


---------47:39----------
you do she she says that she doesn't


---------47:43----------
want to like she she actually broke down


---------47:46----------
once and saying that they she doesn't


---------47:48----------
want to have to put that was


---------47:49----------
responsibility onto me okay


---------47:52----------
and so but what does your mom want you


---------47:55----------
to do I'm not sure I'm the prep chef


---------48:00----------
okay so you said earlier that you're she


---------48:04----------
wants you to kind of like go live your


---------48:06----------
life and don't stay back because of her


---------48:08----------
right and your grandmother you kind of


---------48:11----------
suggest you kind of suggest to that so I


---------48:13----------
think the first thing is that like you


---------48:14----------
guys need to have a conversation about


---------48:16----------
what your wants are right so you should


---------48:18----------
ask her what do you want my life to be


---------48:20----------
and what do you should think about what


---------48:23----------
you want your life to be now let me ask


---------48:24----------
you something so Dharma allows us to


---------48:29----------
accept negative emotions or avoid


---------48:31----------
negative emotions accept them okay so if


---------48:35----------
you left your family how old are you


---------48:37----------
David


---------48:37----------
21


---------48:38----------
okay and what are your options for


---------48:40----------
leaving your family like what would you


---------48:41----------
do I'd have to I guess find an apartment


---------48:44----------
I just live by myself okay like would


---------48:47----------
you go to school or get a job or like


---------48:49----------
what is what if you lived for yourself


---------48:52----------
what would that look like I I do have a


---------48:55----------
job but it's closed down because of


---------48:56----------
covent sure but what would living for


---------48:59----------
like is not sacrificing for your family


---------49:01----------
what would that look like for you I'm


---------49:04----------
not sure really okay so if you moved out


---------49:08----------
on your own and started to live your


---------49:09----------
life how would you feel probably good


---------49:13----------
like pretty bored because there's not


---------49:17----------
like my grandma to just like if I'm on


---------49:20----------
the computer I can't just like get up


---------49:21----------
and go talk to her what I want and then


---------49:25----------
like if I live on my own it's just kind


---------49:26----------
of like I'm just there by myself okay so


---------49:31----------
I so at first I hadn't understood your


---------49:34----------
question to be sort of like a conflict


---------49:36----------
of Dharma like do you live your own life


---------49:38----------
or do you live a life sort of helping


---------49:41----------
out your family and I thought that there


---------49:43----------
was a conflict there but the more that


---------49:45----------
I'm asking you it doesn't seem like


---------49:46----------
there's actually a conflict there okay


---------49:50----------
like what do you think I like I'm just


---------49:54----------
not so like I don't know how to feel


---------49:57----------
about it okay so so my thought is that


---------50:03----------
the first thing that you should do is


---------50:04----------
and I think you asked a good question


---------50:06----------
you were like I'm trying to figure out


---------50:07----------
how to talk to her you've got to talk to


---------50:08----------
your family about this stuff mm-hmm


---------50:10----------
right like you guys have to sit down and


---------50:12----------
you got to say mom I'd like to try to


---------50:13----------
understand what the next five years of


---------50:16----------
our lives are gonna look like and then


---------50:20----------
you guys have to sit down it sounds like


---------50:22----------
you guys and this is hard because people


---------50:23----------
you know don't oftentimes don't have


---------50:25----------
conversations like this and there are


---------50:27----------
all these feelings of guilt and stuff


---------50:29----------
like that and and then you can you guys


---------50:31----------
can run through different scenarios so


---------50:32----------
you can say like option one is I stay at


---------50:35----------
home and then how does that make you


---------50:37----------
feel and what does that look like how


---------50:39----------
does that make me feel how does that


---------50:41----------
make grandma feel and then option two is


---------50:44----------
that I move out of the house how does


---------50:47----------
that make you feel how does that make me


---------50:49----------
feel how does that make grandma feel and


---------50:51----------
what is that


---------50:52----------
like and just because people so the the


---------50:56----------
tricky thing here is I I mean I was


---------50:57----------
shooting for some point which I don't


---------50:59----------
think your is applicable to you but I I


---------51:02----------
want you guys to notice that in David's


---------51:04----------
case what path I mean he says that


---------51:08----------
moving out makes him feel pretty good


---------51:09----------
but like I was envisioning that moving


---------51:11----------
out would make him feel guilty yeah if


---------51:13----------
we really think about karma Dharma lets


---------51:16----------
us accept guilt that's exactly what it


---------51:18----------
does right so right now you not moving


---------51:21----------
out it has something to do with guilty


---------51:24----------
like keeping you at home you see that


---------51:26----------
it's actually avoidance of the guilt


---------51:29----------
that keeps you stuck at home and so you


---------51:32----------
would think that the right thing to do


---------51:34----------
is to stay at home but now this is where


---------51:37----------
you really have to tunnel down into


---------51:38----------
yourself and ask yourself am I staying


---------51:40----------
at home because it's the right thing to


---------51:42----------
do or am i staying home because if it


---------51:45----------
staying home protects me from guilt


---------51:48----------
because the right thing to do may


---------51:50----------
actually be to move out but like moving


---------51:52----------
out involves accepting that guilt and


---------51:54----------
like letting your family fend for


---------51:56----------
themselves or acknowledging that like


---------51:58----------
given your your family's earning power


---------52:00----------
spending a few years going to college


---------52:02----------
and getting a decent job and making like


---------52:04----------
60 K or 100k a year is actually gonna be


---------52:08----------
far better for your family starting at


---------52:10----------
the age of 25 I don't know what kind of


---------52:12----------
work you do or how much you make or


---------52:13----------
things like that but it's a very it's a


---------52:15----------
very possible scenario that investing in


---------52:18----------
yourself is the best thing you can do


---------52:20----------
for your family mm-hmm also


---------52:23----------
unfortunately I don't really know how


---------52:24----------
much longer she has left because she's


---------52:27----------
she's getting up there and she's been


---------52:29----------
it's like she's smoked her entire life


---------52:31----------
so sure so you don't know how so so all


---------52:34----------
that tells me is that it would make you


---------52:37----------
feel more guilty if you left yeah and


---------52:41----------
just because you feel guilty doesn't


---------52:43----------
mean that it's the right or the wrong


---------52:44----------
thing to do so this is why you need to


---------52:46----------
have a conversation with your mom and so


---------52:49----------
I'm gonna leave you with one last


---------52:50----------
question if you were have you graduated


---------52:53----------
from college no okay I did go for a


---------52:57----------
semester but then I I deserted so so


---------53:00----------
then let me ask you something when your


---------53:02----------
mom passes away what do you think will


---------53:05----------
give her more come


---------53:06----------
effort seeing you living at home working


---------53:08----------
whatever job you're working are well on


---------53:10----------
your way to like becoming a successful


---------53:12----------
human who can provide for your family in


---------53:15----------
a very comfortable way okay right so


---------53:21----------
Dharma is tricky and and I'm not saying


---------53:26----------
you should abandon your mom but you


---------53:28----------
really have to think about like what is


---------53:29----------
your Dharma to her and what is her


---------53:30----------
thought about to you what has heard the


---------53:32----------
hunter MOT to you it's to provide for


---------53:35----------
you and set you up in a life that is


---------53:38----------
like that you can be successful and have


---------53:42----------
kids of your own and to create a she


---------53:44----------
wants to create a life for you that is


---------53:46----------
different she wants you to have a life


---------53:49----------
that is different from her life right


---------53:52----------
she wants you to be healthy and stable


---------53:55----------
so that your kids don't have to worry


---------53:56----------
about worrying about you hmm


---------53:58----------
this is a conversation that you need to


---------54:01----------
have with her and as bizarre as it


---------54:05----------
sounds I'd be really careful because


---------54:06----------
this is the tricky thing everyone says


---------54:08----------
the right thing to do is to stay with


---------54:10----------
your mom for her last year's where she's


---------54:12----------
infirm and needs your help and is dying


---------54:14----------
and then Jill never gonna see her again


---------54:16----------
makes perfect sense is kind of like


---------54:17----------
objectively correct and your Dharma may


---------54:20----------
be different your Dharma may be to start


---------54:23----------
to build a life for yourself and


---------54:25----------
recognize that it's your karma in her


---------54:28----------
karma that she doesn't have much time


---------54:30----------
left on this earth so you call her every


---------54:32----------
day or maybe you stay at home or


---------54:33----------
whatever you guys have to talk this


---------54:35----------
through and figure out like what the


---------54:36----------
what the path is because I'm pretty sure


---------54:39----------
that you know what as a parent I can


---------54:42----------
tell you that like I could give two


---------54:43----------
shits about my own happiness like I


---------54:46----------
don't want my kids to take care of me


---------54:48----------
like I don't care about that like I want


---------54:51----------
them to live their lives and be


---------54:52----------
successful like that's what's gonna make


---------54:54----------
me happy like does it make me happy to


---------54:57----------
see them every day absolutely but like


---------55:00----------
that is pleasure my Dharma


---------55:03----------
fulfilling my Dharma to my kids is


---------55:05----------
letting them live their own lives and


---------55:07----------
that's gonna be so much more satisfying


---------55:09----------
than just having them around


---------55:13----------
I'm getting some kind of feedback so for


---------55:16----------
me


---------55:17----------
I'm not sure but look alright David so


---------55:21----------
think about that okay and I think you


---------55:23----------
have to have a conversation with her


---------55:25----------
okay and and that conversation is


---------55:28----------
important now because if she doesn't


---------55:29----------
have long to live then you've got to


---------55:32----------
really think about what does she want


---------55:34----------
how secure or worried is she gonna be


---------55:38----------
about your future when she passes away


---------55:41----------
and probably the best thing that you can


---------55:43----------
do for her is for her to not worry about


---------55:46----------
you when you're passing went when you're


---------55:49----------
passed when she passes away and I had to


---------55:51----------
mute you so we can't hear you but you


---------55:53----------
can turn it on again because you were we


---------55:55----------
were getting feedback okay sorry about


---------55:58----------
so so closing thoughts before we give


---------56:00----------
you the boot yeah I guess I'll talk I'll


---------56:05----------
read it we'll try to have more talks I


---------56:07----------
guess but okay gonna take a while good


---------56:10----------
luck man thank you bye okay we're gonna


---------56:14----------
go ahead and do Joe Joe if you're around


---------56:16----------
and then we're gonna get back to the


---------56:17----------
lecture because this stuff wait do you


---------56:18----------
want go for it jack yeah sure I can hear


---------56:21----------
me yep awesome


---------56:24----------
cool so yeah I kinda have like two


---------56:28----------
directions I might want to ask questions


---------56:30----------
in one is sort of confirming like if I


---------56:34----------
can have a Dharma to like sort of them I


---------56:36----------
don't want to call it an abusive


---------56:38----------
relationship because I think the person


---------56:40----------
the more I look into it the more I think


---------56:42----------
they might have like some semblance of


---------56:44----------
like DPD but it seems like for


---------56:47----------
historically my relationships I've kind


---------56:50----------
of been in longer than people would


---------56:52----------
recommend you know like people are like


---------56:55----------
why are you still with this participant


---------56:57----------
I'm just like I don't know I just feel


---------56:59----------
this obligation and then another another


---------57:03----------
one is a sorry yeah my connection seems


---------57:06----------
low at the moment so I'm on the only so


---------57:08----------
on so the other one is so kind of after


---------57:13----------
like finding you and was in a rut for a


---------57:16----------
while and kind of used some Dharma and


---------57:19----------
meditation and stuff that kind of like


---------57:20----------
180 which was cool and then I I sort of


---------57:24----------
realized that well


---------57:27----------
I don't know it people just started


---------57:29----------
coming to me for help like I don't I


---------57:31----------
don't understand it and sure yeah I've


---------57:33----------
helped people in this discord and my


---------57:34----------
friends and all kind


---------57:36----------
I sort of abandoning my like career


---------57:39----------
dream of being a project manager that


---------57:41----------
I've wanted for like two years and I


---------57:42----------
just want to be a life coach and I want


---------57:44----------
to like start my own business so I took


---------57:45----------
a leave of absence from work because


---------57:47----------
it's kind of like too distracting and


---------57:49----------
I'm just purely focused on that but I'm


---------57:52----------
still not so I feel like that's my


---------57:53----------
Dharma is to like just become a life


---------57:55----------
coach and to help people and kind of do


---------57:56----------
what you do and the issue though is I'm


---------58:00----------
I have a lot I need to do to like be an


---------58:04----------
entrepreneur and like launch a website


---------58:05----------
and like there's it I don't know it


---------58:08----------
seems like it's my Dharma but I'm not


---------58:10----------
really doing the thing you know that I


---------58:13----------
needed sure so so those are our we're


---------58:17----------
gonna get to answering your question in


---------58:18----------
a moment but Jo so first of all huge


---------58:21----------
congrats on on turning your life around


---------58:23----------
and being inspired and helping other


---------58:25----------
people that's awesome so that's like the


---------58:27----------
whole you know there's a Oh a healing


---------58:28----------
and then there's also training other


---------58:29----------
healers my sense is that I would not


---------58:33----------
abandon a career for the sake of your


---------58:35----------
Dharma until it's absolutely ready right


---------58:38----------
so like I think this is where you have


---------58:39----------
to be really really careful because if


---------58:41----------
you actually want to be successful at


---------58:44----------
helping people you may need like


---------58:46----------
financial stability in order to build


---------58:48----------
your thing off of the ground yeah so


---------58:50----------
like I'll give you a good example I


---------58:52----------
don't think that like I think that the


---------58:54----------
people who suffer the most and get the


---------58:56----------
most stuck in life are paid yoga


---------58:58----------
teachers so people fall in love with


---------59:01----------
yoga and they're like oh I love yoga I


---------59:03----------
want to do this all day every day I want


---------59:05----------
it to be my job and then they like try


---------59:06----------
to like become a paid yoga teacher and


---------59:08----------
it's a pay very well and then all kinds


---------59:11----------
of other things like get in the way of


---------59:13----------
them being able to just teach yoga


---------59:16----------
purely it starts to become a business


---------59:18----------
they have to worry about paying bills


---------59:19----------
they start worrying about marketing they


---------59:21----------
become entrepreneurs and some of them


---------59:24----------
really like it and some of them are very


---------59:25----------
successful that's probably like 1% and


---------59:27----------
99% of them are kind of like hustling


---------59:30----------
and moving from paycheck to paycheck and


---------59:32----------
it's not a very good life I also think


---------59:34----------
that in general helping other people


---------59:37----------
should not be a livelihood so I think


---------59:40----------
that


---------59:40----------
your incentives are gonna get really


---------59:44----------
really misaligned if you depend on


---------59:47----------
helping people for your income okay I


---------59:51----------
know that sounds really weird so I'd say


---------59:53----------
that also if you're if your dream is to


---------59:55----------
be a product manager like I don't know


---------59:58----------
what you mean like not it so really it


---------60:01----------
was the first thing that resonated with


---------60:03----------
me as far like I've just been doing


---------60:04----------
customer service for like so long and


---------60:06----------
then and then this thing sort of opened


---------60:08----------
up and like I kind of looked at some of


---------60:10----------
my core like values you had an exercise


---------60:12----------
that you told people to do at some point


---------60:14----------
like right down when you last felt


---------60:15----------
fulfilled and I found a lot of my values


---------60:17----------
from that and then I looked at the


---------60:19----------
project management I was like oh this


---------60:21----------
checks about half the boxes and then I


---------60:23----------
looked at like just talking to people


---------60:25----------
and like and just either like a mentor


---------60:28----------
mentee relationship or like whatever


---------60:30----------
types of stuff


---------60:31----------
those were way more hooking into all my


---------60:34----------
values so yeah this is what I would say


---------60:36----------
if you if you're on the path to become a


---------60:38----------
product manager I would actually


---------60:40----------
recommend that you select what's what


---------60:43----------
wouldn't what would be okay I so I'm


---------60:46----------
completely so it's like I'm I have I


---------60:48----------
have tried to hit that ceiling like so


---------60:50----------
many times and I just I've given up


---------60:52----------
like I just can't okay so I mean I think


---------60:54----------
that's a little bit different I mean my


---------60:56----------
thought would be that you know if you


---------60:57----------
want to become a life coach go for it


---------60:59----------
it's a crowded space and it's hard to


---------61:01----------
make money and and so you know generally


---------61:04----------
I also think that like helping people is


---------61:06----------
something that you can definitely get


---------61:08----------
compensated for but I think that like


---------61:10----------
you should be careful about your


---------61:12----------
incentives so I think part of what makes


---------61:13----------
healthy gamer good is that I have a job


---------61:17----------
that supports my family this is my side


---------61:19----------
gig and I find that having it as your


---------61:22----------
side gig allows you to not have perverse


---------61:25----------
incentives around helping people yeah


---------61:28----------
I think what I want to do is create is


---------61:30----------
like sort of get the ball rolling so to


---------61:33----------
speak like deploy like the website get


---------61:35----------
stuff kind of out there get this sort of


---------61:37----------
foundational work done and then go back


---------61:40----------
to work and then kind of make still do


---------61:42----------
like 40 goes week Joe are you looking


---------61:45----------
for my blessing are you looking for I'm


---------61:47----------
trying to understand why I'm so I want


---------61:51----------
to do the foundational work and then go


---------61:53----------
back


---------61:54----------
resume by working my career but what I


---------61:57----------
don't understand is I'm not like so it


---------62:00----------
seems like it's my Dharma but I'm not


---------62:02----------
doing it like I'm like I'm I have time


---------62:04----------
and I'm not doing it I'm doing I'm


---------62:07----------
choosing to do other things yes so that


---------62:09----------
I'm not quite sure so I I don't know I


---------62:12----------
think this is I don't know if it seems


---------62:14----------
compellingly overwhelmingly the case


---------62:16----------
that it's my Dharma but it doesn't seem


---------62:18----------
to be having the impact arm it does so


---------62:21----------
then I I don't think it's I think you


---------62:23----------
need to explore more of what your


---------62:24----------
autonomy is I think the other way to


---------62:26----------
think about it is like instead of


---------62:28----------
instead of getting either pleasurable


---------62:30----------
thing which is like getting your life


---------62:32----------
coach website off the ground which would


---------62:35----------
be satisfying and gratifying to you you


---------62:37----------
should do the difficult thing which is


---------62:39----------
devote yourself to being a product


---------62:41----------
manager and understand that like the


---------62:43----------
reason that being a product manager


---------62:45----------
doesn't work for you is because it's not


---------62:47----------
in service to something else right so


---------62:50----------
being a product manager is going to


---------62:52----------
serve your goal of helping other people


---------62:55----------
and then you start helping people like


---------62:56----------
in the way that you have been on our


---------62:58----------
discord signed up to be a recovery coach


---------62:59----------
or something like that like that's a


---------63:01----------
great way to you know I wouldn't abandon


---------63:04----------
I mean I sound like you don't have much


---------63:06----------
of a product manager career right now


---------63:07----------
but I would consider like you know Bill


---------63:10----------
and we'll kind of get to this but like


---------63:11----------
building up your yourself first before


---------63:15----------
you start helping other people helping


---------63:17----------
people comes actually like is in the


---------63:19----------
second phase of life which we'll talk


---------63:21----------
about but and I mean it sounds to me


---------63:24----------
like you're actually so you're it's a


---------63:26----------
little bit unclear to me what your


---------63:27----------
question is so it sounds like you


---------63:30----------
formulated a plan that you feel good


---------63:32----------
about what you really want to do is you


---------63:33----------
want to get this stuff off the ground


---------63:34----------
but I think it's gonna be like I don't I


---------63:37----------
don't know how successful you're gonna


---------63:38----------
be because I don't know what separates


---------63:40----------
you from any of the other coaches on the


---------63:42----------
internet like how like just because you


---------63:44----------
have some experience helping people like


---------63:46----------
I started helping people when I was like


---------63:47----------
very young to like basically when I came


---------63:49----------
back from India at the age of 21 and and


---------63:52----------
like over the first time I came back


---------63:53----------
from India and then like I still was


---------63:55----------
helping people here there but it didn't


---------63:57----------
become a career for me for a decade


---------64:00----------
later and not really my Dharma for 15


---------64:02----------
years later so can you do it earlier


---------64:04----------
absolutely but I would say that like


---------64:06----------
like we'll get to this so


---------64:08----------
kind of talked about a couple of these


---------64:09----------
things okay yeah sure yeah it's it's


---------64:12----------
mostly that I just don't know if the


---------64:14----------
Dharma is working or not is really my


---------64:15----------
question and that's yes then I don't


---------64:17----------
think you've really found your Dharma


---------64:18----------
yet if it's not working then then we'll


---------64:21----------
get to that okay


---------64:22----------
all right take care cool thanks Elias


---------64:25----------
unfortunately I'm gonna have to give you


---------64:26----------
the boot because we're almost a time and


---------64:28----------
there's still a couple of important


---------64:29----------
concepts I'm putting that yeah okay


---------64:31----------
that's fair I figure that's fair take


---------64:33----------
care of Yap I don't get off no no it's


---------64:36----------
okay it's it's it's it's my my my choice


---------64:39----------
okay so let's kind of go back to


---------64:41----------
screen-sharing oh god did I just bust


---------64:44----------
the lecture come on okay that took way


---------64:47----------
longer than possible so let me just


---------64:48----------
start by actually asking you guys a


---------64:50----------
couple of questions okay so what I'd


---------64:52----------
like to do oklets so when I ask a


---------64:56----------
question in the middle so we'll talk


---------64:58----------
about that I think that that's actually


---------65:00----------
a little bit tricky and maybe we want to


---------65:03----------
do that again but but what I'm really


---------65:04----------
hoping for which I should have been a


---------65:05----------
little bit clearer about and I don't


---------65:07----------
know how I'm going to filter questions


---------65:08----------
is I'd like to ask you guys questions


---------65:14----------
that are not quite as personal but are


---------65:16----------
relevant to sort of the topic that we've


---------65:18----------
covered so far in the future okay but


---------65:21----------
that's that's okay okay so let's get to


---------65:24----------
how do I find my Dharma so we have to


---------65:30----------
think about whether that's possible so


---------65:32----------
I'm trying to simulate sort of a lecture


---------65:34----------
right where like I asked I'm talking


---------65:36----------
about something in someone raises their


---------65:38----------
hand and I want to be able to call on


---------65:39----------
them and so they can ask kind of a


---------65:41----------
topically relevant question so but we


---------65:45----------
tried that


---------65:46----------
so let's we'll go a little bit long


---------65:47----------
today so how do I find my Dharma


---------65:49----------
so the first thing is that there are two


---------65:53----------
two different topics that I want to


---------65:54----------
cover today one is kind of how you find


---------65:56----------
your Dharma and the second is the


---------65:57----------
tomokawa so in in the Sun script system


---------66:01----------
there are four stages to life okay so so


---------66:08----------
if you don't know what your entire Maya


---------66:09----------
is like Sanskrit kind of gives you a


---------66:11----------
prescription so there are four stages


---------66:16----------
okay first is student


---------66:21----------
which is Brahma Jharia householder sorry


---------66:35----------
[Music]


---------66:39----------
carajás - from third is transition by


---------66:51----------
not press


---------66:56----------
okay so if you guys if you guys didn't


---------66:59----------
realize bad handwriting + complicated


---------67:02----------
son script words are a terrible


---------67:05----------
combination shadows okay so


---------67:10----------
pronunciation sin yes okay there are


---------67:18----------
four stages and basically where you are


---------67:20----------
in life dictates your generals your


---------67:23----------
entire mo so the first stage is to


---------67:25----------
student so this is where your Dharma is


---------67:27----------
Agra brahmacarya is to learn develop and


---------67:34----------
grow so this is when you kind of like


---------67:37----------
eat like the first age of life like when


---------67:40----------
you're 21 you're not supposed to be like


---------67:42----------
out saving the world right that's


---------67:44----------
something that I am 37 so I I spent you


---------67:47----------
know 15 years or longer like basically


---------67:50----------
you know probably the first 30 years of


---------67:53----------
my life basically focusing on myself and


---------67:58----------
I didn't do that intentionally it's just


---------68:00----------
what happened so I went to India and I


---------68:03----------
decided to become a monk at the age of


---------68:05----------
21 and my teacher said no they're like


---------68:06----------
you have to go finish your education so


---------68:08----------
to understand that like your Dharma and


---------68:11----------
helping people that's gonna come later


---------68:13----------
so your karma is going to determine your


---------68:16----------
autonomy which we'll talk about in a


---------68:18----------
second but really if you guys are if you


---------68:21----------
guys are stuck the first thing to


---------68:23----------
understand is that like if you want to


---------68:25----------
help people you can't really help people


---------68:28----------
right now right like you're not in a


---------68:31----------
position to help people like David wants


---------68:33----------
to support his family but


---------68:34----------
his capacity to support his family is


---------68:37----------
very limited so what you guys really


---------68:39----------
need to do is focus first on learning


---------68:42----------
learning developing and growing and and


---------68:45----------
you know a couple days ago on stream I


---------68:47----------
talked a little bit about like how to


---------68:48----------
prepare for medical school like how to


---------68:50----------
be a good medical student and I tried to


---------68:52----------
explain to people that like what I try


---------68:54----------
to explain to medical students is that


---------68:56----------
generally speaking they want a z' and so


---------68:59----------
like they've gotten a's and they're


---------69:00----------
oriented towards a's their entire life


---------69:03----------
no i mean this is the first 25 to 30


---------69:06----------
years of your life should be spent doing


---------69:08----------
this so until you're about thirty you


---------69:10----------
should be a Bromwich Anja


---------69:13----------
it doesn't mean between the ages of so I


---------69:16----------
guess if you guys want to do it that way


---------69:18----------
like well we'll say this will say zero


---------69:21----------
to twenty five to thirty okay that's


---------69:25----------
maybe a better description so in terms


---------69:29----------
of a medical student like their job is


---------69:32----------
not really to help anyone yet but like


---------69:36----------
they're also focused on grades so the


---------69:38----------
question is what is their you know what


---------69:40----------
is their daughter MA and what I try to


---------69:41----------
explain to them is like you should


---------69:43----------
forget about grades and understand one


---------69:44----------
day that you're gonna be you know


---------69:48----------
someone's going to depend on you to save


---------69:50----------
their life and so what you should be


---------69:52----------
doing is preparing for that fictional


---------69:54----------
patient in the future one day someone is


---------69:57----------
gonna walk into your door or you're


---------69:58----------
gonna be at the mall or you're gonna be


---------70:00----------
at a wedding in the first tier of being


---------70:02----------
a medical doctor there were two I dealt


---------70:06----------
with three medical emergencies where I


---------70:08----------
was the only doctor around like I went


---------70:09----------
to two weddings and there were like


---------70:11----------
medical emergencies and then they were


---------70:12----------
like is there a doctor around I was like


---------70:14----------
 so understand that like as a


---------70:16----------
medical student


---------70:17----------
you know people are worried about grades


---------70:19----------
and they're worried about success and


---------70:20----------
they're worried about a B and C don't


---------70:21----------
worry about any of that which you should


---------70:23----------
really be doing is understanding that


---------70:24----------
for four years as a medical student


---------70:26----------
you're going to be taught medical


---------70:28----------
information and whether you receive that


---------70:30----------
medical information well or not


---------70:32----------
determines whether you were going to be


---------70:34----------
able to save someone's life or whether


---------70:35----------
someone's going to die and so that's


---------70:38----------
really the way that you should function


---------70:39----------
and in terms of you guys you should be


---------70:44----------
the same way so you should understand


---------70:45----------
that for most of y'all y'all are


---------70:47----------
bromwich ideas


---------70:48----------
so what that means is that your purpose


---------70:50----------
right now your real Dharma is


---------70:52----------
preparation you don't know what that


---------70:54----------
challenge is going to look like you


---------70:57----------
don't know what you are gonna be called


---------70:58----------
to do but you should prepare and grow as


---------71:01----------
much as you can and by as much as I you


---------71:04----------
can what does that mean how do you focus


---------71:05----------
it will kind of get to this later too


---------71:06----------
but I mean I think you that you guys


---------71:08----------
should absolutely acquire some kind of


---------71:10----------
professional skill right so let's take I


---------71:12----------
think it was not David but that last guy


---------71:15----------
I forgot his name was it David


---------71:17----------
anyway so so that guy was kind of saying


---------71:20----------
I'm not actually a product manager yet


---------71:22----------
and then my response to him would be


---------71:24----------
like you should actually you know


---------71:27----------
consider becoming a product manager


---------71:28----------
because at some point people may need


---------71:30----------
your help or you may realize okay I


---------71:32----------
really want to do a life coach and I


---------71:35----------
need to support myself while I grow my


---------71:37----------
business or I have a family or whatever


---------71:38----------
and then he's not going to have any


---------71:40----------
financial income to support himself and


---------71:42----------
then he's gonna have to Joe or yeah Joe


---------71:45----------
and then he's gonna kind of be stuck so


---------71:47----------
he has to understand that like he has to


---------71:49----------
support himself in his eventual Dharma


---------71:53----------
of helping people like that's my path


---------71:54----------
and I think you know it's worked well


---------71:56----------
for me because I don't have to I don't


---------71:58----------
like a case in point as like we're not


---------72:00----------
charging for the webinar like right so


---------72:03----------
we may charge for stuff I'm working way


---------72:05----------
less so I'm working about 25 percent of


---------72:08----------
what I did when I started twitch


---------72:09----------
streaming in October and that's still


---------72:12----------
okay but like I'm working less and less


---------72:13----------
as we start to make more and more money


---------72:15----------
so that I can do stuff like this instead


---------72:17----------
of seeing patients I'm spending more


---------72:18----------
time on healthy gamer but that like at


---------72:21----------
any point you know I'm not dependent on


---------72:22----------
this income and I think that really like


---------72:24----------
you can support your Dharma if you're


---------72:26----------
dependent on your internal for your


---------72:28----------
income which you absolutely can be at


---------72:30----------
some point it just compromises what


---------72:32----------
you're capable of so your purpose should


---------72:35----------
really be to learn and to develop and


---------72:37----------
grow and what does that mean so that


---------72:38----------
means like acquiring a professional


---------72:40----------
skill


---------72:41----------
[Music]


---------72:46----------
it also means like becoming personally


---------72:50----------
stable and what this means is SWA the


---------72:57----------
eye or self study right so the


---------73:04----------
brahmacari are traditionally in India


---------73:06----------
like they included a lot of yoga and


---------73:08----------
meditation you would actually go to like


---------73:11----------
a temple in the in the wilderness or an


---------73:13----------
ashram and that's where you do your


---------73:15----------
education so you're taught like about


---------73:17----------
like everyone learns I read that


---------73:19----------
everyone's learners yoga everyone learns


---------73:21----------
meditation and that stuff is actually


---------73:23----------
like more important than learning


---------73:25----------
mathematics or finance or things like


---------73:27----------
that so like your guru would teach you


---------73:29----------
all that stuff they teach you


---------73:30----------
mathematics they teach you science they


---------73:32----------
teach you medicine they teach you to


---------73:34----------
meditate they teach you yoga it's like a


---------73:35----------
full package whether you're staying at


---------73:37----------
this place where a monks live and that's


---------73:39----------
where you're learning that's where


---------73:41----------
school is so in your case you guys


---------73:43----------
should absolutely gravitate towards a


---------73:45----------
professional skill you should endeavor


---------73:47----------
to become personally stable you should


---------73:49----------
endeavor to become healthy so that means


---------73:52----------
physically mentally and spiritually and


---------73:59----------
the question is why it's because at some


---------74:02----------
point you guys are gonna face some


---------74:05----------
challenge right so let's go back to Joe


---------74:07----------
once again like when he starts his life


---------74:10----------
coaching business if he isn't like


---------74:12----------
mentally stable and he starts helping


---------74:14----------
other people and their stuff kind of


---------74:16----------
comes on to him then he's gonna really


---------74:18----------
struggle to like maintain a high level


---------74:21----------
of performance like if he's not


---------74:22----------
physically mentally and spiritually


---------74:23----------
prepared to try to help other people and


---------74:26----------
he may be able to handle like whatever


---------74:28----------
kind of you know I'm not saying it's


---------74:31----------
small but like whatever he's handling


---------74:32----------
right now is it scales up and it becomes


---------74:34----------
more important and like let's say that


---------74:36----------
one day someone comes to him and says


---------74:37----------
Joe I want to pay you a thousand a


---------74:40----------
thousand dollars a week to work with me


---------74:42----------
whenever I want to work with you and


---------74:44----------
what is Joe gonna say is he gonna treat


---------74:46----------
that person differently because they


---------74:47----------
have money is he gonna be compromised by


---------74:50----------
money like what's gonna happen and so


---------74:52----------
you really need to become personally


---------74:54----------
stable professionally stable and healthy


---------74:56----------
and I want you guys to I was talking to


---------74:58----------
to someone


---------75:00----------
this weekend they were kind of telling


---------75:01----------
me that like you know when was the last


---------75:03----------
time they felt like their harmony their


---------75:06----------
Karma and they were walking down the


---------75:08----------
beach great story and they saw someone


---------75:11----------
who was like strut like kind of drowning


---------75:13----------
and they jumped into the water and they


---------75:15----------
kind of helped them out unclear whether


---------75:17----------
they would have drowned whether they


---------75:18----------
saved their life or things like that


---------75:19----------
unclear but they basically sort of saved


---------75:22----------
this person's life and the issue is that


---------75:24----------
that person takes care of themselves


---------75:26----------
physically like that's an important part


---------75:28----------
of how they live their day but like if


---------75:30----------
they hadn't been a good swimmer and they


---------75:32----------
weren't physically in shape they would


---------75:33----------
not have been able to do that and I was


---------75:34----------
kind of asking them like what would have


---------75:36----------
happened if you didn't jump in and he


---------75:37----------
was like well they're a bunch of like


---------75:38----------
overweight people who were watching for


---------75:41----------
the shoe from the shore and I would have


---------75:42----------
been just like that so you don't know


---------75:44----------
what challenges life is gonna throw at


---------75:47----------
you so you've got to just prepare for


---------75:48----------
all of them and I want you guys to


---------75:51----------
really think about that and like think


---------75:52----------
about what are you preparing for like


---------75:54----------
kovat is a good example of like you


---------75:56----------
don't know what the world is gonna send


---------75:57----------
your way so you guys should be preparing


---------75:59----------
for all of it


---------76:00----------
prepare to make income because you don't


---------76:02----------
know what when you're gonna need money


---------76:03----------
prepare to become personally stable and


---------76:05----------
healthy because you don't know what life


---------76:08----------
is gonna call on you to do so the second


---------76:11----------
phase is householder so this is when you


---------76:13----------
make money you have kids and all that


---------76:16----------
kind of stuff so then you become like


---------76:18----------
kind of professionally successful you


---------76:19----------
can start a family things like that and


---------76:21----------
then you start to transition away so


---------76:24----------
this is when you become helpful so after


---------76:28----------
you've made your money after your kids


---------76:30----------
are kind of taken care of this hermas


---------76:31----------
sort of these two that are mothers kind


---------76:33----------
of settled then you kind of transition


---------76:35----------
away and so I'd say like a beautiful


---------76:37----------
example of this is Bill Gates so Bill


---------76:40----------
Gates is a guy who like made his money


---------76:42----------
like raised his kids and now he's like


---------76:43----------
focused on helping the world the kind of


---------76:46----------
Dharma of service when people are asking


---------76:48----------
oh but I don't feel like helping people


---------76:49----------
I don't really know if that's the kind


---------76:51----------
of person I am I say yeah absolutely


---------76:55----------
you're not in a phase to help people yet


---------76:57----------
that happens later right so like I help


---------77:00----------
people because I'm sort of I mean I'm


---------77:02----------
kind of here and here but actually


---------77:06----------
helping people comes later in life once


---------77:08----------
you're established and once your feet


---------77:10----------
are firmly on the ground then your


---------77:12----------
capacity to help people


---------77:14----------
increases astronomically it doesn't mean


---------77:16----------
that you should turn people away if they


---------77:17----------
need your help tomorrow but I'm saying


---------77:19----------
that the kind of granddaughter Maya that


---------77:21----------
everyone is envisioning where it's like


---------77:23----------
Parma with a capital D of like helping


---------77:25----------
the world and making the world a better


---------77:26----------
place for most people that comes later


---------77:29----------
in life once they're established so


---------77:31----------
don't worry about that now which you


---------77:32----------
guys should really be focusing on is


---------77:34----------
this in the last phase of life is son


---------77:37----------
yes which is sort of like really


---------77:45----------
renunciation so that's when you kind of


---------77:46----------
give it all up and you devote yourself


---------77:48----------
towards like meditation and spiritual


---------77:50----------
enlightenment and God and whatnot so


---------77:53----------
monks take Sun yes so you kind of you


---------77:57----------
kind of give up you sort of say like


---------77:59----------
okay I don't want any of this stuff I'm


---------78:01----------
just gonna do like meditate all day so


---------78:03----------
those dudes in the Himalayas who are


---------78:06----------
meditating in caves they don't really


---------78:07----------
help a bunch of people they don't really


---------78:09----------
do a whole lot they don't have kids


---------78:10----------
they're just taking some yes so you kind


---------78:14----------
of go you kind of just go and focus on


---------78:20----------
yourself okay so if you guys are some


---------78:23----------
kind of saying how do I find my Dharma


---------78:25----------
the short answer is focus on this for


---------78:27----------
now just focus on growing and now we get


---------78:30----------
to the last thing which I'm going to try


---------78:32----------
to cover in about five minutes so the


---------78:34----------
term on in karma and a lot of people say


---------78:39----------
how do I find my karma and the short


---------78:41----------
answer is you don't your Dharma finds


---------78:47----------
you


---------78:49----------
right so in Soviet in in the u.s. we


---------78:55----------
watch television and in Soviet Russia


---------78:58----------
television watches you so the short


---------79:01----------
answer is like for those of you guys who


---------79:02----------
are worrying about helping people like


---------79:04----------
we can see for example that your karma


---------79:07----------
is going to determine your thought of


---------79:09----------
mine what do I mean by that karma is


---------79:10----------
kind of like circumstance or the hand


---------79:14----------
you're dealt in life and basically like


---------79:18----------
the the Dharma that you have is going to


---------79:20----------
present itself to you and you just need


---------79:22----------
to be ready for it right so like if


---------79:24----------
you're walking down the beach and


---------79:25----------
someone is drowning like that


---------79:27----------
it's not something finding your Dharma


---------79:29----------
in that moment has nothing to do with


---------79:31----------
what you've sought right so Dharma is


---------79:33----------
not like Sean like Dharma presents


---------79:36----------
itself right there definitely exercises


---------79:41----------
you can do to kind of like start to


---------79:43----------
think through what your Dharma is but


---------79:45----------
even now your Dharma is presenting


---------79:46----------
itself and we can see that from David so


---------79:49----------
like you know who here is is has the


---------79:52----------
capacity to help people like David does


---------79:54----------
like who here as David's Dharma david


---------79:56----------
has his Dharma because it was given to


---------79:57----------
him I have my Dharma because it was


---------79:59----------
given to him given to me do we think


---------80:01----------
about like what's my entire mats to help


---------80:02----------
gamers well like how did that happen


---------80:04----------
right just think about this for a second


---------80:07----------
you know I spent years of my life kind


---------80:09----------
of being addicted to video games and


---------80:11----------
sucking at life and dealing with shame


---------80:12----------
and all that kind of crap and I thought


---------80:14----------
that all of that stuff was a waste of


---------80:17----------
time but that's my Karma those were my


---------80:21----------
circumstances and I lived through that


---------80:23----------
and I'm glad that it went that way


---------80:25----------
because if I had a 4.0 GPA and was like


---------80:28----------
awesome at life from the get-go I


---------80:30----------
couldn't actually help you guys so like


---------80:33----------
even the things that you think when you


---------80:35----------
when you live your life and you're like


---------80:37----------
oh I can't find my daughter my I'm


---------80:39----------
sitting at home I'm not doing anything I


---------80:40----------
want you guys to understand I was in the


---------80:42----------
same exact boat in my 20s and I wasn't


---------80:45----------
doing anything and despite that or even


---------80:49----------
teens that was part of my karma and that


---------80:52----------
reinforced what my Dharma was gonna be


---------80:54----------
and so my god about was to sort of suck


---------80:58----------
at life and then I had certain


---------80:59----------
opportunities and I made good choices I


---------81:01----------
decided to you know spend time and get


---------81:03----------
into yoga and stuff like that but even


---------81:04----------
that I was drawn to it it felt like a


---------81:06----------
calling to me and then I still invested


---------81:10----------
that time and that energy into learning


---------81:11----------
that stuff and then I was like okay well


---------81:12----------
now I'm like married and like I'm in


---------81:14----------
love with this girl I wasn't married but


---------81:16----------
I was in love with this girl and I was


---------81:17----------
like now what am I gonna do I'm not


---------81:19----------
gonna become a monk that's like re I


---------81:20----------
might as well become a doctor and so I


---------81:23----------
was like okay like I'll become a doctor


---------81:25----------
and this is this is the other


---------81:26----------
interesting thing so we think of Kurt


---------81:28----------
like jobs as goals this doesn't actually


---------81:34----------
inspire you to put your best forward


---------81:36----------
when a job is a means


---------81:41----------
to an end then you're gonna put your


---------81:44----------
best foot forward when your job becomes


---------81:49----------
part of your Dharma your job isn't your


---------81:51----------
Dharma but it becomes part of your


---------81:53----------
tournament so I've decided okay like I'm


---------81:55----------
gonna become a doctor and like I didn't


---------81:58----------
want to be a doctor because that was my


---------82:00----------
daughter my it wasn't like I'm gonna


---------82:01----------
save lives that was ego I was just like


---------82:04----------
I'm gonna do this thing because it's


---------82:05----------
gonna support the other things that I


---------82:07----------
want to do and and you know so I was


---------82:11----------
like okay fine so I sit what kind of


---------82:12----------
arbitrary to be honest like it was like


---------82:14----------
why I become a doctor it's like kind of


---------82:15----------
why not and oddly enough that why not


---------82:18----------
ness allows you to become detached and


---------82:23----------
once you become detached it's easier to


---------82:25----------
act because like I was just like okay


---------82:30----------
I'm gonna become a doctor I'm gonna try


---------82:31----------
the hardest that I can and if it happens


---------82:33----------
it happens if it doesn't it doesn't and


---------82:37----------
B D okay but kind of going back to the


---------82:41----------
harmonic Karma because I feel like I'm


---------82:43----------
kind of scattered so what I mean is that


---------82:45----------
your Dharma is going to present itself


---------82:47----------
and all you really need to do is prepare


---------82:49----------
and act when the time is right and your


---------82:51----------
your Dharma is determined by your Karma


---------82:53----------
so we can see this very clearly in David


---------82:55----------
David's Dharma is very clear because his


---------82:57----------
Karma has given him a certain set of


---------82:59----------
circumstances my Dharma is very clear


---------83:01----------
because I have a set of circumstances


---------83:04----------
give me a second and so your Dharma will


---------83:09----------
become clear when you are given a set of


---------83:10----------
circumstances and we can see that this


---------83:12----------
with jo21 second


---------83:23----------
and so I want don't want you guys to


---------83:25----------
worry too much as crazy as it sounds


---------83:27----------
about finding your Dharma with a capital


---------83:29----------
D because we can sort of see it emerging


---------83:32----------
like it we can see it emerging with


---------83:34----------
David we can see it emerging with Joe so


---------83:36----------
be it so like if Joe wants to help


---------83:39----------
people start helping people but don't


---------83:40----------
abandon your life don't give up on your


---------83:43----------
career just because you like want to be


---------83:45----------
a life coach like I don't think that


---------83:47----------
that's a good idea I mean I think that


---------83:48----------
when you're ready you can you know


---------83:53----------
you'll be


---------83:54----------
and in the meantime like lightly your


---------83:56----------
karma your karma will tell you what you


---------83:58----------
need to do okay so if you guys are


---------84:03----------
looking for your Dharma that's okay like


---------84:05----------
good you should look and you should seek


---------84:07----------
but at the same time I wouldn't get too


---------84:09----------
worried because your karma is going to


---------84:11----------
present your Dharma to you when it's


---------84:13----------
your time and in the meantime your real


---------84:15----------
focus is actually to prepare this is


---------84:20----------
your tournament right now more than


---------84:22----------
anything else okay and then karma will


---------84:25----------
let you know when it's when it's time


---------84:27----------
like it'll come knocking and we can see


---------84:29----------
it with people right we see it with


---------84:30----------
myself we see it with David we see it


---------84:32----------

---------84:42----------
when you're five Dharma can present


---------84:44----------
itself at any time if you guys don't


---------84:47----------
know what you're supposed to do don't


---------84:48----------
worry about it oddly enough and prepare


---------84:51----------
yourself for what may come and there are


---------84:54----------
also exercises and stuff that we can do


---------84:56----------
so I'm gonna leave you guys with one


---------84:58----------
last exercise which is how to find the


---------85:05----------
job of your dreams okay and I know this


---------85:12----------
is sounds kind of weird but this is this


---------85:15----------
is kind of what I want you guys to do


---------85:16----------
okay so I know where I'm just talking


---------85:20----------
about you know don't focus on finding a


---------85:21----------
job at cetera but if you guys are


---------85:23----------
looking for structure for preparation


---------85:26----------
this is what I want you guys to do okay


---------85:28----------
so let's do this first location so I'm


---------85:38----------
gonna try to tie things together okay so


---------85:44----------
let's say that I want to be I want to


---------85:48----------
work at Riot Games how should you


---------85:51----------
structure your preparation if you want


---------85:55----------

---------85:58----------
don't know how to do that so this is


---------86:00----------
what I want you guys to do like I want


---------86:01----------
you guys to think about what you would


---------86:03----------
like doing or what you would like to try


---------86:05----------
and then you're gonna so we're


---------86:08----------
just gonna go to this website and this


---------86:11----------
is gonna tie together a lot of different


---------86:13----------
stuff okay so like you were just gonna


---------86:16----------
look like as I like League of Legends


---------86:17----------
and I think it's cool and so we're just


---------86:20----------
gonna look at this right so like okay do


---------86:21----------
I want to be a lead artist not really I


---------86:23----------
don't want to do animation brand new


---------86:25----------
management that's kind of cool like


---------86:27----------
creative and IP development that sounds


---------86:29----------
neat


---------86:30----------
so let's just pick this then what we do


---------86:35----------
is we look at our responsibilities


---------86:37----------
okay so manage product lifestyle from


---------86:39----------
game concept to launch and post launch


---------86:41----------
promote the game its vision and core


---------86:43----------

---------86:53----------
brand strategy through partnering with


---------86:55----------
Riots global publishing team manage


---------86:58----------
in-game content planning blah blah blah


---------87:00----------
and then we get to required


---------87:01----------
qualifications and then we get to


---------87:03----------
desired qualifications and this sounds


---------87:07----------
like a lot right so like if you think


---------87:09----------
about this this is like oh wow like five


---------87:11----------

---------87:25----------
like like take this and make these check


---------87:27----------
boxes so like start a grab a piece of


---------87:30----------
paper turn this into its checkbox turn


---------87:32----------
this into a check box turn this into a


---------87:34----------
check box turn this into a check box


---------87:35----------
turn all of these into check boxes and


---------87:37----------
you may look at this and you may say


---------87:39----------
like oh actually I can't do this like


---------87:42----------
there's no way like I have to get a


---------87:43----------
master's degree and then five years of


---------87:45----------
experience this is gonna happen a decade


---------87:47----------
later there's no way I'm gonna be able


---------87:49----------
to do this that's okay don't worry about


---------87:50----------
that then what I want you guys to do is


---------87:52----------
start the first thing like look at these


---------87:54----------

---------88:20----------
communications

---------88:39----------
stuff proficiency with net based


---------88:41----------

---------89:53----------
sprinkler hey on-demand learning public


---------90:06----------

---------90:11----------

---------90:18----------
webinars okay certification programs


---------90:25----------
okay so we're not gonna login here but


---------90:27----------
we're gonna look at that and then what I


---------90:29----------
want you guys to do is you're like okay


---------90:30----------
I want to learn I want to be a brand


---------90:33----------
manager at Riot Games because I think


---------90:35----------
social media is cool and I like I like


---------90:37----------
global worldwide organization global


---------90:39----------
strategies that sounds kind of neat so


---------90:41----------
you guys already checked number one and


---------90:43----------
then what you're gonna do is like during


---------90:45----------
Cova dover the next month you're gonna


---------90:47----------
learn these two right and then once you


---------90:50----------
check these two then you're gonna have


---------90:51----------
some qualifications you're gonna see


---------90:53----------
what else can i do okay do i have a


---------90:54----------
bachelor's degree in marketing


---------90:55----------
communications or business related field


---------90:57----------
okay and then what's gonna happen after


---------91:00----------
you do this is you're gonna be like oh


---------91:04----------
that's kind of cool I actually like that


---------91:05----------
and then you're gonna decide like okay


---------91:07----------
do I want to actually do


---------91:09----------
kind of stuff or not understanding


---------91:11----------
social media platforms right so we're


---------91:13----------
gonna watch Devin Nash's stream a little


---------91:14----------
bit and then we're gonna kind of go from


---------91:20----------
there we're gonna start learning this


---------91:23----------
stuff and then the interesting thing is


---------91:24----------
like let's say you've finished half of


---------91:26----------
your college or you dropped out after


---------91:27----------
one semester then you decide okay I'm


---------91:30----------
gonna go to college I'm gonna go back to


---------91:31----------
college because like I actually do want


---------91:34----------
to do this stuff I think it's really


---------91:35----------
cool and the neat thing is that right


---------91:37----------
now when you guys go to college like you


---------91:39----------
don't actually care about anything that


---------91:40----------
you learn right you're like ah it's


---------91:43----------
college but now you're like okay I need


---------91:46----------
a bachelor's degree and while you're in


---------91:47----------
college it becomes way more fun because


---------91:50----------
college is no longer an end it's not a


---------91:52----------
goal you're like oh I need college to


---------91:54----------
get a good job it's actually College as


---------91:56----------
one of the pieces that's required to get


---------91:59----------
the job of your dreams and you're gonna


---------92:00----------
major in marketing because but but


---------92:02----------
that's weird because marketing is for


---------92:04----------
losers and I want to major in law or


---------92:07----------
accounting or medicine or computer


---------92:09----------
science or statistics or mathematics and


---------92:11----------
then while you're going through college


---------92:13----------
every step of the way you're gonna be


---------92:15----------
going to your professors and you're


---------92:16----------
gonna ask be asking them hey do you know


---------92:19----------
anyone who uses brand watch or other


---------92:21----------
equivalent tools do you know where I can


---------92:25----------
get experience understanding brand


---------92:28----------
campaign indicators metrics are


---------92:30----------
analytics you're going to go to your


---------92:31----------
professors and you're gonna ask them


---------92:32----------
these questions and then your professors


---------92:34----------
are gonna look at you and they're gonna


---------92:36----------
be like wow this kid is like super super


---------92:37----------
motivated and they're gonna say yeah


---------92:39----------
actually I have a buddy who works in a


---------92:41----------
company I'm gonna set you up with an


---------92:43----------
internship and then you're gonna get an


---------92:44----------
internship or you're gonna start


---------92:46----------
applying for internships and then what's


---------92:47----------
gonna happen is you're gonna put


---------92:48----------
together a resume at some point and


---------92:50----------
since you guys used a month very


---------92:53----------
productively during COBIT cove in


---------92:55----------
learning net base and sprinkler


---------92:57----------
you're gonna on your resume you're gonna


---------92:59----------
say I am Joe David and I'm 21 years old


---------93:02----------
and my qualifications are I've completed


---------93:06----------
two years of college and I have a 2.8


---------93:09----------
GPA you don't have to advertise that if


---------93:10----------
you don't want to and then you can say


---------93:12----------
next in the next line but beneath that


---------93:14----------
is certified in net base sprinkler and


---------93:17----------
brand watch and you're gonna say like


---------93:20----------
you know completed a marketing project


---------93:23----------
used brand campaign indicators metric


---------93:26----------
metrics and analytics to develop a media


---------93:29----------
creative media strategy that's what


---------93:32----------
you're gonna say on your resume and then


---------93:34----------
suddenly six months from now you guys


---------93:37----------
are in college again and you've got that


---------93:39----------
on your resume and do you guys see how


---------93:41----------
like that's a real thing like you're a


---------93:43----------
real person now and when you apply to


---------93:45----------
for an internship in a company they're


---------93:47----------
like oh god this guy actually knows


---------93:49----------
something in between from now to even


---------93:51----------
three months or six months from now


---------93:53----------
where you had nothing now you've got a


---------93:55----------
resume and it's a real resume and like


---------93:59----------
you don't like you're there and then you


---------94:03----------
have an internship so then what happens


---------94:05----------
it like you get an internship and then


---------94:07----------
what happens is like you you like you


---------94:10----------
apply for the next internship so you go


---------94:11----------
to Riot Games and then you say I'm a I'm


---------94:15----------
an undergrad I've done an internship


---------94:17----------
with this company you have a letter of


---------94:18----------
recommendation from your professor this


---------94:20----------
is one semester this is like right now


---------94:23----------
it's April right so we're gonna go


---------94:25----------
through the summer and then we're gonna


---------94:26----------
enroll in college in the fall we're


---------94:28----------
gonna apply now because now we actually


---------94:30----------
care about applying and then come


---------94:32----------
November of 2020 you're gonna apply to


---------94:35----------
Riot Games and you're gonna say I'm


---------94:36----------
looking for an internship I'm highly


---------94:38----------
motivated I'm I'm familiar with brand


---------94:41----------
watch sprinkler this and this I did my


---------94:44----------
project on this and then I did an


---------94:45----------
internship at this company where I


---------94:48----------
focused on using industry trends


---------94:55----------
partnerships and branded learning the


---------94:58----------
branded content landscape and I am


---------95:00----------
interested in an internship where I can


---------95:04----------
let's think about this how would I say


---------95:06----------
this I'm interested in gaining knowledge


---------95:09----------
of the development the game development


---------95:11----------
process and life cycle so that I can


---------95:15----------
build a uniform brand strategy that that


---------95:19----------
combines brain game development with


---------95:21----------
like market analytics to create like a


---------95:25----------
good product that lands well with its


---------95:27----------
audience and is also globally branded so


---------95:30----------
like impact multiple markets or some


---------95:32----------
 like that you say this is what I'm


---------95:34----------
looking for and


---------95:36----------
then suddenly like you're like a real


---------95:38----------
person and like if you're a you know I


---------95:40----------
don't know really know people at Riot


---------95:42----------
Games I mean who actually do we're done


---------95:43----------
but you know we've met some of them but


---------95:46----------
when I think about you know when I'm


---------95:47----------
reviewing applications like what do I


---------95:49----------
look for it's stuff like this and so if


---------95:51----------
you guys think about this like you can


---------95:53----------
do this right like this is something


---------95:55----------
that you can manage on your own and and


---------95:58----------
it's not hard and like now we sort of


---------96:00----------
get to like sort of the the summary of


---------96:02----------
everything so we talked about motivation


---------96:04----------
we talked about procrastination we


---------96:05----------
talked about avoidance of emotions we


---------96:07----------
talked about chunking up tasks we talked


---------96:09----------
about and thought about in preparation


---------96:10----------
in Bromwich Aria this is everything tied


---------96:12----------
together do you guys see that so the


---------96:14----------
first thing is you're not motivated


---------96:16----------
because you don't understand what your


---------96:17----------
goals are your goals are way too


---------96:18----------
abstract you're procrastinating because


---------96:21----------
you haven't chunked up tasks properly


---------96:23----------
and you feel like shame and you feel


---------96:25----------
bored and you don't know what your


---------96:26----------
entire mised so you're not doing


---------96:27----------
everything this process combines all of


---------96:30----------
that stuff


---------96:31----------
we're chunking up tasks we're stepping


---------96:33----------
away from shame because you're learning


---------96:35----------
something before you even like you go to


---------96:37----------
college so you're gonna you're gonna be


---------96:39----------
like the one student in your marketing


---------96:41----------
class which is filled with a bunch of


---------96:43----------
freshmen and instead of feeling shame


---------96:45----------
because you're 21 and sitting in a class


---------96:47----------
with a bunch of eighteen year olds those


---------96:48----------
eighteen year olds have no idea what


---------96:50----------
they're doing with life and you're


---------96:51----------
showing up with your professor and


---------96:53----------
you're saying I'm certified and brand


---------96:55----------
watch and sprinkler


---------96:56----------
I'd like to better understand Kim brand


---------96:59----------
campaign indicators metrics and


---------97:00----------
analytics can you please help me and


---------97:02----------
then all the 18 year olds are gonna look


---------97:04----------
at you really like who the is this


---------97:05----------
guy


---------97:06----------
and then like that's it


---------97:10----------
like all of the procrastination like


---------97:12----------
becomes way easier the motivation starts


---------97:14----------
happening naturally you're starting to


---------97:16----------
prepare yourself for your Dharma and


---------97:18----------
then one or two years down the road you


---------97:20----------
may realize oh actually I don't like


---------97:22----------
this but then that's actually perfectly


---------97:25----------
fine because then you just make a career


---------97:26----------
pivot let's say that what you actually


---------97:28----------
want to do is not brand management but


---------97:31----------
you want to do like game development and


---------97:33----------
then you're like okay I actually want to


---------97:36----------
build video games so then what you


---------97:37----------
actually do is you're like oh man like


---------97:39----------
this sucks because all these people who


---------97:40----------
have built video games are gonna be more


---------97:42----------
experienced than me but I want you guys


---------97:44----------
to think about this for a second when


---------97:46----------
you apply for your next job to be a game


---------97:48----------
developer you do that some of this


---------97:49----------
process as well so you


---------97:50----------
learn how to like program or whatever


---------97:51----------
and then on your application it says


---------97:53----------
that I want to design video games and I


---------97:55----------
have a background in in marketing


---------97:57----------
analytics brand campaign indicators and


---------98:00----------
I believe I offer a unique advantage


---------98:02----------
over your other programmers because


---------98:04----------
while I am developing a video game I


---------98:06----------
have a knowledge of the brand side of


---------98:08----------
things and what kind of video game


---------98:10----------
development will be well-suited to be


---------98:13----------
like marketed globally across you know


---------98:17----------
market and grow globally in my


---------98:19----------
appreciation for metrics and analytics


---------98:20----------
allows me to like do an iterative


---------98:23----------
process of game development that allows


---------98:25----------
the game to be more accessible and like


---------98:28----------
better played it's not just mechanics I


---------98:30----------
understand the branding stuff too and


---------98:32----------
then you think about this like so


---------98:34----------
they're gonna get like applications for


---------98:35----------
programmers right and they're gonna look


---------98:37----------
at your application and they're gonna be


---------98:39----------
like oh this guy is disadvantaged


---------98:41----------
because he understands brand Analects


---------98:43----------
know it's dumb right I don't know what


---------98:48----------
my dream job is fine so pick something


---------98:50----------
what do you want to do like what do you


---------98:52----------
want to do start there that's fine you


---------98:56----------
don't need a dream job like you're not


---------98:57----------
gonna actually like I'm not you think


---------98:59----------
that the first thing that you're gonna


---------99:00----------
pick is gonna be like what you invest


---------99:03----------
eight years doing forget about that pick


---------99:05----------
something that you think is cool and


---------99:07----------
just start there and this is exactly why


---------99:09----------
I'm talking to you guys about the pivot


---------99:10----------
the pivot is because you don't have to


---------99:12----------
pick your dream job you just have to


---------99:14----------
pick a job and if you kind of like it


---------99:15----------
you can pivot into other fields okay so


---------99:20----------
listen last thing we're gonna end with


---------99:23----------
so let's stop screen share and give me a


---------99:26----------
second okay


---------99:34----------
last thing I mean I kind of know the


---------99:36----------
answer to this but let's just ask okay


---------99:37----------
so questions at the end or in the middle


---------99:41----------
that's stupid I know the answer but


---------99:43----------
we'll ask anyway because shouldn't make


---------99:46----------
assumptions


---------99:48----------
I want to just get this data right now


---------99:56----------
but that's that's kind of how we tie


---------99:58----------
things together okay at the end easy


---------100:01----------
okay


---------100:02----------
so great job today guys we're gonna


---------100:06----------
hopefully this makes sense


---------100:08----------
we did meditation earlier but yeah so


---------100:14----------
we'll see you guys tomorrow and I'll try


---------100:15----------
to outline some of this stuff like a


---------100:17----------
little bit more like by the way this


---------100:19----------
whole find a job of your dreams thing is


---------100:20----------
actually like a YouTube good thing that


---------100:22----------
I've sort of developed but so hopefully


---------100:25----------
you guys can kind of see like I want you


---------100:27----------
guys to just think about that and think


---------100:28----------
about your notes for motivation and


---------100:30----------
procrastination and see how motivation


---------100:32----------
and procrastination would be affected by


---------100:34----------
this plan okay and we're gonna stream


---------100:37----------
today in about an hour in ten minutes so


---------100:39----------
I got to run thanks guys
