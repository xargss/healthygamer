all right so what's your name buddy


---------00:04----------
my name is very impossible to pronounce


---------00:07----------
in English okay it's it's what a chili a


---------00:13----------
chili yeah it's very hard if you wanna


---------00:17----------
just call me Cory I think that might be


---------00:19----------
better cordless for the screen


---------00:23----------
call you what fine Corky Corky it's how


---------00:28----------
I'm usually for an evening game and


---------00:30----------
whatnot yeah okay cool man


---------00:35----------
and and so help and so tell me about


---------00:39----------
what we're kind of talking about today I


---------00:40----------
think we had mentioned something about


---------00:42----------
sociopathy so you think that sort of


---------00:44----------
fits with who you are yeah when I did


---------00:49----------
the forms I fit in I had like a couple


---------00:55----------
options that I could talk about most of


---------00:59----------
them I think I already worked on okay


---------01:03----------
multiple streams so I thought I would go


---------01:06----------
with the most important one I think


---------01:10----------
about me and also too when I least


---------01:14----------
worrying about or like talk to anyone


---------01:19----------
about like of all of them okay so tell


---------01:23----------
me tell me tell me what you so what are


---------01:26----------
you concerned about or what what are we


---------01:28----------
talking about here what why do you feel


---------01:29----------
like you're a sociopath what does that


---------01:31----------
mean to you to me means like more


---------01:38----------
manipulative oh no wait and also that I


---------01:43----------
don't really have it's not that that


---------01:46----------
sounds wrong it's not like I don't have


---------01:49----------
emotions but I don't show them as easily


---------01:53----------
and usually just don't you kind of mimic


---------01:57----------
in a way other people's emotions so like


---------02:00----------
if I am with people that are sad I'm


---------02:03----------
gonna feel sad in a way


---------02:05----------
and if I'm with people that are happy


---------02:07----------
I'm gonna be more happy or just in


---------02:10----------
general I'm just gonna be like what


---------02:12----------
ever well okay I had peanuts Tech just


---------02:16----------
leavin okay so can you help me


---------02:20----------
understand what you mean so yeah so I


---------02:21----------
think that's that's all you know I think


---------02:24----------
really appropriate stuff for us to talk


---------02:26----------
about let me just kind of repeat back


---------02:29----------
what I heard so it sounds like you do


---------02:31----------
feel emotions but that you mirror a lot


---------02:34----------
of the emotions that you see around you


---------02:37----------
mm-hmm and that you feel like you're


---------02:39----------
kind of manipulative yeah okay so we can


---------02:45----------
talk a little bit about so we can talk a


---------02:47----------
little bit about you know what you feel


---------02:49----------
and why you mirror and things like that


---------02:51----------
so we can talk about emotions and let's


---------02:53----------
we can also talk about manipulation do


---------02:55----------
you have a preference about what you


---------02:57----------
want to talk about first I guess can


---------03:02----------
start the potions


---------03:03----------
okay so tell me more yeah can you tell


---------03:07----------
me yeah can you tell me a little bit


---------03:09----------
more about that like how I feel yeah


---------03:13----------
sure yeah I think like I don't know how


---------03:23----------
other people feel exactly but I think I


---------03:27----------
have like this standing see off just


---------03:30----------
default to not feeling I guess the way I


---------03:35----------
could put it so like in general when I


---------03:38----------
am you know day-to-day basis I'm just


---------03:42----------
like fine right I'm not feeling happy


---------03:46----------
enough and said I'm just your


---------03:48----------
emotionally neutral yeah I guess so


---------03:52----------
okay but then it kind of changes


---------03:56----------
depending on who I'm with so like for


---------04:00----------
example if I'm with my sister who has


---------04:03----------
like a tendency of being more towards


---------04:05----------
the sad side I'm gonna be more like said


---------04:08----------
I'm gonna be more down I'm gonna eat


---------04:10----------
glass him why not and when I'm like


---------04:15----------
having an argument with someone for


---------04:17----------
example like if I discuss something with


---------04:19----------
my girlfriend have a fight or whatever


---------04:20----------
and she's very sad by it I'm gonna ease


---------04:25----------
that about it you like the same way she


---------04:27----------
is


---------04:28----------
do you even if I'm not really sad so do


---------04:32----------
you feel sad or do you act sad yeah


---------04:38----------
that's that's kind of like the issue I


---------04:42----------
can't really tell I feel like sometimes


---------04:45----------
I'm just acting and sometimes I think


---------04:48----------
I'm actually just you know like coughing


---------04:51----------
it you're just acting it I it's very


---------04:54----------
hard for me truth so this is something


---------04:58----------
that's very important okay cuz like let


---------05:00----------
me explain this so if you feel things


---------05:03----------
that other people feel you're actually


---------05:06----------
not a sociopath at all you're the


---------05:07----------
opposite so if you're if you are


---------05:10----------
empathic so if we think about sociopathy


---------05:14----------
the way that I understand it is that


---------05:16----------
your capacity to feel what other people


---------05:19----------
are feeling is actually low so I'm I'm a


---------05:24----------
psychiatrist and sometimes I can sit


---------05:26----------
with people that are suicidal and they


---------05:29----------
want to kill themselves and if I was


---------05:32----------
very very empathic or if I was if my


---------05:34----------
empathy was uncontrolled I would feel


---------05:37----------
really suicidal too


---------05:38----------
does that make sense like empathy is


---------05:40----------
feeling what someone else is feeling so


---------05:43----------
when you say when my sister is sad I


---------05:45----------
feel sad too if I'm around her so in


---------05:48----------
order for me to do my job I have to be


---------05:52----------
able to not feel what other people are


---------05:55----------
feeling does that make sense now the


---------05:58----------
tricky thing I did god no I think it's


---------06:03----------
actually more like acting in the sister


---------06:05----------
example was kind of about one okay I


---------06:08----------
didn't see when my sister said is


---------06:10----------
actually just like acting in a different


---------06:14----------
way than usual cuz I'm I'm usually very


---------06:16----------
reserved like I'm I'm working myself


---------06:19----------
more like doing my own things minding my


---------06:21----------
own business so when she calls and she


---------06:24----------
said it since she wants to talk to me or


---------06:26----------
she's just getting down in general and I


---------06:28----------
want to help her which is actually kind


---------06:32----------
of rare but what's kind of real I feel


---------06:35----------
like if like me wanting to help her I


---------06:38----------
usually just venture ignore it because


---------06:41----------
she has because uh it's very hard to


---------06:45----------
deal with her so I can't you just avoid


---------06:48----------
it basically so when I I want you help


---------06:52----------
her


---------06:52----------
I can't you like a more fun extrovert


---------06:59----------
just like more of a funny person in a


---------07:02----------
way right so why would a chameleon is oh


---------07:05----------
I know


---------07:08----------
the animal is yes yeah are you a


---------07:10----------
chameleon do you change your colors


---------07:15----------
based on what other people around you


---------07:17----------
look like I guess no way yeah right so


---------07:25----------
like the thing about a chameleon is you


---------07:26----------
can stick it on a you know a green plant


---------07:28----------
and it'll turn green and you can stick


---------07:31----------
it on a gray or brown plant and it'll


---------07:34----------
turn brown is that what you do you


---------07:37----------
change your colors to match the people


---------07:39----------
around you yeah pretty much yes so


---------07:44----------
always like sometimes I have I feel like


---------07:47----------
more self-conscious about it anything


---------07:49----------
like am i just acting all the time like


---------07:51----------
am I just basically making characters


---------07:54----------
for each situation and all like I'm with


---------07:57----------
my friends I'm this kind of person when


---------08:00----------
I girlfriend them this kind family this


---------08:03----------
yeah sometimes step that's thing that


---------08:06----------
bothers me


---------08:07----------
what bothers you is that it's like what


---------08:12----------
if I am just acting you know like in my


---------08:15----------
who am I in a way right because if I'm


---------08:19----------
just a bunch of character to different


---------08:21----------
people which one of those characters is


---------08:23----------
me right because it can be three


---------08:27----------
different people I I need to be one who


---------08:31----------
do you think what is it I don't know


---------08:36----------
what's it like to not level you are yeah


---------08:41----------
it's it's weird


---------08:43----------
I wouldn't say it's necessarily bad


---------08:45----------
because being like adaptive in a way is


---------08:49----------
good and kind of


---------08:51----------
dealing with the whole manipulation


---------08:53----------
thing it's usually good for me you like


---------08:57----------
that


---------08:58----------
tell me what you mean by manipulative


---------09:01----------
yeah so like I think a good example


---------09:06----------
would be how I am like in college and


---------09:08----------
why not like I don't care about people


---------09:11----------
or like whoever's in my class I don't


---------09:14----------
make friends with in or anything I just


---------09:16----------
didn't you move towards then been you


---------09:19----------
know act like I care about him and I


---------09:22----------
like them and we're not when it's useful


---------09:23----------
to me like if I know there's a an


---------09:26----------
assignment any to do like some homework


---------09:29----------
right English like if there's some


---------09:34----------
homework that I need to do and it's in


---------09:36----------
groups I know I need some more people so


---------09:39----------
I go looking for our people and act like


---------09:42----------
no hey what's up i doing i like


---------09:45----------
connecting with them just for the moment


---------09:47----------
basic just to make a groove get rid of


---------09:50----------
the homework and then I'm done I don't


---------09:52----------
care about them don't talk [ __ ] in so


---------09:54----------
that's like that one of the ways how do


---------09:57----------
you feel about that naughty I just


---------10:03----------
really don't mind it it's just useful so


---------10:07----------
yeah yeah so it sounds like when when


---------10:10----------
you when someone can when you need


---------10:15----------
something from someone you can be really


---------10:16----------
nice to them and when you're done


---------10:18----------
needing people your don't really


---------10:21----------
maintain much of a relationship yeah and


---------10:26----------
that's the way I am with my family as


---------10:28----------
well yeah like I don't really send


---------10:32----------
messages true because I'd only ever my


---------10:34----------
dad my parents anymore


---------10:36----------
I live with like my my grandma's house


---------10:38----------
so basically I just talk to them when I


---------10:41----------
need money or something like it sounds


---------10:44----------
awful


---------10:45----------
yeah and I know like probably saying


---------10:47----------
like wow how selfish and whatever I


---------10:49----------
don't know I just can't control it I


---------10:52----------
just think I just think you do that you


---------10:57----------
know just watch people get what I need


---------11:00----------
off them and then just like research I'm


---------11:02----------
not caring about anything okay


---------11:06----------
so so I know this is gonna sound kind of


---------11:08----------
weird but let's just acknowledge that it


---------11:10----------
does sound awful it doesn't mean that it


---------11:14----------
is awful right and let's remember that


---------11:16----------
we're not here to judge you


---------11:19----------
we're not here to say that you're a bad


---------11:22----------
person and I think it actually requires


---------11:24----------
a lot of courage to share what you've


---------11:27----------
shared and it does kind of sound like


---------11:29----------
you're sort of like associate that you


---------11:32----------
know and and and so let's try to


---------11:34----------
understand what that means and let's try


---------11:36----------
to understand where that comes from


---------11:39----------
because you you may not be right so I


---------11:42----------
think that we think about the term


---------11:43----------
sociopath is like black or white right


---------11:46----------
like like you are or you aren't but


---------11:49----------
that's not the way that I see it so just


---------11:51----------
to share a little bit I'm gonna try to


---------11:53----------
take the pressure off of you for a


---------11:54----------
second and talk about myself just so you


---------11:56----------
can kind of you know cuz I know you've


---------11:58----------
shared a couple of things that can make


---------12:00----------
people feel very judgmental or maybe you


---------12:02----------
feel vulnerable so I'm gonna just talk


---------12:03----------
about myself for a second is that okay


---------12:05----------
so they can judge me too all right so


---------12:09----------
the first thing is that like you know I


---------12:15----------
I think that empathy so I just want to


---------12:18----------
go back to this idea of empathy okay so


---------12:20----------
empathy is the capacity to feel what


---------12:23----------
other people feel and they're a couple


---------12:27----------
of really interesting sorry I'm tired


---------12:33----------
but you know there are a couple of


---------12:37----------
interesting things that you can look at


---------12:39----------
with empathy where so when you like


---------12:43----------
watch a youtube video let's say and you


---------12:44----------
see someone get kicked in the nuts a lot


---------12:47----------
of people have like an empathic reaction


---------12:49----------
to that and what they do is you know


---------12:54----------
they'll feel something in themselves why


---------12:55----------
are you smiling because like the first


---------13:00----------
thing when you say about that I remember


---------13:02----------
seeing like videos off just with my


---------13:05----------
friends up like people getting karma in


---------13:09----------
a way right so try to do something


---------13:11----------
better someone they just okay until it's


---------13:13----------
as you said or something and just like I


---------13:16----------
always just laugh at it and


---------13:18----------
yeah mine yeah I think it's just so-so


---------13:22----------
empathy is like so people who have high


---------13:24----------
amounts of empathy feel the pain of


---------13:26----------
other people and so you know when you


---------13:29----------
watch a YouTube video where someone


---------13:30----------
getting kicked in the nuts sometimes


---------13:32----------
like you kind of cringe and you're like


---------13:33----------
oh it's gonna hurt and then then so


---------13:36----------
that's what empathy is it's being able


---------13:38----------
to feel what someone else feels now the


---------13:39----------
interesting thing is that you were


---------13:41----------
saying that you know when your sister is


---------13:43----------
around and she is feeling sad then you


---------13:45----------
kind of feel sad too but that means one


---------13:48----------
of two things if you're actually feeling


---------13:50----------
sad that make that lowers you on the


---------13:53----------
sociopathy scale but if you're acting


---------13:57----------
sad that elevates yong-seok sociopathy


---------13:59----------
scales so on the outside you know you


---------14:02----------
could be act the question is you


---------14:04----------
actually feel sad when she feel sad


---------14:05----------
because that means you're really not


---------14:07----------
sociopathic we're very sociopathic at


---------14:09----------
all but if you genuinely do feel so I


---------14:11----------
mean if you do feel sad that means that


---------14:12----------
you're empathic and if you don't feel


---------14:14----------
sad and you act sad that is a little bit


---------14:18----------
more on the socio sociopathic side does


---------14:21----------
that make sense yeah and and what I


---------14:24----------
found in myself is that like I used to


---------14:27----------
be more like you but then through


---------14:30----------
because it sounds like you really do act


---------14:32----------
sad instead of feeling sad and and let's


---------14:36----------
just also acknowledge for a moment that


---------14:40----------
you know not having empathy does not


---------14:42----------
make you a good or a bad person so you


---------14:47----------
know a lot of times if you kind of think


---------14:49----------
about it in a weird way if people feel


---------14:52----------
empathic then it's easier for them to be


---------14:56----------
good people because they have a force in


---------14:58----------
their body that is pushing them to make


---------15:02----------
like you know help other people so that


---------15:03----------
if the other person is less sad then I


---------15:06----------
feel less sad so my helping them is in a


---------15:09----------
weird way driven by my own sadness does


---------15:11----------
that make sense it's actually in a weird


---------15:14----------
way far more difficult or even far more


---------15:18----------
moral to be moral and not feel those


---------15:22----------
feelings so then you're helping someone


---------15:24----------
really because it's a good thing to help


---------15:26----------
them and not because you have an


---------15:28----------
internal compass that's pushing you to


---------15:29----------
help them does that make sense


---------15:32----------
yeah so in a weird way I'd say if you


---------15:34----------
try to help your sister and you don't


---------15:36----------
feel any empathy for her I actually


---------15:38----------
think you deserve more credit than


---------15:41----------
someone who feels empathy because the


---------15:43----------
empathy is pushing that person and it


---------15:45----------
may not be pushing you so I don't think


---------15:46----------
that good and evil has anything to do


---------15:48----------
with sociopathy does that make sense


---------15:51----------
hmm okay so anyway in my case what I


---------15:58----------
sort of have have learned how to do is


---------16:01----------
open up my emotions and close them off


---------16:04----------
so I can kind of turn on and off my


---------16:06----------
empathy which is like required for my


---------16:08----------
job so there are times where I let


---------16:10----------
myself feel things with people which is


---------16:13----------
something that I had to learn how to do


---------16:15----------
because I didn't feel I mean I had a lot


---------16:17----------
of emotions like I had anger and


---------16:19----------
resentment and shame do you feel those


---------16:22----------
things no really I mean at least like


---------16:28----------
I'm I'm always very neutral okay I don't


---------16:36----------
really feel angry or do you have trouble


---------16:38----------
by going to sleep


---------16:41----------
no okay yeah I have my habits like just


---------16:47----------
leave like leave a video clean your son


---------16:49----------
yes okay dad okay is it okay if I ask


---------16:56----------
you a couple more questions to get sort


---------16:58----------
of a better sense of your relationships


---------17:00----------
with various people yeah okay so I just


---------17:04----------
wanted to explain a couple things now


---------17:06----------
we'll kind of go back to collecting some


---------17:07----------
more information okay so can you tell me


---------17:09----------
a little bit about your sister yeah she


---------17:13----------
has I don't think it's diagnosed yet but


---------17:17----------
she's more than likely has borderline


---------17:23----------
personality yeah okay yeah so she more


---------17:28----------
than likely has it and it's very hard


---------17:31----------
she treated as I'm sure yep and what may


---------17:36----------
- isn't that she has borderline


---------17:38----------
personality disorder


---------17:39----------
though a she acts in general and how


---------17:43----------
like she doesn't


---------17:46----------
she takes a lot lots of medicine she


---------17:49----------
kind of help her and it doesn't work as


---------17:51----------
he wouldn't what is the medicine


---------17:54----------
designed to help her with do you know I


---------17:56----------
think it's for depression mania as well


---------18:03----------
and she takes when she sleep


---------18:07----------
because she has another issue I don't


---------18:10----------
know the name in English at all but it's


---------18:12----------
basically when she sleeps her legs


---------18:15----------
restless leg syndrome yeah she has that


---------18:18----------
shoe so she has taken myself and thing


---------18:20----------
she takes like three antidepressants I


---------18:24----------
think she thinks Leitrim okay right yeah


---------18:30----------
takes that you and yeah she's very


---------18:34----------
impulsive by she'll do things without


---------18:39----------
even okay what kind of like what's it


---------18:44----------
like being her brother uh it's mostly


---------18:50----------
whatever because I don't live right so


---------18:55----------
she wasn't like that when I was back


---------18:58----------
home cuz I moved to another city my


---------19:01----------
grandma's house to the college so you


---------19:04----------
know was back home she wasn't like that


---------19:05----------
so it was fine like she would get angry


---------19:09----------
sometimes but that would be a you know


---------19:11----------
because she was younger as well


---------19:13----------
now she's 15 I think now she's what yeah


---------19:18----------
fifteen she'll be 15 this year actually


---------19:20----------
Oh boys so she's young how old are you


---------19:23----------
yeah I am 22 okay


---------19:27----------
21 actually 21 wait no I'm Twitter I


---------19:32----------
always get lost my age I don't know I


---------19:35----------
kind of stopped counting after 20 okay


---------19:38----------
so I'm actually pretty sure yeah so


---------19:42----------
she's 15 and no yeah because of the


---------19:48----------
issues she has she already like tried


---------19:50----------
suicide 19 three times maybe I was like


---------19:54----------
with medicine take a lot of Medicine she


---------19:57----------
hurts herself now


---------19:59----------
she's doing it last because she kind of


---------20:02----------
replaced it with cigarettes


---------20:04----------
it's your addiction right so yeah and


---------20:09----------
basically we you know I say we because


---------20:12----------
I'm not thinking about me and my parents


---------20:14----------
cuz I try to like help them it wasn't


---------20:17----------
try to help them because it it's like


---------20:24----------
troublesome if you have someone like


---------20:26----------
that right someone who can like you can


---------20:32----------
count with no way watch my parents need


---------20:35----------
help she's not doing she she's probably


---------20:38----------
do the opposite and just knowing that


---------20:41----------
they actually keep worrying about her


---------20:43----------
like and how much time and money they


---------20:48----------
have to like waste on her basically I'm


---------20:53----------
using some terms without thinking a lot


---------20:56----------
about them no I think it's good that


---------20:57----------
you're doing that so so let's think


---------20:59----------
about that for a second right so it


---------21:01----------
seems like you feel like to a certain


---------21:03----------
degree a lot of the effort that people


---------21:07----------
make to help her isn't gonna help and


---------21:10----------
let's be clear I mean that's not that


---------21:12----------
doesn't make you an [ __ ] it sounds


---------21:14----------
like many people have tried to prescribe


---------21:15----------
her different kinds of medication that


---------21:17----------
you guys have tried a lot of stuff so


---------21:19----------
it's not illogical for it to sort of for


---------21:24----------
you to recognize that a lot of this


---------21:26----------
stuff isn't really helping but why do


---------21:28----------
you try to help yeah as I said it's


---------21:34----------
because like hey I just don't want to


---------21:38----------
have someone like that in the family


---------21:39----------
like someone so I'm reliable and


---------21:43----------
uncontrollable and someone who is like


---------21:45----------
always so down you know way and also


---------21:51----------
someone who just like keeps making my


---------21:54----------
parents worry and everything why does it


---------21:58----------
matter if your parents worry well


---------22:12----------
I don't know just upsets me that they


---------22:15----------
have to like keep worrying about that


---------22:18----------
that they can have like East


---------22:20----------
what what's upsetting be you know that


---------22:23----------
they can't have peace what does that


---------22:26----------
bother you I don't know I feel like


---------22:27----------
everyone should like have times should


---------22:31----------
just be with themselves and not worrying


---------22:33----------
about something but they basically in


---------22:36----------
and it's also I guess because of how


---------22:43----------
much he actually cuz the they worried


---------22:48----------
about her but not just about her now


---------22:51----------
they also worried aloud about her future


---------22:52----------
right because she doesn't go to school


---------22:56----------
basically because of the Lexx of lack of


---------23:00----------
sleep not like I said she sleeps a lot


---------23:02----------
actually


---------23:03----------
so she yeah this is cool yeah and yeah


---------23:08----------
that's can you tell me a little bit I'm


---------23:11----------
sorry no that's like putting her behind


---------23:14----------
you know it right so she won't go to


---------23:16----------
college the time she should be going


---------23:20----------
sister I I guess I used to care more


---------23:25----------
before like before I realized how much


---------23:30----------
of her how much I can't help her because


---------23:35----------
I feel like you know no matter what I


---------23:37----------
say to her what I do or whatever


---------23:40----------
she just reset he sets actually you know


---------23:45----------
mmm and suicidal he just I think they


---------23:49----------
like cigarettes or whatever it is she's


---------23:52----------
becomes like caring about her is futile


---------23:56----------
there's there's not point to it


---------24:00----------
basically can you use


---------24:03----------
like that something like my parents


---------24:05----------
actually sadly kind of went through a


---------24:10----------
little bit an out there trying hard


---------24:12----------
again I guess Chile you know find


---------24:15----------
something to make her stop blink those


---------24:19----------
things yeah


---------24:22----------
they also made sure like a little bit of


---------24:23----------
a phase off oh I don't we don't think we


---------24:27----------
can do anything to help her let's just


---------24:29----------
you know keep her let her smoke


---------24:32----------
cigarettes and why not let her skip


---------24:34----------
school


---------24:35----------
we can do anything we can wake her out


---------24:37----------
okay and make her to go to school so you


---------24:40----------
know and if you if we like actually when


---------24:44----------
I tried to try to reduce at least a


---------24:46----------
cigarette she was looking every day like


---------24:51----------
it wouldn't work for like a little bit


---------24:54----------
and then she would be just like hey give


---------24:56----------
me more you know it would be like no I


---------24:59----------
already have had enough you know you


---------25:00----------
shouldn't have anymore


---------25:01----------
and she would just be like no give me


---------25:04----------
more or you know what I'm gonna do


---------25:06----------
anything she would coach the bathroom


---------25:08----------
and cut herself right so I there there's


---------25:12----------
nothing I can do


---------25:13----------
in a way sure is if I don't take the


---------25:17----------
cigarettes off she cut yourself it's


---------25:18----------
like worse yeah at least and she's


---------25:24----------
always saying things like oh and I'm 18


---------25:27----------
I'm gonna kill myself and I'm like just


---------25:30----------
like why like I don't I can't really get


---------25:35----------
her point of view I'm gonna just


---------25:44----------
second is that okay


---------25:54----------
do you feel hurt or any no really


---------26:02----------
okay I'm gonna say two words I'm not


---------26:08----------
quite sure if they'll make sense


---------26:11----------
caregiver burnout do you know what


---------26:14----------
burnout is yeah I'm still gonna be about


---------26:18----------
it


---------26:18----------
okay and and what I'm detecting is to a


---------26:23----------
certain degree I think like caregiver


---------26:26----------
burnout so this happens with people who


---------26:28----------
have BPD where the people who love them


---------26:31----------
eventually just burn out because they


---------26:35----------
try to help and they try to help and


---------26:36----------
they try to help and then you know they


---------26:39----------
just kind of become numb and they kind


---------26:42----------
of throw their hands up and they sort of


---------26:44----------
stop trying and then especially with


---------26:47----------
parents they can sort of like you know


---------26:49----------
they're kind of like neutral for a while


---------26:50----------
they're kind of burnt out and then their


---------26:52----------
energy starts to build back up and then


---------26:54----------
they start caring again and they start


---------26:56----------
trying again and things like that so you


---------26:59----------
know as as much as you know I know


---------27:01----------
you're saying a lot of things that are


---------27:02----------
gonna make people think that you're an


---------27:03----------
[ __ ]


---------27:04----------
what I'm really detecting from you in a


---------27:08----------
certain way is actually that your


---------27:10----------
empathic numbness is to a certain degree


---------27:13----------
protective because you've sort of


---------27:16----------
learned that caring doesn't help what do


---------27:21----------
you think about that


---------27:25----------
I don't know because like I never really


---------27:31----------
like work myself up where like I never


---------27:36----------
even do I say like yeah of course trench


---------27:38----------
helper and that was very tiring delayed


---------27:41----------
right cuz I I tried to make her stop and


---------27:46----------
then didn't work but that was most more


---------27:49----------
uh best month and of thing or what kind


---------27:55----------
of any like couple best marks okay


---------27:59----------
that's true bones you know that's when I


---------28:01----------
was trying to help for and even before


---------28:05----------
then I already felt like this Betty this


---------28:09----------
as you say okay so I'm not sure maybe


---------28:14----------
okay meaning more self-conscious to


---------28:17----------
beard so it sounds like you felt you


---------28:20----------
felt pretty numb but before tried to


---------28:23----------
help her yeah yeah and I think that that


---------28:26----------
makes sense right because you know I


---------28:27----------
don't think that your your patterns in


---------28:29----------
college around like group homework and


---------28:31----------
things like that


---------28:32----------
then that's obviously not caregiver


---------28:34----------
burnout right and and so I I'm not


---------28:38----------
saying that it's all caregiver burnout


---------28:40----------
it's just I was exploring that because


---------28:42----------
it seems like I mean you said that you


---------28:44----------
used to care more or that you used to


---------28:46----------
try more and it sounds like you know a


---------28:49----------
lot of the reason that you try is


---------28:51----------
because you're concerned about your


---------28:53----------
parents and that they shouldn't have to


---------28:56----------
try this alone and at the same time what


---------29:00----------
I'm kind of hearing you say is push back


---------29:02----------
a little against the idea of burnout


---------29:04----------
maybe that's what happened to your


---------29:05----------
parents but you didn't really burn out


---------29:06----------
you just realized it was kind of a waste


---------29:08----------
of time is that a better characteristic


---------29:12----------
okay a better way to put it yeah okay


---------29:16----------
okay so sounds like maybe not so much


---------29:19----------
burnout on your end and and maybe just


---------29:21----------
realized it was futile yeah so can you


---------29:25----------
tell me a little bit about your parents


---------29:27----------
yes my mom as bipolar disorder okay


---------29:34----------
she makes I don't know


---------29:38----------
medicine she should be taking medicine


---------29:42----------
she goes to a psychologist yeah yeah but


---------29:48----------
it never really worked out what does


---------29:51----------
that mean like she never got better


---------29:55----------
she's always do this kind of she's a lot


---------29:58----------
like my sister anyway like my family


---------30:01----------
it's me my dad my mom and my sister and


---------30:05----------
basically they away our family works is


---------30:07----------
like I'm like my dad no way I'm calm


---------30:10----------
more often tonight and my mom is more


---------30:14----------
unstable my sister is just like her


---------30:17----------
right so if she gets angry she's gonna


---------30:20----------
act on it she's gonna break things like


---------30:23----------
her wardrobe is broken down basically


---------30:26----------
she's like no doors


---------30:27----------
Oh true that about the work do you think


---------30:34----------
your mom may have have BPD I don't think


---------30:40----------
so okay well because when I think of a


---------30:44----------
PD I think it's much more extreme right


---------30:46----------
it's more just do your mom have periods


---------30:50----------
of like for like weeks to months where


---------30:53----------
she's basically normal don't be okay so


---------31:03----------
I'm gonna educate a little bit okay so


---------31:05----------
once again this isn't like medical


---------31:07----------
advice but I'm just gonna explain sort


---------31:09----------
of the differences in Diagnostics


---------31:10----------
between borderline personality disorder


---------31:13----------
and and bipolar disorder okay so this is


---------31:18----------
something that's very poorly understood


---------31:20----------
so a lot of times people with with


---------31:24----------
borderline personality get diagnosed as


---------31:27----------
bipolar so what people think bipolar


---------31:31----------
means like I'll get a lot of people will


---------31:33----------
come to me and say I'm bipolar and I'll


---------31:35----------
ask you what do you mean by that and


---------31:36----------
they're like I'm happy one minute and


---------31:38----------
I'm [ __ ] pissed off the next minute


---------31:40----------
and the next day I'm super depressed and


---------31:42----------
the next day I'm super happy that's not


---------31:44----------
actually bipolar disorder so bipolar


---------31:48----------
disorder is a mood disorder that is


---------31:50----------
characterized by weak


---------31:52----------
of month or months of an episode of


---------31:56----------
feeling a particular way so people who


---------31:59----------
have sorry my kid is screaming outside


---------32:04----------
so uh sorry it's distracting can I have


---------32:11----------
a second okay I think we should be good


---------32:16----------
sorry about that guys so what I was


---------32:20----------
gonna say is that bipolar disorder and


---------32:22----------
mood disorders are episodic which means


---------32:26----------
that it's it's a mood that lasts for


---------32:29----------
weeks at a time so in bipolar disorder


---------32:33----------
for example people will have manic or


---------32:35----------
hypomanic episodes which is days two


---------32:38----------
weeks of having like a very high mood or


---------32:41----------
being like super active not sleeping you


---------32:44----------
know it'll last weeks followed by


---------32:46----------
usually a crash of like weeks two months


---------32:49----------
of depression it's not like super happy


---------32:52----------
one day super sad the next day it's like


---------32:55----------
three weeks of happiness followed by


---------32:58----------
three months of sadness


---------32:59----------
so it's an episode with borderline


---------33:04----------
personality disorder what we get is


---------33:06----------
something called


---------33:07----------
emotional instability or mood


---------33:09----------
instability so their mood fluctuates a


---------33:12----------
lot more over the course of a day or is


---------33:15----------
unstable like over the course of hours


---------33:17----------
so a lot of you know when people come to


---------33:20----------
me and they say I'm bipolar and then


---------33:23----------
this is the unfortunate thing is that


---------33:24----------
you know a lot of these people end up


---------33:26----------
getting medication but the medications


---------33:29----------
like lithium mood stabilizers can help


---------33:31----------
in terms of emotional instability but


---------33:35----------
generally speaking you know medications


---------33:37----------
like lithium prevent or reduce the long


---------33:41----------
episodes so if someone is depressed for


---------33:45----------
like let's say six months and I start


---------33:47----------
them on lithium my hope would be that


---------33:49----------
they like you know over the next couple


---------33:51----------
of weeks they come out of that


---------33:53----------
depression and they don't get depressed


---------33:54----------
for months again it doesn't actually


---------33:56----------
change how you know quickly their mood


---------34:00----------
shifts over the course of an hour it


---------34:02----------
prevents whatever neuro chemistry


---------34:05----------
changes


---------34:05----------
keep people depressed for months does


---------34:08----------
that make sense so when thinking about


---------34:12----------
that do you have a sense of whether your


---------34:15----------
mom's moods shift like over the course


---------34:18----------
of days I mean sorry like minutes 2


---------34:20----------
hours 2 days are we talking like weeks


---------34:23----------
two months yeah I think it would be more


---------34:28----------
days it's just that like when I think of


---------34:30----------
borderline I think more about like


---------34:37----------
addiction to drugs or alcohol yep


---------34:42----------
multiple relationships thing yeah yeah


---------34:47----------
so so you know it I'm not saying that


---------34:50----------
your mom isn't bipolar


---------34:51----------
Minoo cuz obviously she's working with


---------34:54----------
the clinician and the clinician is gonna


---------34:55----------
know way much more than I do in terms of


---------34:58----------
what her actual statuses like and


---------35:00----------
sometimes people have BPD and bipolar


---------35:02----------
they can be borderline and bipolar like


---------35:05----------
those two things can exist together my


---------35:08----------
point though is that you know it's not


---------35:11----------
uncommon for me to hear stories of mom


---------35:15----------
with bipolar daughter who's bipolar but


---------35:18----------
it turns out that daughter is actually


---------35:20----------
borderline or son is borderline her mom


---------35:22----------
is borderline and really it's all


---------35:24----------
personality pathology it's not like a


---------35:27----------
discrete neurochemical imbalance that


---------35:29----------
then corrects itself over time which is


---------35:32----------
the way that I think about a mood


---------35:33----------
disorder so I think about borderline


---------35:35----------
personality disorder or sociopathy or


---------35:38----------
antisocial personality disorder is the


---------35:40----------
way that your brain is wired it's like


---------35:43----------
the way that your brain is whereas a


---------35:46----------
mood disorder I think about a change in


---------35:48----------
function so it's the way that that your


---------35:51----------
brain operates for a particular period


---------35:53----------
of time does that make sense yeah so one


---------35:57----------
is like the foundation it's the


---------35:59----------
structure and one is an operation so


---------36:01----------
mood disorder is the way that your brain


---------36:04----------
functions for a period of time then it


---------36:06----------
goes back to functioning normally and a


---------36:08----------
personality disorder and that's why we


---------36:10----------
call it personality because it's part of


---------36:12----------
who you are right Korky when we listen


---------36:15----------
to you you're kind of saying I don't


---------36:16----------
know who I am


---------36:18----------
that's not an episode


---------36:19----------
that doesn't like come and go that's


---------36:21----------
like who you are you don't have a clear


---------36:23----------
sense of your identity and it sounds


---------36:26----------
like what you end up doing is it since


---------36:28----------
you don't have a clear sense of your


---------36:30----------
identity you adopt the identities of


---------36:33----------
people around


---------36:35----------
that's the chameleon right so people are


---------36:37----------
sad you're gonna be sad if people are


---------36:39----------
happy you're gonna play the part you're


---------36:41----------
gonna fit in because you don't know so


---------36:43----------
what color is a chameleon really I think


---------36:48----------
it's great see no one close right like


---------36:52----------
that's the whole problem it's like you


---------36:54----------
don't know like I don't know what color


---------36:56----------
I really am and like how can you yeah


---------36:58----------
you know who knows right so what kind of


---------37:02----------
get to that does that make sense about


---------37:04----------
like BPD and and bipolar and borderline


---------37:06----------
and all that kind of stuff yeah okay I


---------37:09----------
think I should just add my dad actually


---------37:14----------
kind recently got diagnosed with bipolar


---------37:17----------
- he had like was almost it was actually


---------37:23----------
a psychotic episode okay right where he


---------37:26----------
was hearing things that weren't there he


---------37:29----------
was seeing things that weren't there


---------37:31----------
because traumatic experience he had and


---------37:36----------
then he went actually took clinic for


---------37:39----------
two weeks I think was like journalized


---------37:44----------
yeah like hospitalized actually he


---------37:46----------
stayed yeah yeah that sounds weak side


---------37:49----------
character yep that yeah he's taking me


---------37:53----------
to my sister okay that sounds like


---------37:57----------
bipolar to me so usually people like


---------38:00----------
having so that too is if we think about


---------38:02----------
that it's a discrete episode right so it


---------38:05----------
sounds like your dad isn't usually like


---------38:07----------
that and something happened to him and


---------38:11----------
then he changed the way that his he was


---------38:13----------
functioning the way his mind was


---------38:15----------
functioning the way his brain was


---------38:17----------
functioning and he started acting a


---------38:19----------
different way it sounds like he needed


---------38:20----------
intense treatment for a certain amount


---------38:23----------
of time and then hopefully he's back to


---------38:25----------
normal and and by the way dude it sounds


---------38:30----------
like I mean that's rough bro


---------38:32----------
like it sounds like you


---------38:33----------
a lot of people in your family who


---------38:34----------
really struggle and and that can't be


---------38:36----------
easy


---------38:39----------
yeah it's kinda funny I think I like all


---------38:44----------
of them have like something like some


---------38:48----------
kind of mental disorder in Stewart and I


---------38:53----------
just kind of don't at least not


---------38:56----------
diagnosed or never had any like issues


---------38:59----------
that made me like actively look for like


---------39:05----------
mm-hmm how do you feel about that


---------39:07----------
struggling in college I I think it's


---------39:11----------
just funny like honest it's the same way


---------39:14----------
like not necessarily physically not in


---------39:19----------
appearance not different like I'm a


---------39:21----------
doctor or something okay it's like all


---------39:24----------
of them have Nietzsche wear glasses


---------39:27----------
yeah like t-shirts right and I never did


---------39:31----------
my vision was always like perfect since


---------39:34----------
forever


---------39:35----------
mm-hmm even with me like always being on


---------39:39----------
the computer and always playing games


---------39:41----------
and whatnot I never thought worse hmm


---------39:44----------
so I think it's very just interesting to


---------39:47----------
me like how even though I'm part of the


---------39:50----------
family I'm kind of completely different


---------39:52----------
of them yeah okay kind of makes sense


---------39:59----------
right I mean I can imagine how it would


---------40:03----------
be difficult to form connections with


---------40:06----------
people like that if you feel different


---------40:08----------
does that make sense


---------40:09----------
like you just don't you feel like you're


---------40:12----------
kind of an outsider can you tell me so


---------40:17----------
you said that your mom and your sister


---------40:18----------
is similar in some ways are you and your


---------40:20----------
dad similar did I did I catch that right


---------40:23----------
yeah


---------40:24----------
in what way he's very like his preserved


---------40:29----------
and quiet and true himself and you know


---------40:32----------
also likes green beans like like I got


---------40:35----------
that from him I guess what right now he


---------40:40----------

---------40:43----------

---------40:46----------

---------40:57----------
diagnostic information acne but


---------41:02----------
seriously I don't diagnose or treat


---------41:04----------
mental illnesses on stream yeah that was


---------41:07----------
a joke so so tell me in what way so you


---------41:10----------
you get your reserved you guys both play


---------41:13----------
games what and what other ways do you


---------41:15----------
think you're similar to your dad are you


---------41:21----------
guys touch basically mm-hm can you tell


---------41:25----------
me what growing up was like for you I


---------41:28----------
mean it was easy I guess like I never


---------41:34----------
had any issues in school or anything


---------41:37----------
kinda like in high school I had oh like


---------41:43----------
the three years of high school that me


---------41:45----------
sorry like that was like from 2012 to


---------41:51----------
2014 I was very lazy in school I guess


---------41:57----------
it's kind of normal for teenagers that


---------41:59----------
age like I'm rarely ever did any


---------42:03----------
homework mm-hmm as I was to explain I


---------42:08----------
kind of thought my priorities on like


---------42:10----------
you know having fun playing games over


---------42:13----------
anything school related right on because


---------42:16----------
I didn't like oh I didn't like to call


---------42:18----------
it the course that I was thinking like


---------42:21----------
it was just very not what I wanted to do


---------42:24----------
sure so to kind of avoid that or escape


---------42:28----------
from that just bleep me alright so I


---------42:30----------
failed some classes that I had to retake


---------42:33----------
next year but I still completed it in


---------42:36----------
time okay fine then what are you


---------42:41----------
studying in college psychology actually


---------42:44----------
not surprised yeah last year now yeah


---------42:48----------
and and what do you want to do with that


---------42:53----------
like when I started it I felt like I was


---------42:56----------
for sure gonna go for like cleaning


---------42:58----------
stuff just like people win absolutely


---------43:02----------
yeah psychoanalysis we saw that one cuts


---------43:04----------
my fourth then like less two years I


---------43:10----------
think I've been kind of changing my mind


---------43:12----------
like I want to work we like eSports


---------43:15----------
maybe or like marketing somehow like I


---------43:20----------
wanna like different things don't really


---------43:24----------
see myself in a clinic all day every day


---------43:28----------
like I don't think it really fits me


---------43:30----------
anymore so we don't usually give career


---------43:33----------
advice on stream but one thing that I


---------43:36----------
would say so a lot of people want to


---------43:38----------
work in eSports and just a little bit of


---------43:40----------
career advice it helps to actually have


---------43:42----------
a concrete skill right so I I work in


---------43:47----------
eSports but the reason that I work in


---------43:50----------
eSports is because I have something


---------43:51----------
concrete to offer and believe me eSports


---------43:55----------
folks definitely need mental health


---------43:58----------
support it's a very high-stress


---------44:01----------
profession and so I don't know that you


---------44:04----------
know I think that if you don't want to


---------44:06----------
work in a clinic that's fine but I think


---------44:08----------
it definitely helps to have a concrete


---------44:10----------
like skill if you want to work in


---------44:14----------
eSports and I work with a lot of stress


---------44:17----------
management kind of stuff so I work with


---------44:20----------
professional physical athletes as well


---------44:22----------
and and you know I wouldn't I wouldn't


---------44:26----------
if you really like you know if you like


---------44:28----------
the mind and you like to understand this


---------44:30----------
stuff and things like that I don't think


---------44:31----------
that that precludes you so you know if


---------44:33----------
you think about it like physical sports


---------44:34----------
they have like physical trainers right


---------44:36----------
they have coaches I think one of the


---------44:39----------
biggest things that's missing in eSports


---------44:41----------
is that they don't have like mental


---------44:43----------
health coaches that's what they need


---------44:44----------
because they're stresses are like mental


---------44:47----------
and obtaining flow state staying in flow


---------44:50----------
States understanding team dynamics and


---------44:53----------
team friction and managing egos and


---------44:55----------
understanding feelings and you know if


---------44:57----------
somebody feels like they're gonna get


---------44:58----------
kicked how does that affect their


---------45:00----------
performance how does that affect the way


---------45:02----------
that they interact with their team and


---------45:04----------
then the sad thing is they're afraid


---------45:06----------
they're going to


---------45:06----------
kicked they have anxiety about getting


---------45:08----------
kicked and then their performance drops


---------45:10----------
it causes friction in the team and then


---------45:12----------
what happens Courtney yeah okay


---------45:15----------
absolutely right and it's a


---------45:18----------
self-fulfilling prophecy and if they if


---------45:21----------
there's one thing that's missing in


---------45:23----------
eSports in the video game industry in


---------45:25----------
general it's like people with


---------45:27----------
psychological training because they have


---------45:30----------
a bunch of marketing people right like


---------45:31----------
they're pretty good at that stuff what


---------45:33----------
they don't have is is actually so some


---------45:36----------
some teams actually do have team


---------45:38----------
psychologists and those teams actually


---------45:40----------
there's some interesting anecdotal


---------45:42----------
evidence that those teams far outperform


---------45:45----------
teams that don't have that so they're


---------45:49----------
they're a couple of teams and you guys


---------45:50----------
can do your research or I can talk about


---------45:51----------
it later if you all really want that


---------45:53----------
that work with psychologists and their


---------45:54----------
their performance is very good so I


---------45:59----------
wouldn't I wouldn't toss the


---------46:00----------
psychological stuff out the window if


---------46:02----------
you're interested in these words yeah I


---------46:05----------
intend on like at least for the next


---------46:07----------
couple years working in clinics like you


---------46:10----------
I get the right specializations yep I'm


---------46:16----------
struggling English I think you're doing


---------46:19----------
yeah I kind of want to seek out like the


---------46:24----------
right areas of study before I try to


---------46:27----------
dive in with sounds good can I ask you a


---------46:31----------
couple more questions about kind of


---------46:33----------
upbringing in some of your relationships


---------46:34----------
and how you kind of relate to people so


---------46:38----------
what was it like when you say it was


---------46:40----------
easy like do you remember what your


---------46:41----------
interactions with your parents were like


---------46:43----------
I mean always good what does that mean


---------46:49----------
well it's because I kind of compare


---------46:52----------
myself like my sister now because she's


---------46:55----------
doing like I saw her growing up and it


---------46:57----------
could compare it like her growing up to


---------46:59----------
my brother and so she's much more like a


---------47:06----------
rebel she asks my spared my parents for


---------47:10----------
something they say no she's gonna annoy


---------47:13----------
them she's gonna like call them names


---------47:15----------
she's gonna be rude to them hurt herself


---------47:18----------
to try


---------47:19----------
yeah what she wants that's like things I


---------47:21----------
never did which I asked my parents for


---------47:24----------
something they said no I would just be


---------47:26----------
like yeah that's fine I can just wait


---------47:29----------
for another moment or whatever and like


---------47:32----------
so I never had any confrontations with


---------47:35----------
them I was always very behaved do your


---------47:39----------
parents love you I guess do you feel


---------47:44----------
loved by your parents


---------47:45----------
ah it's kinda like weird because my dad


---------47:54----------
was always more reserved as I said like


---------47:57----------
just like I am like Marcin himself so it


---------48:00----------
was never hugs and kisses and whatnot


---------48:03----------
yep


---------48:07----------
but my mom always like showed her how


---------48:10----------
much she cared about me now I guess like


---------48:14----------
when you get older it kind of changes a


---------48:16----------
lot yes physical it smart you can feel


---------48:21----------
it easier did you know that your mom


---------48:24----------
growing up did you kind of know that you


---------48:28----------
weren't sure what kind of mom you were


---------48:31----------
dealing with look was there like a nice


---------48:35----------
mom and an angry mom yeah I was always


---------48:39----------
very self-aware yeah and so did it feel


---------48:45----------
to you like sometimes that love was sort


---------48:48----------
of like a switch that could be turned on


---------48:50----------
and off I I guess you know wait but the


---------48:59----------
same time like even when she wasn't


---------49:01----------
ready I knew she still like cared about


---------49:04----------
me how did you know that because like


---------49:07----------
every time like if she was very angry at


---------49:09----------
me for some reason


---------49:10----------
which was very rare okay always good


---------49:16----------
things I guess uh like after she got


---------49:20----------
she's [ __ ] by God not firing me or


---------49:22----------
anything she would just ten minutes


---------49:25----------
later she would come and apologize and


---------49:27----------
say how much she felt bad for it how


---------49:30----------
much she loved me and yeah


---------49:33----------
how do i spawn to that yeah we just be


---------49:37----------
like yeah it's okay I know you didn't


---------49:40----------
mean it


---------49:41----------
I and do you have any idea what would


---------49:49----------
have happened if you if you didn't say


---------49:51----------
it was okay I don't know I mean I guess


---------50:00----------
could make her like me again or I


---------50:06----------
wouldn't make sense for a mission like


---------50:08----------
say it's not fine cuz he really was just


---------50:11----------
like stupid things never like me big


---------50:16----------
never got hit like something impactful I


---------50:22----------
guess I was just like raise your voice


---------50:26----------
not really okay I guess like only


---------50:30----------
realize seven or something like some


---------50:33----------
snaps into play that's about it


---------50:35----------
I don't remember okay so it sounds like


---------50:39----------
you you know got along well with your


---------50:41----------
parents can you tell me a little bit


---------50:45----------
about your girlfriend my household uh


---------50:57----------
she's great


---------51:00----------
like she cares a lot about me I can tell


---------51:04----------
like how can you tell she's always


---------51:08----------
saying it and she always shows like how


---------51:10----------
she acts that I like I'm very important


---------51:13----------
to her you know is she important to uh


---------51:17----------
yeah yeah how do you know so I miss her


---------51:24----------
a lot like if I I stay like long times


---------51:29----------
away from her liked her a lot


---------51:31----------
yeah I can't really go a day or two we


---------51:36----------
are speaking to her something how do you


---------51:40----------
feel like Isis beautiful how do you feel


---------51:44----------
when when a day or two passes without


---------51:46----------
speaking to her


---------51:48----------
never happened back I've been dating her


---------51:52----------
for two years


---------51:54----------
hey like we had a little bit of


---------51:57----------
interruption because I was very I guess


---------52:02----------
it was like one of those moments where I


---------52:04----------
got self-aware like I said like you know


---------52:07----------
in my acting you like Who am I so I kind


---------52:11----------
of thought that was me very bad like for


---------52:16----------
her right there you know I mean I'm not


---------52:22----------
sure who I am so how can I say for sure


---------52:25----------
that I love her so like I told her that


---------52:29----------
you know we should just take some time


---------52:32----------
basically and we spend I think two weeks


---------52:35----------
that I just put in touch her whatever


---------52:40----------
and I was very like wasn't good for me


---------52:47----------
to like realize that I misheard that I


---------52:49----------
needed that that I need her her fight


---------52:52----------
for me and like it was very bad for her


---------52:58----------
she got like very sad wouldn't like do


---------53:05----------
anything basically got very depressed


---------53:07----------
benefit hmm no but I feel bad


---------53:12----------
about it even now because I know even


---------53:15----------
though we're back together and


---------53:17----------
everything's back to normal I know that


---------53:19----------
I still hurt her right I think that what


---------53:22----------
feels wrong about the interstate


---------53:26----------
uh I don't know just like she didn't


---------53:30----------
deserve to be hurt and you said you


---------53:36----------
became self-aware what did you become at


---------53:39----------
ur of of how I was from the different


---------53:45----------
different scenarios


---------53:47----------
like we saw her I'm someone compelled


---------53:50----------
become someone else help me understand


---------53:52----------
why that would lead you to take a break


---------53:57----------
from your relationship to kind of


---------53:59----------
explore that why would you do that what


---------54:02----------
difference does it take to her or to


---------54:04----------
your relationship if you don't know who


---------54:06----------
you are


---------54:16----------
stinking face good think yeah I don't


---------54:25----------
know I guess it really didn't make a


---------54:26----------
difference for her but in my like in my


---------54:32----------
mind I was thinking what if this really


---------54:35----------
ships just like butyl ice right cuz


---------54:39----------
what's wrong with that what isn't wrong


---------54:43----------
with that a relationship building lies


---------54:46----------
that's great so I don't know I just I


---------54:54----------
wouldn't want to be in a relationship


---------54:55----------
with someone who is like blind to me


---------55:00----------
it's not the person sure but she's not


---------55:02----------
lying to you


---------55:03----------
would you want to be a relationship


---------55:05----------
where you lied or I other oh why not


---------55:12----------
it's not good


---------55:14----------
lies are not good when I mean right like


---------55:17----------
lying tricky that Santa Claus is real is


---------55:20----------
okay but lies in general or not so corgi


---------55:27----------
do you think people still think you're


---------55:28----------
an [ __ ] right now how do you sound I


---------55:33----------
don't think so right so so can I share a


---------55:37----------
couple of thoughts with you yep


---------55:41----------
so for some reason I feel like maybe


---------55:45----------
taking a little bit more of an


---------55:47----------
educational approach to help you


---------55:48----------
understand maybe why you are the way you


---------55:50----------
are and what could be going on with you


---------55:52----------
and and also kind of try to tie things


---------55:55----------
together a little bit is that okay I I


---------55:59----------
basically have a hypothesis at this


---------56:02----------
point that I'd like to share and you


---------56:06----------
know I don't maybe the reason that I


---------56:09----------
want to share my hypothesis is because I


---------56:11----------
have enough information to form one so I


---------56:14----------
don't know I mean I would love to


---------56:16----------
continue talking to you more we could


---------56:18----------
talk more but I think I basically gotten


---------56:20----------
a an idea of what I think is going on is


---------56:23----------
that is it okay to share that okay


---------56:28----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------56:31----------
I don't think you're a sociopath I think


---------56:36----------
you have so I don't really buy into that


---------56:39----------
term to begin with but I think that the


---------56:41----------
way that you relate to other people in


---------56:43----------
the way that you feel about yourself


---------56:48----------
developed in an environment that really


---------56:52----------
didn't give you a sense of identity or


---------56:54----------
how to relate to other people and I


---------56:57----------
think what we see from your girlfriend


---------56:58----------
is actually strong evidence that you're


---------57:00----------
not a sociopath but you still don't


---------57:03----------
quite understand like what the [ __ ] is


---------57:05----------
going on there like you don't understand


---------57:07----------
your feelings because you've never had


---------57:09----------
you haven't had many situations like


---------57:11----------
this before because it sounds like you


---------57:13----------
very genuinely care about her it sounds


---------57:15----------
like you feel guilty for hurting her and


---------57:17----------
you feel bad about that those are not


---------57:19----------
things that we think about sociopaths


---------57:21----------
doing so I think that essentially what


---------57:24----------
happened is you were raised in a


---------57:25----------
particular way and I'll state I'll say


---------57:27----------
what that is and so your parents didn't


---------57:29----------
do anything wrong by the way it's just


---------57:30----------
you grew up in a particular environment


---------57:32----------
where literally your brain learned how


---------57:36----------
to relate to people in a particular way


---------57:39----------
and it didn't learn how to be empathic


---------57:41----------
for good reasons and now you're like new


---------57:45----------
empathy and you don't quite know what it


---------57:48----------
is but you definitely are like growing


---------57:51----------
up in terms of your empathy with your


---------57:54----------
girlfriend does that make sense so let's


---------57:57----------
try to understand why that happens so


---------58:00----------
let's start by understanding like how do


---------58:02----------
human beings learn empathy if you


---------58:05----------
learned about any of this stuff in your


---------58:06----------
psychology class


---------58:08----------
I think so okay any-any and the ideas


---------58:12----------
are you want me to just launch into


---------58:14----------
lecture mode go ahead okay


---------58:18----------
so let's just start by understanding how


---------58:21----------
to human beings how do like children


---------58:23----------
learn how they feel so you know if a kid


---------58:28----------
like falls down and they scrape their


---------58:31----------
knee how does everyone react to the kid


---------58:35----------
yeah I'll get all wet sorry


---------58:39----------
worried yeah okay but like is the kid


---------58:42----------
really in any danger then why do they


---------58:46----------
they're all like oh my goodness


---------58:49----------
Oh baby fell down oh my goodness why


---------58:52----------
don't we do that there's no danger to


---------58:55----------
the kid right if you fall in scrape your


---------58:58----------
knee this need is everyone around you


---------59:01----------
drop whatever they're doing rushed to


---------59:03----------
you and said oh my god Corgi fell down


---------59:05----------
you scraped your knee oh my god Corgi is


---------59:09----------
so hurt why don't why do we do that with


---------59:11----------
children but we don't do that with it


---------59:12----------
weird right so this is what's happening


---------59:16----------
in it little baby's brain so little baby


---------59:19----------
falls down and feel certain things and


---------59:22----------
they literally do not understand what


---------59:25----------
they feel right does that make sense


---------59:26----------
like a two-year-old does not understand


---------59:28----------
what it feels they don't have that


---------59:30----------
capacity so how do Thanks


---------59:38----------
so how do children understand what they


---------59:42----------
feel is looking at the emotions of


---------59:45----------
people on the outside and this is why


---------59:48----------
adults have exaggerated emotions so that


---------59:52----------
the child if you have a subtle emotion


---------59:54----------
the child can't tell what you're doing


---------59:55----------
but if you have an exaggerated emotion


---------59:57----------
literally what happens in a child's


---------59:59----------
brain is it looks at the worry on your


---------60:02----------
face and it correlates that worry with


---------60:05----------
what it's feeling on the inside and then


---------60:07----------
the child says ah okay this is fear


---------60:10----------
this is worry oh this is happiness


---------60:13----------
because when a child goes poopoo on the


---------60:15----------
potty


---------60:16----------
everyone's like good job Corgi you went


---------60:20----------
a poopoo on the potty in such a big


---------60:22----------
poopoo you're such a good boy it's


---------60:26----------
exaggerated happiness right and so then


---------60:28----------
the child knows okay this is what pride


---------60:30----------
feels like because they look in someone


---------60:32----------
else's face and they're like okay that's


---------60:34----------
pride and that's how you express pride


---------60:36----------
this is how you feel pride what I feel


---------60:40----------
gets determined by what I see from other


---------60:44----------
people with me it's almost like the


---------60:48----------
facial expressions and emotional


---------60:50----------
responses of adults are like the gold


---------60:54----------
standard or the answer key or the facts


---------60:59----------
about their feelings on the inside with


---------61:02----------
me do you understand what like gold


---------61:05----------
standard means yeah okay


---------61:08----------
so what do you think happens to a child


---------61:11----------
who has a parent who is completely


---------61:15----------
neutral what do you think happens to


---------61:18----------
their capacity to understand their


---------61:20----------
emotions it's not there


---------61:24----------
why not because you didn't have like an


---------61:29----------
example to follow exactly so we see this


---------61:33----------
in in parents so now the interesting


---------61:36----------
thing is that so this is this is


---------61:39----------
something called attachment theory I


---------61:40----------
don't know if you've studied attachment


---------61:42----------
theory but you can kind of look at this


---------61:45----------
stuff and basically what what people


---------61:47----------
realized is that like you know the way


---------61:49----------
that emotions are mirrored by parents is


---------61:54----------
the way that children learn their


---------61:58----------
emotional self and the way that they


---------62:00----------
learn empathy it's all about mirroring


---------62:02----------
so if you want to terrify a child all


---------62:06----------
you have to do is look at a child with a


---------62:08----------
completely neutral expression and


---------62:10----------
they're gonna start to cry because they


---------62:12----------
don't understand what's going on and


---------62:14----------
then they get confused


---------62:15----------
children get reassured by seeing


---------62:19----------
emotions in their parents so if we think


---------62:21----------
about it you know in a child's falls and


---------62:23----------
scrapes their knee and the the parent is


---------62:26----------
very very worried then the child starts


---------62:29----------
to you know like they're like okay like


---------62:30----------
the parent is worried and then when the


---------62:32----------
parent calms down what does the child do


---------62:36----------
arms down absolutely right and so like


---------62:40----------
you may have seen this where sometimes


---------62:41----------
if a child falls and adults are quick


---------62:45----------
enough you can do something when a child


---------62:48----------
Falls if you laugh and you make it seem


---------62:51----------
fine


---------62:51----------
then the child is happy - they laugh -


---------62:53----------
and if you're worried then they start to


---------62:55----------
cry you see that their emotions


---------62:59----------
internally to a certain degree or


---------63:01----------
determined by what happens on the


---------63:03----------
outside does that make sense because


---------63:06----------
that's their gold standard so now let's


---------63:09----------
think about you right so your basic


---------63:11----------
problem is that you don't have empathy


---------63:12----------
you don't understand the feelings of


---------63:14----------
others so what one thing that we know


---------63:17----------
from attachment theory and if you look


---------63:18----------
at data children who grow up with


---------63:22----------
parents with personality disorders tend


---------63:25----------
to have difficulty with empathy and the


---------63:28----------
reason is because you have a pretty


---------63:31----------
consistent experience on the inside but


---------63:34----------
depending on how your mom's mood is she


---------63:37----------
can either mirror your experience as


---------63:40----------
well or mirror them poorly does that


---------63:43----------
make sense like if she's having a bad


---------63:45----------
day and she's feeling impulsive and


---------63:47----------
angry then like you can be feeling bad


---------63:50----------
about yourself and she's not gonna like


---------63:52----------
be able to mirror that or you can be


---------63:54----------
feeling good about yourself and she's


---------63:55----------
gonna get pissed at you and I think you


---------63:58----------
learned very very very early on how to


---------64:01----------
almost be manipulative with her what do


---------64:05----------
you think about that does that resonate


---------64:07----------
with you at all like you became the


---------64:11----------
manager of her emotions not the other


---------64:13----------
way around and it's weird because when


---------64:16----------
she feels bad about herself who made her


---------64:20----------
feel better


---------64:22----------
that was weird


---------64:25----------
I used to think like like especially


---------64:30----------
when was I'm like 16 onwards I always


---------64:35----------
felt like my mom was more of a teenager


---------64:37----------
than I was absolutely like all things


---------64:40----------
stabilities and yeah everything was


---------64:43----------
teenager yep absolutely so so adults


---------64:47----------
with BPD feel like teenagers


---------64:50----------
to their children and it's it's a really


---------64:53----------
strange thing that happened to you right


---------64:54----------
because like when you're seven years old


---------64:57----------
and your mom has done something mean to


---------64:59----------
you what you basically did is like you


---------65:03----------
think about like you know when a parent


---------65:04----------
is mean to a seven year old a seven year


---------65:07----------
old should feel very very very hurt


---------65:09----------
right and then mom comes to you and


---------65:12----------
apologizes and then you're hurt kind of


---------65:15----------
like disappears and instead what you are


---------65:18----------
is like caring towards her and so what


---------65:21----------
happens is like you lose a connection


---------65:23----------
with yourself what you are becomes less


---------65:27----------
important than what you need to be for


---------65:29----------
her does that make sense


---------65:32----------
yeah and that's when the chameleon is


---------65:36----------
born


---------65:37----------
that's when is a seven year old you


---------65:39----------
changed your colors on the outside


---------65:41----------
because of what your mom needed and you


---------65:44----------
became what she needed and then you


---------65:46----------
learned this strategy this adaptation


---------65:48----------
and I think you use the word adaptive


---------65:50----------
which i think is a great word you


---------65:52----------
adapted to ignoring what's in here and


---------65:56----------
being what they need out there and then


---------65:59----------
what happened is you discovered


---------66:00----------
something very very cool it worked so


---------66:03----------
now you say that you had a good


---------66:05----------
upbringing this is the crazy thing you


---------66:07----------
didn't have a good upbringing because of


---------66:09----------
your parents you had a good upbringing


---------66:11----------
because of you because you learned how


---------66:14----------
you need to essentially manipulate them


---------66:16----------
but it's not really like manipulation


---------66:18----------
it's just you recognize that if you do a


---------66:21----------
they're gonna do B and if you do C


---------66:24----------
they're gonna do D and you started


---------66:26----------
relating to other human beings by


---------66:28----------
recognizing that like what you feel is


---------66:31----------
not as important is the way that you act


---------66:33----------
towards them because if you act a


---------66:35----------
certain way you're gonna set your mom


---------66:36----------
off and if you don't act a certain way


---------66:38----------
you're not gonna set your mama and then


---------66:41----------
what we see is your sister doesn't have


---------66:43----------
that capability which is why there's


---------66:44----------
tension and sparks always between them


---------66:47----------
and it's also kind of interesting


---------66:49----------
because now this is where where things


---------66:51----------
get kind of like interesting because if


---------66:53----------
you look at the system of like western


---------66:55----------
psychiatry what they say is that


---------66:57----------
narcissism sociopathy and borderline


---------67:00----------
personality disorder are all linked


---------67:03----------
they all have actually a common root and


---------67:06----------
in one person it manifests in this


---------67:09----------
direction it's like a tree can grow


---------67:11----------
straight up it can grow straight to you


---------67:13----------
can grow to the right or it can grow to


---------67:14----------
the left but the root is all the same


---------67:16----------
and these are things that are called


---------67:18----------
cluster B personality disorders so what


---------67:22----------
people in Western psychiatry have done


---------67:24----------
is they've looked at the different kinds


---------67:25----------
of personality disorders and they've


---------67:27----------
said that okay these seem to be kind of


---------67:29----------
like bucketed altogether and then


---------67:31----------
there's cluster a disorders there's


---------67:33----------
cluster C disorders but these are all


---------67:35----------
cluster B and and so it doesn't surprise


---------67:39----------
me at all that you essentially grew up


---------67:41----------
you know in a household where it sounds


---------67:44----------
like your mom has something on the


---------67:46----------
borderline personality spectrum your


---------67:48----------
sister has something on the borderline


---------67:50----------
personality spectrum and you have


---------67:52----------
something on the antisocial or


---------67:53----------
sociopathic spectrum I don't think it's


---------67:56----------
like just genetics like there may be a


---------67:58----------
genetic component - I don't think you're


---------68:00----------
a bad person at all I just think that


---------68:03----------
the reason that you feel like you're a


---------68:04----------
sociopath is because your emotional


---------68:07----------
circuitry is underdeveloped because very


---------68:10----------
early on you learned that like your


---------68:14----------
internal emotional circuitry it got


---------68:17----------
confused because you didn't get


---------68:19----------
appropriate mirroring from your parents


---------68:21----------
and we can kind of see that because your


---------68:23----------
dad is reserved so you've got neutrality


---------68:25----------
from him like he may not have been


---------68:28----------
exaggerated when you bumped your head


---------68:30----------
and then from your mom depending on like


---------68:33----------
which mom she was you got like an


---------68:36----------
appropriate response or an inappropriate


---------68:38----------
response and this is the crazy thing if


---------68:41----------
we think about like kids or teenagers


---------68:43----------
who have strong identities of self what


---------68:48----------
are their parents like but do you know


---------68:51----------
someone who you think has a strong


---------68:53----------
identity of like who they are that's


---------68:56----------
like someone that you know


---------69:04----------
so I'll asked like people who are


---------69:07----------
watching to also just think about who


---------69:09----------
you know who you would describe as


---------69:11----------
having like a good sense of identity and


---------69:13----------
confident about who they are as a person


---------69:15----------
and and think about that person for a


---------69:18----------
second if you could come up with someone


---------69:20----------
you know great if you can't that's okay


---------69:22----------
too because I don't know that people


---------69:24----------
watching are gonna be able to really


---------69:26----------
they're not gonna understand what's in


---------69:28----------
your head but then the next thing that I


---------69:30----------
want you to do is think about okay who


---------69:32----------
do you know who has a strong sense of


---------69:33----------
personal identity and then what are


---------69:35----------
their parents like right so and I think


---------69:41----------
the short answer is that those parents


---------69:45----------
are gonna be very good at being like


---------69:47----------
reflective and supportive for that


---------69:49----------
person's identity and what that means is


---------69:52----------
that like they let that person be who


---------69:54----------
they are but the basic problem corgi is


---------69:56----------
that I don't think I think there were a


---------69:58----------
couple of times in your life or maybe


---------70:00----------
you know everyday to a certain degree


---------70:02----------
that you couldn't who you were being who


---------70:05----------
you were was less important than being


---------70:08----------
who you needed to be for your mom and so


---------70:12----------
you started to wither away and now


---------70:14----------
you're you're sitting at 22 and you're


---------70:16----------
like I don't know who I am and yeah


---------70:18----------
because what the way that you learn who


---------70:20----------
you are is through the mirroring of your


---------70:22----------
parents right and this goes back to the


---------70:24----------
idea when a kid hurts himself how does


---------70:27----------
he know what he feels it's because of


---------70:29----------
the facial expressions he sees on the


---------70:30----------
outside


---------70:32----------
parental mirroring is what helps you


---------70:35----------
determine your identity because then you


---------70:37----------
get data from the outside about who you


---------70:39----------
are on the inside


---------70:41----------
parental mirroring is also supportive


---------70:44----------
parent like parents who are supportive


---------70:45----------
and we see this with like you know to


---------70:48----------
Tiger parent is so Tiger parents or


---------70:52----------
parents that want their kids to be like


---------70:54----------
super super successful and don't give a


---------70:56----------
[ __ ] about their feelings does that make


---------70:57----------
sense to you like so a lot of like you


---------71:01----------
know a lot of people have Tiger parents


---------71:03----------
and like what happens is the child has


---------71:06----------
certain beliefs about like they have


---------71:08----------
certain things that they feel on the


---------71:10----------
inside and the parent basically doesn't


---------71:12----------
give a [ __ ] and the parent says I don't


---------71:14----------
care what you feel on the inside I want


---------71:16----------
you two just do what I want you to do


---------71:18----------
and then those kids grow up to be like


---------71:21----------
not confident and don't know who they


---------71:23----------
are because their parents never gave


---------71:25----------
them an opportunity to like discover who


---------71:28----------
they are because any time that child


---------71:30----------
tries to express their identity what


---------71:32----------
they got from the parent did not connect


---------71:35----------
with what they feel on the inside does


---------71:38----------
that make sense so I think now what's


---------71:41----------
going on is you're starting to find a


---------71:44----------
relationship where someone is kind of


---------71:47----------
mirroring you or you're starting to form


---------71:49----------
an emotional connection and you're


---------71:51----------
scared because you don't really know


---------71:53----------
like how to do this but you're hungry


---------71:55----------
from your for your girlfriend like


---------71:57----------
that's the best thing that I'd describe


---------72:00----------
like you know it sounds like you really


---------72:01----------
do love her and care about her and you


---------72:03----------
do feel things like guilt so you're not


---------72:04----------
like a sociopathic [ __ ] but I think


---------72:07----------
what's what's new to you is like this


---------72:09----------
sort of empathic connection you don't


---------72:10----------
quite know how to do it and and what I'm


---------72:13----------
getting from you is that like you know


---------72:14----------
you're hungry from her for her does that


---------72:16----------
make sense that word help me understand


---------72:20----------
in what way that word makes sense to you


---------72:26----------
well when I started like dating her it


---------72:34----------
was it was basically I decided that I


---------72:39----------
was gonna find someone you know was good


---------72:43----------
for me you know would find a girlfriend


---------72:45----------
a year and it was like a very fast


---------72:50----------
found her and didn't notice that you


---------72:51----------
know she was a good person and she cared


---------72:54----------
about me


---------72:55----------
so I guess I really under for him the


---------73:01----------
way of attention and love and like


---------73:06----------
really well and expressed love you know


---------73:11----------
they died even though I mean I had that


---------73:16----------
a little bit when I was a child really


---------73:22----------
later stages yep so so like that's


---------73:27----------
interesting right because you said that


---------73:29----------
she makes it abundantly clear how she


---------73:32----------
feels about you


---------73:35----------
so she does the equivalent of oh my god


---------73:37----------
Oh Corgi cuz she says she shows and


---------73:42----------
tells you how much she loves you and you


---------73:44----------
have to talk to her every day so she's


---------73:47----------
doing for you what your parents should


---------73:49----------
have done right right she's providing


---------73:53----------
that like amplified emotional response


---------73:56----------
because your capacity to feel emotion is


---------73:59----------
like you know your volume is turned way


---------74:01----------
down so she has to send you big signals


---------74:04----------
and once you get big signals then you


---------74:07----------
start to form a connection and I think


---------74:10----------
you're gonna be okay man I think you're


---------74:13----------
gonna be okay


---------74:13----------
and I don't think you have to end up


---------74:15----------
like your parents and most importantly


---------74:18----------
if you're thinking about having kids one


---------74:19----------
day I think your kids can be normal and


---------74:21----------
healthy right this is not a curse that


---------74:24----------
has to get passed on yeah actually I


---------74:29----------
wanted to ask you yeah because it's not


---------74:36----------
like it doesn't have biological roots


---------74:39----------
right right it's not purely a biological


---------74:43----------
thing well there's a difference between


---------74:45----------
not having biological roots and purely


---------74:48----------
being a biological thing does it have


---------74:51----------
biological roots absolutely is it purely


---------74:53----------
a biological thing absolutely not


---------74:56----------
yeah cuz I was wondering if it was


---------74:58----------
somehow really did you like how children


---------75:02----------
are raised


---------75:04----------
because I can see a lot of things that


---------75:07----------
went wrong like the way my parents


---------75:10----------
raised yeah so so let's remember that


---------75:14----------
how you were raised


---------75:16----------
doesn't mean it wasn't biological right


---------75:20----------
so like like let's like if I lose a hand


---------75:23----------
in an accident when I'm growing up


---------75:27----------
biologically I'm missing a hand does


---------75:31----------
that make sense like so so what happens


---------75:33----------
when you're growing up is your brain


---------75:34----------
wires a certain way and once it wires


---------75:38----------
that way it's absolutely neuroscientific


---------75:41----------
it's like neurological and it's


---------75:43----------
biological like it in your brain your


---------75:46----------
empathic and emotional circuitry is


---------75:48----------
wired in a way that is like different


---------75:51----------
from other people's brains


---------75:52----------
so is it biological for you absolutely


---------75:55----------
but was it is it genetic or pretty


---------75:58----------
determined absolutely not because our


---------76:00----------
brain responds biologically to


---------76:03----------
influences if I'm a chef and I I learn


---------76:07----------
how to taste things the biology of my


---------76:11----------
tongue in my gustatory cortex which is


---------76:14----------
the part of my brain that can taste


---------76:16----------
things is going to be biologically


---------76:18----------
superior to someone who is not a chef


---------76:20----------
with me so here's what we understand


---------76:25----------
about BPD okay the first thing is that


---------76:28----------
there does seem to be a genetic


---------76:30----------
component to it but the tricky thing


---------76:33----------
there is that I think that the genetic


---------76:36----------
component could have to do with


---------76:37----------
upbringing in the way that you're raised


---------76:39----------
by parents who may have a similar


---------76:41----------
personality disorder does that make


---------76:43----------
sense so even then it's not necessarily


---------76:45----------
purely genetic the other thing that we


---------76:47----------
know that supports that it isn't


---------76:48----------
necessarily biological or genetic in


---------76:50----------
origin is that one of the biggest risk


---------76:53----------
factors for BPD you can just yawn it's


---------76:57----------
okay man the the one of the biggest risk


---------77:00----------
factors for BPD is actually trauma at an


---------77:03----------
early age so even if someone wins the


---------77:07----------
genetic lottery and they get traumatized


---------77:08----------
in a bad way there's a decent chance


---------77:11----------
that they'll develop BPD later on in


---------77:13----------
life so that's not genetic but what


---------77:17----------
happens


---------77:17----------
trauma trauma changes our brain right so


---------77:20----------
is that biological like absolutely like


---------77:22----------
the two are connected but it's not


---------77:24----------
predetermined does that answer your


---------77:26----------
question yeah yeah so I think your brain


---------77:30----------
is different and we know that so we've


---------77:32----------
done brain scans on people with BPD and


---------77:34----------
we see that their brain is different


---------77:35----------
from normal people and here's just one


---------77:38----------
example of this so people with BPD if


---------77:40----------
you take an emotional insult the amount


---------77:45----------
of blood flow that goes to the emotional


---------77:49----------
parts of the brain and a BPD person is


---------77:51----------
like twice as much is what goes to a


---------77:54----------
normal person so their brain activates


---------77:58----------
far more rapidly compared to a normal


---------78:01----------
person after an emotional insult the


---------78:04----------
other thing that's really interesting is


---------78:05----------
that it maintains blood flow to that


---------78:08----------
part of the brain for like days longer


---------78:11----------
compared to hours for a normal person so


---------78:14----------
their emotional circuitry turns on way


---------78:17----------
faster and this is what's really


---------78:20----------
different the biggest difference is how


---------78:22----------
long it stays active so for a normal


---------78:25----------
person will feel better after a couple


---------78:26----------
of hours for someone to BPD they'll be


---------78:28----------
they can be upset for days and there's


---------78:31----------
absolutely a biological correlate to


---------78:33----------
that but was it biologically or


---------78:35----------
genetically predetermined no because the


---------78:38----------
brain wired a certain way as a child to


---------78:42----------
be emotionally sensitive and if you want


---------78:45----------
me to keep going I can even explain


---------78:46----------
further and the reason that their brain


---------78:48----------
wires that way is so oftentimes people


---------78:50----------
with BPD grow up in in households with


---------78:53----------
abusive parents and so what they have to


---------78:56----------
do is a survival mechanism is be able to


---------78:59----------
detect a tiny tiny signal from a parent


---------79:01----------
is my parent gonna slap me across the


---------79:04----------
face and they have to know that the


---------79:06----------
second that the parent walks in the door


---------79:08----------
and we had an interview a couple months


---------79:10----------
ago with a guy named iris I started out


---------79:12----------
dyrus Coco B and and you if you guys


---------79:18----------
watch that that interview you'll you'll


---------79:19----------
see I talk about that a lot in depth


---------79:21----------
where like you know kids who grew up in


---------79:24----------
abusive households are very very attuned


---------79:27----------
to the emotional state


---------79:31----------
of their parents and if they're not


---------79:33----------
attuned they get beat so they have to


---------79:36----------
take a tiny tiny signal and amplify it


---------79:39----------
and once they take that tiny single Oh


---------79:41----------
dad's not in a good mood today I better


---------79:43----------
act I better be super super nice and


---------79:46----------
that's absolutely adaptive and then


---------79:48----------
their brain wires to like to jerk up and


---------79:51----------
turn up the volume on all of the


---------79:53----------
emotional stimuli and then they enter a


---------79:55----------
normal relationship and they get [ __ ]


---------79:57----------
because their partner is not trying to


---------79:59----------
tell them that they're a terrible person


---------80:01----------
but they have the volume terms so high


---------80:03----------
that a tiny thing makes them feel


---------80:05----------
terrible and it's absolutely happening


---------80:07----------
in their brain sorry if I kind of went


---------80:12----------
off on a tangent there but thoughts or


---------80:16----------
questions for me Gordy or did I explain


---------80:19----------
enough about BPD any other questions or


---------80:30----------
anything else you want to share


---------80:37----------
don't think so okay cool man can you can


---------80:44----------
you share with me a little bit about


---------80:45----------
what his what you've taken away from


---------80:49----------
this or if this has been helpful and and


---------80:52----------
how yeah I guess it's very helpful I


---------81:02----------
understand a bit more about like what I


---------81:05----------
knew no way yeah and why that I'm not


---------81:12----------
exactly a bad person because of it yes


---------81:16----------
good you know yeah and what are you what


---------81:19----------
do you think you are help me understand


---------81:21----------
what what you learned about yourself


---------81:22----------
today I am just a very adaptive person


---------81:29----------
mm-hmm didn't get uh the right amount of


---------81:39----------
emotion from France yeah yeah and I'd


---------81:45----------
say when it comes to you being


---------81:46----------
manipulative it's just that you're kind


---------81:49----------
of you know I was talking about a chef


---------81:52----------
earlier who has a very fine-tuned palate


---------81:55----------
in your case your emotional palette is


---------81:58----------
very inexperienced so you don't know how


---------82:02----------
to taste different things so when you


---------82:04----------
interact with other people those parts


---------82:07----------
of your brain that normally feet like


---------82:09----------
make people feel bad are not active but


---------82:12----------
they're definitely there right because


---------82:15----------
you feel bad when it comes towards your


---------82:16----------
girlfriend and as you continue to have a


---------82:18----------
healthy relationship and these parts of


---------82:21----------
your brain are gonna start to turn on


---------82:23----------
slowly you may find changes with your


---------82:26----------
interpersonal interactions with other


---------82:28----------
people so over time and I think


---------82:31----------
especially if you have kids your brain


---------82:34----------
undergoes a lot of changes when you have


---------82:36----------
children because it has to so like you


---------82:39----------
have to learn your emotional circuitry


---------82:41----------
has to be like up like jacked up because


---------82:44----------
you have to be able to relate to a child


---------82:45----------
who can't communicate so you have to


---------82:47----------
learn how to be more empathic because


---------82:49----------
they can't tell you


---------82:50----------
thank so you have to be able to read


---------82:51----------
them way better so for me I noticed a


---------82:54----------
big change like the simplest way that I


---------82:55----------
can put it as ice never cry like I


---------82:58----------
didn't cry for like 15 years or some


---------83:00----------
[ __ ]


---------83:00----------
actually I mean I cried yeah I didn't


---------83:03----------
try it for a while and then I used to


---------83:05----------
never cry watching movies and then after


---------83:08----------
I had kids like I watched the Lion King


---------83:10----------
and I was like crying and I was like


---------83:12----------
what is like I was just confused I was


---------83:14----------
like what is happening


---------83:15----------
I don't know crying the same movie like


---------83:21----------
I never cry about anything


---------83:23----------
yep unless like it's me Mickey yeah


---------83:28----------
right Samia yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah


---------83:33----------
yeah I understand I know exactly what


---------83:36----------
you mean because I literally used to be


---------83:38----------
the same way and then like suddenly I


---------83:39----------
had children and like literally what


---------83:41----------
happens is your brain changes when you


---------83:42----------
have kids because it has to learn and


---------83:44----------
then I was like I'm watching blank and


---------83:46----------
I'm like well no one else is crying my


---------83:49----------
kids don't even really understand they


---------83:50----------
just like the animals so I'm sitting


---------83:52----------

---------83:54----------
Saturday afternoon and my kids are


---------83:56----------
watching a Disney movie and I start


---------83:58----------
crying it's like what I was so confused


---------84:01----------

---------84:03----------
back on and and you know I think you'll


---------84:05----------
be okay man and you're not a bad person


---------84:07----------
you're really not cool do you want to


---------84:13----------

---------84:35----------

---------84:42----------

---------84:46----------

---------84:54----------
I want you to do I'm gonna ask you some


---------84:56----------
questions and what I want you to do is


---------84:58----------
pay attention to what happens in your


---------85:01----------
body as I ask you


---------85:03----------
and if you feel something in your body


---------85:06----------
let me know okay so first what's your


---------85:15----------
girlfriend's name if you feel


---------85:16----------
comfortable sharing it it's Sabrina okay


---------85:22----------
so I want you to think about Sabrina


---------85:32----------
what do you feel


---------85:35----------
all right what does that feel like in


---------85:37----------
your body it's like I'm you know like


---------85:43----------
tingling here take the muscles which is


---------85:47----------
mild and yeah okay I smile unconscious


---------85:52----------
okay and now think about the first time


---------85:56----------
we met


---------85:58----------
can you tell us a little bit about it


---------86:02----------
yeah we were we used to talk like online


---------86:07----------
because a mutual friend group and the


---------86:13----------
first time we met we were pinched a


---------86:15----------
movie with a bunch of friends and it was


---------86:19----------
very like funny cuz I was already in the


---------86:25----------
mall that we were gonna watch with my


---------86:29----------
friends and I saw Hurley call me and


---------86:32----------
just going straight up like she didn't


---------86:34----------
notice us because at the time she was


---------86:36----------
very fat like social anxiety uh-huh so


---------86:43----------
she didn't look around at all and just


---------86:46----------
didn't see us and I was like oh there


---------86:48----------
she goes and uh I went to find her with


---------86:51----------
my friends in the I just came like


---------86:54----------
behind her and I was like okay yeah one


---------86:58----------
of those need to tell her we are here


---------86:59----------
and no one wanted to go so I just sent a


---------87:03----------
message like hey look behind you and


---------87:06----------
like it was so it's very like nice to


---------87:10----------
remember cuz it was still cute though if


---------87:13----------
you turn around and you looks now pay


---------87:16----------
attention to your body what do you feel


---------87:20----------
yeah I am


---------87:25----------
you know okay tell me what you feel hey


---------87:32----------
what does that feel like


---------87:34----------
in your body tell me the sensations in


---------87:37----------
your body


---------87:38----------
I just know like I can't stand still I


---------87:42----------
mean energy in there yeah right


---------87:50----------
so sit with nachos there you are


---------87:52----------
yeah sit with that just bask in it


---------87:58----------
pretend like you're you're laying out in


---------88:01----------
the Sun and let that warmth fill you up


---------88:04----------
and if you feel like if tears want to


---------88:06----------
come out they can come out a big deal


---------88:08----------
don't try to hold anything back


---------88:18----------
and how are you what are you feeling in


---------88:20----------
your body or how are you feeling good my


---------88:26----------
eyes are kind of shaky oh all right so


---------88:34----------
these are these this is this is feeling


---------88:37----------
and your brain is trying to process it


---------88:39----------
hasn't tasted things before right


---------88:42----------
everything has been bland and now your


---------88:44----------
brain is trying to understand what are


---------88:46----------
these feelings what is this not quite


---------88:49----------
sure it's okay so now we're gonna go to


---------88:51----------
a different place so now I want you to


---------88:53----------
think a little bit about the moment that


---------88:56----------
you realize that you're an actor and


---------88:58----------
that maybe you don't really love her


---------89:02----------
right think about where that thought


---------89:06----------
came from you tell us a little bit about


---------89:09----------
how you came to that realization it was


---------89:22----------
just that I was just doing things with


---------89:26----------
my sister that day that she was here


---------89:30----------
butter down squeezing those gonna go


---------89:34----------
talk person and


---------89:38----------
and basically the whole time I just


---------89:40----------
didn't set a message for her and I was


---------89:43----------
just thinking like how weird it was that


---------89:47----------
I didn't think about sending her a


---------89:49----------
message or when I thought about sitting


---------89:51----------
here a message I would just think on how


---------89:54----------
should i what should I say and [ __ ]


---------89:57----------
should I act when talking to her you're


---------90:01----------
talking about Sabrina or your sister


---------90:04----------
yeah Sabrina and comparing that to how


---------90:08----------
like I act towards my sister so it's


---------90:12----------
kind of cool


---------90:14----------
mm-hmm so what I'm hearing is you you


---------90:19----------
were a chameleon that didn't know what


---------90:20----------
color it was supposed to be and you were


---------90:23----------
one color with your sister and you


---------90:25----------
weren't sure what color to be with


---------90:27----------
Sabrina and then yeah and then what I


---------90:31----------
want you to think about when you told


---------90:33----------
her what did you say to her when you


---------90:36----------
ended up telling her hey I'm not sure if


---------90:38----------
I I love you or what do you remember


---------90:42----------
what he said fracturing


---------90:56----------
so now what are you feeling in your body


---------91:04----------
it was comfortable gues comfortable or


---------91:12----------
uncomfortable and okay what is the where


---------91:15----------
in your body do you feel uncomfortable


---------91:17----------
sit up straight


---------91:24----------
it's like like hope bar here generally


---------91:32----------
chest and belly good so what would you


---------91:41----------
describe it as tightness or heaviness or


---------91:45----------
some people feel like their throat is


---------91:48----------
constricting it's kind of empty okay so


---------91:56----------
now what we're gonna do is I want you to


---------91:57----------
just sit with that feeling for a second


---------91:59----------
okay so you may feel guilt or hurt or


---------92:02----------
whatever those are the words that we use


---------92:04----------
and I want you to breathe into your


---------92:06----------
belly now now sit up straight


---------92:08----------
and take a deep breath in through your


---------92:12----------
nose and let it come all the way down


---------92:15----------
into your belly slowly breathe out and


---------92:27----------
again in through the nose and out


---------92:30----------
through the nose okay so nice slow deep


---------92:32----------
breath into the belly and then out and


---------92:43----------
now do it


---------92:44----------
third time and this time as you exhale I


---------92:47----------
want you to see if there's warmth in


---------92:49----------
your chest then it's kind of coming from


---------92:53----------
the outside as you exhale and kind of


---------92:56----------
going into that emptiness


---------93:11----------
but it's it's kind of I felt like it was


---------93:14----------
harder for me to like think back off


---------93:19----------
that moment versus the moment at first I


---------93:22----------
heard that oh that one is so much longer


---------93:25----------
ago yep


---------93:27----------
yeah so you're so overall I know it


---------93:33----------
sounds kind of weird but that's


---------93:34----------
basically the practice so what I what I


---------93:37----------
want you to do so let me ask you


---------93:38----------
something when you were breathing in and


---------93:40----------
out what was happening to the sensations


---------93:42----------
in your chest quite an experience how


---------93:45----------
you doing okay I promise we're almost


---------93:49----------
done so let me just ask you one or two


---------93:51----------
last questions what what was happening


---------93:54----------
to the sensation in your middle part as


---------93:56----------
you were breathing I felt like you got


---------94:06----------
kind of worse than I was Brittany right


---------94:10----------
and you've got better when I was


---------94:11----------
exhaling good yeah yeah so so that so so


---------94:19----------
what I recommend to people if they don't


---------94:21----------
know cuz you know at the beginning of


---------94:23----------
this you were like yeah I don't know


---------94:25----------
what I feel but if you're wondering who


---------94:27----------
the real you is corgi it's that person


---------94:31----------
that you just were for like 90 seconds


---------94:34----------
or two minutes or three minutes that's


---------94:36----------
the real you do you see that it's not


---------94:39----------
like an act like that's coming from in


---------94:41----------
here you're not trying to be unless


---------94:42----------
you're really [ __ ] manipulative and


---------94:45----------
you're fooling all of us which is a


---------94:47----------
possibility maybe this is the part of


---------94:48----------
the chameleon where you pry because


---------94:50----------
you're supposed to cry but I don't


---------94:53----------
really I don't think so but I would say


---------94:57----------
that that is the real right ensure


---------95:00----------
you've been a chameleon your entire life


---------95:02----------
but you're in there man and there's good


---------95:04----------
[ __ ] in there and there's bad [ __ ] in


---------95:06----------
there and that's what that's what the


---------95:07----------
real you is it's all of it


---------95:10----------
and all you have to do to get to know


---------95:13----------
that person is to just stop and close


---------95:16----------
your eyes and think back through things


---------95:19----------
or think back through your day and it


---------95:21----------
doesn't have to be big emotions it can


---------95:23----------
be all kinds of things it can be little


---------95:24----------
things again


---------95:25----------
all things it can be fun things it can


---------95:27----------
be ice-cream it can be a plant it can be


---------95:30----------
a sunset and and just let yourself feel


---------95:33----------
what's in there and if things come up as


---------95:37----------
you think about your sister


---------95:38----------
or think about your dad or think about


---------95:40----------
your girlfriend as you think about not


---------95:42----------
texting her for a day or two how do you


---------95:46----------
feel what feelings come up and then


---------95:48----------
breathe into it and then breathe it out


---------95:50----------
and then do that for a while and you'll


---------95:53----------
know who you are be good all right yeah


---------96:00----------
all right man strong work thank you very


---------96:02----------
much for coming on any last questions or


---------96:04----------
thoughts before we wrap up for the day


---------96:08----------
okay guys that's it thanks a lot man


---------96:11----------
take care so that was good that's fun


---------96:18----------
weird huh cuz like he really sounded


---------96:20----------
like a sociopathic [ __ ] at the


---------96:22----------
beginning of that and and that's what


---------96:26----------
I'm saying like you guys got a you know


---------96:28----------
we have to be careful about the way that


---------96:29----------
we judge ourselves and I don't want you


---------96:32----------
guys so this is the this is the problem


---------96:34----------
is that like you know he looks at


---------96:36----------
himself and he judges himself because he


---------96:38----------
doesn't see the full self you guys judge


---------96:41----------
the person that you are today without


---------96:44----------
giving enough credit to what made you


---------96:46----------
that way


---------96:52----------
right and and you know you can notice


---------96:55----------
things about yourself and just be honest


---------96:57----------
it doesn't mean that you're like a bad


---------96:59----------
person he's not a bad person he's just


---------97:02----------
he's he's emotionally his brain


---------97:05----------
circuitry wasn't given an ideal


---------97:07----------
environment to develop


---------97:14----------
yeah anyway


---------97:19----------
and yeah right so he's


---------97:25----------
okay um would a true sociopath even know


---------97:30----------
or admit that he was yeah so that so


---------97:32----------
this is an interesting question because


---------97:33----------
it implies a true sociopath is a binary


---------97:36----------
thing right it's like a true sociopath


---------97:40----------
is like a hundred percent likes


---------97:41----------
sociopathy is is a personality trait


---------97:45----------
that has a scale there are some people


---------97:47----------
at one end of the scale and another


---------97:49----------
other people at the other end of the


---------97:51----------
scale and I don't think that I mean


---------97:54----------
maybe as a true sociopath exists but in


---------97:58----------
my overwhelming experience it's a scale


---------98:01----------
and even if you think about like


---------98:03----------
neuropsychological testing it's a scale


---------98:05----------
and you get a score it's not binary it's


---------98:08----------
not like yes or no right and and I think


---------98:14----------
that most people know most people who


---------98:15----------
are like test hilum on sociopathy scale


---------98:18----------
have an inkling like he knows right like


---------98:20----------
he knows that he's a chameleon and like


---------98:22----------
he knows he's manipulative and he knows


---------98:24----------
that that's the way that he functions so


---------98:27----------
I I wouldn't be surprised I mean if he


---------98:29----------
got psychological testing and was


---------98:31----------
thoroughly evaluated and things like


---------98:32----------
that there's a decent chance that


---------98:34----------
someone would diagnose him with


---------98:35----------
sociopathy but I I mean I think that


---------98:38----------
that that doesn't mean he's a bad person


---------98:40----------
so that's the other thing that's


---------98:41----------
happened is that in our society


---------98:43----------
sociopathy which is a personality


---------98:45----------
characteristic which roughly correlates


---------98:48----------
with like you know super we have empaths


---------98:50----------
on one end of the spectrum and we have


---------98:53----------
sociopaths on the other end of the


---------98:54----------
spectrum and it's kind of a spectrum of


---------98:56----------
like where where your empathic you know


---------98:58----------
how empathic you are in and oftentimes


---------99:01----------
what happens is we have like moral


---------99:03----------
judgments that we place on a certain


---------99:06----------
personality characteristic but I'll say


---------99:09----------
again that surgeons and psychiatrists


---------99:12----------
test highly on sociopathy scale and


---------99:14----------
that's because it's like an adaptive


---------99:16----------
part of our job if I was super empathic


---------99:18----------
and kind of fell apart every time I was


---------99:20----------
with a suicidal person I have colleagues


---------99:22----------
who are very empathic and their job is


---------99:24----------
like hard they suffer a lot


---------99:30----------
so you know it's it's it's not like a


---------99:32----------
good or a bad thing and I think if you


---------99:34----------
guys really stop and and listen to him


---------99:37----------
he's actually incredibly more right and


---------99:40----------
even so more moral than someone who


---------99:42----------
maybe


---------99:45----------
you know more moral than someone who may


---------99:48----------
be empathic because without those


---------99:50----------
feelings he tries to do right by people


---------99:53----------
right so he it's like it's not like he's


---------99:55----------
like emotionally drawn he makes choices


---------99:58----------
out of like a genuine sense of choice


---------100:04----------
are you allowed to say what mental


---------100:08----------
illness he thinks someone may have on


---------100:10----------
streams sort of so I don't diagnose


---------100:12----------
surfeit mental illnesses so I don't make


---------100:14----------
diagnoses but I think it's fair to say I


---------100:17----------
mean I think I have sort of an ethical


---------100:18----------
responsibility to say like hey man you


---------100:20----------
may want to get that checked out right


---------100:21----------
so if someone that struggles with


---------100:23----------
anxiety sometimes I'll say to people


---------100:25----------
like hey you should really think about


---------100:26----------
seeing a therapist and see if you've


---------100:28----------
really got that I think that that's fair


---------100:29----------
it's not me making a diagnosis it's just


---------100:31----------
me suggesting that it it's worth looking


---------100:34----------
into it's sort of like you know if I see


---------100:36----------
someone on the street who's got like a


---------100:37----------
lump that I think could be cancerous I'm


---------100:40----------
not gonna make a diagnosis but I'm gonna


---------100:41----------
say like hey man maybe you want to get


---------100:42----------
that [ __ ] biopsy right that that I think


---------100:44----------
is a duty that comes with knowledge yeah


---------100:50----------
so I thought that was really fantastic I


---------100:53----------
hope you guys enjoyed it you know a lot


---------100:54----------
of people have been asking about


---------100:55----------
sociopathy and and so hopefully that was


---------100:59----------
helpful and I think that's actually a


---------101:00----------
really good example of what I think real


---------101:03----------
sociopathic tendencies sort of looked


---------101:05----------
like and it's conflict it's like


---------101:06----------
complicated and oftentimes it has to do


---------101:09----------
with like the way that this person was


---------101:10----------
raised and then the way that they were


---------101:12----------
talking about emotions and things like


---------101:14----------
that so you know thank you guys very


---------101:19----------
much for watching thank you guys for


---------101:24----------
supporting us and you know supporting us


---------101:33----------
during Mental Health Awareness Month I


---------101:34----------
think sociopathy is one of these things


---------101:36----------
that's poorly understood and if you guys


---------101:38----------
feel like y'all are sociopaths then like


---------101:40----------
that doesn't mean that you're bad people


---------101:42----------
and chances are you know you are that


---------101:44----------
way for a reason and it's like you can


---------101:46----------
still change like you don't have to be


---------101:47----------
that way that's the cool thing about


---------101:49----------
personality quote-unquote disorders is


---------101:51----------
that even though that your brain is


---------101:53----------
wired a certain way it's not like you


---------101:55----------
can change like people people with BPD


---------101:57----------
can no longer be criteria


---------101:58----------
or even be cured of BPD it I mean it


---------102:02----------
happens right people who are like


---------102:04----------
codependent which is another personality


---------102:05----------
disorder or people who are narcissistic


---------102:08----------
they can no longer be narcissistic or no


---------102:11----------
longer meet criteria for the disorder


---------102:13----------
which this is a tricky thing about


---------102:15----------
psychiatry as we like draw a line and we


---------102:17----------
say you either have it or you don't have


---------102:18----------
it but it's all a spectrum and people


---------102:21----------
can get better right like I used to be a


---------102:22----------
narcissistic [ __ ] too and I got


---------102:25----------
better can alexithymia be treated


---------102:27----------
absolutely so he's also Alexa thymic in


---------102:29----------
the way that you treat alexithymia is


---------102:31----------
exactly what we did right he's a guy and


---------102:32----------
he's like yeah I don't cry and then like


---------102:34----------
within 30 seconds he's like tearing up


---------102:37----------
thinking about his girlfriend that's how


---------102:39----------
you treat alexithymia it's like you just


---------102:41----------
teach people how to engage with their


---------102:43----------
emotions and you teach them how to taste


---------102:45----------
things and it's gonna start with big


---------102:47----------
signals right if I started to ask him


---------102:49----------
about his sister he's probably got


---------102:51----------
emotions there that are buried too but


---------102:53----------
we start with the girlfriend he learns


---------102:55----------
how to taste taste those those emotions


---------102:58----------
amplified responses from girlfriend as


---------103:00----------
he becomes more sensitive or more in


---------103:02----------
tune he can tap into other emotions tap


---------103:04----------
into other emotions tap into other


---------103:06----------
emotions so what about internet trolls I


---------103:11----------
love talking to internet trolls and none


---------103:13----------
of them seem to want to come on though


---------103:14----------
so what's the difference between


---------103:18----------
alexithymia and sociopathy so


---------103:20----------
alexithymia is is a symptom right it's a


---------103:24----------
particular slice of thing and its


---------103:25----------
inability to determine your internal


---------103:28----------
emotional state sociopathy is people who


---------103:32----------
don't feel empathy so sociopathy is is I


---------103:35----------
mean there are more complicated


---------103:37----------
definitions or better definitions that


---------103:39----------
when I'm giving I'm giving a simplistic


---------103:41----------
term but the way that I think about


---------103:42----------
sociopathy is I think about it as a


---------103:44----------
spectrum on like the empathic scale and


---------103:46----------
so its inability to like feel of the


---------103:50----------
emotions of other people and alexithymia


---------103:51----------
is an inability to determine your own


---------103:53----------
emotions so it's an issue of direction


---------103:55----------
good question though yeah so one person


---------104:02----------
says how about if I feel too emotional


---------104:04----------
like sometimes I get emotional watching


---------104:06----------
things that are not emotional at all


---------104:07----------
yeah that that signals to me that you've


---------104:09----------
got pent up emotions that are buried


---------104:11----------
down there


---------104:12----------
that come up at random times so you got


---------104:14----------
to process that stuff too that's more


---------104:16----------
about cleaning apps and processing old


---------104:19----------
emotions that have built up do you talk


---------104:21----------
with viewers absolutely that's what we


---------104:23----------
do so we usually do yeah okay there's no


---------104:28----------
one a truly bad person no I think there


---------104:30----------
can be people who can be bad people


---------104:31----------
absolutely


---------104:33----------
yeah people can do bad things


---------104:37----------
sure so
