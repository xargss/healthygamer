---------00:00----------
they're looking for that one thing no


---------00:01----------
mom of course i don't hate you


---------00:03----------
oh my god mom i'm so sorry please stop


---------00:05----------
crying and then you pat them all


---------00:08----------
narcissism dr k's comments about


---------00:11----------
narcissism


---------00:12----------
have shaken me from the stream today dr


---------00:14----------
k talked about narcissistic tendencies


---------00:17----------
and i realized that what he has


---------00:18----------
described that he is describing me


---------00:20----------
perfectly


---------00:21----------
i feel as though this piece of


---------00:22----------
information has completed a puzzle i've


---------00:24----------
been trying to figure out since i was


---------00:26----------
22.


---------00:26----------
i'm now 38 so i'm probably one of the


---------00:28----------
oldest people here and i'll tell you


---------00:30----------
15 years of anxiety and depression is no


---------00:33----------
fun thing


---------00:34----------
manipulating people expecting special


---------00:36----------
treatment expecting success


---------00:38----------
without putting the effort in slow


---------00:39----------
degradation of relationships not caring


---------00:42----------
about others etc


---------00:43----------
false modesty and hoping for adoration


---------00:46----------
it feels like a massive rock has been


---------00:48----------
dropped on me i realize that my ego and


---------00:50----------
expectations have been the root of


---------00:52----------
so many problems in my life i've always


---------00:54----------
known i have low self-esteem and i can


---------00:56----------
see how that


---------00:57----------
that low confidence has led me to this


---------00:59----------
bizarre state of mind where you expect


---------01:01----------
the world


---------01:02----------
for no good reason dr k if you're


---------01:05----------
reading this please please please do a


---------01:07----------
video about steps one can take to reduce


---------01:08----------
this trait


---------01:09----------
and take steps in the right direction i


---------01:11----------
really need some guidance here any


---------01:13----------
advice from other members would be


---------01:14----------
greatly appreciated too


---------01:16----------
so let's start off so before we get to


---------01:19----------
advice


---------01:19----------
okay what we're gonna do is talk a


---------01:21----------
little bit about


---------01:23----------
narcissism in in a kind of a weird way


---------01:26----------
so the first thing that i'm going to


---------01:28----------
give you guys kind of a a quick


---------01:29----------
backstory okay


---------01:31----------
so i think what this poster was


---------01:32----------
referring to last week on stream we


---------01:34----------
talked a little bit about


---------01:36----------
how narcissism manifests kind of in two


---------01:39----------
ways


---------01:40----------
right so if i have if i'm insecure about


---------01:43----------
myself


---------01:43----------
one way i can deal with that is to be


---------01:45----------
arrogant so


---------01:46----------
like i put on this like very like big


---------01:49----------
shell


---------01:50----------
that's like grandiose and i'm like hey


---------01:52----------
everyone look at me


---------01:53----------
i'm so awesome and i need other people's


---------01:56----------
adoration


---------01:57----------
the other thing that sometimes happens


---------02:00----------
that can result in like people sort of


---------02:02----------
being kind of manipulative and hard to


---------02:05----------
deal with but they're not


---------02:06----------
arrogant is for people to actually have


---------02:10----------
like insecurity on the inside but then


---------02:12----------
they still engage in all of these


---------02:14----------
behaviors to like get other people to


---------02:16----------
like like them but they're not like


---------02:18----------
arrogant behaviors they're like softer


---------02:21----------
behaviors


---------02:22----------
so there are things like excessive


---------02:23----------
modesty um


---------02:25----------
you know like like sort of help seeking


---------02:27----------
kind of behavior like


---------02:29----------
oh woe is me behavior they have these


---------02:31----------
emotional needs of insecurity where like


---------02:34----------
they need to


---------02:35----------
feel loved and respected by other people


---------02:38----------
and they just engage in like


---------02:40----------
non-arrogant behaviors


---------02:42----------
to sort of get that kind of like


---------02:44----------
reassurance from the outside


---------02:46----------
and this creates a real problem in


---------02:48----------
relationships because like


---------02:50----------
sometimes when you're with these kinds


---------02:51----------
of people like they're not doing


---------02:53----------
anything


---------02:53----------
wrong but you still sort of feel


---------02:55----------
subconsciously manipulated


---------02:58----------
and when you feel subconsciously


---------02:59----------
manipulated like if you start to blame


---------03:01----------
them in your mind you kind of like feel


---------03:03----------
guilty


---------03:04----------
so you're kind of in this situation


---------03:05----------
where like oh man like this this person


---------03:08----------
is trapping me but also like making me


---------03:11----------
feel like an [ __ ] for being trapped


---------03:13----------
it's kind of really hard to describe but


---------03:14----------
like that's what i would kind of say


---------03:17----------
so this is a weird kind of subtle


---------03:19----------
narcissism so today what i want to talk


---------03:21----------
to you all about is like kind of the two


---------03:23----------
types of narcissism okay


---------03:25----------
so to start off with let's start with


---------03:28----------
kind of looking at


---------03:29----------
yoga so what we want to do is we want to


---------03:31----------
start by sort of understanding


---------03:33----------
narcissism and by


---------03:34----------
the way that we're going to understand


---------03:35----------
narcissism is actually through a yogic


---------03:38----------
lens all right so in yoga we have


---------03:41----------
three parts of our mind the manus is our


---------03:43----------
emotional mind


---------03:44----------
the ahamkara is our ego and the buddhi


---------03:48----------
is our intellect there's usually like an


---------03:50----------
interplay here where


---------03:51----------
the the goal of the ahamkar is to be a


---------03:53----------
bouncer


---------03:54----------
is to protect us from feeling hurt


---------03:58----------
so anytime we feel hurt in our emotional


---------04:01----------
mind


---------04:02----------
the bouncer steps in and then goes to


---------04:05----------
our intellect and like


---------04:07----------
tells us to rationalize


---------04:10----------
okay so the classic example that i use


---------04:12----------
when illustrating this is


---------04:14----------
i remember when i was in college my


---------04:16----------
friends and i would talk about the


---------04:18----------
ladies


---------04:19----------
and then eventually one of us would like


---------04:21----------
muster up the courage to ask one of the


---------04:23----------
girls out


---------04:25----------
and when we asked her out and she said


---------04:27----------
no


---------04:28----------
then something weird happened because


---------04:30----------
then we'd start like


---------04:31----------
dissing her right like we'd start saying


---------04:33----------
oh she's not that attractive


---------04:35----------
she's not even that great oh yeah i was


---------04:38----------
like i was like


---------04:39----------
you know she's like i'm i i can do


---------04:42----------
better than that


---------04:42----------
and we sort of do this weird kind of


---------04:44----------
like rationalization to like


---------04:46----------
put her down and pump ourselves up and


---------04:49----------
so that's actually what's going on there


---------04:51----------
is we feel hurt by the rejection


---------04:54----------
and then our ego steps in and is like oh


---------04:56----------
no


---------04:57----------
we're feeling hurt let's feel better


---------05:00----------
and then it goes over to the intellect


---------05:03----------
and it's like hey


---------05:04----------
come up with some kind of


---------05:05----------
rationalizations about how awesome we


---------05:08----------
are


---------05:08----------
and let's put her down and let's pump


---------05:11----------
ourselves up


---------05:12----------
i need evidence to support these two


---------05:14----------
goals okay


---------05:16----------
so this is kind of a quick primer so


---------05:17----------
let's take a look at narcissism


---------05:20----------
so in narcissism what we're talking


---------05:22----------
about is


---------05:23----------
low internal self-worth so people with


---------05:25----------
narcissism


---------05:26----------
actually like the reason they're


---------05:28----------
arrogant is because they actually have


---------05:30----------
low internal self-worth


---------05:32----------
and so this is where what we usually see


---------05:35----------
right when we think about narcissism is


---------05:36----------
like people who are narcissistic have to


---------05:39----------
like


---------05:39----------
advertise how good they are so since you


---------05:42----------
have low


---------05:42----------
uh internal self-worth what we have to


---------05:44----------
do is we rely


---------05:46----------
on external


---------05:49----------
signs of worth so if i don't feel


---------05:53----------
confident in myself


---------05:55----------
what i end up doing is like i'll go to


---------05:57----------
like other people


---------05:58----------
and i'll like i i need them to


---------06:01----------
explain to me that i'm really really


---------06:03----------
awesome right so when we think about the


---------06:05----------
traditional narcissists we're thinking


---------06:07----------
about


---------06:07----------
sort of traditional narcissism okay so


---------06:10----------
like if we look at the


---------06:11----------
uh features of traditional narcissism


---------06:13----------
we're talking about stuff like arrogance


---------06:15----------
okay we're talking about like showing


---------06:17----------
off


---------06:19----------
we're talking about being grandiose


---------06:22----------
right so like


---------06:23----------
if i don't believe that like i'm a good


---------06:25----------
person on the inside


---------06:27----------
what i have to do is like advertise how


---------06:29----------
awesome i am


---------06:30----------
if i don't think that i'm like a great


---------06:32----------
person like and i don't have an


---------06:33----------
intrinsic sense of self-worth


---------06:35----------
i need to wear really expensive clothes


---------06:37----------
i need to drive a really nice car


---------06:38----------
because then i can


---------06:39----------
show the world how much i'm worth i need


---------06:42----------
a really big title


---------06:43----------
at work i need to have a lot of money


---------06:46----------
not only do i need to have a lot of


---------06:47----------
money i need to show people that i have


---------06:49----------
a lot of money


---------06:50----------
and sometimes we even end up with a 30


---------06:52----------
000


---------06:53----------
millionaire which is someone who makes


---------06:55----------
30 grand a year


---------06:56----------
but lives like a millionaire they rack


---------06:58----------
up the credit card debt they like drive


---------07:00----------
nice cars they're like living the high


---------07:02----------
life


---------07:03----------
and you know they're gonna make all


---------07:04----------
their money down the road like they know


---------07:06----------
that they're gonna be like


---------07:07----------
they're gonna hit it because they're so


---------07:09----------
awesome right so we have sort of this


---------07:11----------
traditional narcissism


---------07:13----------
which we can also kind of think of as


---------07:15----------
thick-skinned so these people sort of


---------07:17----------
seem thick-skinned because if you insult


---------07:19----------
them you know they're not going to start


---------07:21----------
crying


---------07:21----------
they're very overt right they show off


---------07:25----------
they're very also oblivious this is what


---------07:27----------
we think of in terms of narcissism


---------07:29----------
they're so clueless the world revolves


---------07:31----------
around them


---------07:32----------
they don't think about anyone else


---------07:34----------
relating to this is exhibitionistic


---------07:36----------
showing off right they're grandiose


---------07:40----------
and if you also think about traditional


---------07:42----------
narcissists they


---------07:43----------
they devalue other people so when it


---------07:46----------
comes to dealing with other people


---------07:47----------
they'll


---------07:48----------
kind of devalue them okay what these


---------07:50----------
people do is they have to elicit


---------07:52----------
reassurance


---------07:54----------
okay so we're gonna end up eliciting


---------07:55----------
reassurance because that's what you need


---------07:57----------
right you guys remember this


---------08:00----------
we have to rely on external stuff so i


---------08:02----------
have to like post stuff on social media


---------08:05----------
and then everyone's going to tell me how


---------08:06----------
awesome i am i'm going to tell everyone


---------08:09----------
i got promoted i'm gonna wear these nice


---------08:13----------
clothes


---------08:13----------
and then when you get those compliments


---------08:15----------
when people give you likes and stuff


---------08:17----------
like that


---------08:18----------
that in turn enhances your self-worth


---------08:20----------
but only for a time because it's


---------08:22----------
external right


---------08:23----------
so what these people end up with is sort


---------08:26----------
of like this fragile sense of self-worth


---------08:28----------
because if people don't compliment your


---------08:30----------
clothes


---------08:31----------
and someone else in the room is like by


---------08:33----------
the way you got promoted oh i just like


---------08:35----------
started my own company


---------08:37----------
so it's a very like fragile sense of


---------08:39----------
self-worth that like


---------08:41----------
can fluctuate very wildly which is what


---------08:43----------
leads to kind of this like


---------08:45----------
bad behavior okay so this results in bad


---------08:48----------
behavior


---------08:49----------
this is why they become arrogant and


---------08:51----------
they devalue other people


---------08:52----------
so if someone if i got a promotion and


---------08:55----------
then someone else is like oh i just


---------08:56----------
started my own company


---------08:58----------
then i'm gonna have to devalue that


---------08:59----------
person to poop on them to make myself


---------09:01----------
feel better


---------09:02----------
because they're exposing my inferiority


---------09:04----------
and remember the ahm guard doesn't want


---------09:06----------
that it's the bouncer of the mind


---------09:08----------
so it's like oh no this person is making


---------09:09----------
me feel bad


---------09:11----------
so let's not do that so this is what


---------09:13----------
people think of as narcissism make sense


---------09:15----------
chat


---------09:16----------
so now the interesting thing is that if


---------09:18----------
we look at the pieces


---------09:20----------
okay if we look at these pieces over


---------09:22----------
here and we look at these pieces over


---------09:24----------
here


---------09:25----------
and we look at eliciting reassurance


---------09:28----------
and we look at enhancing self-worth


---------09:31----------
and we look at bad behavior there's


---------09:33----------
actually another


---------09:35----------
set of features which hits all of these


---------09:38----------
same things okay


---------09:42----------
and this is what this poster is talking


---------09:44----------
about so let's go back to the top


---------09:46----------
so let's talk about non-traditional


---------09:49----------
narcissism


---------09:50----------
let's take a look at our list chat and


---------09:52----------
let's see if we can figure this out


---------09:53----------
okay so thick skinned


---------09:57----------
what do you guys think these people are


---------09:59----------
like thin


---------10:00----------
skin overt


---------10:03----------
oblivious hyper vigilant exhibitionistic


---------10:08----------
in the closet or closeted okay


---------10:11----------
grandiose vulnerable and instead of


---------10:14----------
devaluing


---------10:15----------
they idealize okay


---------10:18----------
so this is the the profile of a


---------10:20----------
non-traditional narcissist so let's run


---------10:22----------
through this real quick okay


---------10:23----------
so like when people insult you instead


---------10:26----------
of fighting back


---------10:27----------
you feel really hurt but still on the


---------10:29----------
inside the reason that you have to fight


---------10:31----------
back


---------10:32----------
like if if i get insulted by someone and


---------10:34----------
i don't feel confident let's say about


---------10:36----------
my intelligence


---------10:37----------
right what i have to do is i have to


---------10:39----------
argue with them i have to prove them


---------10:41----------
wrong


---------10:41----------
because secretly on the inside i believe


---------10:44----------
that i'm i may not be very smart


---------10:46----------
so that's the traditional narcissist the


---------10:49----------
belief is still the same in the


---------10:50----------
non-traditional


---------10:51----------
narcissists they still feel insecure but


---------10:53----------
instead what they do is they feel hurt


---------10:55----------
they avoid right they withdraw


---------10:58----------
so we'll get to these in a second but


---------11:01----------
we'll get to like avoidance behaviors


---------11:03----------
and then they're also so the the the


---------11:05----------
traditional narcissist is over


---------11:06----------
while the non-traditional narcissist is


---------11:09----------
covert


---------11:10----------
so both of them once again are insecure


---------11:12----------
so how does the traditional narcissist


---------11:13----------
deal with it they deal with it by like


---------11:15----------
advertising how awesome they are whereas


---------11:18----------
the


---------11:18----------
the non-traditional narcissist hides


---------11:21----------
right i don't want people to see me i


---------11:23----------
don't want people to hear me i don't


---------11:25----------
like


---------11:25----------
oh my god like everyone is like going to


---------11:28----------
realize how


---------11:29----------
bad i am and we'll get to that in a


---------11:30----------
second so then we get to oblivious


---------11:32----------
versus hyper vigilant right so the


---------11:33----------
traditional narcissist


---------11:34----------
is like doesn't think about or doesn't


---------11:36----------
appear to be aware of


---------11:38----------
how other people think or feel whereas


---------11:40----------
the non-traditional narcissist is hyper


---------11:42----------
vigilant


---------11:43----------
they're always paying attention to how


---------11:45----------
other people are reacting and how they


---------11:46----------
feel


---------11:48----------
the traditional narcissist is


---------11:49----------
exhibitionistic kind of


---------11:51----------
related to covert so like the


---------11:53----------
non-traditional narcissist keeps


---------11:55----------
everything on the inside


---------11:56----------
and will occasionally show people things


---------11:59----------
so instead of being grandiose they'll be


---------12:00----------
vulnerable and this is a big one chat


---------12:03----------
so the traditional narcissist places


---------12:06----------
everyone else below them right so i am


---------12:08----------
here


---------12:09----------
and i need to put other people down here


---------12:13----------
this balances things out whereas the


---------12:15----------
non-traditional


---------12:16----------
narcissist puts everyone up here they


---------12:19----------
idealize instead


---------12:21----------
oh look at how crappy i am everyone in


---------12:24----------
the world is better than i am


---------12:26----------
so then this leads to manipulative


---------12:28----------
behaviors via eliciting reassurance


---------12:31----------
what are the behaviors that the


---------12:32----------
non-traditional narcissists engage in


---------12:34----------
let's look at this


---------12:35----------
right so they avoid and they hide but


---------12:38----------
they also


---------12:39----------
emotionally manipulate because you feel


---------12:41----------
insecure about yourself so you'll do


---------12:42----------
things like seek reassurance


---------12:46----------
you know you'll do these like little


---------12:48----------
like things that sometimes are quite


---------12:49----------
frustrating to people they're like oh


---------12:50----------
are you busy


---------12:52----------
oh you're busy today oh that's okay


---------12:55----------
i i i know you have a real life worth


---------12:59----------
living it's okay don't worry about it


---------13:00----------
i'm gonna hang up now


---------13:02----------
you go enjoy your life and then the


---------13:05----------
other person on on the phone is like


---------13:06----------
wait what


---------13:07----------
what what what what's happening like


---------13:09----------
wait


---------13:10----------
what and so what they end up doing is


---------13:12----------
they have this


---------13:13----------
hunger that comes from their low


---------13:15----------
self-esteem


---------13:17----------
so what they'll end up doing is like all


---------13:19----------
kinds of stuff being falsely modest like


---------13:21----------
you know eliciting reassurance in some


---------13:24----------
way but it's kind of like this sneaky


---------13:25----------
kind of manipulative


---------13:26----------
sort of like you know like woe is me and


---------13:29----------
like you're so awesome and i'm so bad


---------13:32----------
and they do that like all these things


---------13:33----------
because when you say that to someone


---------13:34----------
right it's not insulting


---------13:35----------
like when you're dealing with an


---------13:37----------
arrogant narcissist you don't want to


---------13:38----------
spend time with them because they're


---------13:39----------
being an [ __ ] to you


---------13:41----------
and when you're dealing with a


---------13:41----------
non-traditional narcissist it's like you


---------13:43----------
still don't want to spend time with them


---------13:45----------
but you feel guilty for not wanting to


---------13:46----------
spend with time time with them


---------13:48----------
so you end up spending time with them


---------13:49----------
anyway and like trying to convince them


---------13:51----------
that they're awesome


---------13:52----------
it's kind of this weird thing that like


---------13:54----------
once again


---------13:56----------
sort of enhances self-worth what doesn't


---------13:59----------
really enhance self-worth


---------14:00----------
temporarily but it doesn't really unders


---------14:02----------
like it doesn't really address the


---------14:04----------
insecurity


---------14:05----------
because you're kind of manipulating them


---------14:06----------
into


---------14:08----------
like you know supporting you and so this


---------14:10----------
is kind of an


---------14:11----------
interesting pattern of non-traditional


---------14:13----------
narcissism


---------14:15----------
and it's it's interesting because the


---------14:16----------
reason i call it narcissism is if we go


---------14:18----------
back to the roots


---------14:20----------
there are a lot of common factors right


---------14:22----------
so low internal self-worth and


---------14:24----------
relying on external sense of self-worth


---------14:26----------
to


---------14:27----------
buffer your internal sense of self-worth


---------14:29----------
this is the last key thing okay this is


---------14:31----------
going to be the last thing that ties all


---------14:33----------
this together


---------14:34----------
spends a lot


---------14:38----------
of time thinking


---------14:41----------
about how they


---------14:45----------
are perceived so this is the last common


---------14:48----------
element


---------14:49----------
so in both of these situations if we're


---------14:51----------
talking about what are the traits of


---------14:53----------
narcissism it's this box right here


---------14:55----------
because both of these people at the end


---------14:56----------
of the day 20 of their ram


---------14:58----------
is spent thinking about how other people


---------15:01----------
are thinking about them


---------15:02----------
oh does this person realize how awesome


---------15:05----------
i am if they don't realize how


---------15:07----------
awesome i am i better tell them does


---------15:09----------
this person


---------15:11----------
think about how pathetic i am if they


---------15:13----------
don't realize how pathetic i am i better


---------15:15----------
tell them i better advertise


---------15:17----------
i better get some get me some of that


---------15:20----------
sweet sweet


---------15:21----------
reassurance and then like and so this is


---------15:25----------
sort of like a good example of


---------15:26----------
understanding like traditional and


---------15:28----------
non-traditional narcissism so what are


---------15:30----------
the key features here


---------15:32----------
and and what are we kind of talking


---------15:34----------
about so the first thing to understand


---------15:36----------
is that


---------15:36----------
not all narcissists are the same and we


---------15:39----------
sort of have this idea in society that


---------15:42----------
narcissism is characterized by like


---------15:44----------
arrogance and devaluing others and


---------15:46----------
things like that


---------15:47----------
but if we go to the roots of it there's


---------15:49----------
another subtle kind of narcissism


---------15:51----------
and i call it narcissism but really from


---------15:53----------
a yogic perspective it's


---------15:54----------
a an ahamkar that's kind of bent out of


---------15:56----------
shape


---------15:57----------
low internal self-worth so i need


---------15:59----------
external reassurance from other people


---------16:02----------
and then like since i need that external


---------16:03----------
reassurance from other people like it


---------16:05----------
doesn't matter how i get it i can go the


---------16:07----------
arrogant route


---------16:08----------
or i can go the pathetic route they're


---------16:10----------
both still the same thing


---------16:11----------
right so i spend a lot of time thinking


---------16:13----------
about how other people perceive me


---------16:16----------
and so what what ends up happening is if


---------16:18----------
you look at this person why am i using


---------16:19----------
the term narcissism it's because


---------16:21----------
everything revolves around them still


---------16:23----------
right even though you feel really


---------16:24----------
terrible


---------16:25----------
it's like if someone doesn't have the


---------16:28----------
time to talk to you today


---------16:29----------
it's like oh my god like i am that i'm


---------16:32----------
not worth


---------16:32----------
anything like they're they i'm not


---------16:36----------
worth it enough for them to spend time


---------16:38----------
with me like i'm not good enough whereas


---------16:39----------
it's like no it has nothing to do with


---------16:41----------
you it's because like


---------16:42----------
this person is moving today like it has


---------16:45----------
nothing to do with you


---------16:47----------
and so in both of these cases this mind


---------16:50----------
that they have


---------16:51----------
thinks that everything is kind of


---------16:52----------
revolving around them right if someone


---------16:53----------
doesn't have time for you


---------16:55----------
that's a personal insult or is justified


---------16:59----------
based on how little you're worth but at


---------17:02----------
the end of the day like you're not


---------17:03----------
considering them


---------17:05----------
you're just thinking about how they


---------17:07----------
think about you


---------17:09----------
and so that's kind of we caught why we


---------17:11----------
call it sort of traditional and like


---------17:12----------
non-traditional narcissism


---------17:14----------
okay and so it has these other features


---------17:16----------
like being covert being


---------17:18----------
thin skin being hyper vigilant


---------17:20----------
idealizing people instead of


---------17:21----------
not idealizing people this is why i like


---------17:24----------
the sunscreen because if you


---------17:25----------
think about that kind of person it's


---------17:27----------
like is that person really narcissistic


---------17:28----------
not really


---------17:29----------
but they have features of an ahamkar or


---------17:32----------
an ego that is functioning in a


---------17:34----------
particular way


---------17:34----------
which is low self-worth on the inside


---------17:36----------
therefore i need self-worth from the


---------17:38----------
outside and i'm going to spend a lot of


---------17:39----------
time


---------17:40----------
figuring out how to get those emotional


---------17:43----------
needs met


---------17:44----------
no matter what strategy i use i'm gonna


---------17:48----------
get


---------17:48----------
other people to notice and appreciate


---------17:50----------
and tell me how great i am


---------17:52----------
i can do it by pretending to be pathetic


---------17:55----------
or i can do it by pretending to be


---------17:56----------
awesome


---------17:57----------
but it's still pretending and i still


---------17:59----------
need it from other people


---------18:00----------
you know a lot of people are going to be


---------18:01----------
asking what do we do about it


---------18:04----------
so once again i think the first thing is


---------18:06----------
to understand these patterns


---------18:08----------
right like notice what you're doing


---------18:11----------
notice like what you do with people


---------18:13----------
when you're feeling like emotionally


---------18:15----------
needy


---------18:16----------
how do you manipulate them into engaging


---------18:20----------
in a behavior with you


---------18:22----------
right so like like and notice that kind


---------18:24----------
of thing and the interesting thing is


---------18:25----------
instead of like giving into that


---------18:26----------
behavior


---------18:27----------
just notice the need and maybe be a


---------18:29----------
little bit transparent with them and be


---------18:31----------
be like hey i understand you're busy i'm


---------18:33----------
kind of feeling down today like do you


---------18:35----------
have some time to talk


---------18:36----------
and just be transparent that you have an


---------18:38----------
emotional need it can be


---------18:40----------
absolutely terrifying but


---------18:43----------
notice yourself first and then start to


---------18:45----------
like give people the benefit of the


---------18:47----------
doubt and let them participate


---------18:49----------
in the relationship in a healthy way


---------18:51----------
which can be challenging


---------18:52----------
so unfortunately there aren't like tips


---------18:54----------
i mean i can give you a tip but it's


---------18:55----------
like easier said than done


---------18:57----------
so this is the kind of thing where


---------18:58----------
there's like actually a lot more work


---------19:00----------
that has to go into it right so we can


---------19:03----------
diagnose someone with depression if


---------19:04----------
someone asks me what are tips for


---------19:05----------
depression well there's like treatment


---------19:06----------
for that right


---------19:07----------
so in the same way like you can you know


---------19:09----------
work with a therapist work with a coach


---------19:12----------
we have a section of dr k's guides on


---------19:14----------
the nature of self which is sort of


---------19:15----------
geared towards


---------19:16----------
narcissism and self-esteem and sort of


---------19:18----------
these ideas of like


---------19:19----------
what is the true self and what do you


---------19:21----------
think you are and what's the difference


---------19:22----------
there


---------19:23----------
um so we've got some of that kind of


---------19:25----------
stuff in there so hopefully that'll help


---------19:27----------
but i just wanted to kind of explain


---------19:28----------
that concept because i know it's kind of


---------19:30----------
weird that i called like


---------19:31----------
those kinds of people narcissists so i


---------19:33----------
wanted to clarify and also explain to


---------19:35----------
you that


---------19:35----------
you know there's there's actually this


---------19:37----------
like common route to narcissism which


---------19:39----------
can manifest in two separate ways


---------19:40----------
so the non-traditional narcissist is the


---------19:42----------
same as a needy person


---------19:44----------
potentially yes right so if we if we go


---------19:47----------
back to the core


---------19:48----------
of it an emotionally needy person


---------19:51----------
can sometimes have this kind of world


---------19:53----------
revolves around them


---------19:54----------
sort of perspective but i think that and


---------19:57----------
emotionally there are other reasons why


---------19:59----------
other people can be like emotionally


---------20:01----------
needy without that ahamkar kind of thing


---------20:03----------
so it's one of the things on the


---------20:05----------
differential diagnosis of an emotionally


---------20:07----------
needy person


---------20:08----------
are there other terms for the


---------20:09----------
non-traditional narcissist


---------20:11----------
i'm not sure i think that


---------20:14----------
sometimes people will uh call them like


---------20:17----------
covert narcissists as well like it


---------20:19----------
depends on


---------20:20----------
what the literature is that's why i like


---------20:22----------
to use the yogic terminology because


---------20:24----------
i think the yogic terminology still


---------20:26----------
explains it the best


---------20:27----------
which is it's like it's a humkar it's


---------20:29----------
like a sense of


---------20:30----------
ego and a low sense of self-worth and


---------20:33----------
when you


---------20:34----------
start with that low sense of self-worth


---------20:35----------
you can get those emotional needs met


---------20:37----------
through two different pathways


---------20:40----------
how to recover from being hurt by a


---------20:42----------
particularly manipulative narcissist


---------20:45----------
oh man this is tricky um it takes a lot


---------20:48----------
of work but i'd say one really powerful


---------20:50----------
thing that people


---------20:51----------
don't tend to under utilize is actually


---------20:54----------
forgiveness


---------20:55----------
so once you get really manipulated by an


---------20:58----------
emotional narcissist i'd say forgiveness


---------21:00----------
and boundary setting


---------21:01----------
are the two things that you need to do


---------21:03----------
to like fix it right so you sort of


---------21:05----------
understand and you accept that this


---------21:08----------
person


---------21:08----------
like doesn't have control over their


---------21:10----------
emotional needs so they engage in


---------21:12----------
manipulative behavior so like


---------21:14----------
you know that like it's nothing personal


---------21:16----------
it's not like they tried to screw me


---------21:18----------
over it's just


---------21:19----------
they're hungry or thirsty and they're


---------21:21----------
gonna get their food or drink however


---------21:23----------
they can


---------21:24----------
and at the same time while you can


---------21:26----------
forgive them for that and like let go of


---------21:28----------
that


---------21:29----------
anger and let go of that resentment


---------21:30----------
through forgiveness you also want to set


---------21:33----------
super firm boundaries because as long as


---------21:36----------
they are


---------21:37----------
like you're letting them back into your


---------21:39----------
life like it's gonna keep happening over


---------21:41----------
and over and over again


---------21:43----------
so this is also really confusing for


---------21:44----------
some people but you can forgive someone


---------21:47----------
and never talk to them again forgiveness


---------21:50----------
is about


---------21:51----------
letting go of your own resentment and


---------21:53----------
like not blaming them anymore


---------21:56----------
and at the same time like setting a


---------21:57----------
boundary like you can forgive someone


---------21:59----------
and also like move on so i'll give you


---------22:02----------
guys just another like simple


---------22:04----------
example to drive that home so like let's


---------22:06----------
say i'm in a romantic relationship and


---------22:08----------
my partner cheats on me


---------22:10----------
i can forgive him i can say like you


---------22:12----------
know i understand you made a mistake


---------22:14----------
like


---------22:14----------
i understand you didn't mean to and


---------22:17----------
you know you hurt me a lot but i can


---------22:19----------
forgive you for hurting me like i


---------22:20----------
forgive you


---------22:21----------
and also i'm never gonna date you again


---------22:25----------
this is where people get really confused


---------22:27----------
because they assume


---------22:28----------
that forgiveness means that we're wiping


---------22:31----------
the slate clean


---------22:32----------
and we're reversing time and we're back


---------22:34----------
to square one


---------22:35----------
right like but that's not necessarily


---------22:37----------
the case you can let go of that


---------22:39----------
resentment you can say like look


---------22:40----------
i'm not gonna like i'm gonna go on and


---------22:42----------
live my life


---------22:43----------
and i'm not gonna hold on to this anger


---------22:45----------
and like don't worry about it like you


---------22:47----------
made a mistake


---------22:47----------
i forgive you you go live your life i'm


---------22:49----------
gonna go live mine they're like wait but


---------22:51----------
i want to get back together you're like


---------22:52----------
yeah i


---------22:52----------
understand you want to get back together


---------22:54----------
but i can't trust you


---------22:55----------
i can forgive you but like i don't trust


---------22:57----------
you and i'm not interested in a


---------22:59----------
relationship with you


---------23:02----------
i don't hold it like you know i i i wish


---------23:04----------
you no


---------23:05----------
ill will or malice like i hope you go


---------23:07----------
and find a healthy relationship and i'm


---------23:09----------
going to go find a healthy relationship


---------23:11----------
too


---------23:12----------
it's just i don't think i want to do


---------23:14----------
that with you


---------23:15----------
so someone's asking what's so let's


---------23:17----------
let's understand a couple of things one


---------23:18----------
is


---------23:19----------
what's the point of forgiveness and


---------23:21----------
second is what's the point of telling


---------23:22----------
them that you forgive them


---------23:24----------
so the point of forgiveness i mean sure


---------23:26----------
you can sort of do it for them but like


---------23:28----------
i really think forgiveness is powerful


---------23:30----------
uh for your own benefit because if we


---------23:32----------
think about


---------23:33----------
until i forgive what am i holding on to


---------23:35----------
i'm holding on to anger i'm holding on


---------23:37----------
to resentment


---------23:38----------
you know and you're allowed to hold on


---------23:40----------
to that if you want to i'm not saying


---------23:41----------
necessarily that it's


---------23:42----------
bad to hold on to them but that's just


---------23:44----------
where you need to make a judgment call


---------23:46----------
is this resentment interfering in my


---------23:48----------
life yes or no


---------23:50----------
right and if the resentment is bothering


---------23:52----------
you then like it's it can be healthy to


---------23:53----------
forgive


---------23:56----------
and then what's the point in telling


---------23:57----------
them because they may be feeling guilty


---------23:59----------
and they may want your forgiveness they


---------24:01----------
may be asking your


---------24:02----------
for your forgiveness you're no one is


---------24:04----------
entitled to forgiveness by the way right


---------24:06----------
so


---------24:06----------
forgiveness is entirely the right of the


---------24:09----------
aggrieved party


---------24:10----------
like the person who committed the sin or


---------24:12----------
the crime


---------24:13----------
is not entitled to forgiveness of any


---------24:15----------
way shape or form


---------24:18----------
and so i i would say you can tell them


---------24:20----------
because you know that way they can move


---------24:22----------
on with their life it's good for them


---------24:24----------
and at the same time hold your boundary


---------24:25----------
right like fool me once shame on you and


---------24:28----------
i'm not going to give you the chance to


---------24:29----------
fool me again


---------24:31----------
can you move on without forgiving i


---------24:33----------
think so i know it sounds kind of weird


---------24:35----------
but i think you can move on without


---------24:36----------
forgiving right


---------24:37----------
you can say you're you can accept so you


---------24:39----------
have to accept that's the key thing


---------24:41----------
moving on is about acceptance


---------24:43----------
you can accept that this person hurt you


---------24:46----------
and that you've forgiven them and you


---------24:47----------
let them go no hard feelings let go of


---------24:49----------
the results


---------24:50----------
or you can accept you know what i'm


---------24:51----------
never gonna forgive this person


---------24:53----------
for the rest of my life i will detest


---------24:56----------
them and what they did


---------24:58----------
and that's just like i'ma hold that it's


---------25:00----------
gonna be part of me like it's cool like


---------25:02----------
i'm gonna go on and live my life


---------25:04----------
and i can still build a healthy life but


---------25:06----------
there is a corner of my heart


---------25:08----------
in which i will always loathe and detest


---------25:10----------
this person for what they did to me


---------25:12----------
and that's okay no problem and if people


---------25:16----------
are skeptical about that because we


---------25:17----------
don't hear that very much right


---------25:18----------
so i'm a psychiatrist who works with


---------25:20----------
trauma survivors


---------25:22----------
and one of the healthiest things that


---------25:23----------
i've ever realized in therapy because


---------25:25----------
you don't get taught this


---------25:27----------
it's like to tell a trauma server you


---------25:29----------
know what you want to hold on to your


---------25:30----------
[ __ ] hatred you do it


---------25:32----------
you do it go for it no big deal i will


---------25:35----------
support you


---------25:36----------
you detest this person and you never


---------25:38----------
forgive them and they


---------25:39----------
they ruined your life now i want to help


---------25:42----------
you build


---------25:42----------
rebuild another one so like let's work


---------25:45----------
on that right we don't want them


---------25:46----------
ruining our life to like ruin the rest


---------25:49----------
of your life


---------25:50----------
do they absolutely ruin things for the


---------25:52----------
first 28 years


---------25:54----------
yes but we're still going to rebuild but


---------25:57----------
you can absolutely detest that person


---------25:59----------
when they die if you want to go and you


---------26:01----------
know like don't go to the funeral and if


---------26:03----------
you want to you know


---------26:05----------
flip them go walk over to the grave and


---------26:07----------
and flip them the middle finger like


---------26:09----------
that's fine you can do that


---------26:12----------
you don't have to forgive him you can


---------26:13----------
hold on to that hatred


---------26:15----------
but we don't want their what they've


---------26:18----------
done to you in that hatred


---------26:20----------
to prevent you from like building a life


---------26:23----------
worth living right you're 28 years old


---------26:25----------
you've got 40 years left they screwed


---------26:28----------
you over for the first 28 but like let's


---------26:30----------
do something about the next 40.


---------26:32----------
and if you want to hate them for doing


---------26:33----------
that to you like i'm completely behind


---------26:35----------
you let's do it


---------26:36----------
let's talk about how awful they are


---------26:38----------
because they sure do sound awful


---------26:39----------
yeah so when someone says i want those


---------26:41----------
years back bro that's


---------26:43----------
that's where acceptance comes in because


---------26:44----------
you ain't never getting them back


---------26:47----------
right so you can be resentful over that


---------26:49----------
and you can get stuck


---------26:50----------
you can spend all of your time thinking


---------26:53----------
about the time that you've lost


---------26:56----------
and never looking forward and then your


---------26:58----------
entire life will be spent


---------27:01----------
in resentment or you can acknowledge


---------27:04----------
that time is over


---------27:06----------
and this is where i should be looking


---------27:08----------
and you can build something worth living


---------27:10----------
how would you handle a parent that's


---------27:11----------
toxic acceptance slash forgiveness


---------27:15----------
and boundaries folks


---------27:18----------
same answer all the time we'll teach you


---------27:20----------
a lot more about this so we're planning


---------27:23----------
like something a lot more in-depth about


---------27:25----------
how to set boundaries and things like


---------27:26----------
that but


---------27:27----------
the short answer is like you accept like


---------27:28----------
you know they're toxic and they're not


---------27:30----------
going to change


---------27:31----------
don't expect them to change you're just


---------27:34----------
gonna


---------27:35----------
you're setting yourself up for


---------27:36----------
disappointment and frustration


---------27:38----------
they ain't gonna change you treat them


---------27:40----------
like a force of nature


---------27:43----------
rain is gonna be wet it's just who they


---------27:45----------
are if you have a narcissistic parent


---------27:48----------
like that's not going to change like


---------27:50----------
maybe one day it'll change and then


---------27:52----------
lucky you it's like winning the lottery


---------27:54----------
my narcissistic parents is now capable


---------27:56----------
of being emotionally available


---------27:57----------
wow i never expected that


---------28:00----------
and at the same time like they're your


---------28:02----------
parent but they are the way they are so


---------28:04----------
like you know


---------28:05----------
you can get frustrated at the rain for


---------28:07----------
making you wet or you can


---------28:08----------
grab an umbrella and like


---------28:12----------
move to arizona where it never rains


---------28:15----------
so i encourage everyone who's got toxic


---------28:17----------
parents to like do your dharma


---------28:19----------
is their child right so whatever that


---------28:21----------
entails it can be very little or it can


---------28:23----------
be a lot


---------28:24----------
like i'd encourage you to like try to be


---------28:26----------
nice to them and try to help them if


---------28:28----------
they need help


---------28:29----------
and also like you know if it's like one


---------28:32----------
if you see them once a year because it's


---------28:34----------
christmas time because you're their kid


---------28:35----------
and you're like okay fine


---------28:37----------
i'm gonna i'm gonna have a crappy


---------28:38----------
christmas this year and i'm just gonna


---------28:40----------
see them once for one week and they ask


---------28:42----------
you i never see you this happens a lot


---------28:44----------
right because like


---------28:45----------
if you set limits with your parents any


---------28:47----------
time you show up


---------28:48----------
they're like oh my god i can't believe


---------28:50----------
you abandoned me like don't you love me


---------28:52----------
like


---------28:52----------
i only see you during christmas and then


---------28:54----------
you stop and you ask him


---------28:56----------
so like what's your understanding of why


---------28:59----------
i come here


---------29:00----------
once a year they're like because you


---------29:02----------
don't love me


---------29:03----------
you you don't like me this is so like


---------29:06----------
you're so mean you don't care about your


---------29:07----------
mom


---------29:09----------
and then and then you can kind of point


---------29:11----------
out to them that like everything you're


---------29:13----------
saying is about you


---------29:15----------
has it ever occurred to you that like i


---------29:17----------
am a human being in this relationship


---------29:20----------
what do you think my needs are that i


---------29:22----------
only see you once a week and then


---------29:23----------
they're gonna be super confused


---------29:25----------
they're like just tell me tell me what


---------29:27----------
to do i'll do anything


---------29:28----------
and that's when you say okay if you were


---------29:30----------
willing to do anything


---------29:32----------
i want you to think about what my needs


---------29:34----------
are in this relationship and tell me


---------29:36----------
what you think they are


---------29:37----------
no just tell me just tell me this is the


---------29:39----------
problem


---------29:40----------
you're you're not even spending the


---------29:42----------
energy to think about it


---------29:44----------
just think about it and tell me what you


---------29:46----------
think i need in this relationship


---------29:48----------
no you won't tell me like why are you


---------29:50----------
being so mean and you can say this is


---------29:51----------
exactly why i come once a year


---------29:53----------
because any time i have a conversation


---------29:55----------
with you it's always like woe is me


---------29:58----------
and i i literally am unable to have a


---------30:00----------
conversation with you


---------30:01----------
i'm asking you to think about my


---------30:03----------
perspective and i'm not seeing you being


---------30:05----------
able to actually do that which i don't


---------30:06----------
blame you for it's fine like you are who


---------30:08----------
you are


---------30:09----------
and your grandparents you know weren't


---------30:12----------
nice to you either so like no big deal


---------30:14----------
but if you want to understand why i come


---------30:16----------
once a year that's why i come once a


---------30:17----------
year because when i come here


---------30:18----------
i don't feel like i can have a


---------30:19----------
conversation with you like tell me how


---------30:22----------
to have a conversation i've asked you


---------30:23----------
what to do


---------30:24----------
what did you hear me say what did you


---------30:26----------
hear me ask


---------30:28----------
you want me to what again just tell me


---------30:31----------
i'll do anything


---------30:32----------
i want you to just think about what my


---------30:34----------
needs are in this relationship


---------30:37----------
they're like okay fine will you stay


---------30:40----------
longer


---------30:41----------
no i won't i'm willing to stay for four


---------30:45----------
days


---------30:46----------
i love you mom but i can't tolerate you


---------30:50----------
it's the most i can handle and until


---------30:52----------
you're able to understand my needs and


---------30:54----------
like


---------30:55----------
help support them in some way like i


---------30:56----------
can't be here for longer than four days


---------30:58----------
i'm sorry i wish i we i wish i had more


---------31:01----------
stamina


---------31:02----------
is it so painful to be with me yes


---------31:05----------
yes it is oh my god


---------31:09----------
you hate me i don't hate you i just find


---------31:11----------
you intolerable


---------31:13----------
right like i'm trying but like i need


---------31:17----------
you to do more than what you're doing


---------31:20----------
right and that's where like sometimes


---------31:21----------
you don't want to pull punches because


---------31:23----------
that's what the narcissists do right


---------31:24----------
you guys see that have the narcissistic


---------31:26----------
parent we just flipped to the vulnerable


---------31:28----------
side


---------31:28----------
oh my god do you hate me you're


---------31:32----------
you're because you're you're you know


---------31:34----------
you're


---------31:35----------
bludgeoning your parent with truth and


---------31:37----------
then they play that card


---------31:38----------
they're gonna find some way to


---------31:40----------
emotionally manipulate you


---------31:42----------
into like telling them that they're okay


---------31:45----------
they're looking for that one thing no


---------31:47----------
mom of course i don't hate you


---------31:48----------
oh my god mom i'm so sorry please stop


---------31:51----------
crying and then you pat mother


---------31:53----------
narcissism non-traditional narcissism


---------31:56----------
plus traditional heart system


---------31:58----------
they can flip back and forth with


---------32:00----------
whatever they need to get their [ __ ]


---------32:01----------
emotional needs met


---------32:02----------
that's how it works whatever they need


---------32:07----------
they'll find a way to get it so you


---------32:08----------
don't give it to them you lay your


---------32:10----------
boundaries you encourage them to


---------32:11----------
introspect


---------32:12----------
you can also say things like here's what


---------32:14----------
i think would be helpful you're like i


---------32:15----------
don't know what to


---------32:16----------
i don't know how to think about your


---------32:17----------
needs i don't know what you want you can


---------32:18----------
say okay so if you're having trouble


---------32:20----------
figuring out i totally understand


---------32:22----------
i recommend you see a therapist and talk


---------32:24----------
to them about it and see what they think


---------32:26----------
they're like okay so i made a


---------32:29----------
recommendation to you


---------32:31----------
i think that would be helpful you're


---------32:32----------
telling me you don't know what to do i


---------32:34----------
think this will be helpful


---------32:35----------
and you're choosing not to do it what is


---------32:37----------
the therapist going to tell me you just


---------32:39----------
tell me what is the therapist content


---------32:40----------
i'm not sure


---------32:41----------
it's my recommendation do you want to do


---------32:43----------
what i'm recommending yes or no you


---------32:44----------
don't have to


---------32:45----------
you just tell me i don't see how it's


---------32:47----------
gonna help why won't you just tell me


---------32:49----------
what did i do wrong


---------32:52----------
yeah so i've said what i'm gonna say i


---------32:55----------
don't think continuing this conversation


---------32:57----------
is useful at all


---------32:59----------
i'm happy to listen


---------33:03----------
okay so i've shared with you what i


---------33:06----------
think we need to move this relationship


---------33:08----------
forward you're welcome


---------33:10----------
to do it if you want to you're welcome


---------33:11----------
to not do it if you don't want to


---------33:13----------
i don't see the point tell me the point


---------33:14----------
you know like go to therapy and you'll


---------33:16----------
see


---------33:19----------
like no tell me like why should i do it


---------33:21----------
and they're just constantly trying to


---------33:22----------
engage with you


---------33:23----------
constantly trying to pull you in pull


---------33:25----------
you in pull you and pull you in


---------33:28----------
are you telling me i'm broken are you


---------33:29----------
telling me that i'm a bad parent are you


---------33:31----------
telling me that


---------33:31----------
i ruined your life there it is looking


---------33:34----------
for the reassurance


---------33:35----------
and you can say did you hear me say any


---------33:37----------
of those things


---------33:39----------
oh okay i'm gonna just step out i'm


---------33:41----------
literally gonna step out of the


---------33:42----------
conversation right now because


---------33:44----------
i see that you're talking but i don't i


---------33:46----------
think i've already made my point you


---------33:48----------
just keep talking


---------33:49----------
you seem to be like trying to corner me


---------33:50----------
with like asking me for particular stuff


---------33:53----------
so i'm literally going to walk away from


---------33:55----------
this conversation you turn around


---------33:56----------
you walk out because they will continue


---------33:58----------
asking you questions


---------34:00----------
they will continue talking to you until


---------34:02----------
they wear you down


---------34:03----------
you get become cognitively disinhibited


---------34:06----------
you can't control your emotions anymore


---------34:08----------
and then if you lash out at them they're


---------34:11----------
gonna feel vindicated


---------34:13----------
because they feel unloved they feel


---------34:15----------
hated and if you lash out at them


---------34:17----------
they're like oh see he hates me oh my


---------34:19----------
god i was right


---------34:20----------
all along and then the cycle reinforces


---------34:24----------
so literally extract yourself from the


---------34:26----------
conversation


---------34:27----------
only solution you can do


---------34:31----------
okay what if you do hate them you could


---------34:34----------
tell them


---------34:35----------
it may not help what i would say is that


---------34:38----------
there's a part of me that hates you


---------34:40----------
i'd leave some wiggle room in there


---------34:41----------
she's in my room though so


---------34:43----------
walk out of your room i can't give


---------34:46----------
advice though they'll be like you came


---------34:47----------
out of my


---------34:48----------
and now giving me advice no i'm not


---------34:49----------
giving you advice i'm letting you know


---------34:52----------
what i think what i need in this


---------34:54----------
relationship you can do it or not do it


---------34:56----------
and they're like screw you i ain't gonna


---------34:58----------
do it


---------34:58----------
you're like okay fine no big deal


---------35:02----------
i've asked you to do something you don't


---------35:03----------
have to do it right i came out of your


---------35:07----------
v five asterisks anyway yeah so for a


---------35:10----------
lot of people who are talking about like


---------35:11----------
i get slapped and stuff like yeah so


---------35:13----------
there's there's a whole like


---------35:14----------
this is why i like so i i'm kind of


---------35:16----------
going off script here this is why like


---------35:17----------
this is actually a whole


---------35:19----------
long thing which includes


---------35:23----------
power dynamics okay so that's the really


---------35:25----------
tricky thing here


---------35:26----------
is that if your parents if there's a


---------35:28----------
power dynamic between you and your


---------35:29----------
parents you have to respect that power


---------35:30----------
dynamic you can't get over it


---------35:32----------
yeah need skill 100 for this yes you


---------35:35----------
absolutely do so let me explain


---------35:36----------
something to y'all chat


---------35:38----------
if dr k is sitting here on stream and


---------35:40----------
telling you just do this


---------35:41----------
just say this man it's it's how it works


---------35:44----------
i want you all to understand


---------35:45----------
i have literally had like eight to ten


---------35:48----------
years


---------35:49----------
of training and experience like


---------35:52----------
residency is like 80 to 100 hours a week


---------35:55----------
for four years okay so what i am capable


---------35:59----------
of doing


---------36:00----------
is not because i'm amazing but also is


---------36:03----------
like requires a lot of like


---------36:05----------
experience right i am a professional i'm


---------36:08----------
a professional


---------36:09----------
talker and so you you all need to


---------36:13----------
cut yourself some slack give yourself


---------36:15----------
some patience


---------36:16----------
be patient with yourself and work on


---------36:19----------
these things like


---------36:20----------
a little bit at a time and i've seen


---------36:22----------
people get there it's going to take you


---------36:24----------
a year to not kidding


---------36:25----------
like don't expect everything to turn


---------36:27----------
around six months from now


---------36:29----------
setting limits with your parents is a


---------36:31----------
lifelong journey


---------36:33----------
okay it is exhausting


---------36:36----------
but you know you can do it it just takes


---------36:39----------
effort


---------36:40----------
energy awareness and patience like you


---------36:42----------
all will get there like i have faith in


---------36:43----------
you


---------36:44----------
like i don't think you have to become a


---------36:45----------
psychiatrist because we learn all kinds


---------36:46----------
of other crap


---------36:48----------
right it's not just setting uh


---------36:50----------
boundaries with


---------36:51----------
entitled parents or narcissistic parents


---------36:53----------
there's more there's things like ect and


---------36:55----------
tms and pharmacology there's a lot of


---------36:57----------
stuff packed in there but like it's


---------36:58----------
gonna take some time


---------36:59----------
why is life so exhausting because we


---------37:01----------
don't understand the rules and no one


---------37:03----------
teaches us


---------37:05----------
that is why life is exhausting
