---------00:10----------
ollie okay how can i help you today


---------00:12----------
ollie


---------00:14----------
uh i guess i had a question about


---------00:16----------
relationships


---------00:18----------
and mostly just about um a lot of times


---------00:21----------
like


---------00:22----------
i'm not happy in a lot of relationships


---------00:24----------
but i don't know


---------00:26----------
like how to leave or how to like


---------00:28----------
prioritize myself


---------00:30----------
more you know sure and


---------00:33----------
yeah i just don't know why i do that


---------00:35----------
like i know


---------00:36----------
like the steps to take like i'm like


---------00:38----------
okay i'll just tell them hey


---------00:41----------
i'm not really happy i should probably


---------00:43----------
focus on myself blah blah blah but i


---------00:45----------
just


---------00:46----------
can't do it okay or i use


---------00:49----------
like even when the relationship's like


---------00:50----------
coming to an end


---------00:52----------
i just like start panicking and i try to


---------00:56----------
like fix it


---------00:56----------
i'm like oh no let's try to work it out


---------00:59----------
even though i really don't


---------01:01----------
want to be in it and um yeah


---------01:05----------
okay can you help yeah so that's that's


---------01:07----------
uh i'm really glad you


---------01:09----------
um you know came in today and are


---------01:11----------
sharing this question


---------01:13----------
or concern because i think it's a really


---------01:14----------
important thing that a lot of people


---------01:16----------
struggle with


---------01:17----------
so i think the way to approach


---------01:20----------
situations like this like


---------01:21----------
is to first understand what is going on


---------01:25----------
inside you


---------01:26----------
so when a relationship comes is starting


---------01:28----------
to come to an


---------01:29----------
end let's actually start a little bit


---------01:33----------
before that so when you say you're


---------01:34----------
unhappy in a relationship


---------01:36----------
what does that mean um it's like


---------01:40----------
either i'm bored or i just don't really


---------01:43----------
like the person that i'm with is like


---------01:45----------
hurtful


---------01:46----------
in a certain way or like are doing


---------01:48----------
something that's just like upsetting me


---------01:50----------
or it's just um can you give me an


---------01:53----------
example of what's hurtful in a


---------01:55----------
relationship


---------01:57----------
um well i guess the like the last


---------02:00----------
person that i was with um i mean they


---------02:02----------
were nice


---------02:03----------
and all and like it was like an okay


---------02:05----------
relationship overall but um i think a


---------02:07----------
lot of times


---------02:08----------
she would make comments about me being


---------02:10----------
like awkward or like shy


---------02:12----------
and stuff and i it just


---------02:15----------
made me like feel worse about myself and


---------02:18----------
i never really like spoke up about it


---------02:20----------
like whenever she'd say


---------02:22----------
oh like you know i really don't like it


---------02:24----------
when you don't like try to talk to


---------02:26----------
people more


---------02:26----------
okay you walk really awkwardly and


---------02:30----------
i don't know like it kind of just like


---------02:31----------
it makes me act more awkward around her


---------02:34----------
and all that stuff sure and um


---------02:37----------
yeah i just you know like but like you


---------02:39----------
know at the time i was like oh yeah it's


---------02:41----------
it's my fault i'm the dumbass who's


---------02:43----------
awkward you know it's not


---------02:44----------
at all you yeah okay yeah


---------02:48----------
someone


---------02:52----------
i was just gonna say like whenever you


---------02:53----------
had like conversations about like


---------02:55----------
breaking things off it would


---------02:57----------
it would kind of just go into um like me


---------02:59----------
saying oh no


---------03:00----------
i'll try to work on myself you know


---------03:01----------
these are things they'll


---------03:03----------
fix eventually in the future blah blah


---------03:06----------
blah


---------03:07----------
and yeah so in those


---------03:11----------
okay so there are a couple of things


---------03:12----------
that we have to kind of like unpack here


---------03:14----------
okay ollie yeah so let's start with like


---------03:18----------
what's in your mind when you're in this


---------03:21----------
situation


---------03:22----------
so when the way you asked the question


---------03:26----------
you were like


---------03:27----------
when relationships are unhealthy for me


---------03:29----------
i don't


---------03:31----------
it was almost like you were saying i


---------03:32----------
don't have the courage


---------03:34----------
to break up with them does that make


---------03:36----------
sense


---------03:37----------
yeah that kind of makes sense yeah but i


---------03:39----------
i think that that's sort of uh that


---------03:41----------
could be a little bit misleading because


---------03:43----------
if in the moment you actually


---------03:46----------
believe what they say then it's not


---------03:49----------
about courage because


---------03:50----------
you actually genuinely think that you're


---------03:52----------
at fault


---------03:54----------
yeah right there are two issues here one


---------03:56----------
is that you may believe that you're at


---------03:58----------
fault


---------03:59----------
and so like if you're the problem like


---------04:02----------
how does breaking up


---------04:03----------
help anything you need to fix yourself


---------04:05----------
and then the relationship will be


---------04:07----------
healthy


---------04:08----------
does that make sense uh yeah it makes


---------04:11----------
sense


---------04:12----------
and then the other option is that you're


---------04:13----------
not at fault but you have


---------04:15----------
trouble like being confrontational


---------04:19----------
or stating your views for some


---------04:22----------
reason yeah so which


---------04:26----------
and it can be a blend of both but which


---------04:27----------
one are we talking about here


---------04:29----------
like which one you fall into i think


---------04:33----------
it's a mix of both i would say the


---------04:34----------
latter


---------04:35----------
is more like just not being able to like


---------04:37----------
confident be confrontational and stuff


---------04:39----------
okay so how would you how do you feel


---------04:42----------
like so it sounds like it at times when


---------04:45----------
she said


---------04:46----------
oh you know you're awkward or you walk


---------04:48----------
funny you are like yeah i'm the dumbass


---------04:50----------
that dot dot dot


---------04:52----------
but then when you do know that you kind


---------04:54----------
of want to break up with them


---------04:56----------
what gets in the way of you telling them


---------05:00----------
um i guess kind of just like like when i


---------05:03----------
think about it i'm just like oh well


---------05:04----------
like


---------05:06----------
you know if i go through with this it's


---------05:07----------
just


---------05:09----------
uh sorry i just need to like think about


---------05:12----------
this for a second um i think it's just


---------05:14----------
take a second to think about it


---------05:18----------
i mean it's like a mix of like emotions


---------05:21----------
it's not just like


---------05:22----------
oh like i don't like one's just


---------05:25----------
i don't i feel like me saying oh i just


---------05:29----------
don't want to like make this work


---------05:31----------
anymore sometimes feels like oh it's


---------05:32----------
just


---------05:33----------
me being like weak you know like


---------05:37----------
like with that person like the issue was


---------05:39----------
just like me being like a little


---------05:41----------
like anxious and stuff or just awkward


---------05:44----------
if you like me saying like oh


---------05:46----------
like i don't want to do this anymore i


---------05:48----------
felt like oh like


---------05:49----------
you know i have these problems and


---------05:51----------
they're never going to go away


---------05:53----------
so why would i try to like


---------05:56----------
fix them or something like that or just


---------05:59----------
like oh like


---------06:00----------
you know once i'm done like no one else


---------06:02----------
would like ever like want to be with me


---------06:03----------
blah blah blah


---------06:04----------
like something dramatic like that so


---------06:07----------
yeah so i i understood that last part i


---------06:10----------
was a little bit confused about


---------06:12----------
some you said something about this is


---------06:14----------
never going to get better


---------06:15----------
so what helped me understand that oh


---------06:18----------
it's just like you know like


---------06:19----------
you know like me like break like ending


---------06:22----------
the things


---------06:22----------
breaking up with them or whatever would


---------06:24----------
mean that like oh i couldn't fix my


---------06:26----------
problem


---------06:26----------
you know like i wasn't able to like find


---------06:28----------
my solutions i just gave up


---------06:30----------
yeah are you concerned about


---------06:33----------
how they would feel if you broke up with


---------06:36----------
them


---------06:38----------
yeah and how do you feel


---------06:42----------
what are your concerns about their


---------06:43----------
feelings i mean i just


---------06:46----------
don't want to like hurt your feelings or


---------06:48----------
just make them feel bad


---------06:49----------
you know do you feel responsible for


---------06:52----------
their feelings


---------06:53----------
uh a bit yeah like not like you know


---------06:56----------
like


---------06:57----------
well if i like do something that like


---------06:58----------
hurts them i like feel really bad


---------07:01----------
and i'm just like oh i sh why did i do


---------07:02----------
that you know


---------07:04----------
yeah so ali there's something really


---------07:06----------
really dangerous you're doing here


---------07:07----------
right so let me just kind of try to lay


---------07:10----------
this out


---------07:11----------
so one is there's a fatalistic view


---------07:13----------
about yourself


---------07:14----------
like if i break up with them i have to


---------07:17----------
fix this problem


---------07:19----------
i can't fix this problem now so i won't


---------07:21----------
be able to fix it later


---------07:22----------
i might as well stay in the relationship


---------07:24----------
and so in a weird way what you're doing


---------07:26----------
is you're sort of saying like i don't


---------07:27----------
have


---------07:28----------
the control or strength because you call


---------07:30----------
yourself weak


---------07:32----------
to fix myself and so so


---------07:35----------
there's it's kind of interesting because


---------07:36----------
it's sort of like you don't have the


---------07:38----------
power to control


---------07:39----------
your own life and then your mind does


---------07:42----------
something really really


---------07:43----------
dangerous which is a lethal combination


---------07:45----------
with that one it's like a combo


---------07:48----------
which is that you do have the power to


---------07:50----------
control their lives


---------07:51----------
because if you don't break up with them


---------07:53----------
at least they'll be happy


---------07:55----------
or if you do break up with them they'll


---------07:56----------
be sad and that's something you can fix


---------07:59----------
so i think the reason that you have


---------08:01----------
trouble in these sorts of situations is


---------08:02----------
because there's like a one-two punch of


---------08:04----------
i can't fix my i can't make myself happy


---------08:08----------
but i can make them happy and so if you


---------08:10----------
really think about it it's like a


---------08:12----------
logical no-brainer that like why would


---------08:14----------
you


---------08:14----------
because you're if you break up with them


---------08:16----------
it's not like you're going to be able to


---------08:16----------
fix the problem anyway


---------08:18----------
so why would you hurt them if you're


---------08:20----------
just going to be screwed on your own and


---------08:22----------
you're going to screw them over too


---------08:23----------
why not just stay in the relationship


---------08:25----------
and at least make them happy because


---------08:27----------
it's not like you're salvageable


---------08:30----------
does that resonate at all or not so much


---------08:32----------
um


---------08:33----------
yeah i mean that that's kind of on the


---------08:35----------
spot really you know


---------08:37----------
so so that's that's tricky right because


---------08:39----------
it's like


---------08:40----------
like this is where i want you to


---------08:41----------
understand ali you're not stupid and


---------08:42----------
you're not


---------08:43----------
weak you're actually like a caring


---------08:46----------
intelligent


---------08:47----------
person and you're just making that


---------08:49----------
judgment call


---------08:50----------
based on the data that you've got which


---------08:53----------
is like


---------08:54----------
i can make them happy and stay in the


---------08:55----------
relationship


---------08:57----------
and sacrifice my own happiness but even


---------08:59----------
if i break up with them it's not like


---------09:00----------
i'm gonna be happy anyway so there's


---------09:02----------
like it's like a no-brainer of a choice


---------09:03----------
does that make sense


---------09:05----------
yeah that makes sense like it's not i


---------09:07----------
don't know i'm kind of just like the way


---------09:09----------
i work it in my head


---------09:10----------
exactly it's the way you work it in your


---------09:12----------
head is like it's just a terrible idea


---------09:14----------
on all fronts to break up because


---------09:16----------
breaking up is gonna hurt them and it's


---------09:17----------
not gonna help you so why do it


---------09:20----------
you might as well work on yourself fix


---------09:22----------
yourself in the relationship


---------09:23----------
and then everything will change so if


---------09:26----------
you want to tackle that


---------09:28----------
that one-two punch of i can make their


---------09:30----------
life better and i can't make mine better


---------09:33----------
right so those that's the tricky thing


---------09:36----------
if you want to tackle that you have to


---------09:37----------
tackle those assumptions so


---------09:39----------
why do you believe that you can't


---------09:44----------
you know work on yourself more


---------09:47----------
why do you believe like where does the


---------09:49----------
belief that you're a weak person


---------09:50----------
come from um


---------09:54----------
i i guess like a mix of things um i


---------09:56----------
don't i mean i don't think i'm like


---------09:58----------
entirely a weak person but um


---------10:01----------
i i mean a lot of times when i try to


---------10:03----------
like work on myself


---------10:04----------
like i sell start building routines like


---------10:07----------
exercising


---------10:08----------
and all that stuff like things go well


---------10:10----------
for a while and then


---------10:11----------
like like the littlest thing happens and


---------10:14----------
it kind of just sets off like a


---------10:15----------
domino effect where everything just kind


---------10:17----------
of fumbles down so it's just


---------10:19----------
i just feel like oh like if i'm reacting


---------10:22----------
so negatively to like the smallest thing


---------10:26----------
yeah it must be weak


---------10:29----------
ali that's like when the power there's a


---------10:31----------
part when you start to put your life


---------10:32----------
together


---------10:34----------
you have a small setback and then


---------10:36----------
there's a part of your mind that says


---------10:37----------
i told you so i told you you couldn't do


---------10:40----------
it what were you


---------10:41----------
what were you thinking early that you


---------10:43----------
could put your life together


---------10:45----------
how stupid can you be i told you so you


---------10:48----------
better not try and so that's the thing


---------10:52----------
that you really really have to tackle


---------10:54----------
right so like where does


---------10:55----------
that voice come from because i don't


---------10:57----------
think you're a failure


---------10:58----------
at all it's just you have a some scar


---------11:01----------
which is


---------11:03----------
s-a-m-s-k-a-r-a you have this like


---------11:05----------
this programming in your mind that tells


---------11:08----------
you it's like the voice that was


---------11:10----------
implanted in your mind


---------11:12----------
that tells you that you're incapable of


---------11:13----------
change


---------11:16----------
and so like you know you really have to


---------11:18----------
dig into where


---------11:19----------
that voice comes from do you know


---------11:24----------
um i i think i do


---------11:27----------
kinda ish i mean i feel like there's a


---------11:30----------
lot of incidents


---------11:32----------
like that i've like because like i think


---------11:34----------
like i've never been like the um


---------11:36----------
smart kid ever you know in school at


---------11:39----------
least


---------11:40----------
and um i remember in middle school um i


---------11:42----------
took like it we


---------11:44----------
took like why i like well i grew up in


---------11:46----------
um iran


---------11:47----------
for like background and stuff and we had


---------11:49----------
like


---------11:50----------
standardized tests that would kind of


---------11:52----------
evaluate your like math and like


---------11:53----------
language scores and all that stuff


---------11:56----------
and it was like ranked and i actually


---------11:58----------
scored like


---------11:59----------
really high on that and um i felt


---------12:02----------
pretty good about myself that day


---------12:04----------
because i was like oh maybe i'm not


---------12:06----------
stupid you know and i felt like okay


---------12:09----------
maybe i can start


---------12:11----------
playing better in school i can start


---------12:12----------
focusing on myself and like


---------12:15----------
all that stuff and then the same day um


---------12:18----------
we had like you know like binders in our


---------12:21----------
locker rooms and stuff


---------12:22----------
and like the dean would just check them


---------12:25----------
on daily to make sure we're like


---------12:26----------
organized and stuff


---------12:27----------
and he checked mine i'm not a very


---------12:30----------
organized person


---------12:31----------
so i got very upset at that and he came


---------12:33----------
to class and he threw a binder at me


---------12:36----------
and started yelling at me saying i'm


---------12:37----------
like a failure or whatever


---------12:39----------
and i was like oh okay i guess i guess


---------12:42----------
he has a point


---------12:42----------
you know well so i think that's a that's


---------12:45----------
a very


---------12:46----------
insightful story to share ali because


---------12:49----------
that's it right


---------12:50----------
it's not just that he threw the binder


---------12:52----------
at you it's that he threw the binder on


---------12:54----------
at you on the same day that you did well


---------12:58----------
in the class in the standardized test so


---------13:01----------
it's like when you succeed


---------13:04----------
you know like elise when you're about to


---------13:06----------
succeed


---------13:07----------
ali steps in and snatches defeat from


---------13:11----------
the jaws of victory


---------13:12----------
like you're about to win and then like


---------13:15----------
something shows up and then like teaches


---------13:17----------
you


---------13:17----------
puts you in your place how dare you


---------13:20----------
think you're smart ali


---------13:21----------
yeah and and so just notice that pattern


---------13:24----------
because like it's really challenging


---------13:26----------
because as long as that pattern is there


---------13:28----------
you know it's it's going to be really


---------13:30----------
hard because any time you try to take a


---------13:31----------
step forward


---------13:32----------
the pattern is triggered by your actual


---------13:36----------
success


---------13:39----------
like does that make sense no that makes


---------13:42----------
perfect sense you don't say i told you


---------13:43----------
so


---------13:44----------
until you start succeeding and that's


---------13:46----------
what's like it's like


---------13:48----------
this is op it's like it's completely


---------13:50----------
broken and needs to be patched


---------13:52----------
because any step forward you take it


---------13:54----------
triggers the pattern so that it's almost


---------13:57----------
like


---------13:57----------
i know this is going to sound kind of


---------13:59----------
weird but when i think about patterns


---------14:00----------
like this i actually think


---------14:02----------
about hiv and the problem with hiv


---------14:05----------
is that it attacks the very part of your


---------14:08----------
immune system that fights viruses and so


---------14:11----------
in that way like you have this pattern


---------14:13----------
in your mind


---------14:14----------
that attacks the part of your mind that


---------14:16----------
helps you


---------14:17----------
get out of like negative emotional and


---------14:19----------
mental spaces


---------14:23----------
yeah and so this is a sort of situation


---------14:26----------
where i think it's really important to


---------14:27----------
recognize that


---------14:28----------
you're not actually failing it's just


---------14:31----------
any time something anytime you start to


---------14:33----------
succeed and you're


---------14:34----------
actually succeeding this pattern is


---------14:36----------
going to wake up and


---------14:37----------
tell you that you're failing


---------14:40----------
and be aware of that and recognize that


---------14:43----------
like the stronger that pattern is


---------14:45----------
oddly enough the better you're doing


---------14:49----------
because it doesn't turn on unless you're


---------14:51----------
doing well


---------14:56----------
what do you think about that um


---------14:59----------
yeah i mean that makes sense like it's


---------15:00----------
kind of i mean it's also like


---------15:03----------
um i don't know if this is like related


---------15:04----------
or not but it's also when i


---------15:06----------
like when i do that right like i kind of


---------15:09----------
like it also like activates


---------15:10----------
like in a way where it's like oh you


---------15:12----------
know you're hey you know you're just


---------15:14----------
falling behind again like what's the


---------15:15----------
point of trying


---------15:16----------
because like you know you're already so


---------15:18----------
behind and it's stupid


---------15:20----------
but you know it's so no it no so so it's


---------15:22----------
not stupid


---------15:23----------
that's the thing that you've got to


---------15:24----------
understand is you have to understand


---------15:25----------
that these these thoughts in your mind


---------15:28----------
are coming from experience and and so as


---------15:31----------
long as you treat them as stupid


---------15:33----------
you're not going to be able to overcome


---------15:35----------
them and so


---------15:36----------
actually what you want to do is like


---------15:38----------
recognize that


---------15:39----------
in some weird way your mind is twisting


---------15:43----------
to make that not stupid


---------15:46----------
and then you have to learn how to


---------15:47----------
untwist which is sort of like


---------15:49----------
there's sort of this i told you so


---------15:51----------
you're not worth a whole lot kind of


---------15:53----------
like like attitude and i think as long


---------15:56----------
as that attitude is there you're going


---------15:58----------
to continue getting into these


---------15:59----------
situations in your relationships


---------16:01----------
and to really unpack that attitude


---------16:03----------
you've got two or three options one is


---------16:05----------
to recognize the attitude as it arises


---------16:08----------
and try to be really objective in those


---------16:10----------
moments about okay


---------16:11----------
my mind is telling me i told you so


---------16:15----------
yeah my mind is telling me that i'm not


---------16:17----------
gonna do anything


---------16:19----------
but if i really stop and think about it


---------16:20----------
i've been exercising for a week


---------16:22----------
and like this is one day that i've


---------16:24----------
messed up so recognize it


---------16:27----------
and sort of just see you don't have to


---------16:28----------
tell it it's stupid you just have to


---------16:30----------
like


---------16:30----------
try to see the other side of the coin


---------16:32----------
the second thing that you could really


---------16:34----------
do i mean this this sounds like prime


---------16:35----------
for


---------16:36----------
you know depending on what you've been


---------16:38----------
through i would strongly get


---------16:40----------
you know considered getting evaluated by


---------16:42----------
a mental health professional


---------16:45----------
um because because maybe there could be


---------16:46----------
elements of like trauma or depression or


---------16:49----------
or things like that that that may be


---------16:51----------
like clinical in nature that you could


---------16:52----------
benefit from


---------16:54----------
and if you want to work on the some scar


---------16:56----------
itself you don't have to see a therapist


---------16:58----------
for that if you don't have a clinical


---------16:59----------
sort of issue and then like coaching is


---------17:01----------
sort of designed to help people work


---------17:03----------
through


---------17:04----------
those kinds of issues and help you


---------17:06----------
understand your patterns


---------17:08----------
that's really what coaching is about um


---------17:11----------
but i definitely think that this is not


---------17:12----------
a journey that


---------17:13----------
um you need to walk alone although i


---------17:17----------
think if you


---------17:17----------
work at it like i think you'll you can


---------17:20----------
figure it out on your own through


---------17:22----------
meditation through reflection things


---------17:24----------
like that because you sound to me to be


---------17:26----------
actually a pretty capable guy and very


---------17:27----------
insightful


---------17:28----------
which i think is really what you need


---------17:33----------
um yeah i mean that sounds right i mean


---------17:34----------
i've been trying therapy for a while


---------17:36----------
it's just um


---------17:37----------
i don't have i've yet to like meet


---------17:39----------
someone that's like


---------17:40----------
able i'm able to like talk to in like a


---------17:43----------
way where like


---------17:44----------
i feel like if there's an understanding


---------17:46----------
or whatever


---------17:47----------
yep but yeah yeah and if there isn't an


---------17:50----------
understanding whose fault is that


---------17:53----------
it's their fault good


---------17:57----------
okay so so i i'm gonna toss one last


---------18:00----------
thing to you okay


---------18:01----------
yeah it's their fault but it's also your


---------18:04----------
responsibility


---------18:06----------
yeah that makes sense okay


---------18:09----------
yeah all right man thanks for calling in


---------18:11----------
hopefully that was helpful


---------18:13----------
no that was really helpful yeah thank


---------18:15----------

---------18:16----------
kind words and stuff thank you for


---------18:19----------
calling in i i really


---------18:20----------

---------18:22----------

---------18:23----------
relate to
