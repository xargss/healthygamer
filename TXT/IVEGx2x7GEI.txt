---------00:00----------
hey guys dr k here today's video is an


---------00:02----------
awesome exploration of finding the


---------00:05----------
origin of your psychological scars


---------00:07----------
or what your trigger points are


---------00:09----------
oftentimes people will have you know one


---------00:12----------
day and then the next day and on some


---------00:13----------
days your mental is completely busted on


---------00:15----------
other days


---------00:16----------
things don't seem to bother you as much


---------00:18----------
how does that work


---------00:19----------
today's video is an exploration of sort


---------00:21----------
of figuring out what are the trigger


---------00:23----------
points


---------00:24----------
that cause you to have a good day or a


---------00:25----------
bad day and the challenge here is that


---------00:28----------
this exploration usually isn't linear


---------00:30----------
so you all are going to see in the first


---------00:31----------
half of the video it feels like we're


---------00:33----------
kind of meandering and not really


---------00:34----------
getting anywhere


---------00:36----------
but that crystallizing moment comes from


---------00:39----------
mapping out all that territory and then


---------00:41----------
really putting the the puzzle together


---------00:43----------
in the second half so i hope you guys


---------00:45----------
enjoy the video and i hope it's helpful


---------00:52----------
okay you hear me yep i hear you great


---------00:54----------

---------00:55----------

---------01:18----------

---------01:20----------

---------01:21----------

---------01:23----------

---------01:31----------

---------01:33----------
um so tell me to start off with what


---------01:35----------
would you


---------01:36----------
like me to call you today uh you could


---------01:39----------
just call me lois


---------01:42----------
down here yeah okay and lois can you


---------01:44----------
tell me um


---------01:45----------
a little bit about you know is there


---------01:47----------
anything that we you wanted to talk


---------01:48----------
about or focus on or maybe learn a


---------01:50----------
little bit more about


---------01:51----------
today explore together


---------01:58----------
yeah i mean so


---------02:01----------
i i i you guys reached out after like i


---------02:03----------
had like i tweeted uh


---------02:05----------
oh back to depression okay um


---------02:08----------
and i just want to put it out there that


---------02:10----------
like to anyone in the chat who


---------02:11----------
who you know has like diagnosed


---------02:15----------
depression or anything like i'm not


---------02:16----------
diagnosed i was just really like upset


---------02:19----------
that day you know what i mean


---------02:21----------
um so i just want to say like i don't


---------02:23----------
joke about that


---------02:25----------
um but i just was really feeling down


---------02:27----------
and


---------02:28----------
uh i think i guess what i want to talk


---------02:32----------
with you about was like


---------02:35----------
um why


---------02:38----------
so why can sometimes


---------02:42----------
comments and like the way people are


---------02:45----------
affect me and then sometimes literally


---------02:48----------
anyone can say whatever they want it


---------02:49----------
doesn't affect me at all


---------02:51----------
like that's like the thing that's like i


---------02:53----------
have i'm always like


---------02:55----------
trying to figure out um in my own head


---------02:58----------
so


---------02:59----------
you know maybe we could start with their


---------03:01----------
start there


---------03:02----------
lois dude that is such a brilliant


---------03:04----------
question man


---------03:06----------
really yeah man like it like think about


---------03:08----------
it right because it's like


---------03:09----------
it's so confusing because we think that


---------03:11----------
the world operates based on certain laws


---------03:14----------
like gravity always makes things fall


---------03:16----------
down right


---------03:18----------
and yeah and so what i'm hearing from


---------03:19----------
you is there are some days of the week


---------03:21----------
or some


---------03:22----------
states of mind that maybe you're in


---------03:24----------
where people's words like really


---------03:26----------
sweep past your armor and like hit


---------03:29----------
and then there are other times where


---------03:31----------
like you're able to kind of like shrug


---------03:33----------
things off


---------03:35----------
yeah like that's the perfect way to


---------03:36----------
describe it um


---------03:38----------
and then the other day when i did tweet


---------03:39----------
that that was one of the days where it


---------03:40----------
was just like


---------03:42----------
anything people were saying was just


---------03:43----------
completely disaffecting me um


---------03:46----------
and so it makes me think like is that


---------03:49----------
even what's affecting me


---------03:51----------
because if those words if things people


---------03:54----------
say don't affect me other days


---------03:57----------
you know what i mean so that's that's my


---------03:58----------
like question pretty much


---------04:00----------
yeah dude i'm serious i i it's it's one


---------04:03----------
of the most


---------04:04----------
important questions to ask because i


---------04:06----------
think the first thing to kind of


---------04:08----------
understand


---------04:09----------
is that it's not what they say


---------04:14----------
right there's there's like there's a


---------04:17----------
signal that gets broadcast


---------04:18----------
and then there's a receiver and what i'm


---------04:21----------
hearing from you is that the signal can


---------04:23----------
be the same


---------04:23----------
every single day but something changes


---------04:26----------
on the receiver


---------04:27----------
that allows that signal to come in and


---------04:30----------
that


---------04:31----------
receiver is you and so this is like the


---------04:33----------
reason i think that's such an important


---------04:35----------
question is because i


---------04:36----------
i want like people to understand that if


---------04:38----------
we really think about this


---------04:39----------
loss what we what we can discover is if


---------04:41----------
we can figure that out


---------04:43----------
if we can figure out how the receiver


---------04:44----------
works what we could also do is make


---------04:46----------
ourselves impervious to criticism


---------04:49----------
okay right okay yeah


---------04:52----------
if we can figure out the difference


---------04:54----------
between a day where their words


---------04:56----------
hurt and a day where you can shrug them


---------04:58----------
off


---------04:59----------
and we can figure out how that formula


---------05:01----------
works we can have


---------05:02----------
every day where you're immune to


---------05:04----------
criticism


---------05:07----------
i i would love that i'm sorry


---------05:10----------
something yeah i mean like that's why i


---------05:13----------
think the question is like really really


---------05:14----------
well formulated right because it's like


---------05:16----------
it's a very good


---------05:18----------
um i would love that i would love that


---------05:21----------
so let's start with this so let's


---------05:22----------
explore that i think it's great


---------05:24----------
um i'm just going to make a list of kind


---------05:27----------
of talk


---------05:27----------
talking points that we may have to


---------05:28----------
circle back to but


---------05:31----------
um so can you give me an example of of


---------05:34----------
you know like can you just tell us a


---------05:35----------
little bit about what kind of day you


---------05:36----------
were having or maybe


---------05:38----------
like you know let's get gather some data


---------05:40----------
about an example of each of those days


---------05:43----------
okay so um


---------05:48----------
i think the day that i was having that


---------05:50----------
day


---------05:52----------
was there was a lot of frustration


---------05:55----------
about things that had nothing to do with


---------05:58----------
any comments or anything


---------06:00----------
like that it was just one thing after


---------06:03----------
another after another


---------06:04----------
and then when i do finally like after


---------06:07----------
this stuff's already happening i go on


---------06:08----------
twitter


---------06:09----------
and um somebody


---------06:13----------
somebody had do you watch basketball or


---------06:16----------
do you watch star wars


---------06:17----------
yeah i mean i don't watch basketball


---------06:22----------
okay you know lebron yeah so i've been a


---------06:24----------
huge lebron fan since um


---------06:27----------
man since i was a little probably like


---------06:31----------
i'm 26 now so maybe


---------06:36----------
maybe i was like 13 years old or


---------06:38----------
something 13 years i don't know


---------06:39----------
but i've been a big fan for a while and


---------06:42----------
so


---------06:43----------
but what people love to do is you know a


---------06:46----------
part of trolling me


---------06:48----------
is whatever i enjoy or ever


---------06:51----------
whatever i show interest in whatever i


---------06:54----------
like hype up or anything


---------06:55----------
they try to just shoot it down you know


---------06:57----------
what i mean


---------06:58----------
and uh it's it's yeah i know it's it's


---------07:01----------
i've been getting trolled like this for


---------07:03----------
a while


---------07:04----------
um so you know lebron has a bad game or


---------07:08----------
something or


---------07:08----------
the the lakers lose or something i my


---------07:11----------
twitter mentions are all just like oh


---------07:14----------
uh like lebron's ass and you know you


---------07:17----------
know basically just talking [ __ ] and


---------07:19----------
just


---------07:19----------
and then so i kind of like responded to


---------07:22----------
one guy and i was like


---------07:24----------
you know i basically just disagreed with


---------07:27----------
him


---------07:28----------
and then i just got hit with like 300


---------07:30----------
replies of just


---------07:32----------
ever just like saying the craziest stuff


---------07:34----------
to me


---------07:35----------
um and it it it just


---------07:39----------
it became like it wasn't even saying


---------07:41----------
things about lebron it was just


---------07:43----------
just saying stuff to just get to me and


---------07:46----------
on other days where


---------07:48----------
would you say what were they saying oh


---------07:51----------
my god


---------07:52----------
i i mean can i say anything i don't want


---------07:54----------
to say you know


---------07:55----------
is sh can i curse on here uh yeah i


---------07:58----------
think so


---------07:59----------
just nothing against tos i mean okay


---------08:01----------
yeah we'll go to


---------08:02----------
okay well basically no it was just a lot


---------08:03----------
of just you know


---------08:05----------
insulting me insulting my intelligence


---------08:07----------
uh


---------08:08----------
insulting just me as a person uh


---------08:12----------
insulting lebron whatever


---------08:13----------
and like i said other days people


---------08:17----------
people uh talk [ __ ] about lebron all the


---------08:19----------
time like that doesn't


---------08:21----------
affect me like i see it all the time but


---------08:22----------
it would like i said it was just one of


---------08:24----------
those days where


---------08:25----------
um this was just like another


---------08:28----------
thing added on to it um and it was like


---------08:33----------
yeah i was basically going back and


---------08:34----------
forth with people and


---------08:36----------
i just felt like more people were


---------08:38----------
supporting like the dudes coming at me


---------08:40----------
than like me


---------08:42----------
so that just that just made me just more


---------08:45----------
mad


---------08:45----------
um but look in retrospect


---------08:50----------
on a different day where i'm in a really


---------08:52----------
good mood


---------08:54----------
i just i look at it like okay it's


---------08:56----------
twitter trolls just


---------08:57----------
you know yeah messing with me so that's


---------09:01----------
that's the the difference yeah so i


---------09:03----------
here's


---------09:04----------
here's i'm gonna tunnel down okay a


---------09:07----------
little bit so one is


---------09:08----------
you said you felt like there were more


---------09:11----------
people


---------09:12----------
you know attacking you than defending


---------09:15----------
you


---------09:16----------
yeah yeah right yeah so so the first


---------09:18----------
thing that i i think you used a really


---------09:20----------
good word there which is


---------09:21----------
felt so we'll we'll dig into like what


---------09:24----------
is that feeling


---------09:25----------
the second thing that that i want to


---------09:27----------
highlight is that


---------09:28----------
you know we're kind of focusing on a lot


---------09:30----------
of the details of this twitter stuff


---------09:32----------
but you actually started off this this


---------09:35----------
story with sort of saying there were


---------09:37----------
several things that were unrelated i was


---------09:38----------
frustrated about


---------09:40----------
you want me to tell you like the main


---------09:42----------
one or something


---------09:43----------
sure well i mean i think like let's


---------09:45----------
acknowledge that like when you enter the


---------09:47----------
twitter arena


---------09:49----------
your inventory was already full like


---------09:51----------
you're very close to being encumbered


---------09:53----------
yeah yeah yeah right so so i think


---------09:56----------
that's going to be a big part of it so


---------09:57----------
can can you tell and and by the way i


---------09:59----------
know sometimes we have like a call ahead


---------10:01----------
of time about like


---------10:02----------
boundary setting and stuff so if there's


---------10:03----------
anything that i ask you that you feel is


---------10:05----------
like not appropriate or out of line or


---------10:07----------
you don't want to share


---------10:08----------
you just let me know okay you can ask me


---------10:10----------
anything i um


---------10:11----------
okay i'm an open book um i


---------10:15----------
what's happened is um this happened a


---------10:19----------
few weeks ago and this is when i started


---------10:21----------
getting like upset


---------10:22----------
more and more um someone had


---------10:26----------
botted my twitch account like with a


---------10:27----------
bunch of followers like they bought it


---------10:29----------
at like 2 million followers or something


---------10:31----------
um and since then


---------10:34----------
there's been this weird thing happening


---------10:36----------
with with twitch with um


---------10:39----------
sending out like notifications people


---------10:41----------
not even getting notifications for my


---------10:42----------
stream anymore


---------10:43----------
and so you know it was just happening


---------10:47----------
every single day


---------10:48----------
and it would be like you know like i


---------10:51----------
follow your stream you went live i got a


---------10:52----------
notification


---------10:53----------
i was going live people wouldn't know


---------10:55----------
about it for like 15 minutes


---------10:57----------
and then other people would join really


---------10:58----------
late and be like oh i didn't even know


---------10:59----------
you were alive what's going on


---------11:02----------
so it was just it's like a thing where


---------11:04----------
it's like i feel like i have no control


---------11:05----------
over it


---------11:06----------
it was just really frustrating um and


---------11:09----------
then


---------11:10----------
yeah it was just making everything else


---------11:11----------
bad yeah sure


---------11:13----------
i it sounds like it sucks man like yeah


---------11:16----------
so let's just be a little bit clear


---------11:18----------
what was it that you had no control over


---------11:22----------
i mean like the technology of twitch


---------11:26----------
i don't know sure sure so that that in a


---------11:29----------
practical sense


---------11:30----------
uh obviously you have no control over


---------11:32----------
you know twitter and the guy who decided


---------11:34----------
to


---------11:35----------
bought me what was the random guy you


---------11:37----------
know i


---------11:38----------
let me think about how to ask this loss


---------11:40----------
and this is this is going to be like a


---------11:41----------
crappy


---------11:42----------
question so i you know apologize if it


---------11:44----------
doesn't make sense but


---------11:46----------
when we think about those things


---------11:48----------
obviously you don't have control over


---------11:49----------
those


---------11:50----------
but in those moments what i'm


---------11:53----------
envisioning


---------11:53----------
is those two events took something away


---------11:57----------
from you


---------11:59----------
yeah yeah what did they take away from


---------12:02----------
you


---------12:03----------
well it just felt like man i've been


---------12:05----------
streaming for almost six years on this


---------12:07----------
platform


---------12:09----------
and um you know we're trying to handle


---------12:11----------
it now i've been talking to some people


---------12:13----------
at twitch but


---------12:14----------
um yeah it just felt like damn like i


---------12:17----------
worked all all these years like hard


---------12:19----------
work


---------12:19----------
to just wow it could be like taken away


---------12:22----------
in some way not fully but like yeah in


---------12:25----------
some capacity


---------12:27----------
um you know and it just made me start to


---------12:29----------
think like


---------12:30----------
wow what if i got banned or something or


---------12:32----------
what if you know


---------12:34----------
everyone lost their notifications but


---------12:35----------
like it just i don't know it just gives


---------12:37----------
you bad thoughts


---------12:38----------
you know because i really care about you


---------12:40----------
a lot


---------12:41----------
so that's that's why i was making me


---------12:44----------
feel like that


---------12:45----------
what do you what do you care about a lot


---------12:49----------
um i care about my stream and


---------12:52----------
my you know community and and uh


---------12:56----------
you know growing and you know


---------12:59----------
in general you know yeah so tell what do


---------13:01----------
you what do you like about your stream


---------13:03----------
why do you care about your stream uh


---------13:06----------
they're they you know they they uh


---------13:10----------
it's kind of they like they have my back


---------13:13----------
even though i just said that whole story


---------13:14----------
about them not my back but that was like


---------13:15----------
twitter trolls about


---------13:16----------
basketball um in them for the most part


---------13:19----------
no they just they they have my back and


---------13:20----------
they they


---------13:21----------
show so much you know love and support


---------13:24----------
so


---------13:25----------
just the idea of like potentially losing


---------13:28----------
even like one percent of that just


---------13:30----------
really upset me


---------13:32----------
sure yeah


---------13:36----------
can i think for a second lois yeah go go


---------13:39----------
ahead


---------13:39----------
[Music]


---------13:46----------
who were you six years ago


---------13:51----------
uh i don't know how to let me let me let


---------13:53----------
me think um


---------13:55----------
oh no six years ago


---------13:59----------
six years ago i didn't really use the


---------14:01----------
internet like that i would watch like


---------14:03----------
occasional youtube


---------14:04----------
prank prank videos or something like i


---------14:06----------
didn't really use the internet


---------14:08----------
um people weren't really streaming i was


---------14:11----------
going to school


---------14:12----------
and i was working at a hospital um


---------14:16----------
and then yeah i just i i i found twitch


---------14:19----------
one day


---------14:20----------
and uh you know i've loved it ever since


---------14:23----------
you know what


---------14:24----------
what do you love about twitch i just


---------14:27----------
love the


---------14:27----------
the the


---------14:31----------
i have a lot of like youtube friends and


---------14:33----------
i compared to like


---------14:36----------
youtube is cool but like the the thing


---------14:38----------
with streaming is like the instant


---------14:39----------
reaction and instant like


---------14:42----------
you know feedback from people um


---------14:45----------
it's just it feels more like together so


---------14:48----------
um yeah i i like i like the


---------14:51----------
the live aspect of streaming


---------14:55----------
sure and what kind of stuff do you


---------14:57----------
stream lois


---------14:59----------
um i stream all kinds of stuff i've done


---------15:01----------
a bunch of stuff over the years like i


---------15:03----------
do a lot of just chatting now


---------15:05----------
um i do different games


---------15:10----------
i'm pretty much all over the place i


---------15:11----------
don't have like a set thing it's more


---------15:12----------
variety


---------15:13----------
sure yeah um


---------15:19----------
yeah so let me just and when you said


---------15:22----------
like you were kind of feeling like back


---------15:24----------
to the depression again i


---------15:26----------
i recognize and appreciate kind of your


---------15:29----------
um desire to be sort of compassionate


---------15:32----------
and and sort of not claim that you have


---------15:34----------
kind of you know you go through maybe


---------15:36----------
the same struggles that other people


---------15:37----------
clinical depression go through


---------15:39----------
and at the same time i mean i i think


---------15:41----------
that um


---------15:43----------
you know you're allowed to be depressed


---------15:45----------
just because no one diagnosed you right


---------15:47----------
you're allowed to have a bad day and


---------15:49----------
feel down and in the dumps


---------15:51----------
yeah and i just wouldn't want to call me


---------15:54----------
having a bad day like


---------15:55----------
what people go through just on a daily


---------15:58----------
basis without even anything frustrating


---------16:00----------
though


---------16:01----------
um you know so that's why i wanted to


---------16:03----------
say that can you


---------16:05----------
can you help me understand when you said


---------16:06----------
back to the depression


---------16:08----------
what you what that felt like to you or


---------16:10----------
what you call


---------16:11----------
because you said back to the depression


---------16:14----------
so what i'm hearing there is that like


---------16:16----------
you know it's a place where you have


---------16:19----------
you've been before


---------16:20----------
it's a place it's a place i've gone


---------16:23----------
before


---------16:24----------
tell me about that place it's just not a


---------16:27----------
good place like it's just the worst


---------16:28----------
feelings you know i mean


---------16:30----------
um and it's it literally just


---------16:34----------
affects my mood it affects like how i


---------16:37----------
talk to people or like interact with


---------16:38----------
people or how so


---------16:40----------
i i get really like a short like


---------16:44----------
like um i get like a temper almost or


---------16:46----------
like a


---------16:48----------
like i lose patience easily um


---------16:52----------
so like someone could say the most


---------16:54----------
innocent question to me or


---------16:56----------
and i could like get offended by it or


---------16:59----------
so like you know what i mean so


---------17:00----------
it's just like an overall bad mood and


---------17:02----------
i'm just like not feeling good


---------17:04----------
and yeah and and what what is it like in


---------17:07----------
what is it that your mind tells you in


---------17:09----------
those moments where someone's like


---------17:11----------
behaving innocently towards you and


---------17:13----------
and your mind like turns it into


---------17:14----------
something else


---------17:16----------
i i think it's i'm i'm so annoyed


---------17:19----------
that like just anything even if it is


---------17:21----------
the most innocent thing


---------17:23----------
is just i can't handle any more in that


---------17:26----------
moment like i'm too too much stuff is


---------17:28----------
just going on in my head


---------17:30----------
where i'm like i can't even talk i can't


---------17:31----------
even talk to you i can't i can't


---------17:34----------
i'm with you so so you're encumbered


---------17:38----------
got too much in your inventory yeah i


---------17:41----------
don't know that word but yeah


---------17:42----------
okay yeah sorry it's it's like an rpg


---------17:44----------
gaming term where


---------17:45----------
um so like in you know an rpg is like


---------17:47----------
you've got your inventory


---------17:48----------
it's got like 30 slots and then what


---------17:50----------
happens is if you have like too much


---------17:52----------
weight in your inventory then you like


---------17:55----------
walk slow


---------17:57----------
you know so it's kind of like it means


---------17:58----------
that you're like you're carrying too


---------18:00----------
much


---------18:01----------
and you don't have space for anything


---------18:02----------
else that's really what i'm hearing from


---------18:04----------
you


---------18:05----------
yeah and they have no bad intention it's


---------18:08----------
just me


---------18:09----------
you know you just can't handle whatever


---------18:11----------
even if it's not


---------18:12----------
you know if my inventory is full even if


---------18:14----------
someone wants to give me like a piece of


---------18:16----------
pie like i can't hold anymore like i


---------18:18----------
don't have room for your pie


---------18:20----------
i understand you're trying to be nice


---------18:21----------
but i don't want your pie


---------18:23----------
you know it's perfect perfect analogy


---------18:27----------
and and so what is in your mind that you


---------18:30----------
don't have room for anything else do you


---------18:31----------
remember


---------18:35----------
well if i'm thinking on those moments it


---------18:37----------
is like a level of like


---------18:40----------
worry i think okay because like i said


---------18:44----------
you know the the it's just gonna go back


---------18:46----------
to normal like


---------18:47----------
the way my twitch is operated for five


---------18:50----------
plus years


---------18:51----------
just like the doubt and the just


---------18:53----------
worrying


---------18:55----------
and hope of that particular situation


---------18:59----------
yeah and and what what


---------19:02----------
where are you afraid of going to


---------19:06----------
like so when i'm here when i hear worry


---------19:07----------
you're like is it going to go back to


---------19:09----------
normal if it doesn't go back to normal


---------19:11----------
i imagine that your mind kind of like


---------19:13----------
projects something sort of nebulous or


---------19:16----------
maybe it's even a feeling


---------19:18----------
of where would you return to if things


---------19:20----------
did not go well


---------19:26----------
it might be like a and i and i


---------19:30----------
i think this is an irrational fear but


---------19:32----------
just like


---------19:33----------
oh i have to like restart or like all


---------19:36----------
these years i put into it like what if


---------19:38----------
that was for nothing


---------19:39----------
just that kind of that kind of feeling


---------19:43----------
um what makes you think that's


---------19:44----------
irrational


---------19:47----------
i think it's irrational because if i


---------19:49----------
take a step back and i think about it


---------19:50----------
like i have all these people who


---------19:52----------
who love and support me so like if


---------19:55----------
something


---------19:56----------
happened on my notification like that


---------19:57----------
wouldn't be the end of the of the world


---------20:00----------
sure um i just the fear was like


---------20:04----------
more casual people or people who maybe


---------20:07----------
they don't have twitters and they don't


---------20:08----------
know when i go live or you know what i


---------20:10----------
mean like


---------20:11----------
um just kind of the casual viewer


---------20:14----------
because i've i've been


---------20:16----------
personally i've been like subscribed to


---------20:17----------
a youtuber and then gotten like unsub


---------20:20----------
from them or i don't see their videos


---------20:21----------
anymore


---------20:22----------
and you kind of just like forget you


---------20:24----------
like forget almost you know


---------20:26----------
if you're not like a huge fan of them


---------20:28----------
and go seek them out


---------20:29----------
um so that was like that's like the fear


---------20:32----------
of like


---------20:32----------
you you oh wow no one's getting


---------20:34----------
notifications like what are people going


---------20:36----------
to just forget


---------20:37----------
like um so that was that's


---------20:40----------
yeah that was forgotten before


---------20:45----------
i'm sure i'm sure from some people i


---------20:48----------
mean


---------20:49----------
i can't really i don't know the answer


---------20:50----------
that um okay


---------20:52----------
i've never felt forgotten before during


---------20:55----------
doing this twitch


---------20:56----------
stuff what about before twitch


---------21:03----------
i don't know i don't know maybe some


---------21:05----------
friendships maybe


---------21:07----------
okay maybe that's that's the only thing


---------21:09----------
i could really think of


---------21:10----------
so los i'm gonna go ahead and just pause


---------21:13----------
for a second and kind of like


---------21:15----------
repeat back to you what i'm hearing and


---------21:18----------
how i'm thinking about this conversation


---------21:21----------
and then i'd love to hear from you


---------21:23----------
whether you think like we're kind of


---------21:25----------
whether it's accurate whether it feels


---------21:27----------
like it's moving in the right direction


---------21:29----------
okay so the first thing is that


---------21:32----------
um you know you were relatively new to


---------21:34----------
the internet


---------21:35----------
six years ago you discovered twitch


---------21:38----------
you'd been following youtubers and other


---------21:39----------
content creators it sounds like you


---------21:41----------
started streaming


---------21:43----------
you really really appreciate kind of


---------21:45----------
like the live interaction the kind of


---------21:47----------
feedback you know it's not like you're


---------21:48----------
just


---------21:49----------
watching this thing that like is sitting


---------21:50----------
on a shelf in the youtube


---------21:53----------
you know data center that will always


---------21:55----------
exist there until the end of time it's


---------21:57----------
like there's real people there


---------21:59----------
and what i'm hearing from you is that


---------22:00----------
like you've really come to appreciate


---------22:02----------
you're not like


---------22:03----------
really streaming for you what i'm really


---------22:05----------
feeling is that it's not really about


---------22:07----------
a particular game or a particular kind


---------22:09----------
of thing you know some streamers like


---------22:11----------
have their


---------22:12----------
thing like i have like a thing that i


---------22:14----------
stream for right


---------22:15----------
like i'm like a one-trick pony and and


---------22:18----------
what i hear from you is that for you


---------22:19----------
it's really about like the community and


---------22:21----------
that like you've built a group of people


---------22:23----------
that you really enjoy interacting with


---------22:25----------
i would imagine you support them quite a


---------22:27----------
bit it sounds like they certainly


---------22:29----------
support you quite a bit


---------22:31----------
yeah um and and then sometimes what


---------22:33----------
happens is like


---------22:34----------
like things will start to happen and


---------22:36----------
you'll kind of get frustrated


---------22:38----------
and what i'm hearing is that frustration


---------22:40----------
is sort of built on


---------22:41----------
kind of a loss of control and this is


---------22:44----------
going to be kind of an important nuance


---------22:45----------
because i don't think it's a lack of


---------22:47----------
control i think it's a loss of control


---------22:50----------
um and that you've sort of worked really


---------22:52----------
hard to get to where you


---------22:54----------
are uh you know you've


---------22:58----------
and the thought of like losing something


---------23:00----------
being forgotten


---------23:02----------
um the thought of like building


---------23:04----------
something up


---------23:05----------
and having that taken away from you and


---------23:08----------
i think that's kind of like a subtle


---------23:09----------
theme that i'm hearing here is that it's


---------23:11----------
not about the lack of something


---------23:13----------
it's like i'm gonna put all my energy


---------23:15----------
and effort into building the stream


---------23:16----------
building this community and then it's


---------23:18----------
gonna get like


---------23:19----------
i'm gonna lose it and yeah


---------23:23----------
and and those kinds of thoughts are kind


---------23:25----------
of floating around in your head


---------23:27----------
and i'm also hearing that you actually


---------23:29----------
handle those thoughts pretty well


---------23:31----------
i know it sounds weird but like that you


---------23:33----------
can manage that you recognize that


---------23:35----------
you're feeling down you're feeling


---------23:36----------
frustrated you have a short temper


---------23:38----------
those thoughts kind of occupy your space


---------23:40----------
but you can hold them right like you can


---------23:41----------
handle that


---------23:43----------
and then it's really like this


---------23:44----------
additional stuff piled on top


---------23:47----------
that really feels too much


---------23:51----------
whether it's other conversations


---------23:54----------
whether it's twitter trolls i'm really


---------23:57----------
kind of getting this


---------23:57----------
this sense of like straw that broke the


---------23:59----------
camel's back where like you can handle a


---------24:01----------
lot of frustration


---------24:03----------
but then you kind of reach your breaking


---------24:04----------
point and then then


---------24:06----------
i think this kind of goes back to your


---------24:07----------
original question which is why is it


---------24:09----------
that some days the


---------24:11----------
twitter trolls bother me and some days


---------24:12----------
they don't what i'm sort of hearing from


---------24:15----------
you


---------24:15----------
is it kind of depends on how much you're


---------24:17----------
carrying at the start of that day


---------24:21----------
yeah i yeah that's


---------24:24----------
and one thing i before i lose before i i


---------24:27----------
don't want to get off the


---------24:28----------
train of thought but i might lose this


---------24:30----------
um


---------24:31----------
when i said back to depression the the


---------24:34----------
thought of like losing or whatever


---------24:36----------
uh recently well not recently but before


---------24:38----------
that like months ago


---------24:40----------
i had like the you know when the dmca


---------24:43----------
stuff was happening


---------24:44----------
um i got two dmc strikes i had to delete


---------24:47----------
everything i couldn't play music anymore


---------24:49----------
so that was like the that was like the


---------24:52----------
first time i started feeling like that


---------24:54----------
the thought of like oh wow like it could


---------24:56----------
actually like i could be banned


---------24:59----------
or i could actually lose that for real


---------25:01----------
so when this thing happened


---------25:03----------
it just brought me back to that same


---------25:04----------
kind of feeling um


---------25:06----------
so that's i think that's where like i


---------25:09----------
just wrote back to depression that's


---------25:11----------
i think the back too ah


---------25:14----------
yeah that's really important yeah


---------25:18----------
so so what i'm almost hearing um lost


---------25:21----------
there is that you sort of had a


---------25:23----------
traumatic experience


---------25:25----------
and you're almost like


---------25:30----------
it's almost like i know this word gets


---------25:32----------
tossed around a lot


---------25:33----------
but it almost feels to me like a trigger


---------25:38----------
could be yeah so so let me explain to


---------25:40----------
you what i mean by trigger which i i


---------25:43----------
mean i think the word gets tossed around


---------25:44----------
so you know when i work with like


---------25:46----------
veterans so i worked with veterans like


---------25:49----------
that were in the iraq and afghanistan


---------25:50----------
war


---------25:52----------
and so like they have particular


---------25:54----------
experiences that make them feel a


---------25:55----------
certain way like you know they


---------25:57----------
like someone detonates a bomb for


---------25:59----------
example


---------26:01----------
and then what happens is they'll be like


---------26:02----------
walking down the parking lot of a home


---------26:04----------
depot


---------26:06----------
and then they'll hear like a truck


---------26:08----------
muffler kind of go bang


---------26:10----------
and what happens is like that


---------26:14----------
experience opens up this door in their


---------26:17----------
mind where a flood of emotions


---------26:20----------
feelings memories worries like then


---------26:23----------
suddenly


---------26:24----------
comes out and it occupies their mind and


---------26:27----------
it's kind of they're


---------26:27----------
like they're transported back there this


---------26:30----------
is the idea of a flashback in ptsd


---------26:33----------
yeah yeah and then like when they're in


---------26:35----------
that state of mind they also feel


---------26:37----------
like their mood is heavily affected they


---------26:39----------
have a short temper


---------26:40----------
you know all kinds of other things but


---------26:42----------
and the other interesting thing that


---------26:43----------
you know it's really interesting to hear


---------26:45----------
you say that because


---------26:46----------
the other interesting thing if you


---------26:47----------
really look at ptsd i'm not saying you


---------26:49----------
have ptsd i'm just talking about


---------26:50----------
sort of that as an extreme i don't want


---------26:53----------
to compare my twitch problems to like


---------26:55----------
yeah so so i'll explain what i mean by


---------26:57----------
that uh by the comparison and why


---------26:59----------
why it's important to make but what i'm


---------27:01----------
hearing is a is


---------27:03----------
a similar pattern but a very different


---------27:05----------
intensity


---------27:07----------
right but like the fundamental


---------27:09----------
neuroscience of our brain


---------27:12----------
sort of recalling up relevant emotions


---------27:14----------
happens to all of us


---------27:17----------
right so you don't you can experience


---------27:19----------
trauma and not have ptsd ptsd is a


---------27:21----------
clinical condition


---------27:23----------
but all of us can be traumatized and


---------27:26----------
whether it turns into a full-blown


---------27:28----------
clinical


---------27:29----------
illness is like a separate thing but you


---------27:31----------
know the mechanism of trauma in your


---------27:33----------
mind is the same as the mechanism of


---------27:35----------
trauma


---------27:36----------
in someone with ptsd it's the size of


---------27:39----------
the trauma that results in ptsd


---------27:41----------
versus not ptsd okay does that make


---------27:44----------
sense


---------27:45----------
but what i'm still hearing you say is


---------27:46----------
that like it actually sounds to me like


---------27:48----------
you had sort of a traumatic experience


---------27:51----------
around the dmca stuff and then it's like


---------27:54----------
these moments are kind of transporting


---------27:56----------
you back to like


---------27:58----------
i could lose it all yeah yeah


---------28:02----------
that's like worst case scenario you know


---------28:04----------
mindset


---------28:06----------
would you say that um this issue of sort


---------28:09----------
of being really frustrated and things


---------28:11----------
bothering you does that predate the dmca


---------28:14----------
stuff or has that been since the dmca


---------28:16----------
stuff


---------28:20----------
um if we're just going strictly off of


---------28:23----------
off of how i feel with twitch i think


---------28:28----------
um i've been like suspended before


---------28:32----------
but i've never really had that like it


---------28:34----------
was always like 24 hours or something


---------28:36----------
like that


---------28:37----------
i never really had the feelings that i


---------28:39----------
do about this and the dmca so i think


---------28:42----------
i think the dmc it was the first time


---------28:44----------
where i was like wow cause i i


---------28:46----------
had to delete all my like clips from my


---------28:48----------
twitch


---------28:49----------
and that's like memories i want to you


---------28:51----------
know


---------28:52----------
show my kids one day or something you


---------28:54----------
know what i mean um


---------28:57----------
or just always have to look back at yeah


---------29:00----------
so it was just like what did you do it


---------29:03----------
was


---------29:03----------
during the dmca thing well


---------29:06----------
i was getting i was getting strikes from


---------29:09----------
like


---------29:10----------
old clips from like 2017


---------29:13----------
stuff like that so the the the solution


---------29:16----------
that was being given to


---------29:18----------
all the streamers was yeah delete all


---------29:20----------
your twitch and all your clips and bonds


---------29:22----------
um so i did i did it because i was like


---------29:25----------
all right well


---------29:27----------
these are memories but i'd rather not


---------29:29----------
lose my entire


---------29:30----------
channel um so i had to make that


---------29:32----------
decision


---------29:34----------
but you know and then even after that


---------29:37----------
decision it's like okay well now


---------29:39----------
you got to worry about you can't play


---------29:40----------
anything copyright in your stream


---------29:42----------
because then


---------29:43----------
three strikes are out like you'll get


---------29:44----------
permabed so that was just like a


---------29:46----------
constant


---------29:48----------
you know stressful thing too um


---------29:52----------
so yeah that's those are just two things


---------29:55----------
i've dealt with with on the twitch


---------29:57----------
side so from a dmca standpoint i mean i


---------30:00----------
understand you had to delete


---------30:02----------
those those vods and clips and whatnot


---------30:04----------
but


---------30:05----------
i'm going to kind of ask you a question


---------30:07----------
again in sort of a slightly different


---------30:08----------
manner like what did you what did you


---------30:10----------
lose right so you said memories


---------30:13----------
like you talked about showing these


---------30:14----------
potentially to your kids


---------30:16----------
one day yeah i mean you know


---------30:20----------
it's it's just them all


---------30:24----------
it was like i could always look back


---------30:26----------
from where it started


---------30:28----------
i can go to like you know what was i


---------30:31----------
doing in 2018 2019 like i can go through


---------30:34----------
these


---------30:35----------
and now it's really just um you know i


---------30:38----------
just gotta hope that there's like clips


---------30:40----------
or videos on youtube somewhere and


---------30:42----------
you know that's that's that's what


---------30:46----------
that's


---------30:46----------
that was um what i lost was that it's


---------30:49----------
all in one place on my channel


---------30:51----------
i could look back people could look back


---------30:53----------
people can go to the beginning


---------30:55----------
you know what's the value of going to


---------30:56----------
the beginning being able to look back


---------31:00----------
oh man i mean


---------31:03----------
the same reason people have peop you


---------31:05----------
know people


---------31:06----------
had uh um what's it uh what's it called


---------31:12----------
what's it when when i it's like an old


---------31:14----------
thing people take pictures and they have


---------31:15----------
like a


---------31:16----------
well i don't know what it's called i'm


---------31:17----------
like a screen blanking out like a


---------31:19----------
scrapbook maybe i don't know


---------31:20----------
but my mom would yeah like a fallout


---------31:22----------
yeah i'm dumb


---------31:23----------
um yeah like you know people make photo


---------31:26----------
albums same reason people take pictures


---------31:28----------
and videos


---------31:29----------
when they're on vacations or you know


---------31:31----------
whatever like it's the same thing it's


---------31:32----------
like


---------31:33----------
this is my version of that um


---------31:36----------
you know my looking back at friends and


---------31:39----------
you know even family too i've had my


---------31:40----------
family on here


---------31:41----------
yeah so it's you know the memories just


---------31:46----------
kind of just hadn't had to get rid of


---------31:48----------
them to you know save the channel


---------31:51----------
yeah yeah so los i'm going to ask you a


---------31:55----------
couple of really hard questions because


---------31:57----------
they're really really simple and really


---------31:59----------
really fundamental


---------32:01----------
and i think you're giving good answers


---------32:04----------
so


---------32:04----------
i think it's interesting because what


---------32:05----------
i'm hearing from you is that you had to


---------32:07----------
sacrifice your history


---------32:09----------
for your survival


---------32:14----------
right like you had to give up like


---------32:17----------
you know we all care about like albums


---------32:20----------
and where we came from


---------32:21----------
in our journey and that's like an


---------32:23----------
important part of who we are


---------32:25----------
and what i'm hearing you say is that you


---------32:27----------
really had to like


---------32:29----------
axe it you know yeah


---------32:33----------
yeah what was it what did it feel like


---------32:36----------
to do that


---------32:41----------
um it was really just a


---------32:44----------
sad feeling it was just sad i like


---------32:48----------
you know i didn't cry or anything like


---------32:51----------
crazy


---------32:52----------
i just was just really upset about it


---------32:54----------
and uh


---------32:56----------
it kind of happened really quick so i


---------32:57----------
got one strike and i didn't really


---------33:00----------
think anything i was like all right


---------33:02----------
everyone gets like a strike but then


---------33:03----------
like i got a second one i was like oh my


---------33:05----------
god like i gotta act now


---------33:06----------
you know so it was kind of just like i


---------33:08----------
just it was like


---------33:10----------
do or die type thing um


---------33:13----------
so yeah i just had to do it yeah it just


---------33:14----------
didn't feel good and


---------33:17----------
i don't know and then just looking at my


---------33:19----------
channel after that


---------33:20----------
it just like felt weird because you know


---------33:22----------
like you can click your top


---------33:24----------
clips and it shows like it's it'll be


---------33:26----------
like a clip from last year two years


---------33:28----------
whatever


---------33:28----------
i just had none of that so i just i


---------33:31----------
don't know i just felt it just felt


---------33:32----------
different


---------33:34----------
um for the first time in like years of


---------33:35----------
streaming


---------33:37----------
yeah so um


---------33:40----------
i'm noticing you're using words like sad


---------33:42----------
weird and different


---------33:44----------
so what we're gonna try to do is is you


---------33:46----------
know especially as men


---------33:48----------
and especially on platforms like twitch


---------33:50----------
like we don't have a very


---------33:52----------
like we're not really taught good


---------33:53----------
emotional vocabulary


---------33:55----------
so if it's okay with you lose i'm going


---------33:57----------
to try to toss out a couple of words and


---------33:58----------
maybe maybe we can explore


---------34:00----------
what is weird and different is that okay


---------34:04----------
so the first thing is you know i had a i


---------34:08----------
had a patient once who was kind of


---------34:09----------
telling me about like


---------34:10----------
furniture that got repossessed from


---------34:12----------
their house


---------34:15----------
and like that sounds kind of weird but


---------34:16----------
what i'm hearing from you kind of


---------34:18----------
reminds me of that conversation where it


---------34:19----------
was like


---------34:20----------
i remember talking to that person it's


---------34:22----------
like the creditors came in


---------34:24----------
and like this was their home right this


---------34:25----------
is what they had like built up and


---------34:27----------
accrued


---------34:28----------
and like one day people showed up and


---------34:31----------
they started like


---------34:32----------
unplugging televisions and like taking


---------34:34----------
them out of the house


---------34:36----------
and they started taking like furniture


---------34:39----------
and it's awful and and i know that


---------34:42----------
you're very sensitive about making


---------34:44----------
comparisons about


---------34:45----------
you know how bad you have it versus how


---------34:47----------
bad other people have it i respect that


---------34:49----------
we'll get to that maybe


---------34:50----------
but what i'm sort of what i'm sort of


---------34:52----------
envisioning is like when you look at


---------34:54----------
your top clips and it's like


---------34:55----------
it's all empty it actually reminds me


---------34:57----------
that conversation


---------34:58----------
that i had with that person years ago


---------35:00----------
about like you sort of you know walk


---------35:02----------
into your


---------35:02----------
this space that you spent six


---------35:05----------
years of your life like creating these


---------35:07----------
moments and like someone has come in and


---------35:09----------
like


---------35:11----------
like they're like movers are coming in


---------35:13----------
and like you're like deleting these


---------35:14----------
clips and it feels empty


---------35:16----------
like what i'm hearing is really a


---------35:18----------
feeling of emptiness


---------35:19----------
and loss yeah


---------35:23----------
is that how you feel yeah that's how i


---------35:25----------
feel


---------35:26----------
and um you know a lot of people were


---------35:28----------
like oh you could like save


---------35:30----------
clips and stuff and like i saved a few


---------35:32----------
clips but


---------35:34----------
i mean we're talking about like


---------35:36----------
terabytes worth of


---------35:39----------
you know data or whatever clips whatever


---------35:42----------
so i just i didn't have that luxury i


---------35:46----------
just had to just delete


---------35:47----------
um so it's but even if i could save all


---------35:51----------
of them


---------35:52----------
i would still in a way feel the same way


---------35:56----------
because it's just it's not out there for


---------35:58----------
anyone to look at or like right where it


---------36:00----------
was


---------36:01----------
um i'd have to like go into like files


---------36:04----------
on the computer and like look at like


---------36:06----------
i don't know like just like random dates


---------36:08----------
or something it's just


---------36:09----------
it's different it's just different um


---------36:13----------
so yeah that's yeah i'm hearing that


---------36:16----------
those


---------36:17----------
those clips don't just exist for you


---------36:20----------
yeah yeah they're not just for me it's


---------36:22----------
not just for me no those are moments


---------36:24----------
that you had with your community that


---------36:26----------
are that are sort of important for them


---------36:27----------
and like important to be shared and


---------36:29----------
things like that


---------36:30----------
that's six years of classic funny


---------36:32----------
moments


---------36:33----------
just you know just things that


---------36:38----------
yeah it's in the moment and uh yeah


---------36:40----------
they're just they're gone


---------36:43----------
how does it feel talking about this


---------36:47----------
dude like it like it kind of sucks like


---------36:49----------
now i'm thinking about it


---------36:51----------
like damn yeah like uh


---------36:54----------
i've been kind of like just trying to


---------36:55----------
like pretend that that didn't happen


---------36:57----------
but i mean you know in reality it did


---------37:00----------
and


---------37:01----------
and i think this might sound kind of


---------37:04----------
messed up but like i feel like if


---------37:06----------
every single streamer if this happened


---------37:08----------
to everyone it'd be like oh damn okay


---------37:10----------
like we're all in this together type


---------37:11----------
thing like everyone had to delete


---------37:13----------
everything


---------37:13----------
but like i see all these people who you


---------37:15----------
know this didn't happen to them and


---------37:17----------
you know people have always been playing


---------37:20----------
music and stuff like that so


---------37:22----------
i i i know that sounds kind of messed up


---------37:25----------
because i'm like i don't


---------37:26----------
wish this on anyone but i'm just like i


---------37:29----------
feel like


---------37:29----------
i would you know me and then other


---------37:32----------
people were like


---------37:34----------
the ones that you know had to pay for


---------37:36----------
this and


---------37:37----------
you know other people it didn't affect


---------37:38----------
them and it's like


---------37:41----------
i don't know i don't know if that's like


---------37:43----------
a way to look at it but i'm just like


---------37:45----------
damn like


---------37:46----------
you know why couldn't i get lucky you


---------37:48----------
know what i mean


---------37:49----------
sure and not have it in me um


---------37:52----------
so yes so here's here's what i'm hearing


---------37:54----------
and i i i'm glad


---------37:56----------
los i'm really glad you shared that


---------37:57----------
because i i see where you're coming from


---------37:59----------
in terms of like


---------38:01----------
i'm i'm definitely not hearing from you


---------38:03----------
that you wish that other people had


---------38:05----------
gotten screwed too


---------38:06----------
what i'm really hearing from you is is


---------38:08----------
that you actually kind of feel like


---------38:10----------
alone and isolated


---------38:13----------
you know and and that you sort of don't


---------38:15----------
have someone to go


---------38:16----------
through this with


---------38:20----------
what do you think yeah yeah i mean i've


---------38:24----------
seen


---------38:24----------
other streamers that they had to to do


---------38:27----------
this but it's it's kind of


---------38:29----------
it's it's people i don't even know it's


---------38:31----------
like


---------38:32----------
a few people that i've even seen like on


---------38:34----------
twitter or something


---------38:36----------
um but people that i'm close with and


---------38:38----------
other streamers i really know like that


---------38:40----------
really


---------38:40----------
didn't this didn't even affect them yeah


---------38:44----------
so what's it like to have you know


---------38:46----------
people that you're close with not be


---------38:48----------
able to understand what you're going


---------38:50----------
through


---------38:51----------
not being able to talk about it with


---------38:52----------
them oh man well


---------38:55----------
yeah that's that's something i've dealt


---------38:56----------
with for a while because


---------38:59----------
you know up until recently kind of


---------39:02----------
streaming and youtube internet


---------39:04----------
type stuff was kind of tab not taboo but


---------39:06----------
like kind of like


---------39:07----------
people didn't really understand it or


---------39:10----------
even want to understand it so


---------39:12----------
a lot of problems i would have or like


---------39:14----------
issues or


---------39:16----------
uh things i'd i'd feel because of the


---------39:18----------
stream or


---------39:19----------
i wouldn't even be able to like talk to


---------39:21----------
people about this to be honest


---------39:23----------
a select few of my friends knew about it


---------39:26----------
um


---------39:26----------
now it's get it's getting different more


---------39:28----------
people are getting into it but um


---------39:30----------
yeah it's it's kind of that same feeling


---------39:32----------
of when i first was streaming


---------39:34----------
and not really having anyone to like


---------39:37----------
talk to about like these like


---------39:39----------
kind of intricate weird things that


---------39:42----------
yeah it's not you know it's not like a


---------39:45----------
well-known


---------39:46----------
thing yet yeah


---------39:50----------
i can see why the community and and like


---------39:52----------
the love and support of the community


---------39:53----------
and the connection with the community


---------39:55----------
can


---------39:55----------
feel so valuable to you because it


---------39:57----------
sounds like you know you've


---------39:59----------
been actually kind of isolated or


---------40:01----------
isolation isn't anything new to you


---------40:03----------
let me put it that way yeah yeah i've


---------40:05----------
dealt with isolation


---------40:07----------
yeah um i'm i'm kind of curious about


---------40:11----------
that but i just want to toss one thing


---------40:12----------
out there so i


---------40:13----------
you know i asked you like how does it


---------40:15----------
feel talking about this and you were


---------40:16----------
like


---------40:17----------
kind of sucks


---------40:20----------
and so let me just explain for a second


---------40:23----------
so i think that that


---------40:24----------
unfortunately is how it is and i think


---------40:27----------
actually that's what healing


---------40:30----------
looks like so in my experience


---------40:33----------
when we have something really difficult


---------40:34----------
happen to us what our mind tries to do


---------40:37----------
is push


---------40:38----------
it away and then what happens is like we


---------40:41----------
find


---------40:41----------
in and that actually is sort of the


---------40:43----------
answer to your first question which is


---------40:45----------
you know why do i have some days where


---------40:48----------
things bother me and other days where


---------40:49----------
things


---------40:49----------
don't it's because you're carrying


---------40:52----------
around all of this stuff in your


---------40:54----------
subconscious


---------40:55----------
and so you're kind of at capacity your


---------40:57----------
arms are full


---------40:59----------
and then like you're not really


---------41:00----------
consciously aware of it because you've


---------41:02----------
actually


---------41:03----------
purposely blocked it away right you try


---------41:06----------
to ignore it you try to pretend it's not


---------41:07----------
there


---------41:08----------
you try not to think about it because


---------41:09----------
anytime you think about it you just get


---------41:11----------
sad


---------41:13----------
and so as we push those emotions into


---------41:15----------
our subconscious


---------41:17----------
what they do is shorten our fuse that


---------41:19----------
shorten our conscious views


---------41:21----------
because a lot of that fuse is being


---------41:23----------
taken up by our subconscious does that


---------41:25----------
kind of make sense


---------41:26----------
interesting right so like we're shoving


---------41:29----------
it all to the side but we're still


---------41:31----------
carrying it mm-hmm and


---------41:34----------
and so the process of healing is


---------41:36----------
actually bringing it into our conscious


---------41:39----------
mind


---------41:40----------
sitting with those feelings feeling with


---------41:42----------
those feelings


---------41:43----------
and then like letting them go and then


---------41:46----------
the cool thing


---------41:47----------
is that like as you suffer that pain


---------41:50----------
here and now


---------41:52----------
we're gonna metabolize it we're gonna


---------41:54----------
digest it


---------41:55----------
and then like if you do this for a


---------41:57----------
little while


---------41:59----------
you'll start snapping at people less


---------42:03----------
yeah it's just that's good um and but i


---------42:06----------
think the downside is that like


---------42:08----------
you know you it sounds kind of weird but


---------42:11----------
you you've signed yourself


---------42:12----------
up for a certain amount of hurt and so


---------42:14----------
what we can do is try to process that


---------42:16----------
hurt in sort of as healthy


---------42:18----------
and minimal of a man manner as possible


---------42:21----------
but you have to work through that energy


---------42:22----------
it's like kind of like this weird karmic


---------42:24----------
sort of thing


---------42:26----------
okay right when when you like when


---------42:28----------
you've built something for six years


---------42:30----------
and you have to like go through and


---------42:31----------
[ __ ] delete it so that no one can


---------42:33----------
ever see it again


---------42:34----------
like you can't just you know there's


---------42:36----------
like there's a price there's an


---------42:38----------
emotional price that you've got to pay


---------42:41----------
and we can try to make it yeah and i and


---------42:43----------
i felt like


---------42:46----------
this might sound really traumatic and


---------42:48----------
i'm not trying to


---------42:49----------
again the comparisons but i feel like


---------42:53----------
there was no


---------42:54----------
morning period if that makes sense i'm


---------42:57----------
not trying to compare again anyone who's


---------42:58----------
lost


---------42:59----------
someone or any you know any pad or


---------43:02----------
anything


---------43:03----------
uh you guys say that word where is it


---------43:07----------
it's grief can you see it i don't know i


---------43:10----------
don't know


---------43:10----------
yeah yeah yeah right so i think that's


---------43:13----------
what we're talking about


---------43:15----------
yeah cause i feel like it happened and


---------43:17----------
then it was like


---------43:18----------
you know the when the people come to my


---------43:20----------
stream they wanna you know they just


---------43:21----------
wanna be entertained and


---------43:22----------
you know they don't wanna talk about you


---------43:24----------
know like sad things like oh i'll never


---------43:26----------
be able to see the clip from three years


---------43:28----------
ago that i love there's you know what i


---------43:29----------
mean


---------43:30----------
so like i would i just had to like after


---------43:33----------
that just snap into like okay now i


---------43:34----------
gotta just stream and act like


---------43:36----------
everything's fine


---------43:37----------
meanwhile uh all the clips are gone i


---------43:40----------
can't play any music


---------43:42----------
which i've been playing for years on the


---------43:44----------
stream it's a big you know music is a


---------43:46----------
huge part of


---------43:47----------
my life and a lot of people's life um so


---------43:50----------
it's just and then and then i had to


---------43:51----------
like be you know in stream mode


---------43:54----------
entertainment mode um


---------43:57----------
and i and i think uh i think i had some


---------43:59----------
streams where i was kind of


---------44:01----------
out of it um because of that


---------44:05----------
i think and uh


---------44:08----------
yeah because there was no really


---------44:09----------
mourning or anything like that people


---------44:11----------
just like oh that sucks but like all


---------44:12----------
right entertain


---------44:13----------
entertain now you know dance monkey


---------44:15----------
dance yeah


---------44:17----------
yeah which they don't mean that listen


---------44:19----------
you guys in the chat like i know like


---------44:20----------
they don't mean it they just that's what


---------44:21----------
they they you know they want to be


---------44:22----------
entertained


---------44:23----------
yeah well when they come in so i know it


---------44:26----------
sounds kind of weird but i i think that


---------44:28----------
the biggest person who's telling you to


---------44:30----------
do that is not


---------44:31----------
your chat it's you


---------44:35----------
hmm you think


---------44:38----------
yeah right because when you say you


---------44:41----------
didn't have time to mourn who wouldn't


---------44:43----------
let you mourn


---------44:46----------
that that is true that is true but then


---------44:48----------
so why is that then


---------44:50----------
you know like why i don't know


---------44:53----------
why did i not want to mourn or i don't


---------44:55----------
know well i think a couple of things


---------44:57----------
right so


---------44:58----------
here's what i would say one is that


---------45:01----------
you tried to push it away because it


---------45:03----------
hurt to sit with it


---------45:04----------
which is a completely normal thing so no


---------45:06----------
one wants to mourn


---------45:08----------
it's just we have to second thing is


---------45:12----------
that i can imagine that you know


---------45:14----------
when your channel takes a hit


---------45:18----------
you have a voice inside you which is


---------45:20----------
responsible for your success which is


---------45:22----------
basically telling you to dance monkey


---------45:23----------
dance


---------45:25----------
and on some days you know


---------45:28----------
it it's i mean we all carry it like i


---------45:30----------
have it too


---------45:33----------
today is actually one of those days oh


---------45:36----------
no and and so but like that's that's


---------45:39----------
it's what we sign up for


---------45:40----------
right it's like there's like it's the


---------45:43----------
commitment that we make it's like


---------45:45----------
it's not just streamers like we all like


---------45:48----------
a lot of times our harshest


---------45:50----------
harshest critics or the people who don't


---------45:52----------
cut a slack


---------45:53----------
is ourselves true like it's really


---------45:57----------
fascinating and really sad that like you


---------45:59----------
know you'll cut slack to your friends


---------46:01----------
like if your friends have a bad day if


---------46:02----------
they get fired


---------46:04----------
if they get dumped you know there's


---------46:06----------
other fish in the sea


---------46:07----------
like you know you'll be okay like you're


---------46:10----------
a good guy but like when you get dumped


---------46:12----------
like what does your mind tell you


---------46:14----------
exactly yeah right yeah


---------46:18----------
and so because i i i i hear you it


---------46:20----------
sounds like your community is awesome


---------46:21----------
and super supportive and they like care


---------46:23----------
about you a lot but like you hold


---------46:24----------
yourself to a standard


---------46:26----------
when your channel gets a hit and your


---------46:28----------
mind starts telling you


---------46:29----------
you know this could be the beginning of


---------46:30----------
the end that's when you're like


---------46:33----------
i don't get to mourn i don't take a


---------46:34----------
break i just lost all my clips i can't


---------46:37----------
lose


---------46:38----------
being high energy on stream too


---------46:42----------
yeah uh


---------46:46----------
yeah i i was gonna say something i


---------46:49----------
completely forgot


---------46:51----------
totally fine let me actually i'm gonna i


---------46:54----------
have a notepad so i can


---------46:55----------
if i remember something


---------47:00----------
okay all right um


---------47:03----------
yeah so i think what's it gonna


---------47:09----------
i'll i'll i'll come back to it i'll i'll


---------47:11----------
try to remember it but yeah we can


---------47:13----------
we can keep going um you know i think


---------47:16----------
those are great points i think those are


---------47:18----------
great points


---------47:20----------
and it's like i don't even what you're


---------47:22----------
saying i don't even think about that


---------47:24----------
you know like it's just like okay i turn


---------47:26----------
on the stream i gotta stream


---------47:28----------
it's like it's just like instinctual


---------47:32----------
now when i turn on stream i gotta be you


---------47:35----------
know


---------47:35----------
a certain way yeah um


---------47:40----------
yeah so that's yeah so so you kind of


---------47:42----------
say


---------47:43----------
instinctual i would toss out a slightly


---------47:45----------
different word i would say habitual


---------47:47----------
issue okay yeah right and i think


---------47:50----------
because that's what you've


---------47:51----------
trained yourself to do and


---------47:54----------
and i think so this is where like i


---------47:55----------
think part of the reason that you know


---------47:57----------
we we have talks like this loss is


---------47:58----------
because i think that like


---------48:00----------
it's my belief that actually the most


---------48:02----------
successful loss


---------48:04----------
and and the the lows that your chat kind


---------48:07----------
of i mean they love you in all


---------48:09----------
in all of your dimensions but i think


---------48:11----------
that like what we come here to do


---------48:13----------
organically on twitch happens the best


---------48:17----------
when you're the healthiest and happiest


---------48:20----------
and part of that involves learning how


---------48:22----------
to break some of these habits and


---------48:24----------
learning how to take time for yourself


---------48:27----------
learning how to sit with some of that


---------48:28----------
negativity processing some of that


---------48:30----------
negativity


---------48:32----------
yeah and as you work through that stuff


---------48:34----------
i think that like basically


---------48:35----------
stuff will slip under the armor less


---------48:39----------
yeah you know what i feel that a lot


---------48:42----------
with


---------48:42----------
is when when i am


---------48:46----------
like when i'm like working out all the


---------48:49----------
time eating good and stuff and i'm


---------48:50----------
feeling good


---------48:51----------
i feel amazing on stream but i recently


---------48:54----------
got like a


---------48:55----------
like a back injury so i haven't been


---------48:57----------
able to really work out i've just been


---------48:58----------
like kind of like


---------49:00----------
i've been like lazy on all the you know


---------49:02----------
the eating good all this stuff


---------49:04----------
so like there'll just be days when you


---------49:05----------
know like if you eat bad and like you


---------49:07----------
just feel


---------49:08----------
bad some days um i i know people in the


---------49:11----------
chat can relate to that


---------49:13----------
like that'll that'll be another thing


---------49:15----------
that kind of like um


---------49:17----------
will just it'll just make me mad i'm not


---------49:20----------
even mad about like comments


---------49:22----------
it's like me being like mad at myself


---------49:24----------
about


---------49:25----------
like oh well you could have easily


---------49:28----------
just eaten good today and you know or


---------49:31----------
worked out today and you would feel


---------49:33----------
great but you decided to


---------49:35----------
eat a burger you know what i mean um


---------49:38----------
so that's like this similar thing to


---------49:40----------
like


---------49:41----------
having frustration build up that's like


---------49:45----------
something else in that day i was also


---------49:47----------
feeling that too


---------49:48----------
i remember um so it was literally like


---------49:51----------
everything possible happened in one day


---------49:53----------
yeah so yeah


---------49:57----------
so it sounds like you beat yourself up


---------50:01----------
i was completely beating myself up my


---------50:03----------
girlfriend was like why are you doing


---------50:04----------
like why are you


---------50:06----------
you know being like so hard on yourself


---------50:08----------
you know and i was just like oh you


---------50:10----------
don't understand like whatever


---------50:13----------
tell us tell us what what your mind was


---------50:16----------
telling


---------50:18----------
you that she didn't understand


---------50:21----------
i just i just think it was it's kind of


---------50:24----------
like um


---------50:27----------
even if i try to explain in great detail


---------50:31----------
i just feel like there's no way to


---------50:32----------
explain


---------50:34----------
how much like the stream and this stuff


---------50:37----------
like means to me


---------50:39----------
you know what i mean like i i feel like


---------50:40----------
i could go on for 30 minutes trying to


---------50:43----------
explain it but there it would really it


---------50:46----------
wouldn't really do it justice


---------50:48----------
yeah so here here's what i'm hearing no


---------50:50----------
matter how hard you try


---------50:51----------
no one will be able to understand


---------50:56----------
why i have to get that deep though like


---------50:58----------
i i don't is it that deep i don't know


---------51:00----------
is that what the feeling is


---------51:04----------
i mean i think for this particular thing


---------51:06----------
i think it's fine yeah so


---------51:08----------
so let's learn how to be non-judgmental


---------51:12----------
with our feelings okay like i i asked


---------51:15----------
that question you're like [ __ ]


---------51:17----------
like why does it have to be like if


---------51:19----------
that's what you feel like let's call it


---------51:20----------
what it is bro like then we can work on


---------51:22----------
it


---------51:23----------
okay yeah i'm down i'm down and so so


---------51:26----------
here's


---------51:27----------
how so like i know this is gonna sound


---------51:28----------
kind of weird maybe we can ask chat


---------51:30----------
because this is sort of a read my mind


---------51:32----------
question and i i'm just gonna throw you


---------51:33----------
some real


---------51:34----------
you know curveballs here fastballs


---------51:38----------
so like what is the word that we use to


---------51:42----------
describe someone


---------51:44----------
who no matter how hard they explain no


---------51:47----------
one will be able to understand


---------51:50----------
misunderstood that's a good one not the


---------51:54----------
one that i was thinking of but that's


---------51:56----------
actually probably a more accurate term


---------51:58----------
okay right right so i'm not hearing that


---------52:01----------
you're misunderstood


---------52:03----------
subtly uh like it's not that you're


---------52:06----------
misunderstood


---------52:07----------
it's not that she understands one thing


---------52:10----------
and that's the wrong thing it's that she


---------52:13----------
can't understand


---------52:15----------
right she's never gonna be able to


---------52:17----------
understand


---------52:19----------
yeah and so what i'm really hearing


---------52:22----------
there is like you're alone


---------52:27----------
i i i i think alone


---------52:30----------
with i think it goes back to what we


---------52:34----------
were saying about like those feelings


---------52:36----------
about having people to relate to them so


---------52:39----------
it's like she doesn't do any of this


---------52:40----------
she's not a streamer she


---------52:42----------
she's not in that world you know so


---------52:45----------
if i'm talking to her about this or she


---------52:47----------
or she's like oh what's wrong it's like


---------52:49----------
i just feel like there's no real


---------52:54----------
like point to like explain


---------52:57----------
the whole i don't know i don't know that


---------52:59----------
sounds kind of messed up saying it out


---------53:00----------
loud but


---------53:01----------
don't judge just say it we'll work


---------53:03----------
through it no yeah i just feel like


---------53:06----------
you know it's


---------53:09----------
it's something that i can't i just can't


---------53:12----------
explain it's


---------53:13----------
i don't know i don't know i don't know


---------53:14----------
what it is i don't know i don't know how


---------53:16----------
to


---------53:16----------
describe it that's what you're that


---------53:18----------
you're i don't know i don't understand


---------53:19----------
right that's what i'm here for so so i


---------53:21----------
think you're doing a great job lose


---------53:23----------
i think you're describing it way better


---------53:24----------
than you think you are


---------53:27----------
okay so i think this is a confusing


---------53:28----------
thing


---------53:30----------
oh [ __ ] this is gonna be weird but


---------53:33----------
you're actually describing it very well


---------53:37----------
but remember that there's a voice in


---------53:39----------
your head


---------53:40----------
telling you that no one can understand


---------53:43----------
okay so you think that you're not


---------53:45----------
describing it well


---------53:47----------
yeah but the very voice in your head


---------53:50----------
tells you


---------53:51----------
no one can understand so like you can't


---------53:53----------
describe it properly


---------53:56----------
do you see that yeah


---------53:59----------
even now it's acting in this


---------54:01----------
conversation where


---------54:02----------
you feel like your words are


---------54:05----------
insufficient to convey


---------54:07----------
what you're going through why is that


---------54:14----------
brilliant questions from right so this


---------54:17----------
is where like now we get


---------54:18----------
to like answers okay so tell me what it


---------54:21----------
was like


---------54:21----------
when you started streaming and people


---------54:24----------
didn't understand what you did


---------54:28----------
oh man i had a lot of i had one i had my


---------54:32----------
best friend


---------54:33----------
at one point um


---------54:36----------
and my cousin i remember i'll never


---------54:39----------
forget this it was


---------54:40----------
i think i had been streaming for like


---------54:41----------
maybe a year um


---------54:44----------
and they and we were in a pizzeria and


---------54:46----------
they were like what are you doing with


---------54:47----------
this like


---------54:48----------
because because i wouldn't i would stay


---------54:50----------
in most nights and stream


---------54:52----------
a lot of people be going out doing stuff


---------54:54----------
and i'd i'd stay in i


---------54:56----------
i you know what are you doing with this


---------54:57----------
like this is gonna die in like a year or


---------55:00----------
two like you need to like you know


---------55:02----------
you know focus on uh you know what's


---------55:06----------
important and stuff like that


---------55:08----------
so a lot of people who weren't


---------55:11----------
in the streaming or youtube internet


---------55:14----------
world whatever


---------55:15----------
they just didn't understand it um


---------55:19----------
so and then and then it would be like


---------55:22----------
you know i have a girlfriend now but


---------55:23----------
before her


---------55:24----------
any girl who i would talk to


---------55:28----------
it was almost impossible like trying to


---------55:30----------
get them to understand like what exactly


---------55:33----------
you know i i did to the point where i


---------55:36----------
would even


---------55:37----------
i i i would just lie at that point and


---------55:39----------
just be like yeah no i do stocks online


---------55:42----------
um i'm like a i'm a day trader


---------55:46----------
uh i would just say i'm into like


---------55:48----------
technology i do like


---------55:50----------
stuff on the computers because it was


---------55:52----------
just it was just too like


---------55:54----------
i don't feel like explaining this whole


---------55:55----------
thing every time i meet so you know what


---------55:57----------
i mean


---------55:58----------
now i do feel like it's it's getting


---------56:00----------
more well-known but i just think


---------56:03----------
yeah there was there was a long period


---------56:04----------
of time where it was just like


---------56:06----------
you know not a lot of people really


---------56:09----------
understood


---------56:10----------
so lois it's not that a lot of people


---------56:12----------
didn't understand


---------56:14----------
what i'm hearing this is what i want you


---------56:16----------
to think about what does it do to


---------56:18----------
someone


---------56:19----------
when the closest people to them


---------56:23----------
don't understand can't understand won't


---------56:26----------
understand


---------56:27----------
won't try to understand i i think it's


---------56:30----------
something where it's


---------56:31----------
it's like you wanna


---------56:35----------
you wanna relate with the people you're


---------56:38----------
closest with about like


---------56:39----------
you know everything i think you know


---------56:41----------
yeah so if you can't relate about a


---------56:43----------
major thing


---------56:45----------
in your life it kind of makes like a


---------56:47----------
separation


---------56:49----------
yep or like yeah puts up like a little


---------56:51----------
little wall or something


---------56:53----------
yep yeah is that how you feel


---------56:57----------
is that how you felt when you got dmcad


---------57:00----------
and your close streamer felt


---------57:02----------
friends didn't um


---------57:05----------
yeah yeah i felt like it was


---------57:09----------
it was the same like just alone just


---------57:12----------
damn


---------57:13----------
you know damn and uh


---------57:18----------
tell me more that's the feeling just


---------57:20----------
damn like this


---------57:21----------
you know this sucks this sucks i wish


---------57:24----------
this didn't happen to me


---------57:25----------
you know that kind of feeling what did


---------57:28----------
you wish


---------57:32----------
i mean just


---------57:35----------
that it didn't happen you know yeah and


---------57:38----------
i think this is where we get to some of


---------57:40----------
the things where


---------57:42----------
you know this is going to sound kind of


---------57:43----------
messed up i'm going to repeat back some


---------57:44----------
of your words but like in a weird way


---------57:46----------
like


---------57:46----------
you wish that it happened to them too


---------57:48----------
like not because you wanted them to hurt


---------57:50----------
them but you wish that there was someone


---------57:52----------
out there


---------57:52----------
that could understand that could get


---------57:55----------
over that wall


---------57:57----------
you know like it was on your side of the


---------57:59----------
wall


---------58:00----------
if this happened to one of my close


---------58:02----------
streamer friends or someone even someone


---------58:03----------
i remotely knew


---------58:05----------
i'm sure we would have had like you know


---------58:07----------
conversation about this and


---------58:09----------
that would have probably helped you know


---------58:11----------
yeah something like that i'm sure we


---------58:13----------
would have many conversations


---------58:15----------
um and but that just didn't happen


---------58:18----------
and i just felt like damn like i just


---------58:20----------
see everyone like having so much fun


---------58:23----------
like like business as usual nothing


---------58:25----------
happened and then i'm just over here


---------58:26----------
like damn


---------58:27----------
you know yeah you know my whole stream's


---------58:31----------
changed in a


---------58:32----------
in a heartbeat you know


---------58:35----------
so i i want to kind of go back to you


---------58:37----------
know people are curious about


---------58:40----------
where a lot of our psychological


---------58:42----------
patterns come from


---------58:44----------
um you kind of said i'll never forget


---------58:48----------
dot dot like you said there it was like


---------58:51----------
y'all were in a pizzeria


---------58:52----------
with your best friend and one of your


---------58:54----------
other friends like you'll never forget


---------58:56----------
that moment i'll never forget it because


---------58:58----------
they


---------58:58----------
actually now to this day they brought


---------59:00----------
that back up like wow remember when we


---------59:02----------
said


---------59:03----------
we said that and you know now look at


---------59:05----------
you um and then


---------59:07----------
how does that conversation go


---------59:10----------
that conversation was just like you know


---------59:13----------
i'll kind of sometimes be like i told


---------59:14----------
you like i


---------59:15----------
i i wouldn't be wasting my time doing


---------59:17----------
something i didn't believe in or you


---------59:18----------
know


---------59:19----------
just stuff like that how do you feel


---------59:21----------
this hard question loss


---------59:23----------
how do you feel when they say remember


---------59:25----------
that conversation in the pizzeria


---------59:31----------
i feel proud that i did that it didn't


---------59:33----------
go that way


---------59:35----------
yep that they what else do you feel


---------59:39----------
uh i feel a sense of accomplishment


---------59:46----------
now this is where i get to be an


---------59:47----------
arrogant prick


---------59:50----------
okay because i'm going to assume for


---------59:51----------
most of the time i listen


---------59:53----------
and i'm like oh lois how do you feel bro


---------59:56----------
tell me your feelings this is where i'm


---------59:57----------
going to tell you


---------59:58----------
how i think you feel and if you say you


---------60:00----------
don't feel this way i'd say you're in


---------60:02----------
denial


---------60:03----------
okay i think you i think you feel pissed


---------60:09----------
elaborate well because like


---------60:13----------
it's not just about pride and


---------60:15----------
accomplishment right it's like you


---------60:16----------
[ __ ] like i was trying to explain


---------60:18----------
this to you back then


---------60:20----------
and i needed y'all to understand and


---------60:22----------
like now you guys are joking about it


---------60:24----------
but like that conversation wasn't funny


---------60:28----------
yeah yeah yeah


---------60:33----------
yeah i i yeah i agree


---------60:36----------
because i do remember in that moment


---------60:39----------
being like damn like


---------60:41----------
you know i i would hope i would i i


---------60:44----------
would wish


---------60:45----------
when i'm one of my best friends my


---------60:47----------
cousin would believe


---------60:48----------
in me you know what i mean um but i


---------60:52----------
i in that moment i didn't have that


---------60:54----------
support


---------60:55----------
yep yeah and so then sure like i get


---------60:58----------
that there's this


---------60:59----------
i'm not trying to say damn this much


---------61:01----------
it's just i honestly my reaction is damn


---------61:04----------
that's just my reaction to a lot of


---------61:05----------
things i ignore


---------61:07----------
so like this this is where like i think


---------61:08----------
we've got to be like this is part of


---------61:10----------
that processing right because like


---------61:11----------
here's what i'm hearing like it sort of


---------61:12----------
makes sense you're kind of like


---------61:14----------
macho these are your bros and you're


---------61:16----------
like i showed you [ __ ]


---------61:18----------
you know i was right all along like i


---------61:21----------
get that


---------61:22----------
but there's like a subtle underside to


---------61:24----------
that coin which is like


---------61:25----------
when i needed y'all to believe in me


---------61:27----------
like sure i showed you that you were


---------61:29----------
wrong but like


---------61:30----------
it's not a competition where you show


---------61:32----------
them who's wrong like


---------61:33----------
they're joking about it and they're like


---------61:34----------
you see how stupid we were like i get


---------61:36----------
that there's value there but there's


---------61:37----------
like


---------61:38----------
a subtle other thing which is like i


---------61:40----------
don't need you to believe in me now


---------61:43----------
like i have three million followers on


---------61:45----------
twitch


---------61:46----------
what i needed you to do was believe in


---------61:48----------
me back then


---------61:50----------
um yeah


---------61:55----------
what do you think about that um


---------61:59----------
i i think that i wasn't even


---------62:03----------
i don't think that i even thought um


---------62:07----------
i had that feeling until you kind of


---------62:09----------
just said that and it's kind of


---------62:12----------
it it's kind of like in my head's like


---------62:14----------
yeah it would it would have felt a lot


---------62:15----------
better


---------62:16----------
back then when i was trying to do this


---------62:18----------
to have more people


---------62:20----------
you know support and understand it yeah


---------62:23----------
um so i even i had another friend who


---------62:26----------
um really kind of just like roasted this


---------62:28----------
whole thing


---------62:30----------
and now you know they've


---------62:33----------
recently visited my new house and


---------62:35----------
they're like


---------62:36----------
this this is from the streaming i'm like


---------62:38----------
yeah


---------62:39----------
and and now now they now they're so


---------62:42----------
interested i'm getting a hundred


---------62:43----------
questions about it now


---------62:45----------
but you know back then it was it was a


---------62:47----------
different thing it was like yo why


---------62:48----------
aren't you coming out like why aren't


---------62:49----------
you coming out tonight like


---------62:51----------
and uh yeah so


---------62:54----------
but you know i don't i don't think i'm


---------62:57----------
pissed i don't think i'm pissed


---------62:59----------
i i think it would


---------63:02----------
it would have been nice to have


---------63:05----------
more support but i'm i'm glad the way


---------63:09----------
for the most part things worked out you


---------63:11----------
know yeah so lois i think that's an


---------63:13----------
incredibly mature way of looking at it


---------63:15----------
you know i commend you for


---------63:18----------
being a better human than i um


---------63:21----------
and and and so and at the same time i


---------63:23----------
think that like


---------63:26----------
you know if you really want to let some


---------63:27----------
of this stuff go if you ask you ask me


---------63:29----------
the question like why does my mind do


---------63:31----------
that like this is the way that you undo


---------63:33----------
it because i think there is a part of


---------63:34----------
your mind


---------63:35----------
pissed maybe not but i think that


---------63:37----------
there's certainly a part of your mind


---------63:38----------
that felt


---------63:39----------
hurt by their lack of faith


---------63:42----------
right and oftentimes anger


---------63:46----------
actually has its root in being hurt


---------63:49----------
and so i think it's easier to detect for


---------63:52----------
most people


---------63:53----------
it's easier to detect the anger than it


---------63:55----------
is for them to detect the hurt but if


---------63:57----------
you're able to follow that anger down to


---------63:59----------
the hurt


---------64:00----------
it makes sense to me that you're not


---------64:01----------
actively pissed because usually


---------64:03----------
anger masquerades like right it's like


---------64:05----------
if if i get you know


---------64:06----------
if if my significant other my girlfriend


---------64:09----------
says something like that is very hurtful


---------64:11----------
to me like i'm gonna get mad at her


---------64:14----------
right it's just like it's how we respond


---------64:16----------
to being hurt like when when you hit me


---------64:18----------
like i'm gonna hit back


---------64:20----------
and so i i think i know this sounds


---------64:22----------
really really bizarre but like


---------64:24----------
um you know at some point it may be


---------64:26----------
worthwhile like having


---------64:27----------
sort of a conversation where you like


---------64:29----------
let some of this go


---------64:31----------
and this can sound hard but like


---------64:34----------
sometimes it's like actually sitting


---------64:35----------
down with those people and saying like


---------64:37----------
you remember that conversation in the


---------64:38----------
pizzeria like


---------64:40----------
i was really trying something new and i


---------64:42----------
wasn't sure of myself but i thought i


---------64:43----------
was onto something


---------64:44----------
and like i really felt like y'all


---------64:48----------
you know you guys were trying to do the


---------64:49----------
best that you could


---------64:51----------
but at the same time i felt like really


---------64:52----------
hurt and isolated and like i was trying


---------64:54----------
to share this part of my life with you


---------64:56----------
and i needed some


---------64:57----------
help and support and i sort of like


---------64:59----------
didn't get it


---------65:01----------
and but do you think too that they maybe


---------65:03----------
could have been


---------65:04----------
actually they thought they were looking


---------65:06----------
out for me sure


---------65:08----------
absolutely i think they they did think


---------65:10----------
they were looking out for you


---------65:11----------
and that's why you guys need to have a


---------65:13----------
conversation you can acknowledge that


---------65:15----------
like i think i


---------65:16----------
even now if you go back and watch the


---------65:17----------
bot i think i said y'all did the best


---------65:19----------
that you thought you could


---------65:22----------
and it still hurt right and i think that


---------65:25----------
like


---------65:25----------
acknowledging that is really healthy


---------65:28----------
you're not necessarily blaming them


---------65:30----------
what you're doing is like remember the


---------65:32----------
goal here


---------65:33----------
is not to like blame or fix things i


---------65:35----------
know it sounds weird lois but the goal


---------65:37----------
is to take down


---------65:38----------
down that wall that's between you and


---------65:40----------
other people


---------65:43----------
and put taking down that wall i'll just


---------65:45----------
kind of give you a quick example so


---------65:47----------
i was uh working with a a family


---------65:51----------
actually so the


---------65:52----------
parents have one special needs child and


---------65:55----------
one


---------65:55----------
neurotypical child and like what what is


---------65:59----------
neurotypical


---------66:00----------
like non-special needs like regular kid


---------66:02----------
okay okay


---------66:03----------
okay so they've got like one kid with uh


---------66:05----------
you know something like autism


---------66:07----------
and one regular kid and so um


---------66:11----------
uh you know like when the kids were


---------66:15----------
growing up like the parents had to spend


---------66:17----------
a lot more time


---------66:19----------
with like the special needs kid


---------66:20----------
understandably so


---------66:22----------
and like the family couldn't go on


---------66:24----------
vacations and stuff because like the kid


---------66:25----------
couldn't handle a flight


---------66:27----------
and so you know for the other kid it's


---------66:29----------
like you know their fam like you know


---------66:30----------
all their friends are going on vacation


---------66:32----------
like they're going to summer camp and


---------66:33----------
things like that and like he like missed


---------66:35----------
out on a lot of opportunities because


---------66:37----------
his parents had to take care of the


---------66:38----------
special needs kid


---------66:40----------
and it's not like the parents could have


---------66:42----------
done much different like maybe they


---------66:43----------
could have done a little bit different


---------66:46----------
and and even the you know the the normal


---------66:48----------
kid


---------66:49----------
understands that the parents were trying


---------66:51----------
to do their best


---------66:53----------
and it's still hurt yeah


---------66:56----------
right so there doesn't have to be blame


---------66:59----------
for there to be an acknowledgement of


---------67:01----------
hurt


---------67:02----------
and having that conversation where he


---------67:05----------
says like


---------67:05----------
you know i wish we could have done these


---------67:07----------
things growing up


---------67:09----------
and i really felt like hurt and like i


---------67:11----------
feel like i didn't have a regular


---------67:13----------
childhood


---------67:14----------
and it's really hard but having his


---------67:16----------
parents sit with that and say like


---------67:18----------
yeah we're sorry that we couldn't do


---------67:20----------
more for you we probably could have done


---------67:22----------
more and we


---------67:22----------
probably could have done a better job


---------67:25----------
but both parties sort of acknowledged


---------67:26----------
that like everyone was sort of doing the


---------67:28----------
best that they could


---------67:30----------
and it wasn't enough but when it comes


---------67:32----------
to feeling connected


---------67:34----------
you know hearing his parents say


---------67:38----------
like acknowledge that we sh we're sorry


---------67:41----------
we couldn't do more for you and that you


---------67:43----------
deserved more


---------67:44----------
even though we did our best yeah


---------67:48----------
and that really like helps people like


---------67:50----------
come together


---------67:53----------
that's true i i yeah i never really


---------67:56----------
thought to sit down like actually talk


---------67:59----------
about it with them but um because i'm


---------68:03----------
with me like i'm more of like when it


---------68:05----------
when it comes to like really like


---------68:07----------
like serious or like deep things i kind


---------68:10----------
of try to approach things in like a


---------68:11----------
casual way cause i'm like i don't i


---------68:13----------
i don't like being like all right let's


---------68:14----------
sit down let's we gotta talk like i


---------68:16----------
don't like being like that


---------68:17----------
i i don't know why i just i don't want


---------68:20----------
to be so serious


---------68:22----------
um but yeah i i next time


---------68:26----------
you know yeah i mean because like and


---------68:29----------
this is where like we can keep going as


---------68:31----------
far back as you want to we don't we


---------68:32----------
don't know anything about you before you


---------68:34----------
turn 20.


---------68:35----------
but this is where like you know wide are


---------68:37----------
you like that probably because there


---------68:39----------
have been experiences in your life


---------68:42----------
that taught you that that's like really


---------68:44----------
hard


---------68:45----------
because if we think about it being


---------68:47----------
really authentic and vulnerable with


---------68:48----------
someone is taking that wall down mm-hmm


---------68:52----------
right and so we know why you have the


---------68:54----------
wall now like that wall was really built


---------68:56----------
in that pizzeria


---------68:59----------
you know six years ago yeah


---------69:02----------
uh you know yeah right yeah and then you


---------69:05----------
added more


---------69:06----------
bricks on top during the dmca thing


---------69:10----------
for sure and then if we really think


---------69:13----------
about it like


---------69:14----------
we come back to the internet trolls and


---------69:16----------
like in those moments like what is it


---------69:18----------
that really bothers you


---------69:20----------
it's that like you felt like there were


---------69:23----------
fewer people defending you than


---------69:24----------
attacking you which once again


---------69:27----------
i think is like feeling alone it's like


---------69:30----------
there's so many people coming at me


---------69:32----------
and like where is everyone that was


---------69:33----------
supposed to support me


---------69:36----------
yeah yeah it's like


---------69:39----------
and i know it sounds dumb like just you


---------69:42----------
know i brought this up on stream


---------69:44----------
in in like a rage and people were just


---------69:47----------
like wow you're really hurt that like we


---------69:49----------
don't agree with your basketball take


---------69:51----------
and it's just like it's so much like


---------69:54----------
deeper than that


---------69:55----------
it's if you want to look at it like that


---------69:57----------
and be like an [ __ ] about it


---------69:59----------
then that's cool but yeah yeah


---------70:02----------
well sorry for for interrupting i really


---------70:04----------
shouldn't do that when you're on a roll


---------70:05----------
but


---------70:06----------
like that's exactly it right it's like


---------70:08----------
they don't connect with


---------70:09----------
you mm-hmm


---------70:12----------
it's like they they it's like holy crap


---------70:15----------
man like just what you said is like


---------70:16----------
that's it's the pizzeria all over again


---------70:19----------
it's i'm not trying to laugh at that


---------70:22----------
it's just


---------70:22----------
yeah no no but seriously it's like


---------70:24----------
you're trying to tell people what your


---------70:26----------
take is


---------70:27----------
and they're like hey bro you really


---------70:28----------
shouldn't be doing it that way and like


---------70:30----------
all these trolls on the


---------70:31----------
the internet are like they're they're


---------70:33----------
not listening to you


---------70:35----------
they're like listening to like they


---------70:37----------
think it's about lebron it's not about


---------70:38----------
lebron it's about like it's about you


---------70:41----------
yeah and and you know this


---------70:45----------
did i i want to go on here and not get


---------70:47----------
so


---------70:48----------
crazy deep but like there's one thing


---------70:50----------
that is pretty deep that i'll share


---------70:52----------
because and i don't


---------70:53----------
i think i've said this on stream before


---------70:55----------
but um


---------70:57----------
there was there was a time when


---------71:00----------
i literally put on my wall in my bedroom


---------71:03----------
i put like believe in me


---------71:05----------
i know that sounds really corny but it


---------71:07----------
was at a time in high school where


---------71:09----------
i was i was playing basketball and i


---------71:11----------
like did bad in


---------71:12----------
a couple classes and like i was like


---------71:15----------
might not be able to play


---------71:16----------
and i was really upset like my parents


---------71:18----------
were like mad and upset


---------71:21----------
and i was just like no no i'll you know


---------71:24----------
i'll fix this or something and and i


---------71:26----------
just was so i was just like really


---------71:27----------
emotional


---------71:28----------
and i just like put like believe in me


---------71:30----------
on my wall because i was just like


---------71:32----------
because i could sense they kind of like


---------71:34----------
doubted


---------71:35----------
that like i could like turn it around or


---------71:37----------
something and uh


---------71:40----------
it was um that i think i was like a


---------71:43----------
sophomore in high school


---------71:45----------
and um yeah they basically said like


---------71:47----------
yeah you have to get


---------71:49----------
you know do good on like this this this


---------71:51----------
all these tests to like get your grade


---------71:52----------
back to passing and i did it and i


---------71:54----------
accomplished it but


---------71:55----------
i just in that moment i felt like damn


---------71:57----------
like no one like believed in me


---------71:58----------
you know so i i i think when


---------72:03----------
maybe subconsciously when people don't


---------72:05----------
believe in me like the pizzeria or you


---------72:07----------
know like when i'm giving my opinion


---------72:09----------
i i i'm just like it's like a


---------72:12----------
frustrating thing i think i think it's a


---------72:14----------
frustrating thing


---------72:16----------
when um i'm so when i get like so


---------72:19----------
doubted


---------72:20----------
or so like disagreed with because um


---------72:24----------
i don't know i don't know why but that's


---------72:26----------
just


---------72:28----------
yeah that's just like a thing that's in


---------72:30----------
my head um


---------72:32----------
yep i'm with you bro because you didn't


---------72:36----------
write


---------72:36----------
believe in yourself on your wall


---------72:40----------
no you wrote believe in me


---------72:44----------
you're talking to someone else that


---------72:45----------
message was not for you


---------72:48----------
it was for other people yeah yeah


---------72:55----------
like i said i think this starts before


---------72:57----------
you turn 20.


---------72:58----------
so thanks for sharing that well yeah


---------73:01----------
that was definitely but yeah i was like


---------73:03----------
i think i was like 15.


---------73:05----------
when that happened um


---------73:11----------
yeah thinking more into it i think i'm


---------73:16----------
not trying to cut you off


---------73:17----------
um i think it's like a


---------73:20----------
feeling of not wanting to


---------73:25----------
like let people down


---------73:29----------
i think can i try to massage that a


---------73:33----------
little bit


---------73:34----------
yeah go ahead i think the weird thing


---------73:37----------
the weird thing about you was so i think


---------73:40----------
a lot of people don't want to let other


---------73:41----------
people down


---------73:42----------
i think the cool thing about you is that


---------73:44----------
it's not just about letting


---------73:46----------
people down it's actually knowing that


---------73:49----------
you're not gonna let them down


---------73:50----------
but them not being able to see it


---------73:55----------
well interesting


---------74:00----------
interesting


---------74:06----------
is it kind of like a thing like i'll


---------74:08----------
like i'll show you type of thing


---------74:10----------
or that because that's so wrong well i


---------74:12----------
mean that's what you've had to do


---------74:14----------
over and over and over again


---------74:17----------
nowhere throughout all of this deep


---------74:20----------
exploration


---------74:20----------
am i actually hearing you doubt yourself


---------74:27----------
yeah that's yeah that's true that's


---------74:28----------
crazy right


---------74:30----------
it's really interesting it's really


---------74:33----------
interesting


---------74:40----------
i don't know you're letting me like just


---------74:41----------
sit in the moment or just yell it over


---------74:43----------
but


---------74:45----------
that's that's an interesting


---------74:48----------
way to look at it


---------74:51----------
yeah because yeah i mean there's there's


---------74:53----------
there have there's just been times of


---------74:55----------
people doubting me but


---------74:57----------
i tr i truly have not doubted


---------75:02----------
like myself i don't know maybe i'm just


---------75:04----------
have blind delusion or


---------75:06----------
have like this like um just don't


---------75:09----------
devalue it


---------75:10----------
i'll do whatever it takes type thing i


---------75:12----------
don't know i don't i don't i i don't


---------75:14----------
know


---------75:14----------
what what causes that or would but


---------75:18----------
yeah i think i've had to do it a lot in


---------75:22----------
life


---------75:26----------
interesting


---------75:31----------
man i didn't want to see i didn't want


---------75:33----------
to check this deep


---------75:35----------
i'm you're good dude you're good


---------75:42----------
i don't


---------75:45----------
i don't know as i don't know how i don't


---------75:47----------
know what you mean by that like you


---------75:49----------
you're saying


---------75:50----------
like i you're good at what you do i know


---------75:53----------
okay okay i i i i because sometimes


---------75:56----------
people say like you're good like it's


---------75:57----------
okay keep going


---------75:58----------
right oh no it's like oh no no yeah i i


---------76:01----------
couldn't tell if


---------76:01----------
and then also like i didn't want to get


---------76:03----------
this deep and then i'm confused because


---------76:05----------
i


---------76:05----------
i don't know if i should say i'm sorry


---------76:07----------
or you're welcome


---------76:09----------
no both are appropriate


---------76:13----------
right you know and yeah


---------76:17----------
and lois like like so just to be clear


---------76:20----------
you know it takes two to tango


---------76:23----------
right so i can only do


---------76:27----------
you know what you let me do and like


---------76:30----------
you're the one


---------76:30----------
like you're the one who's like you're


---------76:32----------
the one who's going back right like


---------76:33----------
there are many


---------76:34----------
many times during this conversation


---------76:36----------
where you could have chosen not to go


---------76:38----------
deep but you you did


---------76:40----------
you know that's true that's true and and


---------76:42----------
so the thing is it's like


---------76:44----------
the way what we're talking about is just


---------76:47----------
unlocking things


---------76:49----------
you know that i don't really think about


---------76:51----------
daily yeah


---------76:53----------
so i think that's where i where i'm at


---------76:55----------
like you're you're good at that


---------76:57----------
yeah i am something of a lebron myself


---------77:04----------
in what way in doing this yeah


---------77:07----------
no yeah no for sure there's more


---------77:10----------
trolling


---------77:12----------
yeah just too good of a meme


---------77:15----------
to pass up but yeah so i i think you


---------77:18----------
know


---------77:18----------
like i i think there's a certain pacing


---------77:21----------
to this i mean if you want to keep going


---------77:23----------
and unlocking things i think that's okay


---------77:24----------
i think we've


---------77:25----------
basically kind of come up for air i


---------77:27----------
think you've connected a lot of dots um


---------77:30----------
i am letting you sit with things a


---------77:31----------
little bit more now


---------77:33----------
yeah and i i think kind of if you want


---------77:35----------
to we can talk kind of


---------77:36----------
com come back to the present a little


---------77:38----------
bit and think a little bit about how to


---------77:40----------
you know take these revelations and make


---------77:42----------
them a little bit more practical


---------77:45----------
okay or we can go deeper you know it


---------77:47----------
just sort of depends i feel like we've


---------77:48----------
sort of broken the tension at this point


---------77:50----------
but


---------77:51----------
um whatever you want to do just take the


---------77:54----------
lead and i'll


---------77:55----------
and i'll try to do my best so so then


---------77:59----------
i i think


---------78:02----------
i'm getting the sense that while you'd


---------78:03----------
be totally open to go deeper like maybe


---------78:06----------
we can just kind of pause there from


---------78:07----------
like the deep exploration standpoint


---------78:10----------
and just come back to your original


---------78:12----------
question


---------78:13----------
which is why do i have some days where i


---------78:16----------
kind of get frustrated and stuff like


---------78:17----------
this


---------78:18----------
so here here's the thing i i think that


---------78:20----------
like now that we've uncovered like


---------78:22----------
this theme right and the theme is sort


---------78:24----------
of


---------78:25----------
a sense of isolation that people don't


---------78:27----------
trust you


---------78:28----------
don't have faith in you and that like


---------78:31----------
you've tried to at times in your life


---------78:33----------
like communicate things to people


---------78:36----------
and what you needed in that moment was


---------78:38----------
like their faith and their trust


---------78:41----------
and and instead what you got was like


---------78:43----------
like not i mean they weren't like


---------78:44----------
abusive or anything right like they


---------78:46----------
weren't like mean to you or anything in


---------78:47----------
fact they were trying to do their best


---------78:50----------
yeah um and they were trying to do what


---------78:52----------
was right for you but they really


---------78:53----------
weren't like


---------78:54----------
emotionally kind of giving you what you


---------78:56----------
need and then even now you guys kind of


---------78:58----------
like joke about it like your friends


---------79:00----------
acknowledge that they were dumb


---------79:02----------
back in the pizzeria but like what you


---------79:03----------
didn't need them to be you didn't need


---------79:05----------
them to be


---------79:06----------
like smart you what you needed them to


---------79:08----------
be was like there for you


---------79:10----------
and like believe it like as you put on


---------79:12----------
your wall believe in me like that's what


---------79:14----------
you wanted from them


---------79:16----------
yeah um and and so now when we kind of


---------79:19----------
think about you know what's gonna


---------79:21----------
frustrate you


---------79:22----------
i think it's gonna be like when your


---------79:24----------
mind the thing that bothers you the most


---------79:28----------
and that's really gonna like transform


---------79:31----------
the way that your mind looks at the


---------79:33----------
outside world like whether you can just


---------79:35----------
laugh with the twitter trolls because


---------79:37----------
everyone knows like we're all just


---------79:38----------
playing games here


---------79:40----------
right i mean maybe some people are


---------79:42----------
really trying to be toxic but


---------79:44----------
i think for but but what happens is when


---------79:46----------
your mind starts to feel


---------79:50----------
like oh like i want this person to


---------79:54----------
believe in me and they're like not


---------79:55----------
believing in me


---------79:57----------
that's what i want you to look for


---------80:00----------
and then that that core feeling is going


---------80:03----------
to


---------80:03----------
manifest in all kinds of different ways


---------80:06----------
you're going to have a short temper


---------80:08----------
you're going to crack jokes you're going


---------80:11----------
to start putting up walls


---------80:13----------
yeah and then those that's what i think


---------80:16----------
is


---------80:17----------
is another question or if this is the


---------80:19----------
original but


---------80:21----------
why like that specifically


---------80:24----------
why is that bothering me


---------80:28----------
so much more than other things like why


---------80:30----------
is just


---------80:32----------
just not like believing in me or or


---------80:36----------
trusting what i say like why like why is


---------80:38----------
that


---------80:40----------
i don't i wish i wish it didn't yeah


---------80:42----------
yeah


---------80:43----------
like that yeah yeah so so i my answer is


---------80:45----------
gonna sound kind of weird but it's sort


---------80:47----------
of like


---------80:47----------
you know why does the iraq veteran


---------80:51----------
respond to the muffler going off instead


---------80:54----------
of a dog barking


---------80:55----------
it's because that's the experience that


---------80:58----------
hurt them


---------81:00----------
right so if you think about trauma and


---------81:01----------
ptsd like for example some you know


---------81:05----------
like female clients that i've had that


---------81:07----------
have been like sexually assaulted


---------81:09----------
their triggers are going to be different


---------81:12----------
from the triggers for a war veteran


---------81:15----------
okay so inside what personally has has


---------81:17----------
affected you


---------81:18----------
is what's always going to yeah either


---------81:22----------
yeah so like i have a scar like a tiny


---------81:24----------
little scar i don't know if you guys can


---------81:26----------
see it but i have a


---------81:28----------
tiny little scar right here it's barely


---------81:29----------
visible i've tiny little scar


---------81:31----------
why do i have the scar there


---------81:35----------
because that's where i got the b bite


---------81:37----------
when i was like six years old


---------81:39----------
right a b yeah it's a beasting


---------81:42----------
it left a scar yeah left scar oh well


---------81:45----------
yeah so i got a bee sting and it left a


---------81:47----------
scar but like why is the scar


---------81:48----------
there and so why does this particular


---------81:51----------
thing bother you because that's the


---------81:53----------
partic


---------81:53----------
that's it's like a psychological scar is


---------81:56----------
the way that you can think about it


---------81:57----------
right and where what determines where


---------82:00----------
this you know what the scar is and where


---------82:01----------
it is


---------82:02----------
depends on the injury


---------82:06----------
and so we can even go back like even


---------82:08----------
further than like sophomore year


---------82:11----------
because now what i'm hearing is like


---------82:13----------
this is some this is a part of you that


---------82:15----------
has been traumatized in this place


---------82:18----------
not just once but twice thrice


---------82:21----------
four times five times six times and so


---------82:23----------
with each particular injury


---------82:25----------
like that scar gets thicker and thicker


---------82:27----------
and thicker and bigger and bigger and


---------82:29----------
bigger


---------82:30----------
and it dominates more of your


---------82:31----------
psychological process


---------82:37----------
yeah um


---------82:42----------
i i think where it's happened


---------82:45----------
a lot where i could just think of is


---------82:50----------
um


---------82:52----------
maybe not before i stream well


---------82:53----------
definitely while i've been streaming


---------82:56----------
it's been you know it's been a lot of


---------82:58----------
trolls and a lot of just


---------83:01----------
whatever um you know whatever i say just


---------83:04----------
like complete doubt


---------83:06----------
like when i say when i saw you know i


---------83:08----------
don't want to bring up basketball again


---------83:10----------
but


---------83:10----------
it's a easy one but just me saying


---------83:14----------
uh just like oh i'll beat this guy


---------83:17----------
one-on-one or something just everyone


---------83:19----------
just completely just


---------83:20----------
just doubting it and just being like no


---------83:22----------
like you're bad you're


---------83:24----------
exactly just like and like


---------83:27----------
that kind of thing of just like just


---------83:29----------
completely doubting me and


---------83:31----------
and stuff i don't know that is that yeah


---------83:34----------
that just bothers me a lot yeah


---------83:36----------
um but but then again it's like


---------83:40----------
like i said there's days where a million


---------83:42----------
people could doubt


---------83:44----------
what i'm saying and it won't even affect


---------83:45----------
me so like that's where i'm trying to


---------83:47----------
like


---------83:48----------
figure out like what's well so so so i i


---------83:51----------
and and that's where i would we could


---------83:53----------
tunnel down further but i


---------83:54----------
i don't think that a million people uh


---------83:57----------
oh actually


---------83:58----------
here maybe here's here's the thing


---------83:59----------
because i think your


---------84:01----------
your trigger isn't just doubt of people


---------84:04----------
it's specifically the closest people


---------84:08----------
yeah yeah and so if it's my viewers and


---------84:12----------
like you know


---------84:12----------
the people who support me the most doing


---------84:14----------
it yeah it almost


---------84:16----------
hurts like a friend in a way it's the


---------84:19----------
same


---------84:19----------
kind of hurt it's a hurt loss that


---------84:22----------
you're very familiar with at this point


---------84:25----------
yeah right and and so i i think


---------84:28----------
as you start to pay attention like what


---------84:30----------
i want you to do is like on those days


---------84:32----------
where you feel


---------84:34----------
sad worried your mood is down where


---------84:36----------
you're back to that depression that you


---------84:38----------
tweeted about


---------84:40----------
what i would start with is is there a


---------84:43----------
part of me


---------84:44----------
that feels like someone should be


---------84:47----------
believing in me


---------84:48----------
and they're not


---------84:51----------
and this is where like i think anger is


---------84:54----------
maybe an easy thing to find because like


---------84:56----------
there's another question that i just


---------84:57----------
have burning in my mind


---------84:59----------
which is going to be completely out of


---------85:01----------
context but how many


---------85:03----------
freaking times do you have to prove


---------85:04----------
yourself before people start believing


---------85:06----------
in you


---------85:08----------
i think i man i i think


---------85:12----------
that that's a never-ending


---------85:15----------
journey i don't think that there's an


---------85:17----------
answer to that exactly


---------85:19----------
because that that's because the feeling


---------85:22----------
is that they don't have faith in you


---------85:25----------
right like do


---------85:26----------
you see that it's not even true it's


---------85:27----------
just like as long as that complex that


---------85:30----------
little nugget


---------85:31----------
that nomad because here's the other like


---------85:34----------
flip side of that


---------85:36----------
is like no matter what you do


---------85:40----------
if it's a never-ending journey it's a


---------85:42----------
battle you can never


---------85:44----------
never win and like just imagine what


---------85:46----------
that's like for you


---------85:47----------
like take a step out of your shoes for a


---------85:49----------
moment what's it like to live a life


---------85:51----------
where like


---------85:52----------
the people that are closest to you will


---------85:54----------
like never have faith in you


---------85:57----------
yeah and i don't i i really don't want


---------85:59----------
to think that no one in here


---------86:00----------
like none of my family or friends


---------86:03----------
believe that all


---------86:04----------
i'm just i was giving you the examples


---------86:05----------
of the ones that didn't like my parents


---------86:07----------
were supportive


---------86:08----------
no no i i i you know so so once again i


---------86:10----------
that's why i'm saying like let's be


---------86:11----------
non-judgmental because i


---------86:13----------
i know that you clearly have a fan base


---------86:16----------
family girlfriend that friends


---------86:19----------
streamer friends that in reality are


---------86:22----------
supportive


---------86:23----------
but what i'm pointing out to you is that


---------86:25----------
there's this like nugget of hardness in


---------86:27----------
your mind


---------86:28----------
that like i asked you this question how


---------86:30----------
many times do you have to do it before


---------86:31----------
they start believing you


---------86:32----------
and like you should go and watch the vod


---------86:34----------
you grinned


---------86:36----------
and you're like it feels like it's never


---------86:38----------
gonna be enough


---------86:40----------
because and and i man i don't want to do


---------86:43----------
this comparison let me think if i could


---------86:44----------
do a different comparison


---------86:46----------
i'll just put it like this i'll put it


---------86:47----------
like this i


---------86:49----------
let me preface this by saying i'm not


---------86:51----------
calling myself like


---------86:52----------
anything like i'm not comparing myself


---------86:54----------
to these people


---------86:55----------
i'm just i i think


---------86:58----------
a reason why i like lebron is he


---------87:02----------
is so hated on and like


---------87:05----------
so doubted that i root for him all the


---------87:09----------
time


---------87:09----------
to just prove people wrong like yeah


---------87:13----------
because i've been a fan of him while


---------87:15----------
everyone was hating him


---------87:17----------
and everyone was you know just


---------87:19----------
completely [ __ ] on him doubting him


---------87:21----------
so that's something i relate to so and


---------87:23----------
so some people are like oh wow you're


---------87:25----------
getting mad because people insult lebron


---------87:26----------
it's like


---------87:27----------
okay but like you dude no bro


---------87:30----------
bro you just you just blew the top off


---------87:33----------
of this lois


---------87:37----------
what do you think bro you just brew it


---------87:39----------
because like


---------87:40----------
what you're doing is you're like going


---------87:43----------
to lebron's rescue


---------87:44----------
when people are doing to him what they


---------87:47----------
do to you


---------87:51----------
because in those moments where everyone


---------87:52----------
is doubting him


---------87:54----------
and he's alone lois is like


---------87:57----------
f that i'm not going to let him be alone


---------88:02----------
and i'm going to believe in him


---------88:06----------
y'all don't understand like you guys


---------88:08----------
want to doubt lebron you all want to be


---------88:10----------
haters


---------88:11----------
i've got us back


---------88:15----------
that's that's really crazy


---------88:18----------
um yeah


---------88:26----------
that's a really therapeutic way to look


---------88:28----------
at this it's that's how i can put it


---------88:30----------
because i've never


---------88:31----------
thought about it like that why am i


---------88:32----------
defending him like this


---------88:35----------
um and i and i think it's just


---------88:38----------
yeah i think oh well


---------88:43----------
uh i don't know if this is embarrassing


---------88:47----------
or if this is like a good


---------88:49----------
i don't know what this is to be honest


---------88:52----------
uh


---------88:54----------
i don't know bro


---------88:57----------
i don't know i don't know i don't know


---------89:00----------
do you feel embarrassed


---------89:02----------
no i don't feel embarrassed i really


---------89:03----------
feel like wow like that makes a lot of


---------89:05----------
sense


---------89:06----------
and i also feel like


---------89:09----------
that a lot of i i think of


---------89:12----------
when i s when i see how i put this


---------89:20----------
it only makes me think more like wow


---------89:22----------
like when i when i see


---------89:24----------
people you know who are also on here


---------89:27----------
defending their favorite


---------89:28----------
whoever it is whether it's a musician or


---------89:31----------
a streamer


---------89:32----------
athlete whatever they must have some


---------89:34----------
kind of feeling of like


---------89:35----------
that same thing that you said like i


---------89:37----------
don't want like i'll be here to support


---------89:39----------
you you know because they felt


---------89:41----------
than not having support yep before


---------89:44----------
and i think that's why you know that's


---------89:47----------
why there's a lot of


---------89:50----------
i don't know like fans of


---------89:53----------
whatever um and you see a lot of people


---------89:56----------
defending and


---------89:56----------
you see like die hard you know accounts


---------90:00----------
like people defending people to the to


---------90:03----------
the end


---------90:03----------
you know because i think you might be


---------90:06----------
right i think that's like i think a lot


---------90:08----------
of people feel that same thing that i'm


---------90:09----------
feeling


---------90:10----------
yeah yeah i think i think your community


---------90:13----------
feels it too


---------90:16----------
that's why i think i think certain


---------90:17----------
people yeah they do come to your rescue


---------90:20----------
right


---------90:20----------
they're not going to let lois fight it


---------90:22----------
alone


---------90:23----------
you want to throw down with the twitter


---------90:25----------
trolls we'll throw down with you


---------90:28----------
and i you know there's something else i


---------90:30----------
could bring up too where


---------90:32----------
you know when it's when a typical stream


---------90:34----------
of mine it's it's jokes


---------90:35----------
people trolling but if there's a serious


---------90:38----------
thing going on like if there's like


---------90:40----------
an actual someone trying to come at me


---------90:43----------
or you know like a real thing it's like


---------90:47----------
a


---------90:47----------
a switch gets flipped and every single


---------90:49----------
one of those people


---------90:52----------
a hundred percent has my back and will


---------90:54----------
it literally at


---------90:55----------
like at times it felt like they would


---------90:57----------
like you know take a bullet for me


---------90:59----------
you know what i mean and um


---------91:02----------
so that's why i don't get so like upset


---------91:05----------
to the poor like oh i quit dude i'm done


---------91:07----------
with this


---------91:08----------
because i know that when it's for real


---------91:10----------
like that's what keeps me going is like


---------91:13----------
yeah you like i could be getting trolled


---------91:14----------
today but that's because it's about like


---------91:16----------
what like it's about like


---------91:17----------
basketball stats or you know i mean like


---------91:19----------
it's this isn't like an important thing


---------91:22----------
but if it's someone coming at me or


---------91:25----------
trying to threaten me or


---------91:26----------
you know them or like my livelihood or


---------91:28----------
something like that


---------91:30----------
i have all the support um


---------91:33----------
i think that's what's going to have


---------91:36----------
people believe in you


---------91:39----------
oh man i mean and i'm sure you could you


---------91:42----------
know this too like this


---------91:44----------
is like it's a it's an amazing feeling


---------91:46----------
it's an amazing feeling


---------91:48----------
um and it's it's a feeling i would love


---------91:51----------
to have all the time but i just


---------91:54----------
you know the way


---------91:58----------
my streams are and it's a lot it's a lot


---------92:00----------
about joking around and


---------92:02----------
and stuff there's going to be a lot of


---------92:04----------
trolling


---------92:06----------
and when there's trolling stuff can go


---------92:08----------
too far


---------92:09----------
and uh you know


---------92:13----------
it can get it can get taken too far and


---------92:16----------
yeah so lois i'm gonna


---------92:19----------
ask you how do you feel right now


---------92:24----------
i feel ugh man i don't know i don't know


---------92:27----------
i feel


---------92:27----------
i feel good i feel weirdly good yeah


---------92:31----------
i feel yeah i feel oddly good for like


---------92:34----------
getting to the bottom of this


---------92:36----------
you know this is what emotional you


---------92:38----------
remember i was telling you


---------92:40----------
like about like sort of dealing with


---------92:42----------
that subconscious emotion that you've


---------92:44----------
packed away


---------92:46----------
yeah this is what it feels like


---------92:50----------
so there's a period of time where you


---------92:51----------
sit with that emotion and it feels


---------92:53----------
really


---------92:54----------
like negative and crappy and it's like


---------92:56----------
actually i've been trying to avoid these


---------92:57----------
feelings


---------92:58----------
and as you work through it you feel the


---------93:01----------
way that you do now


---------93:03----------
which is like not just good but like


---------93:05----------
weirdly good


---------93:07----------
you know you kind of feel like lighter


---------93:09----------
like things are clear like nothing has


---------93:10----------
really changed but you like this is


---------93:12----------
literally what emotional


---------93:14----------
metabolism it's like you're taking like


---------93:17----------
this sandwich and your body is like


---------93:19----------
transforming it into your hair in your


---------93:22----------
blood


---------93:23----------
and your bones and so this is what


---------93:25----------
emotional metabolism looks like


---------93:28----------
yeah it it gives me like a second


---------93:31----------
strength almost or like a second


---------93:33----------
it gives me like


---------93:36----------
it uh i don't know just it boosts me


---------93:39----------
yeah


---------93:40----------
it boosts me yeah good that's what we're


---------93:43----------
here for man


---------93:55----------
what's okay so then i know you're


---------93:58----------
letting me linger


---------93:59----------
oh no i i was just sorry i


---------94:02----------
i mean what now


---------94:07----------
i don't know if it's a what now it's


---------94:08----------
just kind of like i don't want to


---------94:10----------
before we get off this if there's


---------94:11----------
anything else like you wanted


---------94:14----------
you know i don't want to like leave the


---------94:16----------
moment without


---------94:17----------
checking all the boxes yeah sure so


---------94:19----------
let's talk about let's talk about


---------94:21----------
practicalities for a second okay


---------94:23----------
so i think the first thing is like some


---------94:24----------
of the emotional work has already been


---------94:26----------
done


---------94:26----------
so good job i'm glad you're feeling


---------94:28----------
better right so we've talked through


---------94:30----------
some of this stuff


---------94:31----------
you've understood a lot about the


---------94:32----------
connections now how to move forward i'd


---------94:34----------
say the main thing is that like as you


---------94:36----------
kind of just by all means like process


---------94:37----------
like go for a walk or something i highly


---------94:39----------
recommend


---------94:40----------
it's what i do after i stream like if i


---------94:41----------
can i'll just like


---------94:43----------
walk for a little while um and just kind


---------94:45----------
of like digest and


---------94:46----------
and things like that but i think


---------94:49----------
practically


---------94:50----------
you know for you i think the key things


---------94:52----------
to look out for


---------94:54----------
are going to be like this vulnerability


---------94:56----------
or this scar like popping up


---------94:58----------
and the thing is it's not gonna you know


---------95:00----------
the whole point of doing these like


---------95:02----------
realizing stuff is that


---------95:04----------
in your day-to-day experience you didn't


---------95:06----------
recognize that this is what it was


---------95:08----------
but now that you recognize it each time


---------95:10----------
it happens you can work through it a


---------95:12----------
little bit more


---------95:14----------
and it'll actually start to free you


---------95:16----------
from that


---------95:17----------
mood in the same way that like we we


---------95:20----------
actually


---------95:21----------
purposefully brought you to the dark


---------95:23----------
place


---------95:24----------
and then you were sitting in the dark


---------95:25----------
place and now we've taught


---------95:28----------
you how to move from the dark place to


---------95:30----------
this other place


---------95:32----------
not by walling it off but by working


---------95:35----------
through it


---------95:36----------
and each time you do that the dark place


---------95:39----------
gets a little bit smaller and you get


---------95:41----------
better at leaving


---------95:42----------
it so like for me or for maybe other


---------95:44----------
people in the chat


---------95:46----------
if they don't have you to talk to like


---------95:48----------
someone who's


---------95:49----------
clearly professional how do you do that


---------95:53----------
with yourself is there like is it just


---------95:57----------
you know well i mean so because we're


---------96:00----------
kind of bouncing ideas off each other


---------96:02----------
sure well i mean so so there are ways to


---------96:04----------
do it by yourself i don't think they're


---------96:06----------
as effective as working with another


---------96:08----------
human being yeah which is like


---------96:10----------
literally why i don't know if people


---------96:12----------
know this but we have a coaching program


---------96:14----------
at healthy gamer


---------96:15----------
where we have about 60 coaches that i


---------96:18----------
started training in november of 2019


---------96:21----------
and our coaches are awesome and they do


---------96:24----------
this kind of work with people


---------96:26----------
and and i'm also like sort of an


---------96:28----------
academic and and have done a lot of


---------96:30----------
research and stuff


---------96:30----------
so we have like a pretty robust robust


---------96:33----------
research part of our coaching program


---------96:35----------
which um so we test outcomes so we


---------96:38----------
actually do is like we measure


---------96:40----------
the efficacy of our coaches against me


---------96:43----------
actually


---------96:44----------
and what we find is that our coaches are


---------96:45----------
actually pretty good and our outcomes


---------96:47----------
are comparable


---------96:48----------
um okay and you know i'm not going to


---------96:49----------
say that they're me but like


---------96:52----------
it is my belief that if you want to do


---------96:54----------
this work


---------96:55----------
having someone to bounce ideas off of


---------96:59----------
is actually like really really effective


---------97:03----------
now if you want to do it on your own i


---------97:04----------
think this is where like developing a


---------97:06----------
good meditation practice


---------97:08----------
or doing some amount of like reflection


---------97:10----------
and journaling and like just going for


---------97:12----------
walks


---------97:13----------
um you know there are other things that


---------97:15----------
you can do but i in my experience


---------97:18----------
you know meditation and journaling isn't


---------97:20----------
someone


---------97:21----------
like they just they aren't responsive


---------97:23----------
right it's sort of like exactly what you


---------97:24----------
said about youtube versus twitch like


---------97:26----------
what's the difference like both of them


---------97:28----------
have people talking


---------97:30----------
but one platform is like responsive


---------97:33----------
so you move faster than you would on


---------97:35----------
your own


---------97:36----------
yeah so practically like you could go


---------97:39----------
you know meditate like go to a


---------97:40----------
meditation retreat or something like


---------97:42----------
that but like the whole reason that we


---------97:43----------
developed the coaching program is


---------97:44----------
because


---------97:45----------
i you know i know i'm good and all but


---------97:47----------
like frankly like


---------97:49----------
what i do can be taught right and that's


---------97:52----------
what we set out to do is to train 60


---------97:54----------
other people


---------97:55----------
we've helped about 2 000 people from the


---------97:57----------
twitch community at this point


---------97:59----------
and you know you know and so i think


---------98:02----------
that like you don't have to do it alone


---------98:03----------
and the answer isn't to do it alone and


---------98:05----------
for you by the way i don't know if you


---------98:06----------
know this but


---------98:07----------
you know twitch actually like if you


---------98:09----------
want to work with a coach


---------98:11----------
um twitch is sponsoring that so you can


---------98:14----------
assuming you're partnered um yeah


---------98:17----------
but so we have a coaching program where


---------98:19----------
we support our creators


---------98:21----------
around creator specific issues so like


---------98:24----------
these things about like you know


---------98:26----------
having people around you not understand


---------98:28----------
what you're going through and things


---------98:29----------
like that


---------98:30----------
what we've heard from a lot of our


---------98:31----------
creator coaches and and even people in


---------98:33----------
our


---------98:34----------
regular coaching program is that they'll


---------98:35----------
actually go see a therapist


---------98:38----------
but the therapist doesn't understand


---------98:42----------
that's yeah um but


---------98:45----------
you know i yeah lois i think that like


---------98:49----------
you can do it on your own i just i mean


---------98:51----------
the reason that we do this is


---------98:52----------
because i think it's more that's why


---------98:53----------
this is so good and it's just so


---------98:55----------
interesting


---------98:56----------
what you do because it's so unique


---------98:59----------
because you understand twitch like you


---------99:01----------
you're a streamer like


---------99:03----------
yeah so it's a really like you have the


---------99:06----------
perspective


---------99:07----------
um so when when i do bring up things


---------99:10----------
about dmc


---------99:11----------
this isn't like foreign language to you


---------99:14----------
so yeah no i i i appreciate what you're


---------99:16----------
doing i i like i said i


---------99:18----------
watched the show many times and i think


---------99:21----------
uh all you guys in the chat should


---------99:22----------
follow if you're not already followed


---------99:23----------
but


---------99:24----------
yeah i uh yeah no that's that sounds


---------99:27----------
like a great idea


---------99:28----------
sounds great with the coaching are you


---------99:30----------
interested in learning a little bit


---------99:32----------
about meditation i mean you may be


---------99:34----------
experienced or meditate already


---------99:37----------
i've nev i don't think i've ever


---------99:39----------
meditated in my life


---------99:41----------
um i i don't i i


---------99:44----------
might have a slight adhd i'm not


---------99:46----------
diagnosed i don't know


---------99:47----------
but like i'll start reading a book and


---------99:50----------
i'll


---------99:51----------
be like reading the book i'll get to the


---------99:54----------
second page and not know what i just


---------99:56----------
read for an entire


---------99:57----------
like that's kind of level so like when i


---------99:59----------
try to sit there in silence


---------100:01----------
it kind of just you know just ends in


---------100:04----------
like 30 seconds or something


---------100:08----------
are you telling me that you're not good


---------100:09----------
at meditation


---------100:11----------
i i don't i i i don't know i i think


---------100:15----------
i've tried


---------100:16----------
but i it's i believe in you most you


---------100:19----------
believe


---------100:21----------
hey i mean i'll if you have any tips


---------100:24----------
i'll i'll i'll try man


---------100:26----------
you know what i'm hearing this is the


---------100:28----------
first time i'm hearing something


---------100:30----------
from you which is that maybe you don't


---------100:31----------
believe in yourself so i'm going to


---------100:32----------
choose to believe in you


---------100:35----------
and i'm gonna say that no matter how


---------100:36----------
adhd you are i think you can learn how


---------100:38----------
to meditate


---------100:40----------
okay have you been taught how to


---------100:42----------
meditate


---------100:44----------
um no okay


---------100:48----------
probably not properly no so this is


---------100:50----------
where like i'm i'm


---------100:51----------
asking you lois do you know how to ride


---------100:53----------
a bike and you're like well i'm not so


---------100:54----------
sure


---------100:55----------
my balance isn't so good i'm like you've


---------100:57----------
ever been did anyone teach you how to


---------100:58----------
ride a bike you're like not really and


---------101:00----------
then i'm like well


---------101:02----------
that makes it makes sense so so i think


---------101:04----------
it's fine if you're a little bit adhd


---------101:06----------
so i'm going to give you a choice okay


---------101:08----------
and what we can also do is try two


---------101:10----------
techniques


---------101:10----------
if you want to today i'm going to give


---------101:12----------
you a choice one


---------101:14----------
is going to be sort of like an


---------101:15----------
introductory technique that'll get you a


---------101:17----------
little bit used to meditating


---------101:19----------
maybe address a little bit of your


---------101:20----------
adhdness


---------101:22----------
and will help in the moment


---------101:26----------
it kind of calming your mind down and


---------101:29----------
um also like letting go of a little bit


---------101:33----------
of that anger and frustration


---------101:35----------
so you know like when you're in those


---------101:37----------
moods where things are bothering you


---------101:40----------
my hope is that this technique will sort


---------101:42----------
of like


---------101:43----------
almost like a tiny little xanax just


---------101:46----------
like


---------101:47----------
change your mood okay that's one


---------101:50----------
technique


---------101:51----------
the second technique that i would offer


---------101:53----------
you is a little bit more long-term


---------101:56----------
so it's not really about calming you


---------101:58----------
down in the moment


---------101:59----------
it's a technique that you can do on a


---------102:01----------
regular basis when you are relatively


---------102:03----------
calm


---------102:04----------
that will help the process of this


---------102:07----------
emotional digestion


---------102:08----------
of this scar that you have which one do


---------102:11----------
you want


---------102:14----------
let's let's do the let's start with uh


---------102:18----------
when when i need to meditate like when i


---------102:21----------
when i'm feeling like


---------102:23----------
i need to calm down yeah good okay so um


---------102:26----------
so what i want you to do is sit up


---------102:28----------
straight


---------102:30----------
okay now i'm going to teach you


---------102:34----------
a a technique that we do a fair amount


---------102:36----------
on stream which is alternate nostril


---------102:38----------
breathing which is going to sound kind


---------102:39----------
of weird but basically


---------102:41----------
what we're gonna do is we're gonna block


---------102:43----------
one nostril


---------102:45----------
and breathe in through the other nostril


---------102:48----------
okay and and then i'll show you so i'm


---------102:50----------
gonna breathe in through this nostril


---------102:52----------
and then we're gonna block the other


---------102:53----------
nostril and we're gonna breathe out


---------102:55----------
through the other one


---------102:57----------
okay so i know it sounds kind of weird


---------103:00----------
and then what we're gonna do is breathe


---------103:01----------
in through this one


---------103:03----------
switch back and then breathe out so it's


---------103:06----------
gonna be in


---------103:09----------
out in switch


---------103:13----------
out in switch out


---------103:17----------
in switch out so it's like half of the


---------103:20----------
breath


---------103:21----------
gets done through each nostril


---------103:24----------
okay okay so let me just show you okay


---------103:26----------
so i'm gonna


---------103:27----------
block my right nostril breathe in


---------103:32----------
now switch and breathe out


---------103:39----------
in through the same nostril


---------103:44----------
switch and out


---------103:49----------
in through the same nostril


---------103:54----------
switch out


---------104:00----------
in


---------104:05----------
good out


---------104:09----------
in


---------104:13----------
switch out


---------104:19----------
in


---------104:22----------
switch out beautiful now continue


---------104:26----------
your own pace for about 60 seconds


---------104:29----------
i'll tell you when to stop


---------105:00----------
she's


---------105:14----------
my


---------105:28----------
do


---------105:34----------
is am i hypnotized right now i don't


---------105:36----------
know what's happening


---------105:37----------
what do you mean i just like i could


---------105:40----------
have just fell asleep i'm not gonna lie


---------105:43----------
could have just fallen asleep


---------105:49----------
what were you thinking about i was just


---------105:54----------
completely calm i was very calming


---------105:59----------
sounds like you meditated wow


---------106:02----------
wow


---------106:06----------
it's that it's that wow


---------106:09----------
so i don't have to sit there like with


---------106:11----------
my hand like


---------106:14----------
in a pretzel okay


---------106:19----------
no i believe in you loss


---------106:27----------
wow i appreciate it that was


---------106:30----------
is it is it so like the science behind


---------106:33----------
is it like the focusing on what you're


---------106:34----------
doing


---------106:36----------
where like you can't even focus anything


---------106:38----------
else you're just focusing on how you're


---------106:39----------
breathing like hot


---------106:41----------
is that that's pretty okay yeah exactly


---------106:45----------
look at how quickly you figured it out


---------106:46----------
so


---------106:48----------
a little bit explanation okay


---------106:54----------
i was just surprised because no one no


---------106:55----------
one's ever


---------106:57----------
stopped and been had that profound of an


---------106:59----------
effect like that quickly it was like wow


---------107:01----------
okay


---------107:01----------
so cool um so it seems like it really


---------107:04----------
worked for you which means we found a


---------107:05----------
good technique for you good job


---------107:07----------
so a couple of things about the science


---------107:09----------
of meditation the first is that


---------107:11----------
meditating successfully is not


---------107:13----------
contorting yourself


---------107:15----------
into a particular meditation technique


---------107:18----------
it's finding the right kind of


---------107:19----------
meditation technique


---------107:21----------
for your mind okay so you told me that


---------107:24----------
you were a little bit like


---------107:26----------
distractible just to touch adhd


---------107:29----------
so the meditation that technique that's


---------107:30----------
gonna work for you


---------107:32----------
is one that demands some of your


---------107:35----------
attention


---------107:37----------
okay so it's like it's like a little bit


---------107:38----------
tricky to keep track


---------107:40----------
right it's not like so hard but you


---------107:43----------
gotta like


---------107:44----------
focus on it yeah right it doesn't happen


---------107:47----------
on autopilot


---------107:48----------
and when you demand the attention of


---------107:50----------
your mind on one particular thing


---------107:54----------
it sort of there's no room for other


---------107:56----------
thoughts


---------107:58----------
so remember your problem is that you're


---------107:59----------
carrying around all of this stuff


---------108:01----------
and you don't have room for anything


---------108:03----------
else so when you do this technique


---------108:05----------
what your mind automatically has to do


---------108:09----------
is put everything else down


---------108:12----------
yeah and when you put everything else


---------108:14----------
down


---------108:15----------
you're like whoa i feel calm


---------108:18----------
because subconsciously you're carrying


---------108:20----------
all this stuff around


---------108:22----------
and then like you basically do this


---------108:24----------
technique and your mind


---------108:25----------
sets like just imagine like hiking with


---------108:27----------
this like 50 pound backpack


---------108:29----------
and for 60 seconds you set the backpack


---------108:31----------
down you're like whoa i could have


---------108:32----------
fallen asleep


---------108:34----------
so why is it that and maybe some people


---------108:37----------
can but


---------108:38----------
i haven't figured out how to do this why


---------108:40----------
is it that i can't just


---------108:41----------
do that like why can't i just sit down


---------108:45----------
take a


---------108:46----------
take a deep breath and just not have a


---------108:48----------
care like why


---------108:50----------
because you haven't been taught how


---------108:53----------
okay okay short answer


---------108:57----------
simple answer you know i just put you on


---------109:00----------
a bike


---------109:00----------
i held it a little bit and you started


---------109:02----------
pedaling and you're like


---------109:03----------
why can't everyone just ride bikes it's


---------109:05----------
because you need to


---------109:07----------
be taught okay right this is naturally


---------109:10----------
is just


---------109:11----------
can wipe their mind like that's


---------109:15----------
arguably there may be people out there


---------109:18----------
who


---------109:19----------
are more you know better at that like


---------109:21----------
there are some


---------109:22----------
depending on which tradition you you


---------109:24----------
kind of like listen to like


---------109:26----------
some people think that the dalai lama


---------109:28----------
for example is essentially born like


---------109:30----------
pseudo-enlightened


---------109:31----------
and so there may be like three-year-olds


---------109:33----------
that can do this i don't really know


---------109:35----------
but you know i think that this is like


---------109:38----------
like


---------109:39----------
los this is a skill that you can acquire


---------109:43----------
right and this is why when people like


---------109:45----------
meditate on a regular basis


---------109:47----------
they become more productive they become


---------109:49----------
happier


---------109:51----------
you know i think i just need a medic i


---------109:54----------
think yeah i think i just need to


---------109:55----------
learn how to meditate yeah well now you


---------109:58----------
know


---------109:58----------
so the next challenge for you is going


---------110:00----------
to be anchoring your practice so that


---------110:02----------
you do it on a regular basis


---------110:05----------
right so i'd say three to five minutes


---------110:07----------
three days a week


---------110:08----------
is your first goal eventually if you can


---------110:11----------
work your way up to 20 minutes


---------110:13----------
that's where the research shows that


---------110:15----------
your brain will literally start to


---------110:17----------
rewire itself


---------110:19----------
and you'll learn how to do things like


---------110:20----------
let go like your brain will be more


---------110:23----------
automatic


---------110:24----------
it's going to be bizarre i'm telling you


---------110:26----------
you're going to be


---------110:27----------
in one of these episodes where you're


---------110:28----------
pissed off and then some part of your


---------110:30----------
brain is like


---------110:31----------
whoa take a deep breath it's not that


---------110:34----------
big of a deal


---------110:35----------
these are the things that you already


---------110:36----------
tell yourself they're just gonna start


---------110:38----------
working


---------110:40----------
and that's because your neurons are


---------110:42----------
gonna change


---------110:44----------
and they're gonna be capable of letting


---------110:46----------
things go


---------110:48----------
okay you're gonna practice putting down


---------110:51----------
the backpack


---------110:52----------
over and over and over again for three


---------110:54----------
to five minutes a day


---------110:55----------
three days a week and then you're gonna


---------110:58----------
learn how to put down the backpack


---------111:00----------
yeah before i wrote this down i don't


---------111:04----------
this is


---------111:05----------
really i don't know this yeah it's kind


---------111:06----------
of on topic


---------111:08----------
um but no i guess it has to do with some


---------111:11----------
sort of meditation


---------111:13----------
it do you um do


---------111:16----------
can people get hypnotized is that is


---------111:20----------
hypnosis a thing


---------111:21----------
it does have anything to do with any


---------111:23----------
kind of practice or is that just


---------111:25----------
like a myth no no so hypnotism is real


---------111:29----------
so so so hypnotism is like it's the


---------111:33----------
answer is yes people can get hypnotized


---------111:35----------
so here's what the science says about


---------111:37----------
hypnosis


---------111:38----------
so the first is that there's a wide


---------111:40----------
variety of susceptibility to hypnosis


---------111:44----------
okay so some people are more likely to


---------111:46----------
become hypnotized than others


---------111:48----------
willingness to become hypnotized is a


---------111:51----------
big


---------111:51----------
part of whether hypnosis is successful


---------111:54----------
or not


---------111:56----------
so i don't think you can like i've never


---------111:59----------
seen any convincing scientific evidence


---------112:01----------
that you can like mind control someone


---------112:03----------
through hypnosis


---------112:06----------
but essentially yeah that's why i didn't


---------112:07----------
even want to ask because i'm like


---------112:08----------
alright this probably sounds really dumb


---------112:09----------
so


---------112:10----------
okay yeah hey like dude i think it's


---------112:13----------
like one of my favorite questions i've


---------112:14----------
ever gotten on stream


---------112:16----------
exactly okay so so and if we think about


---------112:18----------
it you know how does hypnosis work


---------112:21----------
yeah this is where uh it's kind of i


---------112:23----------
mean i can explain this in a second but


---------112:25----------
in a couple of seconds but if we think


---------112:26----------
about studying okay so like let's say


---------112:28----------
i'm trying to study


---------112:30----------
depending on how much activity there is


---------112:32----------
in my conscious mind


---------112:35----------
okay let me just let's take a step back


---------112:36----------
so when i talk about studying let's


---------112:38----------
think about what that means i read


---------112:39----------
something


---------112:40----------
i think about it actively for a second


---------112:43----------
and then what i want to do is take that


---------112:45----------
information and implant it into my


---------112:48----------
unconscious mind


---------112:49----------
so after i'm done at the library i close


---------112:51----------
the book i go hang out with my friends i


---------112:53----------
play some games


---------112:54----------
the next day i have my test i'm not


---------112:55----------
thinking about whatever i studied right


---------112:57----------
i'm just living my life


---------112:58----------
i see a question on the test and then


---------113:01----------
poof out of my unconscious mind


---------113:03----------
comes the answer does that make sense


---------113:06----------
like when i read the question that's


---------113:07----------
when the answer comes into my conscious


---------113:09----------
mind


---------113:09----------
this might be a whole different problem


---------113:11----------
but i'm sure that makes sense to a lot


---------113:12----------
of people


---------113:13----------
me i always had some sort of problem


---------113:16----------
studying but that's


---------113:18----------
that's probably completely yeah so so


---------113:21----------
it's on topic because we'll talk about


---------113:23----------
why you had a problem studying in a


---------113:24----------
second


---------113:25----------
i'm saying theoretically if we think


---------113:27----------
about it like when i study something


---------113:30----------
i'm actively thinking about it and then


---------113:32----------
my hope is that the active thinking will


---------113:34----------
like get stored


---------113:36----------
on my hard drive and then like later on


---------113:40----------
that information can be recalled and


---------113:42----------
pulled up that's the goal of studying


---------113:44----------
right


---------113:45----------
yeah so if we think about it we have our


---------113:47----------
conscious mind where we're thinking


---------113:48----------
and we have our unconscious mind where


---------113:51----------
like our thought like


---------113:52----------
all our knowledge is stored so then the


---------113:56----------
next thing


---------113:56----------
is that what are the ways in which we


---------113:58----------
can implant things into our unconscious


---------114:00----------
mind if i try to study and my mind is


---------114:02----------
distracted


---------114:03----------
how much do you learn


---------114:08----------
not at all right exactly and so if your


---------114:11----------
mind is super calm how easy is it to


---------114:14----------
study


---------114:17----------
if your mind is clear yeah it's so much


---------114:20----------
easier to put things in there


---------114:21----------
exactly so let's think about what


---------114:23----------
hypnosis is


---------114:25----------
hypnosis is a technique to intentionally


---------114:29----------
and quickly


---------114:30----------
completely calm that conscious layer of


---------114:33----------
mind


---------114:33----------
so that you can stick something into the


---------114:35----------
unconscious


---------114:37----------
and then once it's stuck in the


---------114:39----------
unconscious it starts to like


---------114:40----------
work automatically right so when people


---------114:43----------
get hypnotized


---------114:44----------
you like tell them something like oh


---------114:47----------
you're now


---------114:48----------
a woman who's late for a work


---------114:50----------
appointment


---------114:52----------
and then like when they wake up their


---------114:54----------
unconscious mind is like


---------114:56----------
pushing thoughts into their conscious


---------114:58----------
mind oh my god i'm late for my


---------114:59----------
appointment and i'm a woman


---------115:01----------
and then they start freaking out and


---------115:02----------
everyone on stage like laughs and it's


---------115:04----------
really funny and they got hypnotized and


---------115:06----------
thinking that they were a woman


---------115:07----------
and then the hypnotist is like when i


---------115:08----------
snap my fingers you'll be back to who


---------115:10----------
you are and they snap their fingers and


---------115:11----------
they kind of back to who they are


---------115:13----------
so like in your opinion that's a real


---------115:15----------
thing that happens people do that's not


---------115:16----------
a magic trick


---------115:17----------
no it's not a magic trick it's just


---------115:19----------
there's a wide variety there's a wide


---------115:21----------
range of hip


---------115:22----------
like hypnotic suggestibility and people


---------115:25----------
use hypnosis


---------115:26----------
in therapy a fair amount right so like


---------115:29----------
if you look at like where is hypnosis


---------115:31----------
actually used in a way that is not a


---------115:33----------
stage performance


---------115:35----------
there are hypnotherapists and the goal


---------115:37----------
of hypnotherapy


---------115:38----------
is to calm down that that surface level


---------115:41----------
mind so that you can access things


---------115:43----------
like repressed memories and like things


---------115:46----------
like that


---------115:46----------
i mean i do that in sort of a slightly


---------115:48----------
different way whereas like i ask you


---------115:50----------
leading questions


---------115:52----------
and i know like i sniff something out


---------115:54----------
and i'll ask you a question and then


---------115:55----------
like


---------115:56----------
just think about this conversation go


---------115:57----------
back and watch it some random story pops


---------116:00----------
into your head


---------116:01----------
and then another random story pops into


---------116:02----------
your head right like where do those


---------116:04----------
stories come from


---------116:05----------
like they've always been buried in your


---------116:07----------
subconscious we're just bringing them


---------116:09----------
out in sort of an intentional way


---------116:11----------
and so it's still like hypnotism just


---------116:13----------
sort of like


---------116:15----------
you know if i had hypnotized you and


---------116:16----------
then asked you particular questions


---------116:18----------
maybe you would have like other


---------116:20----------
like less defended things like even on


---------116:22----------
stream you're probably like a little bit


---------116:25----------
you know you talked about going deep so


---------116:26----------
the purpose of hypnotism


---------116:28----------
is to help people go deep faster okay


---------116:32----------
yeah and there's a lot of like


---------116:35----------
similarities but a couple of key


---------116:37----------
important differences from the


---------116:39----------
meditative state of mind and the


---------116:40----------
hypnotic state of mind i frankly think


---------116:43----------
that meditation is just essentially


---------116:44----------
superior like i think it's more


---------116:46----------
consistent


---------116:47----------
more people can do it there's less


---------116:48----------
variability and it leads to there's more


---------116:50----------
data that suggests that it's like


---------116:52----------
more helpful than hypnotism yeah


---------116:55----------
yeah i've heard of so many people


---------116:58----------
talking about


---------116:59----------
uh meditating i i mean i have a


---------117:01----------
grandmother who


---------117:02----------
always like tells me i should be


---------117:04----------
meditating and i just i'm like okay


---------117:06----------
yeah grandma like you know i mean like


---------117:08----------
but it's kind of like


---------117:10----------
i you know this actually helps people


---------117:14----------
i just have been i don't know i've been


---------117:16----------
i've been lazy


---------117:17----------
or i don't know no no maybe i just


---------117:19----------
didn't want to look into it i don't know


---------117:21----------
no no no no listen listen lois you just


---------117:24----------
have never had the opportunity to learn


---------117:27----------
okay yeah that's it's as simple as that


---------117:30----------
you're not you didn't you're not lazy or


---------117:33----------
anything it's just like


---------117:34----------
like it's kind of weird because everyone


---------117:36----------
just talks about meditation but like no


---------117:38----------
one


---------117:38----------
teaches it to you it's like man like


---------117:40----------
i've seen people riding bikes all the


---------117:41----------
time people


---------117:42----------
wake up when they're 26 and they're like


---------117:44----------
you know what i'm gonna learn how to


---------117:45----------
ride a bike


---------117:46----------
yeah like that person isn't lazy it's


---------117:48----------
just like you gotta give someone a bike


---------117:49----------
and you gotta be like hey man you want


---------117:51----------
to like hop on this bike and learn how


---------117:52----------
to ride


---------117:53----------
and then you're like it was like kind of


---------117:55----------
ignorance on my partner just not


---------117:57----------
knowing that oh you had to learn like i


---------117:59----------
i just thought it's just like


---------118:01----------
yeah okay so yeah yeah


---------118:04----------

---------118:07----------

a lot of the things that you talked


---------119:07----------
about


---------119:07----------
you know hopefully a lot of our


---------119:09----------
community can resonate with


---------119:11----------
in terms of building walls you know like


---------119:14----------
believing in yourself and not having


---------119:16----------
other people believe in you i think


---------119:17----------
those are really common themes that


---------119:18----------
people struggle with


---------119:20----------
