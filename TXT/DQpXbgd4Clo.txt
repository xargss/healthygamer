---------00:00----------
all right


---------00:00----------
so let's talk about


---------00:03----------
adhd and parenting so chat question


---------00:05----------
number one what is the relationship


---------00:07----------
between adhd and parenting


---------00:13----------
so let me put it to you this way


---------00:16----------
okay


---------00:18----------
so if i have adhd


---------00:21----------
if child has adhd


---------00:25----------
what effect does that have on the parent


---------00:30----------
and if


---------00:32----------
a parent


---------00:36----------
has a particular style


---------00:40----------
does that affect


---------00:42----------
the adhd in the kid


---------00:45----------
right these are kind of the two


---------00:47----------
questions so like what's the


---------00:48----------
relationship between adhd and parenting


---------00:51----------
and the reason that we're going to talk


---------00:52----------
about this today is because i think that


---------00:55----------
when we think about illnesses


---------00:57----------
we tend to think about them in isolation


---------01:00----------
but the interesting thing is that


---------01:02----------
they're not really isolated right so


---------01:04----------
there's a lot about adhd and people


---------01:05----------
y'all may be surprised by sort of what


---------01:07----------
we discover we're going to cover a lot


---------01:08----------
of different literature today


---------01:10----------
but it's really challenging for parents


---------01:13----------
to have a child with adhd so i think


---------01:15----------
this is something that is like under


---------01:18----------
appreciated that like how hard it is to


---------01:21----------
be a parent with a child with adhd and


---------01:23----------
on the flip side how hard it is to be a


---------01:26----------
child with adhd


---------01:29----------
who has a parent that doesn't understand


---------01:31----------
what your needs and cognitive like


---------01:34----------
limitations or cognitive preferences are


---------01:37----------
and how that can lead to a lot of


---------01:38----------
negative impacts in the household


---------01:41----------
so we're going to start off by so the


---------01:43----------
goal of today's lecture is to just


---------01:45----------
explore the relationship between adhd


---------01:48----------
and parenting okay


---------01:50----------
so we're going to start off by kind of


---------01:51----------
defining adhd so sure there's like the


---------01:53----------
dsm the diagnostic and statistical


---------01:55----------
manual there's things like the icd-11


---------01:57----------
we're not going to worry about that kind


---------01:58----------
of stuff


---------01:59----------
okay so what we're going to talk about


---------02:01----------
is like practically what is adhd like


---------02:03----------
how do you know if you have it if you're


---------02:05----------
a parent out there what are the signs


---------02:07----------
that you're going to see in your child


---------02:08----------
that should make you think a little bit


---------02:09----------
about adhd and even if they don't have a


---------02:12----------
clear diagnosis of it if they have these


---------02:14----------
tendencies


---------02:16----------
then it may be worthwhile to like


---------02:18----------
understand some of the stuff later in


---------02:19----------
the lecture even without a diagnosis


---------02:21----------
right so remember that adhd is attention


---------02:24----------
is a spectrum


---------02:26----------
right so we have like a spectrum of


---------02:27----------
attention


---------02:28----------
and so wow that's a terrible bell curve


---------02:31----------
so let me just fix that


---------02:36----------
and so even though like we may say that


---------02:38----------
if your attention is in this area this


---------02:40----------
is what we qualify as clinical adhd if


---------02:43----------
your child is within this window


---------02:46----------
we still can you know this lecture is


---------02:49----------
still going to be useful for people over


---------02:51----------
here the other thing that's going to be


---------02:52----------
kind of interesting is a lot of stuff


---------02:54----------
that we're talking about even if you're


---------02:55----------
not a parent but if you have a


---------02:57----------
significant other who has adhd a lot of


---------02:59----------
stuff that we're going to be talking


---------03:00----------
about today will be like really relevant


---------03:02----------
so if you're up if your partner has adhd


---------03:04----------
and you're trying to figure out okay


---------03:06----------
like how should i like interact with


---------03:07----------
them how should i relate to them what


---------03:09----------
should be the home environment like


---------03:11----------
there are things like that that are


---------03:12----------
actually really important


---------03:14----------
the flip side of this is that if you are


---------03:15----------
someone with adhd you may find that


---------03:18----------
there are a lot of problems in your


---------03:19----------
relationship that have to do with some


---------03:21----------
of the stuff that we talk about today so


---------03:23----------
you can even have you can be the person


---------03:25----------
with adhd and you can have a


---------03:26----------
conversation with your parents you can


---------03:28----------
have a conversation with your


---------03:29----------
significant other about like some of the


---------03:31----------
things that's a little bit different um


---------03:33----------
in your mind and kind of how you work


---------03:34----------
and stuff like that and how can y'all as


---------03:37----------
people in a relationship whether it's a


---------03:38----------
parent-child relationship or a


---------03:40----------
non-parent child relationship platonic


---------03:42----------
relationship romantic relationship how


---------03:44----------
can you understand some of these things


---------03:45----------
to improve the quality of relationship


---------03:48----------
so let's start with like what is adhd so


---------03:51----------
adhd i kind of think about is


---------03:52----------
attentional problems


---------03:55----------
and what do i mean by that


---------03:57----------
so people with adhd oftentimes have


---------03:59----------
distracted attention


---------04:02----------
but what trips a lot of parents up or


---------04:04----------
people in terms of self-diagnosis and


---------04:06----------
all that good stuff


---------04:07----------
is that parents will see their kid and


---------04:09----------
they can like do something


---------04:13----------
for


---------04:14----------
hours


---------04:16----------
without interruption


---------04:19----------
right and so what what a parent will do


---------04:21----------
is they'll look at their kid and they'll


---------04:22----------
say oh well like


---------04:24----------
you know sure they get distracted easily


---------04:26----------
and they may have difficulty at school


---------04:27----------
but like if you give them their


---------04:29----------
particular book or if they're playing


---------04:30----------
with legos or they're using an ipad or


---------04:33----------
like whatever they can do this for hours


---------04:35----------
and hours and hours without interruption


---------04:37----------
so remember that adhd is disordered


---------04:39----------
attention it doesn't necessarily mean a


---------04:42----------
lack of attention it just means


---------04:43----------
disordered attention so what we see in


---------04:46----------
adhd is paradoxically the inability to


---------04:49----------
be interrupted in some cases


---------04:52----------
and very like


---------04:54----------
too easily interrupted in other cases


---------04:56----------
so normally what we want is an attention


---------04:58----------
kind of in here but what we'll find with


---------05:00----------
people with adhd is there are some


---------05:02----------
symptoms at this end of the spectrum


---------05:03----------
where they can't


---------05:05----------
move attention


---------05:08----------
and so the main main kind of common


---------05:10----------
element here is that sometimes our


---------05:11----------
frontal lobes we want to direct our


---------05:13----------
attention in a particular place


---------05:15----------
and people who have adhd their frontal


---------05:17----------
lobes just don't comply as easily so


---------05:20----------
this could be i need to stop doing this


---------05:22----------
and start getting to other stuff


---------05:24----------
or it could be


---------05:27----------
i need to focus on this one thing and


---------05:30----------
stop doing other things right so it's


---------05:32----------
like distraction or inability to to stop


---------05:36----------
doing


---------05:36----------
something so just because your kid is


---------05:39----------
able to play with legos for four hours


---------05:40----------
at a stretch does not mean that they


---------05:42----------
don't have adhd in fact if it is very


---------05:44----------
very hard to get them to stop playing


---------05:46----------
with legos if they cannot control and


---------05:48----------
restrain their attention whether that's


---------05:50----------
from distraction or overly focusing both


---------05:53----------
of those are consistent with adhd okay


---------05:56----------
so there are a couple of other things


---------05:57----------
that are kind of just like


---------05:59----------
common qualities so one is


---------06:01----------
difficulty


---------06:04----------
engaging


---------06:07----------
in academic work


---------06:13----------
difficulty with motivation


---------06:19----------
these are also consistent with adhd so


---------06:22----------
if we think about what is motivation


---------06:23----------
right the motivation is the ability to


---------06:26----------
focus our attention in a particular area


---------06:29----------
for like


---------06:30----------
a significant amount of time right so if


---------06:32----------
i'm motivated to go to the gym what that


---------06:33----------
means is that my attention is going to


---------06:35----------
be like okay like let's go to the gym


---------06:37----------
i'm going to organize things so this is


---------06:38----------
another thing that we're going to get to


---------06:40----------
difficulty with


---------06:44----------
organization


---------06:48----------
all features of adhd


---------06:50----------
right so if you have difficulty getting


---------06:51----------
organized you have difficulty getting


---------06:52----------
motivated um and remember that too


---------06:55----------
motivation is it's not a lack of desire


---------06:58----------
right it's a lack of like being able to


---------07:00----------
organize your thoughts and move towards


---------07:02----------
a particular direction in kind of like a


---------07:05----------
motivated and concerted fashion


---------07:08----------
so if your kid has these kinds of


---------07:10----------
challenges then you may want to consider


---------07:12----------
something along the adhd spectrum so


---------07:14----------
remember that this is sort of a western


---------07:16----------
model but in ayurveda we also have vata


---------07:20----------
right so this is like


---------07:22----------
uh you guys can watch dr k's guide if


---------07:24----------
you don't know what kind about that is


---------07:25----------
for those of you that are familiar with


---------07:26----------
ayurveda and people who are high on the


---------07:28----------
vata spectrum will exhibit signs of adhd


---------07:34----------
right so it's not necessarily that you


---------07:36----------
need a clinical diagnosis but if for


---------07:38----------
example


---------07:39----------
we become more manic if we become you


---------07:41----------
know drink a bunch of caffeine things


---------07:43----------
like that there are all kinds of things


---------07:44----------
that will exacerbate our vata including


---------07:46----------
technology usage and so as arvata


---------07:48----------
exacerbates our attention becomes more


---------07:50----------
flighty


---------07:52----------
so adhd this is another big thing that i


---------07:54----------
think sometimes parents will miss is


---------07:56----------
remember that adhd is not just about


---------07:59----------
school and work and focus it actually


---------08:01----------
manifests socially as well


---------08:05----------
so uh there have been studies that show


---------08:07----------
that kids with adhd are more likely to


---------08:09----------
be shy and


---------08:10----------
withdrawn now you may ask yourself well


---------08:13----------
why is that like sometimes kids with


---------08:15----------
adhd are shy and withdrawn until they


---------08:18----------
discover being a class clown


---------08:22----------
and now suddenly they know how to become


---------08:23----------
popular so if your your route to


---------08:25----------
popularity is to be the class clown and


---------08:27----------
if you weren't the class clown you


---------08:28----------
wouldn't know how to interact with other


---------08:30----------
people in your in your class then you


---------08:32----------
might have adhd okay


---------08:34----------
so why are they shy and withdrawn so


---------08:36----------
this comes down to oftentimes kids with


---------08:38----------
adhd are neglected by their peers


---------08:42----------
also very very good data supporting this


---------08:44----------
okay


---------08:46----------
and so you may wonder okay well like


---------08:47----------
what's going on there so remember that


---------08:49----------
like if you have attentional problems


---------08:52----------
it's going to be hard for you to attend


---------08:54----------
to social situations read the room as it


---------08:57----------
were right like so you don't know like


---------08:59----------
where people are it may be hard to pay


---------09:01----------
attention to a conversation they may be


---------09:03----------
talking about one thing and because your


---------09:05----------
mind is so flighty you start talking


---------09:07----------
about something else


---------09:08----------
you know so all these kinds of like


---------09:09----------
problems that people with adhd run into


---------09:11----------
in social situations so this tends to


---------09:13----------
lead to social isolation withdrawal they


---------09:15----------
tend to get neglected by peers made fun


---------09:17----------
of the other flip side of this as well


---------09:19----------
is that people with adhd remember that


---------09:21----------
you have disordered attention right so


---------09:23----------
sometimes people with adhd will talk


---------09:25----------
about one thing and they won't like read


---------09:27----------
the room and recognize that people are


---------09:29----------
not interested in that subject so over


---------09:31----------
time people will just be like socially


---------09:33----------
like not too interested in engaging with


---------09:35----------
an adhd kid and it's super sad


---------09:38----------
okay so if your kid has these problems


---------09:40----------
that's another thing to consider


---------09:42----------
so


---------09:43----------
the last thing that i'm just going to


---------09:44----------
kind of touch on


---------09:46----------
is passive non-compliance


---------09:50----------
now this is an example of something that


---------09:51----------
i think is very parent-oriented so you


---------09:54----------
all may not


---------09:55----------
this is not something that if you have


---------09:57----------
adhd you may not really be able to


---------09:59----------
understand this


---------10:00----------
but sometimes when you're a parent you


---------10:02----------
tell your kid what to do


---------10:05----------
and like sometimes they just ignore you


---------10:08----------
like and so this can lead to a lot of


---------10:10----------
frustration on the parents part right so


---------10:12----------
the parent is like hey go put on your


---------10:13----------
shoes like time to put on your shoes and


---------10:15----------
the kid is playing with legos and they


---------10:16----------
just like completely ignore them


---------10:19----------
so then what ends up happening is that


---------10:21----------
the parent like has to raise their voice


---------10:23----------
right so you get like you like hey put


---------10:26----------
on your shoes


---------10:27----------
and so then the kid like snaps out of it


---------10:29----------
and then they kind of like look over you


---------10:30----------
and they're like a little bit alarm but


---------10:32----------
like now they understand so they're


---------10:33----------
gonna like go put on your shoes so


---------10:35----------
what's gonna happen in this case so this


---------10:36----------
is what's called passive non-compliance


---------10:39----------
so kids with adhd don't listen


---------10:44----------
okay


---------10:45----------
and when they don't listen


---------10:47----------
parents can get frustrated


---------10:51----------
and then that frustration


---------10:54----------
leads to


---------10:55----------
a behavioral change


---------11:00----------
like raising your voice


---------11:06----------
and if you do this


---------11:08----------
they listen


---------11:11----------
right


---------11:12----------
so what's going on here


---------11:15----------
so this is a prime example of how adhd


---------11:18----------
shapes parenting which we'll see in a


---------11:19----------
second


---------11:20----------
and in turn the way that adhd shapes


---------11:24----------
parenting style


---------11:25----------
can be damaging to the kid right so this


---------11:28----------
is like in a nutshell like what we're


---------11:30----------
gonna talk about today because now


---------11:32----------
what's happening is you have a parent


---------11:33----------
that's


---------11:34----------
like constantly raising their voice so


---------11:36----------
like now the parent learns like because


---------11:38----------
your brain is learning too that speaking


---------11:40----------
softly and politely does not get my kid


---------11:42----------
to listen and it's time to go and they


---------11:44----------
need to put on their shoes


---------11:45----------
so instead what i'm gonna do is just


---------11:47----------
start barking at my kid all the time


---------11:48----------
because that's what's effective that's


---------11:50----------
what they need to listen


---------11:52----------
the challenge here is that it's not that


---------11:54----------
they're not listening it's that they're


---------11:56----------
not hearing right so this is not


---------11:58----------
defiance so sometimes when you tell your


---------12:00----------
kid to put on your shoes your kid is


---------12:01----------
like no i don't want to i want to finish


---------12:04----------
doing this


---------12:05----------
that's active non-compliance they know


---------12:07----------
what they're doing they don't want to do


---------12:08----------
it they're pushing limits they're


---------12:10----------
testing boundaries


---------12:12----------
whatever you want to call it


---------12:14----------
but with kids with adhd a lot of times


---------12:16----------
they're not attending to your voice


---------12:19----------
so their attention is so focused on what


---------12:21----------
they're doing or so distractible that


---------12:24----------
they literally do not hear and process


---------12:26----------
what you're saying so it's an


---------12:28----------
intentional problem so like and then


---------12:30----------
what happens is the kid gets kind of


---------12:31----------
like confused and starts to feel bad


---------12:33----------
about themselves because mom is always


---------12:35----------
mom or dad is always yelling at me all


---------12:36----------
the time right because like i don't


---------12:38----------
listen


---------12:39----------
and then the parents can also tell the


---------12:40----------
kid like you need to listen like like


---------12:42----------
please listen listen listen listen the


---------12:44----------
kid is like okay i'm going to try to


---------12:46----------
listen i'm going to try to listen i'm


---------12:47----------
going to try to listen but then the


---------12:48----------
problem is like they feel bad because


---------12:50----------
like literally that stimulus is not


---------12:52----------
entering their conscious field their


---------12:54----------
their brain we have these these


---------12:55----------
different kinds of attentional circuits


---------12:57----------
like top-down circuits and bottom-up


---------12:58----------
circuits i won't go into a bunch of


---------13:00----------
detail with this but basically your


---------13:02----------
brain has circuits that like pull your


---------13:04----------
attention towards something so if i'm


---------13:06----------
walking down the street and i see a


---------13:08----------
snake in the middle of the road and i'm


---------13:10----------
having a conversation with my friend


---------13:12----------
even though my attention is on the


---------13:14----------
conversation with my friend there's some


---------13:16----------
signal processing going on with my


---------13:18----------
visual cortex that's like hey wake the f


---------13:20----------
up like stop talking about philosophy


---------13:22----------
and like there's a snake in front of you


---------13:24----------
right so we have all these circuits in


---------13:26----------
our brain that will pull our attention


---------13:27----------
in a particular place so when a kid has


---------13:29----------
adhd we see passive non-compliance


---------13:31----------
because their brain is not attending to


---------13:33----------
the stimuli so they don't actually like


---------13:36----------
know that their parent is trying to get


---------13:37----------
them to do something


---------13:39----------
okay


---------13:40----------
so if you've got a kid who has


---------13:41----------
attentional problems maybe has some


---------13:43----------
social difficulties is a class clown and


---------13:46----------
especially as passive non-compliance you


---------13:48----------
may want to this lecture may apply to


---------13:51----------
you okay


---------13:52----------
so now let's kind of move on so what


---------13:54----------
impact let's go back to our original two


---------13:56----------
questions okay


---------14:03----------
so


---------14:04----------
now we're going to talk a little bit


---------14:05----------
about


---------14:08----------
you know if a child has adhd what impact


---------14:10----------
does it have on parenting and if a


---------14:12----------
parent has a particular style what


---------14:14----------
impact does that have on adhd


---------14:16----------
so as we sort of already illustrated


---------14:18----------
through our example there is actually a


---------14:20----------
reciprocal impact so what we see with


---------14:23----------
parents and kids


---------14:25----------
is that when you're a parent


---------14:28----------
you will learn certain coping mechanisms


---------14:30----------
to get your child to do what they're


---------14:32----------
supposed to do and that unfortunately a


---------14:34----------
lot of times those coping mechanisms are


---------14:36----------
actually somewhat harmful in the long


---------14:38----------
term and this is what we sort of


---------14:42----------
see this is what the literature kind of


---------14:44----------
bears out


---------14:46----------
so


---------14:47----------
a couple of interesting tidbits so adhd


---------14:49----------
in the kid


---------14:50----------
predicts


---------14:52----------
family stress


---------14:57----------
and even


---------14:59----------
parental depression


---------15:04----------
so parents of kids with adhd are more


---------15:07----------
likely to be stressed out and even like


---------15:09----------
effects like their


---------15:11----------
how depressed they are okay


---------15:13----------
we also know that


---------15:16----------
the severity of adhd


---------15:18----------
affects


---------15:20----------
the parenting style


---------15:26----------
of parents


---------15:28----------
so this is the way in which the parents


---------15:30----------
interact with the kids and we'll talk


---------15:31----------
about this in a second


---------15:33----------
and in turn we also find this that the


---------15:35----------
parenting


---------15:38----------
style affects


---------15:41----------
severity


---------15:44----------
of adhd


---------15:47----------
so what we tend to see is a reciprocal


---------15:50----------
kind of like bi-directional relationship


---------15:53----------
that tends to get worse over time until


---------15:55----------
people figure out what they're supposed


---------15:56----------
to do right the good news is that all


---------15:58----------
this can be fixed


---------16:00----------
so essentially what we see is like adhd


---------16:03----------
leads to bad parenting


---------16:06----------
and i recognize that that's kind of


---------16:07----------
judgmental and stuff but i'll we'll go


---------16:09----------
into more detail in a second and then


---------16:11----------
bad parenting actually makes adhd worse


---------16:14----------
and then this kind of becomes a loop


---------16:19----------
and eventually


---------16:21----------
you know just gets worse and worse and


---------16:22----------
worse and worse and worse to the point


---------16:24----------
where we can even make predictions about


---------16:26----------
college performance


---------16:28----------
based on the like how things were at


---------16:30----------
home


---------16:31----------
so like this actually has been measured


---------16:33----------
in things like grades and stuff like


---------16:35----------
that like even at the college level


---------16:38----------
so let's talk a little bit about what


---------16:39----------
are the different parenting styles


---------16:41----------
there's been a bunch of research on this


---------16:44----------
and we're going to go over four


---------16:46----------
parenting styles


---------16:48----------
okay


---------16:49----------
so one the first one is authoritarian


---------16:54----------
second one is authoritative


---------16:59----------
third one is permissive


---------17:05----------
and fourth one is i think overprotective


---------17:07----------
that's the right yeah


---------17:11----------
okay


---------17:12----------
so


---------17:13----------
what are the ways in which we understand


---------17:15----------
these parenting styles so one is going


---------17:16----------
to be


---------17:19----------
control


---------17:23----------
one is gonna be warmth


---------17:26----------
and then we'll just like general notes


---------17:29----------
okay i'm not gonna fill up this section


---------17:31----------
too much but this is where a lot of what


---------17:33----------
i'll talk about


---------17:34----------
so authoritarian parents have a high


---------17:37----------
degree of control


---------17:40----------
actually


---------17:41----------
just use a symbol


---------17:43----------
so let's just say


---------17:45----------
high degree of control and low degree of


---------17:47----------
warmth so these are parents that are


---------17:49----------
like harsh they're involved in your life


---------17:52----------
they're like paying attention to what


---------17:54----------
you do and things like that they're


---------17:55----------
gonna make sure you're studying on time


---------17:57----------
things like that


---------17:58----------
um


---------17:59----------
you know but they're not going to be


---------18:01----------
like


---------18:02----------
warm and supportive so these parents


---------18:05----------
tend to be controlling


---------18:07----------
and punitive


---------18:09----------
if you don't do this this is going to


---------18:11----------
happen


---------18:12----------
you need to do this or else this is


---------18:14----------
gonna happen you have not demonstrated


---------18:16----------
to me that you can handle this so i'm


---------18:18----------
gonna do it for you


---------18:19----------
right like actions and consequences like


---------18:22----------
there's like you know they're gonna


---------18:23----------
teach you like how life works


---------18:26----------
okay


---------18:27----------
so authoritarian parenting styles lead


---------18:30----------
to worsening of adhd symptoms


---------18:33----------
adhd symptoms lead to more authoritarian


---------18:37----------
parenting styles right so like let's


---------18:39----------
just talk about this for a second or


---------18:40----------
think about this for a second


---------18:42----------
so if i have a kid who doesn't listen


---------18:44----------
what i have to end up doing


---------18:46----------
is like be harsh with them to get them


---------18:49----------
to listen


---------18:50----------
so like if if my kid is like playing


---------18:52----------
with legos and i tell them to put on the


---------18:53----------
shoes and like they're not putting on


---------18:55----------
shoes and like i'm like oh sweet darling


---------18:57----------
sweet child oh my goodness baby it's


---------18:59----------
time to put on your shoes love come on


---------19:02----------
darling like let's let's go put on our


---------19:03----------
shoes and the kid is like going to


---------19:04----------
continue playing legos


---------19:06----------
and so i'm like hey


---------19:07----------
it's time to put on shoes


---------19:09----------
right and so the kid feels a little bit


---------19:11----------
hurt


---------19:12----------
and then they start crying and then like


---------19:14----------
i say like i've been i told you three


---------19:16----------
times


---------19:17----------
and you haven't listened


---------19:18----------
i've told you like three times to do


---------19:20----------
this and you're not listening so then


---------19:22----------
daddy gets upset


---------19:25----------
right so this is an authoritarian


---------19:27----------
parenting style


---------19:29----------
the authoritative parenting style


---------19:31----------
actually has high control and high


---------19:33----------
warmth


---------19:34----------
so these are parents that are


---------19:38----------
structured


---------19:40----------
and supportive


---------19:44----------
this is basically the best parenting


---------19:45----------
style there are studies that show that


---------19:48----------
authoritative parents


---------19:50----------
actually do well in terms of like kids


---------19:52----------
substance use


---------19:54----------
so


---------19:56----------
child substance use is like


---------19:58----------
the worst with permissive parents


---------20:02----------
and the best with authoritative parents


---------20:04----------
so they provide like structures and


---------20:05----------
boundaries but they're kind of like warm


---------20:07----------
and emotionally supportive


---------20:09----------
okay


---------20:10----------
um


---------20:13----------
so like these are parents that i think


---------20:15----------
of as is so a couple of other notes so


---------20:17----------
these are people with high expectations


---------20:23----------
with


---------20:26----------
little support


---------20:30----------
so this is another like key aspect of


---------20:32----------
authoritarian parents so you can think


---------20:33----------
about tiger parents as like being in


---------20:35----------
this category right where they expect a


---------20:37----------
lot from you but like if you get a b


---------20:41----------
they're not gonna be like okay let's sit


---------20:43----------
down and like think a little bit about


---------20:44----------
what's going on and like why you gotta


---------20:46----------
be and like how can we help you like are


---------20:48----------
you struggling is do you need glasses


---------20:51----------
like they don't care about that right


---------20:52----------
authoritarian parents are gonna be like


---------20:54----------
you need to get an a


---------20:56----------
i don't care how you figure out it out


---------20:57----------
you need to get an a


---------21:00----------
right so they're not very supportive but


---------21:01----------
they're like demanding and they have


---------21:02----------
high expectations


---------21:05----------
so authoritative parents are a little


---------21:06----------
bit different


---------21:07----------
so they are they they set limits


---------21:12----------
uh set limits


---------21:20----------
with emotional support


---------21:24----------
right so it's like you need to get an a


---------21:26----------
but like i understand things are okay so


---------21:28----------
like tell me like why you know what's


---------21:29----------
hard what's going on like is something


---------21:31----------
going on in your life that seems out of


---------21:33----------
character let me understand like help me


---------21:35----------
understand like what's going on with you


---------21:36----------
like why aren't you getting an a like is


---------21:37----------
there something i need to know about


---------21:39----------
what can i do to help you still need to


---------21:41----------
get an a like we're not going to not let


---------21:42----------
you get an a so we need to correct that


---------21:44----------
behavior and at the same time i can be


---------21:46----------
like emotionally supportive while doing


---------21:48----------
so


---------21:49----------
okay


---------21:51----------
next parent is permissive which is low


---------21:54----------
control and high warmth this is the cool


---------21:57----------
parent


---------22:00----------
right


---------22:01----------
so these people are great because


---------22:03----------
they're emotionally supportive


---------22:09----------
but


---------22:11----------
few boundaries


---------22:13----------
few limitations or boundaries


---------22:18----------
right so this is the parent who's kind


---------22:20----------
of like


---------22:21----------
yeah i'm sorry you got a b honey like


---------22:23----------
it'd really be nice if you got an a but


---------22:26----------
you know like do you promise me that


---------22:28----------
you'll study harder okay i love you


---------22:30----------
darling


---------22:31----------
do really good okay mommy's like mommy


---------22:33----------
loves you no matter what


---------22:35----------
like daddy daddy loves you no matter


---------22:37----------
what


---------22:38----------
and you promise me you're gonna do


---------22:39----------
better right okay i'm glad we had this


---------22:41----------
talk


---------22:42----------
go play your nintendo


---------22:45----------
go ahead it's okay


---------22:46----------
i know you're gonna do it


---------22:49----------
right so that's a permissive parenting


---------22:50----------
style


---------22:52----------
then we've got the overprotective


---------22:54----------
parenting style so this too can be like


---------22:57----------
sorta high control


---------23:00----------
and then the warmth is kind of weird


---------23:03----------
so it's i would call kind of call this


---------23:05----------
like


---------23:06----------
overt warmth overtly high and covertly


---------23:09----------
low


---------23:12----------
so these are like like


---------23:14----------
overprotective parents tend to restrict


---------23:16----------
autonomy


---------23:20----------
of the kid um


---------23:22----------
tend to be like


---------23:24----------
physically


---------23:26----------
or psychologically controlling


---------23:36----------
and tend to encourage dependence


---------23:42----------
right so if you can't like if you can't


---------23:44----------
get an a like let me go ahead and like


---------23:46----------
arrange a tutor for you and i'm gonna do


---------23:48----------
this for you and i'm gonna do that for


---------23:49----------
you because you can't do it yourself so


---------23:51----------
like daddy your mommy is gonna take over


---------23:53----------
and like you need to do really well but


---------23:55----------
like i'm gonna be there for you okay you


---------23:56----------
don't need to learn how to drive at the


---------23:57----------
age of 16. mommy or daddy are going to


---------24:00----------
be there for you if you drive there are


---------24:01----------
drunk drivers on the road we can't trust


---------24:03----------
your friends like they could drive drunk


---------24:06----------
so i don't want you driving i don't want


---------24:07----------
you under their influences mom and dad


---------24:09----------
are going to drive you everywhere


---------24:10----------
oh that's wonderful you want to go on a


---------24:12----------
date you have a you have a boyfriend now


---------24:14----------
that's fantastic mommy's so proud of you


---------24:16----------
for having your boyfriend i'm gonna


---------24:18----------
drive you to your date you're gonna sit


---------24:19----------
at this table i'm gonna sit at that


---------24:21----------
table i won't bother you at all i


---------24:23----------
promise and then when you're done with


---------24:24----------
your little date mommy and daddy will


---------24:26----------
drive you home


---------24:27----------
okay


---------24:28----------
so these are overprotective parents


---------24:31----------
so we tend to see in adhd


---------24:33----------
so this is where things get kind of


---------24:34----------
interesting


---------24:36----------
so


---------24:38----------
people have done studies looking at ages


---------24:41----------
three


---------24:42----------
six


---------24:43----------
and nine


---------24:44----------
and what they tend to find is that the


---------24:47----------
worse the adhd is


---------24:49----------
especially at this phase


---------24:51----------
less so at three-year-olds when you have


---------24:53----------
high adhd this leads to increased


---------24:56----------
authoritarian parenting


---------25:01----------
okay


---------25:02----------
when you have also between these ages


---------25:04----------
when you have high authoritarian


---------25:06----------
parenting


---------25:10----------
this leads to worse adhd


---------25:14----------
okay so it seems like between the ages


---------25:16----------
of three and six there isn't too much


---------25:19----------
change


---------25:20----------
um so it seems like starting at the age


---------25:22----------
of six and i would even say just six


---------25:24----------
plus because you see this stuff at like


---------25:26----------
college


---------25:28----------
ages and stuff like that too


---------25:30----------
we see a lot of bi-directional effects


---------25:33----------
so worse adhd leads to worsening


---------25:35----------
authoritarian kind of parenting and then


---------25:37----------
authoritarian parenting leads to


---------25:39----------
exacerbation of symptoms of adhd


---------25:42----------
so it tends to be there are a couple of


---------25:43----------
other interesting dynamics here so it


---------25:45----------
seems like there are gender effects here


---------25:46----------
too


---------25:48----------
where um for example


---------25:50----------
let me just make sure i have this


---------25:51----------
correct


---------25:53----------
so


---------25:55----------
uh


---------25:56----------
so


---------25:57----------
female kids here's just examples of


---------26:00----------
different things okay


---------26:02----------
are more sensitive


---------26:05----------
this is going to be a packed sentence


---------26:07----------
okay


---------26:08----------
too


---------26:09----------
low


---------26:11----------
authoritative


---------26:14----------
mothers


---------26:16----------
so this is where when we get into like


---------26:18----------
the super specifics of the research


---------26:20----------
we're looking at like different


---------26:21----------
variables right so what this basically


---------26:23----------
means


---------26:24----------
is that if you're a if you're a a girl


---------26:27----------
and you have a mom who is not very


---------26:29----------
authoritative right authoritative is the


---------26:31----------
good one


---------26:33----------
um right so


---------26:36----------
uh hold on oh no sorry yeah


---------26:37----------
authoritative is the good one


---------26:39----------
so if you have uh if you're a female kid


---------26:42----------
who has a low authoritative mother a


---------26:45----------
mother who does not provide you with


---------26:47----------
structure and emotional support your


---------26:49----------
adhd is likely to be like way worse than


---------26:52----------
a male kid


---------26:54----------
right so this is where it's just


---------26:55----------
interesting but as we start looking at


---------26:56----------
these different variables we start to


---------26:58----------
see different sorts of


---------27:00----------
effects on kids so for example


---------27:02----------
dad's


---------27:04----------
parenting style has more of an effect


---------27:06----------
between the ages of three to six than


---------27:09----------
mom's parenting style so there are other


---------27:10----------
kinds of interesting just sort of like


---------27:12----------
semi-random


---------27:14----------
gender effects that we tend to see like


---------27:15----------
dads seem to be more impactful from the


---------27:17----------
the ages of three to six than moms are


---------27:19----------
female kids with moms that have low


---------27:21----------
authoritative


---------27:23----------
parenting styles tend to have like we're


---------27:25----------
not necessarily saying that they're high


---------27:26----------
authoritarian right so do you all


---------27:28----------
understand that there's like a


---------27:28----------
difference there


---------27:30----------
you can be low on one and high on the


---------27:32----------
other but it's really the variable is


---------27:34----------
low authoritative that that girls tend


---------27:36----------
to be sensitive to later in life


---------27:39----------
there are all kinds of specific effects


---------27:41----------
we'll give you guys a list of the the


---------27:43----------
resources and stuff you guys can read


---------27:45----------
the papers yourself if you want to okay


---------27:48----------
so different kinds of effects here


---------27:51----------
and so


---------27:53----------
this is the there's a key


---------27:55----------
finding here that's really important so


---------27:57----------
then what people did is they they looked


---------27:59----------
at these different effects right and


---------28:00----------
they saw this reciprocal kind of


---------28:02----------
relationship and then so what then


---------28:04----------
researchers started doing


---------28:06----------
is intervening


---------28:08----------
so researchers started asking the


---------28:10----------
question okay


---------28:11----------
if we move from an authoritarian


---------28:17----------
to an authoritative


---------28:21----------
right so this one is


---------28:24----------
controlling


---------28:26----------
this one is structured


---------28:29----------
and supportive just to give you guys an


---------28:31----------
example like a reminder right because i


---------28:32----------
know the terms are similar


---------28:34----------
so they did is if we train parents


---------28:37----------
in moving from authoritarian to


---------28:38----------
authoritative


---------28:40----------
what happens and the cool thing that


---------28:42----------
they discovered is that adhd improves


---------28:46----------
so if you alter the way in which you


---------28:49----------
parent


---------28:50----------
you can actually affect the adhd of your


---------28:54----------
child


---------28:55----------
and this correlates with all kinds of


---------28:56----------
stuff okay so it correlates with like


---------28:58----------
improved academic performance


---------29:00----------
improved ability to like meet goals


---------29:02----------
improved social outcomes so if you like


---------29:05----------
literally change the way in which you


---------29:06----------
parent your child's adhd will improve


---------29:09----------
now there's another really really key


---------29:11----------
key key


---------29:13----------
finding here which is fascinating


---------29:15----------
is that when researchers when you change


---------29:17----------
the parenting style


---------29:19----------
the inattention


---------29:22----------
does


---------29:23----------
not


---------29:24----------
improve


---------29:27----------
but


---------29:28----------
grades


---------29:29----------
improve


---------29:32----------
okay so now this gets a little bit


---------29:33----------
complicated


---------29:35----------
but i'm going to try to explain this


---------29:37----------
so when we measure a kid with adhd


---------29:40----------
they're like tests that we can do to see


---------29:42----------
how their attention functions like how


---------29:45----------
long can you read this


---------29:46----------
boring paragraph for example before your


---------29:49----------
eyes start wandering


---------29:51----------
and then there's other things that we


---------29:52----------
measure as well


---------29:53----------
which is like not just like your


---------29:55----------
attention at a task


---------29:58----------
but outcomes like what happens to your


---------29:59----------
grades what happens to your social


---------30:01----------
situation what happens to your sense of


---------30:03----------
depression your self-worth all these


---------30:04----------
kinds of things and we we we've assumed


---------30:07----------
as a psychiatric industry we've assumed


---------30:10----------
that increasing attention


---------30:13----------
is the mechanism


---------30:14----------
to improve grades


---------30:18----------
right


---------30:19----------
so then what we do is psychiatrists is


---------30:21----------
we prescribe stimulants


---------30:23----------
and what we're going to do is we're


---------30:24----------
going to give you a pill that will


---------30:25----------
improve your attention therefore we will


---------30:28----------
increase the grade


---------30:29----------
and so stimulants lead to


---------30:32----------
improved grades right that's what


---------30:33----------
psychiatry believes


---------30:35----------
but what parenting studies actually show


---------30:37----------
is really fascinating is the fundamental


---------30:39----------
attentional stuff does not improve their


---------30:41----------
ability to pay attention to a paragraph


---------30:43----------
does not seem to get better


---------30:45----------
but what does improve is the grades


---------30:48----------
and this is a really really really


---------30:50----------
important finding because what this


---------30:52----------
suggests is that


---------30:53----------
fixing the attention doesn't


---------30:55----------
automatically fix everything downstream


---------30:57----------
in fact providing the right kind of


---------30:59----------
parenting style


---------31:00----------
is sufficient to improve your grades


---------31:03----------
without fixing the attention with


---------31:04----------
stimulants


---------31:06----------
right so what this actually means is


---------31:08----------
that like you don't need stimulants like


---------31:10----------
you can actually i mean you may need


---------31:11----------
depending on your clinical situation


---------31:14----------
but this fundamental like assumption


---------31:16----------
that psychiatry has that stimulants are


---------31:18----------
what you need


---------31:19----------
appears to actually not be not true that


---------31:21----------
you can actually


---------31:23----------
teach parents how to parent properly and


---------31:25----------
parent their child appropriately with


---------31:27----------
adhd and the kids outcomes will improve


---------31:30----------
despite the fact that you're not


---------31:31----------
altering their neurochemistry


---------31:33----------
so then the question naturally becomes


---------31:35----------
what's the relationship between


---------31:37----------
stimulants and parenting and this is


---------31:38----------
what's really fascinating


---------31:40----------
when you give a kid a stimulant


---------31:45----------
it decreases authoritarian parenting


---------31:53----------
so this is fascinating


---------31:55----------
incredibly fascinating


---------31:57----------
right so when a kid is on a stimulant


---------32:00----------
and they're able to attend a little bit


---------32:01----------
better


---------32:02----------
the parent actually needs to yell less


---------32:05----------
they're able to like you know attend to


---------32:08----------
the parent more so the parent doesn't


---------32:10----------
enter go into this cycle over here


---------32:12----------
right so once you once you fix the


---------32:14----------
stimulant this goes away so then this


---------32:17----------
goes away and this goes away they just


---------32:20----------
start by listening


---------32:22----------
and so it's kind of like really


---------32:24----------
interesting there right


---------32:26----------
and so this is kind of what we sort of


---------32:28----------
learn which is that at the end of the


---------32:30----------
day the way in which you parent your


---------32:32----------
child will actually affect their adhd


---------32:34----------
symptoms


---------32:35----------
will in turn affect your own mental


---------32:37----------
health if you kind of parent them


---------32:39----------
appropriately and will lead to better


---------32:41----------
outcomes for their kid for your kid so


---------32:43----------
then everyone's going to be asking


---------32:47----------
so if you guys want to see um let's just


---------32:49----------
look at a couple of these papers real


---------32:50----------
quick okay


---------32:54----------
so uh let me see what's something that's


---------32:57----------
kind of digestible


---------32:59----------
um let me just look let me show you guys


---------33:01----------
if you guys just want to


---------33:02----------
we'll put include these references


---------33:04----------
hopefully somewhere but i'll just flash


---------33:05----------
them here so you guys can look at the


---------33:06----------
vod so here's one of the papers that we


---------33:08----------
looked at


---------33:09----------
maternal parenting style and


---------33:11----------
internalizing and adhd symptoms in


---------33:13----------
college students


---------33:17----------
these studies are actually really cool


---------33:18----------
by the way


---------33:22----------
parenting is a mechanism of change in


---------33:23----------
psychosocial treatment for youth with


---------33:25----------
adhd


---------33:27----------
right so like that's exploring the


---------33:28----------
mechanism of change


---------33:30----------
when you


---------33:33----------
adjust your parenting


---------33:36----------
um


---------33:38----------
a longitudinal study of the relation


---------33:40----------
between family functioning and preschool


---------33:42----------
adhd symptoms so these are like papers


---------33:45----------
looking at college students and


---------33:47----------
preschool


---------33:48----------
okay


---------33:51----------
family impact and parenting styles and


---------33:53----------
in families of children with adhd so


---------33:55----------
this is a great paper that just kind of


---------33:56----------
talks about it all


---------33:58----------
and then this is the one that we're


---------33:59----------
gonna i think talk about


---------34:01----------
now


---------34:02----------
for a second so examining differences oh


---------34:04----------
no wait hold on i'm missing one


---------34:14----------
huh


---------34:19----------
there we go this is the one i'm missing


---------34:23----------
so mindfulness for children with adhd


---------34:25----------
and mindful parenting mind champ a


---------34:27----------
qualitative study on the feasibility


---------34:29----------
effects so this is a study that looks at


---------34:31----------
actually an intervention where they


---------34:33----------
taught parents the mind champ program


---------34:36----------
right so this i don't know if you all


---------34:37----------
are aware of this but mine champ is an


---------34:39----------
evolution of the pog champ emote


---------34:41----------
which has now been banned i understand


---------34:44----------
right


---------34:45----------
so we need to mine champion


---------34:47----------
petition twitch chat


---------34:50----------
so now what everyone is going to be


---------34:51----------
asking is


---------34:53----------
um


---------34:55----------
okay so oh


---------34:56----------
there we go


---------34:58----------
so what everyone's going to be asking is


---------34:59----------
like if you're a parent or you're a kid


---------35:01----------
and you're trying to figure out or


---------35:02----------
you're a romantic partner or whatever


---------35:04----------
platonic friend


---------35:05----------
you know how do i parent properly


---------35:14----------
so there's a lot of different stuff that


---------35:15----------
people have measured


---------35:17----------
right to see


---------35:18----------
what are the key things that determine


---------35:20----------
whether someone like is doing a good job


---------35:23----------
of parenting or not good job of


---------35:24----------
parenting what are the things that are


---------35:25----------
important


---------35:26----------
so the first is to be structured


---------35:31----------
instead of


---------35:32----------
reactive


---------35:35----------
so let me actually do it this way


---------35:40----------
is greater than reactivity


---------35:44----------
what does that mean


---------35:46----------
so


---------35:47----------
i'll give you guys a story from my my


---------35:48----------
personal life


---------35:50----------
so i have a kid who's like super high


---------35:51----------
vata and what i've found is that like


---------35:54----------
getting her ready for school in the


---------35:55----------
morning can be a five minute process


---------35:58----------
that is easy and simple or it can be a


---------36:01----------
half hour process with a lot of like


---------36:03----------
frustration and yelling and like


---------36:05----------
you know things like that so what i find


---------36:07----------
is that when i'm you know have a hive at


---------36:09----------
that child what i have to do is be like


---------36:11----------
super super structured about it so for


---------36:13----------
example like we get her clothes ready we


---------36:15----------
get her toothbrush ready we get all of


---------36:17----------
her stuff ready and it's placed in the


---------36:19----------
bathroom whereas in the past what we


---------36:21----------
would do is like we'd brush our teeth in


---------36:22----------
one place we'd go to the closet to get


---------36:25----------
dressed we'd then like go get our socks


---------36:28----------
because we keep our socks and shoes like


---------36:30----------
you know by the door and then we'd put


---------36:31----------
on our shoes and like so it's like a


---------36:33----------
multi jet like it's like there's phase


---------36:34----------
one is brushed teeth and go potty phase


---------36:36----------
two is moved to location number two and


---------36:38----------
put on clothes and phase three is like


---------36:41----------
put on socks shoes and coat and what i


---------36:43----------
find is that each time there's a


---------36:45----------
transition her attention can wander and


---------36:47----------
she'll like start playing with something


---------36:49----------
if she starts playing with something


---------36:50----------
then i have to like react to it right


---------36:53----------
and then i'll also get frustrated i'll


---------36:54----------
be like oh my god like she like she


---------36:56----------
feels like a fish that's gotten like


---------36:58----------
loose from the net and then she'll just


---------37:00----------
like run away and do whatever she wants


---------37:02----------
to


---------37:03----------
okay


---------37:04----------
and so what we want to end up doing is


---------37:06----------
being as structured as possible so this


---------37:08----------
is where like we get the clothes the


---------37:09----------
toothbrush we close the door to the


---------37:11----------
bathroom and we're not leaving the


---------37:12----------
bathroom until we have our coat socks


---------37:15----------
toothbrush you know teeth brushed wet


---------37:18----------
potty change clothes put on socks and


---------37:20----------
coat right there and then we're going to


---------37:21----------
leave the bathroom and then we'll put on


---------37:23----------
our shoes right by the door on the way


---------37:25----------
out


---------37:26----------
so you want to be as structured as


---------37:27----------
possible and try to be as


---------37:30----------
as non-reactive as possible


---------37:32----------
second thing


---------37:34----------
impose limits


---------37:39----------
without emotion


---------37:42----------
this is a key one okay


---------37:44----------
so you want to set boundaries like by


---------37:46----------
all means you want to set boundaries the


---------37:48----------
problem or even enforce boundaries the


---------37:50----------
problem is that oftentimes parents will


---------37:53----------
impose those limits or set boundaries or


---------37:55----------
enforce boundaries when they themselves


---------37:57----------
are pissed


---------37:58----------
and so like this is it's hard for a kid


---------38:00----------
because first of all they're doing


---------38:01----------
something wrong but when you're yelling


---------38:03----------
at them like they may learn because


---------38:05----------
they're going to be learning like their


---------38:07----------
limbic system will be active and it'll


---------38:08----------
be teaching them lessons but there's


---------38:10----------
going to be like negative impacts to


---------38:12----------
self-worth


---------38:14----------
is going to go down


---------38:15----------
right like they know that you're angry


---------38:17----------
with them


---------38:18----------
so they're going to like feel bad


---------38:21----------
you're you're going to be angry with


---------38:23----------
yourself


---------38:24----------
right because you're yelling at your kid


---------38:25----------
and you don't want to be yelling at your


---------38:26----------
kid


---------38:28----------
so as best as possible


---------38:30----------
try to set limits without being


---------38:32----------
emotional right and this is where we


---------38:34----------
have to be super super careful because


---------38:36----------
this translates into a weird thing


---------38:38----------
sometimes where parents are like i'm not


---------38:40----------
supposed to be emotional with my kids so


---------38:41----------
i'm gonna i'm gonna talk like this i'm


---------38:43----------
not gonna be emotional at all no


---------38:46----------
emotions


---------38:47----------
child you have been a bad child today


---------38:50----------
therefore i'm going to have to take away


---------38:51----------
your toy no angry no yelling no emotion


---------38:56----------
right


---------38:57----------
so sometimes parents will do this


---------39:00----------
where there's another version of this


---------39:02----------
that i've heard


---------39:03----------
historically and recently which is like


---------39:05----------
yeah we don't punish our kids because


---------39:07----------
punishment is bad we should use positive


---------39:09----------
reinforcement


---------39:10----------
and then they'll say things like okay so


---------39:11----------
like we're not going to do timeout


---------39:13----------
because timeout is a punishment we're


---------39:14----------
going to take a break


---------39:15----------
or we're going to do something else


---------39:17----------
right


---------39:18----------
and so they'll use this weird language


---------39:20----------
and what they end up doing is like


---------39:21----------
punishing the kid they just don't call


---------39:23----------
it a punishment


---------39:25----------
right it's like super weird and that


---------39:27----------
screws kids up even more like so i had a


---------39:29----------
patient got so screwed up it's like nuts


---------39:32----------
where the parents like would never


---------39:33----------
punish the kid because they were super


---------39:35----------
into like not punishing kids


---------39:37----------
so instead what would happen is oh like


---------39:39----------
you're acting out


---------39:41----------
the reason you're acting out is because


---------39:43----------
you ate i kid you not gluten


---------39:46----------
and so since you're acting out this is


---------39:47----------
the gluten's fault it's not your fault


---------39:49----------
because heaven forbid we're not going to


---------39:51----------
punish you there's nothing wrong with


---------39:53----------
you you are the perfect child it is the


---------39:55----------
gluten that's causing the problem


---------39:57----------
because it's it flaring up your ibs


---------40:00----------
therefore wait for it wait for it wait


---------40:02----------
for it no cupcakes


---------40:04----------
you're acting out therefore it's the


---------40:06----------
gluten's fault therefore no cupcakes and


---------40:08----------
the kid gets like super confused right


---------40:10----------
because


---------40:11----------
they see the acting out and they see the


---------40:13----------
removal of the cupcake they just can't


---------40:15----------
handle like and then it gets really


---------40:17----------
weird because if you're punishing a kid


---------40:19----------
but you don't call it punishment that


---------40:22----------
screws up the kid more than just


---------40:23----------
punishing them than calling them


---------40:24----------
punishment


---------40:26----------
you'll get that


---------40:27----------
like if you're punishing a kid just let


---------40:29----------
at least be authentic about it and be


---------40:31----------
honest about it because then the kid


---------40:33----------
winds up in my office i kid you not no


---------40:36----------
pun intended


---------40:37----------
and then they've got this weird


---------40:39----------
relationship with like food


---------40:41----------
because of this


---------40:42----------
and every time that something bad


---------40:44----------
happens so they're like dating someone


---------40:47----------
and they feel emotionally hurt and they


---------40:49----------
start blaming the cupcakes and it's like


---------40:51----------
then i have to do the work of rewiring


---------40:54----------
this person's brain and it's like no


---------40:55----------
you're not feeling bad because of the


---------40:57----------
gluten


---------40:58----------
you're feeling bad because your your


---------41:00----------
partner was emotionally unsupportive it


---------41:02----------
didn't like respond to your texts


---------41:05----------
right and so like you get this like so


---------41:07----------
if you're gonna punish your kid like


---------41:08----------
punish your kid try to do it without


---------41:10----------
emotion now this is the other key thing


---------41:13----------
without emotion does not mean


---------41:14----------
suppressing your emotions so you have a


---------41:16----------
monotone child you have misbehaved


---------41:18----------
therefore i'm going to set a limit on


---------41:20----------
you without emotion no emotion no


---------41:22----------
elevated voice nothing no i'm calm i'm


---------41:25----------
collected i'm i am good and you my


---------41:28----------
friend are screwed


---------41:30----------
but with no emotion


---------41:32----------
this is not actually no emotion so this


---------41:35----------
is the other thing that parents tend to


---------41:36----------
do is when we say do something without


---------41:38----------
emotion they think what that means is


---------41:40----------
suppress the emotion


---------41:41----------
but here's the thing and we see this a


---------41:43----------
lot with toddlers right


---------41:44----------
toddlers like know maybe like 50 words


---------41:47----------
they're like two-year-olds right so when


---------41:49----------
you don't use the language of emotion


---------41:52----------
i mean a punishment sorry and like you


---------41:54----------
don't display like


---------41:56----------
if you don't like overtly punish them


---------41:58----------
they're very very attuned to you


---------42:00----------
emotionally and empathically so you can


---------42:03----------
act like you're not emotional but a


---------42:06----------
two-year-old will absolutely understand


---------42:08----------
exactly what you're feeling because


---------42:09----------
that's all they've got to work with


---------42:11----------
right they don't have vocabulary they


---------42:12----------
don't have logic they don't understand


---------42:14----------
reasoning all they can do is like read


---------42:17----------
your facial expression and understand


---------42:18----------
that like mommy and daddy are like not


---------42:20----------
happy with me and i kind of screwed up


---------42:23----------
and then you tell your kid no no you


---------42:24----------
didn't screw up this is not a punishment


---------42:26----------
you didn't screw up and then the kid


---------42:28----------
gets super confused and they're like


---------42:30----------
what and then they wind up in my office


---------42:33----------
right


---------42:35----------
so you're damn right two-year-olds read


---------42:36----------
your mind that's exactly what they do


---------42:37----------
because that's all they know how to do


---------42:38----------
because they don't have words they don't


---------42:40----------
have language they don't have logic so


---------42:42----------
all they have to do is like super high


---------42:45----------
empathic circuitry


---------42:47----------
okay


---------42:48----------
it's kind of bizarre they're like very


---------42:50----------
very attuned to things


---------42:52----------
and it's like you can change your facial


---------42:53----------
expression like make a kid cry like


---------42:54----------
super easily because that's all they've


---------42:56----------
got to work with they've got no history


---------42:58----------
no context all they can do is like read


---------42:59----------
your facial expression it's like 100


---------43:01----------
like they'll read exactly what's going


---------43:02----------
on


---------43:03----------
okay


---------43:05----------
so as a parent like what should you do


---------43:08----------
right so you want to impose limits


---------43:09----------
without emotion and if you say okay well


---------43:10----------
that how do i impose limits without


---------43:12----------
emotion this is where like you process


---------43:13----------
emotions


---------43:15----------
so if you're feeling angry with your kid


---------43:17----------
you've got to like kind of work through


---------43:19----------
that yourself okay


---------43:21----------
so there's a couple of things that are


---------43:22----------
important here so one is like awareness


---------43:27----------
of your emotions


---------43:31----------
this is what you should do if you're a


---------43:32----------
parent right so how do we get here we


---------43:34----------
get here by doing this


---------43:35----------
so like what are you feeling okay i'm


---------43:36----------
feeling frustrated like acknowledge that


---------43:38----------
right and you can even acknowledge it to


---------43:40----------
your kid you can say


---------43:41----------
hey daddy is feeling kind of frustrated


---------43:43----------
with you right now and i'm going to do


---------43:44----------
my best to set that aside i really don't


---------43:46----------
want to be frustrated with you and


---------43:47----------
daddy's working on that


---------43:49----------
i really need you to put on your shoes


---------43:51----------
and i'm sorry if i'm saying that in a


---------43:53----------
way that hurts your feelings like can


---------43:54----------
you please do that for daddy you just


---------43:56----------
say that


---------43:58----------
right


---------43:59----------
and then you can ask them hey


---------44:01----------
was is the way that daddy's talking to


---------44:03----------
you does it make you feel bad


---------44:05----------
okay let me give you a hug right so like


---------44:08----------
you can be frustrated but you don't want


---------44:10----------
to impose the limit with that


---------44:11----------
frustration it's like it's like that


---------44:13----------
simple


---------44:15----------
right it's not necessarily easy to learn


---------44:17----------
how to talk like that but like you can


---------44:18----------
acknowledge your emotions to your child


---------44:20----------
and like kind of check in with them


---------44:22----------
so as a parent you want awareness of


---------44:23----------
your emotions


---------44:25----------
okay


---------44:26----------
second thing is you yourself need to be


---------44:28----------
like careful about being as non-reactive


---------44:33----------
and making sure you're emotionally


---------44:35----------
regulated


---------44:38----------
right so this kind of goes back to now


---------44:40----------
i'm using some of the language of the


---------44:41----------
research paper so this is like


---------44:43----------
processing your own emotions so you can


---------44:45----------
cultivate like


---------44:47----------
detachment so this is like our hg bread


---------44:50----------
and butter stuff so the cool thing about


---------44:52----------
paying attention to hg


---------44:54----------
is that we will make you better parents


---------44:56----------
whether you realize it or not because


---------44:58----------
we're teaching you all to be detached


---------45:00----------
right we're teaching you all to like


---------45:02----------
understand your emotions we're teaching


---------45:03----------
you to be less lexithemic


---------45:06----------
another big thing is acceptance


---------45:09----------
and so this too is like related to this


---------45:11----------
right


---------45:12----------
so you got to kind of just accept


---------45:15----------
that


---------45:17----------
like some of this stuff isn't gonna be


---------45:18----------
perfect right so whether i like if my


---------45:20----------
kid is like late for school yelling at


---------45:22----------
them is not gonna make a difference


---------45:24----------
like they're late so we can definitely


---------45:26----------
have a conversation about it


---------45:28----------
we can impose some kind of uh punishment


---------45:30----------
or whatever but like you as a parent can


---------45:33----------
accept that things are just not gonna be


---------45:35----------
perfect and so if we think about like


---------45:37----------
acceptance like which parenting style


---------45:40----------
does not enjoy acceptance at all which


---------45:42----------
parenting style is the hallmark of a


---------45:45----------
lack of acceptance


---------45:47----------
do you all remember


---------45:49----------
ah yes


---------45:51----------
the authoritarian parenting style or


---------45:53----------
acceptance is the enemy


---------45:56----------
right


---------45:58----------
acceptance is exactly what we want to


---------46:00----------
avoid like we don't want to accept our


---------46:02----------
kid for who they are like screw that we


---------46:04----------
want our kid to be what we want them to


---------46:05----------
be


---------46:06----------
screw acceptance


---------46:08----------
acceptance leads to subpar results


---------46:11----------
and this is the really sad thing is that


---------46:12----------
is actually like not true


---------46:14----------
in fact the opposite right what we tend


---------46:16----------
to discover through research is that


---------46:18----------
actually like accepting your kid for


---------46:20----------
where they're at and still sort of


---------46:22----------
imposing limits and boundaries and


---------46:24----------
structure


---------46:25----------
with love is actually the way to go


---------46:28----------
so as a parent you want to be structured


---------46:30----------
instead of reactive so if you've got a


---------46:31----------
kid with adhd


---------46:33----------
don't give them opportunities to get


---------46:35----------
distracted


---------46:36----------
right so you want to like not have to


---------46:38----------
respond and chase them around this is


---------46:40----------
what drives parents absolutely crazy


---------46:41----------
because then you're chasing your kid


---------46:43----------
around all the time


---------46:45----------
you're stressed out you get frustrated


---------46:47----------
what should take five minutes is now


---------46:48----------
taking half an hour you don't have your


---------46:50----------
own time to take care of yourself so


---------46:52----------
self-care is actually another important


---------46:54----------
part


---------46:55----------
something that parents


---------46:57----------
woefully neglect


---------46:59----------
is like taking care of themselves


---------47:00----------
because if you are calm cool and


---------47:01----------
collected


---------47:03----------
you will do a better job of taking care


---------47:04----------
of your your kids


---------47:06----------
and this is what we've seen in our


---------47:08----------
parent program is like we'll give our


---------47:10----------
our parents like we'll teach them


---------47:11----------
communication skills we'll teach them


---------47:13----------
how to set boundaries and stuff like


---------47:14----------
that but a big part of what we do for


---------47:16----------
parents is actually emotional support


---------47:18----------
and this is where like you know we get


---------47:20----------
them in a room together we talk about


---------47:21----------
okay what's like what's it like for you


---------47:23----------
having a kid who's addicted to video


---------47:25----------
games


---------47:26----------
it's like terrifying right like they're


---------47:28----------
scared they're scared that their child


---------47:30----------
is like their kid is like 19 years old


---------47:32----------
they failed their first year of college


---------47:34----------
and the parent is terrified they're like


---------47:36----------
what if i can't control this like what


---------47:38----------
if this continues they're gonna be


---------47:39----------
homeless like what's gonna happen to


---------47:41----------
them once i pass away like if they're


---------47:43----------
not able to take care of themselves they


---------47:44----------
have all this fear


---------47:46----------
rolling around inside of them and then


---------47:48----------
anytime they have a conversation


---------47:51----------
it's gonna like show up with the kid


---------47:54----------
right so we actually had this case


---------47:56----------
yesterday where someone was sharing with


---------47:57----------
me that you know the parent was


---------47:58----------
concerned about their kid they said like


---------48:00----------
i i'm worried about what's gonna happen


---------48:02----------
to you when i'm gone


---------48:05----------
and that's a devastating thing to share


---------48:07----------
with a child like the kid can't handle


---------48:09----------
that emotional that because they know


---------48:10----------
you're right like they know you're right


---------48:13----------
if you're a parent who has enabled your


---------48:14----------
child


---------48:16----------
and you have like a man-child for a kid


---------48:19----------
or a woman child for a kid and like you


---------48:20----------
do like their laundry and stuff like and


---------48:23----------
you worry about what's gonna happen and


---------48:24----------
that's a completely valid worry that is


---------48:26----------
gonna terrify your kid because they know


---------48:28----------
it's true they know that once you leave


---------48:30----------
like they they're like they're old


---------48:32----------
enough to understand they don't do their


---------48:33----------
laundry they don't pay their bills they


---------48:34----------
don't have a job so if you're a kid like


---------48:36----------
that like it's terrifying to face that


---------48:38----------
reality that your parent isn't gonna be


---------48:40----------
there one day and then that negative


---------48:42----------
emotion that the kid deals with in turn


---------48:44----------
is gonna shatter their motivation


---------48:46----------
it's not gonna like scare them straight


---------48:48----------
it's gonna like that's what drives them


---------48:49----------
to the game in the first place


---------48:51----------
and then like they get driven to the


---------48:53----------
game and like now they retreat because


---------48:54----------
like their life is going nowhere when


---------48:56----------
your parent is like by the way your life


---------48:58----------
is going nowhere and the kid is like


---------48:59----------
yeah i know they lash out at the parent


---------49:01----------
and they retreat to the video game and


---------49:03----------
then the cycle perpetuates


---------49:05----------
right so how do you do this you take


---------49:07----------
care of your own emotions as a parent


---------49:09----------
somewhere else you take care of yourself


---------49:11----------
you do what you need to


---------49:13----------
if you need that glass of zinfandel on


---------49:15----------
thursday at 4 pm you go for it right


---------49:18----------
i don't actually recommend that because


---------49:20----------
using alcohol as a coping mechanism is a


---------49:21----------
bad idea


---------49:25----------
let's say if you need your bath


---------49:27----------
on a sunday morning


---------49:28----------
you go for it


---------49:30----------
okay


---------49:32----------
so this is adhd and parenting to


---------49:34----------
summarize


---------49:36----------
it's kind of interesting because a lot


---------49:38----------
of people wonder what's the relationship


---------49:40----------
between parenting and adhd right so if


---------49:43----------
like if i have an adhd kid do i need to


---------49:45----------
parent differently the answer is


---------49:47----------
absolutely yes


---------49:48----------
for kids with adhd you may wonder you


---------49:51----------
know like


---------49:54----------
what is my parents impact on my


---------49:58----------
adhd and the interesting thing is that


---------50:00----------
it appears that children with adhd


---------50:03----------
stress their parents out and result in


---------50:06----------
changes in parental behavior which in


---------50:08----------
turn those changes in parental behavior


---------50:10----------
lead to worsening and adhd symptoms and


---------50:12----------
it's absolutely a bi-directional effect


---------50:16----------
and so i'm not trying to share this with


---------50:17----------
you all for the purpose of like you know


---------50:19----------
blaming your parents and being like you


---------50:21----------
screwed me up now i'm failing out of


---------50:22----------
college because you didn't parent me


---------50:23----------
well enough and i don't want the parents


---------50:25----------
to feel guilty because they're like oh i


---------50:27----------
screwed up because if i'd been a more


---------50:28----------
authoritative parent instead of an


---------50:30----------
authoritarian parent then my kid would


---------50:32----------
be like getting a 4.0 in college that's


---------50:34----------
not the point of this the point of this


---------50:35----------
and those feelings can come up and


---------50:37----------
they're actually quite natural the point


---------50:38----------
is even if that does come up like the


---------50:40----------
two we all have a relationship


---------50:42----------
and the child needs to acknowledge that


---------50:44----------
hey maybe if you did things differently


---------50:45----------
like life would be easier for me


---------50:48----------
and at the same time like child also


---------50:49----------
needs to acknowledge that like i can't


---------50:50----------
really blame you for this because it's


---------50:52----------
not like anyone teaches you this stuff


---------50:53----------
right so it's sort of like not the


---------50:55----------
parent's fault and then you guys can


---------50:56----------
start building bridges from where you


---------50:58----------
are now right as a parent you can


---------51:00----------
acknowledge that maybe if you knew more


---------51:02----------
about this like you would have done a


---------51:03----------
better job and you wouldn't have like


---------51:04----------
put your kid in the situation they're in


---------51:06----------
so you can apologize that for as a


---------51:07----------
parent as a kid you can forgive them if


---------51:09----------
you both admit to like what what the


---------51:11----------
situation is and then you guys can be on


---------51:13----------
the same team like there's like avoiding


---------51:16----------
making mistakes is not the way that you


---------51:17----------
build a relationship you acknowledge the


---------51:20----------
mistake you forgive people for the


---------51:21----------
mistake and even then it's the child's


---------51:24----------
place to say if they're kind of mature


---------51:25----------
about it they're gonna say like actually


---------51:26----------
i can't really blame you for that but i


---------51:28----------
appreciate the apology i don't hold it


---------51:30----------
against you and i'm but i'm glad you


---------51:31----------
know you're accepting responsibility but


---------51:34----------
i don't blame you at all i love you very


---------51:35----------
much


---------51:37----------
let's work on it now like that's what


---------51:38----------
we're looking for at the end right


---------51:41----------
so at the end of the day though adhd in


---------51:43----------
parenting is super tricky and the good


---------51:45----------
news is that if you adjust your


---------51:46----------
parenting style you can actually affect


---------51:48----------
the the symptoms of adhd


---------51:51----------
so this is where being more


---------51:53----------
authoritarian be being more structured


---------51:55----------
and emotionally supportive as opposed to


---------51:57----------
disciplinarian or controlling or


---------52:00----------
permissive where you let the adhd kid do


---------52:02----------
whatever they want to


---------52:03----------
or where you let them like you're


---------52:05----------
overprotective and you start doing


---------52:06----------
things for them because parents will


---------52:08----------
like default to any of those things


---------52:09----------
right


---------52:10----------
either i'm going to yell at you i'm just


---------52:12----------
going to do it for you


---------52:14----------
because you've got adhd and you can't do


---------52:15----------
it yourself


---------52:18----------
i'm gonna just like


---------52:19----------
i'm done with this i like i don't know


---------52:20----------
what to do about this


---------52:22----------
throw your hands up and let your kid do


---------52:23----------
whatever he wants to so the permissive


---------52:25----------
overprotective or authoritarian style


---------52:27----------
those are all non-ideal


---------52:29----------
the challenge the challenging thing is


---------52:31----------
that the authoritative style which is


---------52:33----------
kind of the right move is difficult it's


---------52:35----------
hard it requires self-care on the part


---------52:37----------
of the parent it requires awareness on


---------52:39----------
the part of the parent it requires like


---------52:41----------
acceptance


---------52:42----------
it requires being thoughtful and like


---------52:44----------
building in structure and trying to not


---------52:46----------
be as reactive as possible and


---------52:48----------
processing your own emotions so it's


---------52:50----------
hard but the good news is that you can


---------52:51----------
alter that


---------52:52----------
so if you're someone in a relation if


---------52:54----------
you've got adhd and you see this kind of


---------52:56----------
stuff in your parents


---------52:57----------
recognize that some of what your


---------53:00----------
self-esteem is


---------53:02----------
may not be because your parents are


---------53:03----------
actually like think you're crap but like


---------53:05----------
some of those emotions which even if you


---------53:07----------
know your parents love you those


---------53:09----------
emotions are coming from experiences


---------53:11----------
where your parents had to react because


---------53:13----------
they didn't know any better


---------53:15----------
and similarly if you're in a romantic


---------53:16----------
relationship now or platonic


---------53:18----------
relationship now understand that


---------53:20----------
structure and non-reactivity will help


---------53:22----------
the relationship right so you can


---------53:24----------
implement these from any which way


---------53:26----------
questions


---------53:40----------
can could you talk about how the


---------53:42----------
relationship changes when


---------53:43----------
when the parent has adhd as well


---------53:46----------
is it's quite genetic yeah absolutely


---------53:48----------
so if a parent not only adhd


---------53:51----------
but when a parent has any kind of


---------53:53----------
psychopathology it leads to worsening


---------53:55----------
symptoms in the kid


---------53:56----------
okay


---------53:57----------
so like you can have a parent with


---------53:59----------
anxiety that'll lead to worsening


---------54:00----------
symptoms with adhd


---------54:03----------
there's also


---------54:05----------
uh


---------54:06----------
so adhd is not the only illness that


---------54:09----------
we examined i mean i'm not going into


---------54:11----------
all the detail because that's you know


---------54:13----------
so for example this paper looked at not


---------54:15----------
only adhd but oppositional defined


---------54:17----------
disorder depression and anxiety


---------54:20----------
i think there's some paper that looks at


---------54:21----------
ocd too


---------54:23----------
and then there's like there's plenty of


---------54:24----------
data let me see if i can find if one of


---------54:26----------
these references i mean i read more than


---------54:28----------
this


---------54:29----------
um let me see if there's a parenting


---------54:32----------
nope


---------54:35----------
yeah so you can also look at this paper


---------54:38----------
which looks at


---------54:41----------
um let me see if i can find this real


---------54:43----------
quick so there's like family stress


---------54:47----------
here we go


---------54:50----------
you ready for it man i'm good sometimes


---------54:52----------
i gotta say


---------54:54----------
dr k is good


---------54:55----------
to remember where the paragraph is in


---------54:57----------
which paper like sometimes i i'm proud


---------54:59----------
of myself


---------55:00----------
so parent adhd symptoms um


---------55:03----------
so


---------55:04----------
using a four-point likert scale if a


---------55:06----------
parent responded two or three for


---------55:07----------
symptoms okay


---------55:09----------
uh


---------55:10----------
so this paper did look at


---------55:13----------
um parent adhd


---------55:16----------
so this is the paper a longitudinal


---------55:18----------
study of the relationship between family


---------55:20----------
functioning and preschool adhd symptoms


---------55:22----------
so let me see if i can find


---------55:24----------
the result


---------55:28----------
okay so this is going to be


---------55:30----------
a bit complicated so i'll try to find


---------55:32----------
this for you all okay


---------55:34----------
um i don't know here we go


---------55:36----------
this is the paper that this is the one


---------55:38----------
we want


---------55:42----------
so this looks at the impact of for


---------55:44----------
example maternal depression


---------55:47----------
right so we can see what the impact is


---------55:49----------
these are statistically significant we


---------55:51----------
can look at parental


---------55:53----------
yeah uh


---------55:55----------
so they don't have they're not looking


---------55:58----------
at


---------55:59----------
one of these is not summarized


---------56:01----------
so you can look at like maternal life


---------56:03----------
stress you know seems to have a negative


---------56:06----------
correlation


---------56:08----------
with


---------56:09----------
adhd


---------56:11----------
let's look at depression and anxiety i


---------56:12----------
think that's what we want


---------56:14----------
actually


---------56:16----------
right and the key thing here is that


---------56:18----------
maternal depression or paternal


---------56:20----------
depression is going to have an impact on


---------56:21----------
the adhd


---------56:23----------
um


---------56:25----------
and then that impact changes based on


---------56:28----------
which category of kid you're talking


---------56:30----------
about


---------56:31----------
and if you guys look here


---------56:33----------
it looks like the impact from mothers is


---------56:35----------
greater than fathers but the short


---------56:36----------
answer is that adhd for parents will


---------56:39----------
absolutely affect the adhd of the child


---------56:42----------
and it's not just


---------56:45----------
adhd and parents right so there's


---------56:47----------
evidence that for example being an


---------56:49----------
overprotective parent


---------56:51----------
increases the anxiety of your child


---------56:54----------
there are even studies that show that


---------56:56----------
giving parents anti-anxiety medication


---------57:00----------
if they have an anxiety disorder has a


---------57:02----------
clinical benefit in the kid


---------57:04----------
so when you are an anxious parent who is


---------57:06----------
overprotective you will pass on that


---------57:09----------
anxiety to the kid and if you medicate


---------57:11----------
yourself or get treatment yourself that


---------57:14----------
will result in your kid having less


---------57:15----------
anxiety


---------57:17----------
so but what should adhd kids say to a


---------57:19----------
single parent to describe uh to them


---------57:22----------
what's happening especially if a parent


---------57:23----------
thinks you're just trying to change them


---------57:25----------
in a negative way


---------57:26----------
my mom tends to blame me for everything


---------57:29----------
but not to accept that i'm in the adhd


---------57:31----------
spectrum


---------57:34----------
so that's a really tough question but a


---------57:37----------
really good question so i would start by


---------57:39----------
having in like open-ended conversation


---------57:42----------
with your parents so start to ask them


---------57:44----------
so like take a particular example


---------57:46----------
like if you had some kind of conflict


---------57:48----------
let's say you didn't take out the trash


---------57:50----------
and your mom gets upset with you and you


---------57:52----------
can sort of ask her like


---------57:54----------
how do you see this situation like what


---------57:56----------
do you think is going on here


---------57:59----------
right and she'll say like oh like you're


---------58:00----------
just


---------58:01----------
you know


---------58:03----------
you're criticizing me like maybe they'll


---------58:04----------
perceive any kind of conversation as a


---------58:06----------
criticism that can happen so this is


---------58:09----------
what's really tricky


---------58:11----------
is that


---------58:12----------
if parents know they're doing a bad job


---------58:15----------
and you try to bring up to them that


---------58:17----------
things are not ideal


---------58:20----------
that suppressed thought of i'm doing a


---------58:22----------
bad job comes roaring back and they push


---------58:25----------
back against it right so there's


---------58:26----------
suppressive mechanisms that like that


---------58:29----------
are pushing down the thought that i'm


---------58:30----------
screwing up because that is the most


---------58:32----------
devastating thought to a parent right if


---------58:34----------
your parent loves you you can get some


---------58:35----------
really bizarre behavior because if i'm


---------58:37----------
screwing up as a parent and i love my


---------58:38----------
kid like that's terrifying i can't i


---------58:40----------
can't deal with that so what i do is i


---------58:43----------
suppress that and then what happens is i


---------58:45----------
end up getting hypersensitive to any


---------58:47----------
kind of criticism of my parenting


---------58:49----------
because deep down i am insecure about it


---------58:52----------
right it's just like any other


---------58:53----------
insecurity if i'm afraid i'm an idiot


---------58:56----------
then what i need is a thousand people to


---------58:58----------
tell me i'm smart every single day


---------59:01----------
and if a single person calls me an idiot


---------59:03----------
i'm gonna push back against them so hard


---------59:05----------
so this is where it's like uh like you


---------59:08----------
know having a gentle conversation with


---------59:10----------
them where if they start to get


---------59:11----------
defensive you can sort of ask what are


---------59:12----------
you hearing me say are you hearing me


---------59:14----------
say that i that you're a bad parent you


---------59:17----------
can just ask them that question


---------59:19----------
and then you can even tell them i'm not


---------59:21----------
saying that i'm just saying that we have


---------59:22----------
a conflict and i'm trying to figure out


---------59:24----------
how we can work through this conflict


---------59:26----------
i don't believe i'm 100 at fault i don't


---------59:29----------
believe you're 100 at fault in fact two


---------59:31----------
people cannot be at fault individually


---------59:34----------
but when you have a relationship


---------59:36----------
there's going to be some kind of


---------59:38----------
friction that occurs because you've got


---------59:39----------
more than one human


---------59:41----------
so i just like to explore with you like


---------59:43----------
what do you think is going on like in


---------59:45----------
our relationship why do you think these


---------59:46----------
conflicts keep happening


---------59:48----------
let's try to understand it because i


---------59:50----------
love you and i want to have a healthy


---------59:52----------
relationship with you and sometimes


---------59:53----------
relationships need a little bit of work


---------59:55----------
what do you think about that


---------59:57----------
right so you can try things like that


---------59:59----------
but that's super challenging like


---------60:00----------
generally speaking you you know if


---------60:01----------
you've got a defensive kind of like


---------60:04----------
suppressing parent and you're a kid with


---------60:06----------
adhd it's hard to do that


---------60:08----------
what you could also do is send them this


---------60:10----------
lecture and just use that as a backdrop
