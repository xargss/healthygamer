---------00:00----------
touch on a couple of things so one is I


---------00:03----------
got a couple of dm's after Devon's last


---------00:07----------
stream about IQ and I thought I would


---------00:09----------
actually just address them I would kind


---------00:13----------
of address them directly so the first is


---------00:16----------
someone was asking I would like to ask


---------00:18----------
about your claim that gaming selects for


---------00:20----------
IQ and the first question is isn't IQ an


---------00:24----------
empty statistic meaning that it doesn't


---------00:26----------
predict anything in the world and


---------00:27----------
doesn't map anything and certainly


---------00:29----------
doesn't define intelligence so the first


---------00:32----------
question is like is IQ and empty


---------00:35----------
statistic that doesn't predict anything


---------00:36----------
in the world the answer to that is no so


---------00:39----------
IQ is a predictor of many things in the


---------00:41----------
world and the next question is doesn't


---------00:44----------
in this IQ define intelligence the


---------00:48----------
answer to that question is also no so IQ


---------00:51----------
does predict to some degree success or


---------00:55----------
does predict to some degree like


---------00:58----------
correlates with like real world stuff


---------01:02----------
but I think the real problem with IQ is


---------01:04----------
that we we think about IQ in a vacuum as


---------01:07----------
being like the most important factor for


---------01:09----------
success so IQ is absolutely a real thing


---------01:12----------
so for example if you test someone a


---------01:14----------
test someone with Down syndrome and you


---------01:17----------
test their IQ you're gonna end up with a


---------01:19----------
number and the ability for that person


---------01:22----------
with Down syndrome to become a


---------01:23----------
successful attorney or investment banker


---------01:26----------
is gonna be very difficult and that's


---------01:28----------
gonna correlate with IQ so if you look


---------01:31----------
at very difficult professions like let's


---------01:33----------
say you've grabbed a group of investment


---------01:36----------
bankers from goldman sachs and you test


---------01:38----------
their IQ that's gonna correlate to the


---------01:40----------
real world like the their IQ number is


---------01:42----------
gonna correlate in some way to like how


---------01:44----------
successful they are in life


---------01:47----------
I think the biggest challenge is that


---------01:49----------
intelligence is not defined by IQ either


---------01:52----------
so we now know that intelligence is


---------01:54----------
complicated and that IQ is actually sort


---------01:56----------
of a general first stabbed by humanity


---------02:00----------
in psychology to try to gauge what is


---------02:02----------
intelligence but one of the areas that I


---------02:05----------
work in a lot is recently people have


---------02:06----------
started to grow like more and more


---------02:08----------
interested in something called EQ which


---------02:10----------
is emotional quotient or emotional


---------02:12----------
intelligence and what people are


---------02:14----------
discovering is that IQ doesn't solve


---------02:17----------
everything so just because you have an


---------02:18----------
IQ doesn't mean that you're gonna be


---------02:19----------
successful in life but there are a lot


---------02:21----------
of other things that contribute to


---------02:23----------
success in life an EQ is sort of the


---------02:26----------
most recent hot topic which is sort of


---------02:28----------
your emotional intelligence so I for


---------02:30----------
example I have an above-average IQ but I


---------02:33----------
don't think that I'm like a genius my IQ


---------02:35----------
is actually not like that far off the


---------02:37----------
charts what I do have is a very high EQ


---------02:40----------
and I think that a lot of my success is


---------02:42----------
not because I'm actually like good at


---------02:44----------
acquiring knowledge but I'm good at


---------02:46----------
understanding people so even when I work


---------02:49----------
with my colleagues like the reason that


---------02:50----------
I'm successful like in my job is because


---------02:52----------
people like me it's like if you're a


---------02:54----------
physician if you want to like do a good


---------02:57----------
job as a physician you need to have like


---------02:59----------
like the nursing staff sort of like like


---------03:01----------
you and support you and you could be as


---------03:04----------
brilliant of a physician as you want to


---------03:06----------
be but like unless the nurses and the


---------03:08----------
support stuff on the floor like you


---------03:09----------
you're like it's gonna be a really hard


---------03:11----------
job that you do so I think that it is


---------03:14----------
important to remember that IQ is


---------03:16----------
absolutely real and also doesn't tell


---------03:18----------
the whole story


---------03:21----------
second question is if we grant that IQ


---------03:23----------
measures intelligence is there any


---------03:25----------
evidence that gaming selects for it


---------03:26----------
absolutely so there was a study that was


---------03:29----------
done by that I think I can find it I'll


---------03:31----------
try to find you guys a reference you see


---------03:33----------
buddy


---------03:42----------
you


---------03:47----------
okay I'm gonna have to find the


---------03:48----------
reference for you guys but um is there a


---------03:51----------
beneath any evidence that gaming selects


---------03:53----------
for IQ absolutely and I think that the


---------03:55----------
the more I've talked to gaming a gamers


---------03:57----------
the more that I realize first of all I


---------03:59----------
do believe that gamers are average


---------04:02----------
smarter than the average population and


---------04:04----------
that's not only my personal belief and


---------04:06----------
experience and there are good reasons


---------04:08----------
for that which I'll explain in a second


---------04:09----------
but that's actually also backed up by


---------04:11----------
data so we know for example like that


---------04:14----------
there's a DoD study that was done in


---------04:16----------
2012 or 2015 I'm gonna just have to find


---------04:18----------
the reference but that actually they


---------04:21----------
tested soldiers and what they found is


---------04:24----------
that like soldiers who played video


---------04:25----------
games had a fifteen to twenty percent


---------04:27----------
higher fluid IQ than soldiers who did it


---------04:29----------
so there's like data to support this and


---------04:31----------
I think like this is really important to


---------04:33----------
understand when you talk to a gamer so


---------04:35----------
I'm gonna tell you guys a story so I was


---------04:38----------
talking to a gamer and I asked him you


---------04:40----------
know when was it that you sort of


---------04:41----------
started playing video games and what was


---------04:43----------
it about video games that you loved so


---------04:44----------
much and what he told me was that he


---------04:47----------
remembers like the like in second grade


---------04:50----------
was like when he sort of fell in love


---------04:51----------
with video games and when I asked him


---------04:53----------
like what do you remember about the


---------04:54----------
second grade he said so I went to school


---------04:56----------
and I I was in math class and the


---------05:00----------
teacher gave passed out math worksheets


---------05:02----------
and I did the math worksheet in about


---------05:05----------
ten minutes and then I walked up to the


---------05:07----------
teacher and I gave her the math


---------05:09----------
worksheet and I said okay so can I have


---------05:11----------
what's next and the teachers response


---------05:14----------
was that's all we're doing for today


---------05:16----------
you'll get the next worksheet the next


---------05:18----------
day and so he went he looked like went


---------05:20----------
and sat at his desk and like got bored


---------05:21----------
for the next 45 minutes of the class and


---------05:24----------
then what happened is he would go home


---------05:25----------
and then he would play a video game and


---------05:28----------
when he beat level one he didn't have to


---------05:31----------
wait till tomorrow to play level two


---------05:33----------
like level two is waiting for him so if


---------05:35----------
you have a smart kid what are they going


---------05:37----------
to gravitate towards are they gonna


---------05:39----------
gravitate towards a school system that


---------05:41----------
moves at the pace of the slowest child


---------05:44----------
or if you give a smart kid something


---------05:46----------
that is paced perfectly towards you that


---------05:49----------
if you fail at level one you get to redo


---------05:51----------
level one and if you beat level one


---------05:52----------
level two is there and if you beat level


---------05:54----------
two level three is there like which one


---------05:56----------
are you gonna find intellectually more


---------05:58----------
engaging like you're absolutely going to


---------06:00----------
find video


---------06:00----------
games more engaging and the far the more


---------06:03----------
you outpaced school the more attracted


---------06:07----------
to videogames you're gonna be because if


---------06:09----------
school is perfectly paced to you let's


---------06:11----------
say that you're actually kind of like


---------06:12----------
slow like I don't mean that to be


---------06:13----------
derogatory but let's say it takes you


---------06:15----------
like 50 minutes to do the math worksheet


---------06:18----------
then school is gonna kind of be paced -


---------06:21----------
and video games don't offer you anything


---------06:22----------
outside of school because you're being


---------06:24----------
intellectually challenged in kids when


---------06:27----------
they're growing up they crave


---------06:28----------
intellectual challenge that's like


---------06:30----------
there's a lot of there are a lot of


---------06:31----------
studies about this as well that like


---------06:33----------
children who are growing up crave


---------06:36----------
challenge and want to learn how to do


---------06:38----------
things and want to master things there's


---------06:40----------
this study there's this field of


---------06:41----------
psychology that's sort of dubbed intent


---------06:43----------
to mastery where people basically


---------06:45----------
figured out that like one of the most


---------06:46----------
fundamental human drives is to get


---------06:48----------
better at stuff and when you give a


---------06:50----------
child like an option like school which


---------06:53----------
doesn't really challenge them


---------06:54----------
individually and you give them an option


---------06:56----------
like a video game which is perfectly


---------06:58----------
challenging them and even after you beat


---------06:59----------
the game you can open up another game


---------07:01----------
and like start playing that and you're


---------07:02----------
challenged again so the smarter kids are


---------07:05----------
gonna gravitate towards games because


---------07:07----------
games give you that sense of challenge


---------07:09----------
and they also like give you things to


---------07:11----------
think about they give you systems to


---------07:12----------
master and so if you're hungry for that


---------07:14----------
kind of stuff if you're smart in the


---------07:16----------
real world like if you work it like


---------07:17----------
let's say you know flipping burgers or


---------07:19----------
like serving coffee at like Starbucks


---------07:21----------
like that's gonna be only so


---------07:22----------
intellectually challenging and so that's


---------07:24----------
gonna be sufficient for some people but


---------07:26----------
if it's intellectually unsatisfying and


---------07:29----------
then you have the option to play a video


---------07:31----------
game you're gonna gravitate towards that


---------07:33----------
so I absolutely do believe that like IQ


---------07:36----------
measures some degree of intelligence and


---------07:38----------
that there's evidence that gaming


---------07:40----------
selects for people who have high IQ


---------07:42----------
[Music]


---------07:45----------
and so then this goes on to the next


---------07:47----------
question about IQ isn't IQ sort of like


---------07:49----------
the DSM where researchers wanted to


---------07:50----------
figure out whether they were testing the


---------07:52----------
same thing so devise this test that


---------07:53----------
means smart but doesn't encapsulate the


---------07:56----------
whole complexity of the mind absolutely


---------07:58----------
that's exactly what they were doing so


---------07:59----------
researchers started to made some basic


---------08:02----------
observations that if you look in the


---------08:04----------
world


---------08:05----------
some people seem to be generally


---------08:07----------
speaking like more capable than other


---------08:09----------
people


---------08:09----------
that some people like someone who has


---------08:12----------
like Down syndrome for example or that


---------08:14----------
like someone is just you know they


---------08:15----------
really struggle in school like they have


---------08:17----------
trouble like problem solving they have


---------08:19----------
trouble holding jobs and that there are


---------08:20----------
some people who are who can be


---------08:22----------
successful like in generally speaking or


---------08:24----------
like just more successful so researchers


---------08:27----------
looked at the difference that there's


---------08:28----------
like a variance and intelligence within


---------08:30----------
the human population and they started


---------08:32----------
out by saying okay how can we start to


---------08:34----------
like systematically and scientifically


---------08:35----------
understand that and they developed IQ in


---------08:38----------
the second part of the question is what


---------08:40----------
doesn't encapsulate the whole complexity


---------08:42----------
of the mind and the answer to that is


---------08:43----------
absolutely yes


---------08:45----------
IQ does not incapsulate the whole like


---------08:47----------
complexity of the mind and and so that's


---------08:51----------
but we got to start somewhere right so


---------08:53----------
if we want to study something like we


---------08:54----------
have to start with the most basic


---------08:56----------
observation we can make and over time


---------08:58----------
we're going to improve and refine our


---------09:01----------
understanding of this concept so we


---------09:03----------
started with IQ and now we're moving on


---------09:05----------
to EQ and I think that if you look at


---------09:07----------
studies of Ayurveda which is like mental


---------09:10----------
health like a traditional Indian


---------09:12----------
medicine Ayurvedic goes as far as to say


---------09:14----------
that there are different kinds of


---------09:16----------
cognitive fingerprints and there are


---------09:17----------
different qualities of memory that it's


---------09:19----------
not just good memory or bad memory but


---------09:21----------
some kinds of minds learn things very


---------09:24----------
quickly but also forget things very


---------09:25----------
quickly and other kinds of minds are


---------09:27----------
slow to learn but also slow to forget


---------09:30----------
and so I think there's there's an


---------09:33----------
immense amount of complexity in


---------09:35----------
understanding intelligence but I think


---------09:36----------
IQ is a great place to start and is also


---------09:39----------
incomplete


---------09:42----------
furthermore viewing intelligence is this


---------09:44----------
instrument that people have different


---------09:46----------
efficiency rating is based on a specific


---------09:48----------
perspective intelligence ignoring all of


---------09:51----------
the relevant social economic or


---------09:52----------
educational factors that contribute to


---------09:54----------
it yes so if you look at so IQ I think


---------09:57----------
is to a certain degree somewhat


---------09:59----------
independent of social economic and


---------10:01----------
educational factors because I think


---------10:03----------
generally speaking the way that we


---------10:04----------
define IQ is sort of like raw


---------10:06----------
intellectual capability but if we look


---------10:09----------
at and some of that may be influenced by


---------10:11----------
like social and economic factors or


---------10:13----------
economical factors but what we do know


---------10:16----------
is that like those factors correlate


---------10:18----------
with like worldly success in a way that


---------10:21----------
is you know more important than IQ so


---------10:23----------
you can be like I think that I've met


---------10:26----------
poor people who have very high IQs and


---------10:28----------
I've met rich people who have very high


---------10:30----------
IQs I've met different people of


---------10:32----------
different ethnicities who have you know


---------10:35----------
very high IQs and very low IQs and when


---------10:38----------
you look at like worldly success I think


---------10:40----------
social economic and educational factors


---------10:43----------
correlate with worldly success in a way


---------10:46----------
that far outweighs IQ so the reason that


---------10:49----------
you have so many Indian doctors in the


---------10:51----------
United States so like I'm Indian or


---------10:54----------
South Asian or East Asian so like I


---------10:56----------
remember when I went to my like intern


---------10:58----------
orientation at Mass General Hospital


---------11:00----------
it's like a room of a hundred and twenty


---------11:03----------
like basically interns at Harvard


---------11:05----------
Medical School in one of the best


---------11:06----------
hospitals in the country like a third of


---------11:10----------
them were or probably 40% or maybe even


---------11:13----------
50% were either South Asian or East Asia


---------11:16----------
so like 20 percent of the room was like


---------11:19----------
Indian or Pakistani or Bangladeshi or


---------11:22----------
something like that and that vastly out


---------11:24----------
represents like Indians or like South


---------11:26----------
Asians or like maybe 1 to 2% of the


---------11:28----------
population of the United States but you


---------11:30----------
go to like internship orientation at


---------11:32----------
Mass General Hospital and it's like 20%


---------11:34----------
of the population is that because Indian


---------11:36----------
people are smarter no it's because there


---------11:39----------
was like a selection effect where my


---------11:40----------
parents are both physicians so like the


---------11:42----------
people who rose to the top of India left


---------11:45----------
and came to the United States and then


---------11:47----------
their kids not only do they have high


---------11:50----------
IQs but more importantly like my parents


---------11:53----------
were really really focused on like


---------11:54----------
instilling


---------11:55----------
me like a strong work ethic which I


---------11:57----------
rebelled against 100% became very lazy


---------11:59----------
and played like Dungeons & Dragons and


---------12:00----------
video games growing up but they tried to


---------12:02----------
really teach me a lot of stuff about the


---------12:04----------
importance of knowledge and I think even


---------12:06----------
though I ignored like 50% or like 90% of


---------12:09----------
what they said there was so much general


---------12:12----------
stuff about like the importance of


---------12:15----------
knowledge and work ethic and study that


---------12:16----------
got baked into me even though I was


---------12:18----------
rebelling against it so if we look at


---------12:20----------
real world success it has a lot more to


---------12:24----------
do with IQ it has a lot to do with


---------12:25----------
social stuff it has a lot to do with


---------12:27----------
economic stuff it has a lot to do with


---------12:28----------
family factors and IQ is still a big


---------12:31----------
part of it right because at the end of


---------12:33----------
the day if you have someone who is born


---------12:35----------
with like fetal alcohol syndrome or has


---------12:37----------
like brain damage during duda like


---------12:40----------
hypoxia during birth their capacity to


---------12:43----------
like rise to the top of a field is going


---------12:46----------
to be like heavily influenced by


---------12:48----------
something going on in their brain which


---------12:49----------
is sort of like IQ so I think IQ is


---------12:52----------
important and also insufficient and so


---------12:56----------
this goes to kind of the the next two


---------12:58----------
comments so this is kind of this guy


---------13:00----------
sharing an opinion dr. whims so he or


---------13:02----------
she I would like to know why why do you


---------13:04----------
subscribe to IQ I thought modern


---------13:05----------
psychology sociology and anthropology


---------13:07----------
have moved past IQ i subscribe to IQ


---------13:11----------
because there's an overwhelming data


---------13:12----------
that suggests that it's like a useful


---------13:14----------
metric and then the second piece is I


---------13:16----------
thought modern psychology sociology and


---------13:18----------
anthropology move past IQ yeah they have


---------13:20----------
and I have to but like let's remember


---------13:23----------
that when by moving past that we've


---------13:26----------
realized that the issues are more


---------13:27----------
complex and there are more variables at


---------13:29----------
play but IQ is still a useful like


---------13:31----------
indicator of stuff


---------13:33----------
and then this is the last and I think


---------13:35----------
most important question don't you think


---------13:37----------
telling people they are addicted to


---------13:38----------
video games because they are smart


---------13:40----------
implanting some dangerous belief about


---------13:41----------
themselves and if they are better than


---------13:43----------
others absolutely and I think it's true


---------13:46----------
right so I think that if you want to


---------13:48----------
overcome gaming addiction you need to


---------13:51----------
understand what you are and part of


---------13:54----------
understanding what you are is in


---------13:55----------
recognizing that you're probably smarter


---------13:57----------
than the average person and like this is


---------14:00----------
really important because then the next


---------14:02----------
step that you need to realize because


---------14:03----------
our vows I do ver values intelligence is


---------14:06----------
that being smarter than your neighbor


---------14:08----------
doesn't isn't enough it actually doesn't


---------14:12----------
mean [ __ ] like just because you're the


---------14:14----------
smartest kid in the room doesn't mean


---------14:15----------
you're gonna be successful but I do


---------14:17----------
think it's very important for gamers to


---------14:19----------
understand that they for the most part


---------14:21----------
they are very smart and if they can


---------14:23----------
figure out how to apply that


---------14:25----------
intelligence in the real world the sky


---------14:27----------
is the limit and I think that's really


---------14:29----------
important is it a dangerous belief


---------14:31----------
absolutely but I also believe it's a


---------14:33----------
true belief I also believe that a lot of


---------14:35----------
what holds gamers back is that they


---------14:37----------
recognize that they're smarter than


---------14:39----------
other people that gives them an ego


---------14:42----------
boost and the ego boost actually keeps


---------14:44----------
them complacent they feel like they're


---------14:47----------
better than other people so that they


---------14:48----------
don't have to work hard it's kind of


---------14:51----------
like you build this like house of cards


---------14:54----------
which is your intelligence and you


---------14:56----------
believe that you're smarter than other


---------14:57----------
people and like the simple matter is you


---------15:00----------
probably are smarter than most other


---------15:02----------
people than the average person and then


---------15:05----------
the problem is like that becomes your


---------15:06----------
escape that becomes your justification


---------15:09----------
and that becomes your source of


---------15:10----------
avoidance like since you're smarter like


---------15:12----------
what happens is the more you believe


---------15:15----------
you're smarter than other people like


---------15:16----------
that boosts your ego and then you can


---------15:18----------
like be content because all of the the


---------15:21----------
negative emotions that you get get


---------15:22----------
buried by your ego and get buried by the


---------15:25----------
idea that like oh that person may be


---------15:27----------
more successful than I am but like


---------15:29----------
they're not as smart as I am so like


---------15:32----------
that makes me feel okay about myself and


---------15:34----------
like that's the problem so I do believe


---------15:37----------
that recognizing you're intelligent is a


---------15:40----------
gamer and more intelligent than the


---------15:41----------
average person is a very important


---------15:44----------
realization and I think it's a dangerous


---------15:46----------
belief and I


---------15:47----------
think that what we have to do is not


---------15:48----------
avoid dangerous beliefs but like


---------15:51----------
recognize that we have dangerous beliefs


---------15:53----------
and then figure out how to overcome them


---------15:55----------
like that's the whole point like we want


---------15:56----------
to face the music we want to face the


---------15:58----------
problem and we want to overcome the


---------16:00----------
problem


---------16:01----------
um so I don't think we should avoid that


---------16:04----------
discussion about IQ in fact I think it's


---------16:05----------
like really important for like gamers to


---------16:07----------
understand how they're different so that


---------16:09----------
you can get into the process of like


---------16:10----------
overcoming you know what your challenges


---------16:12----------
are but you have to know what you're


---------16:14----------
dealing with like I think it's foolish


---------16:15----------
to ignore the hand that you're dealt in


---------16:17----------
life and if you have an ace when it


---------16:19----------
comes to IQ like you should absolutely


---------16:20----------
understand that because part of your


---------16:22----------
road for it is in recognizing okay like


---------16:24----------
even if I'm smarter than the average


---------16:26----------
population and if I'm stuck in life that


---------16:28----------
must mean that the answer lies somewhere


---------16:30----------
outside of IQ and I think that


---------16:32----------
recognition is one of the most important


---------16:34----------
things that a gamer can ever sort of


---------16:36----------
realize


---------16:37----------
[Music]


---------16:42----------
yeah and so I guess like I see a lot of


---------16:45----------
people sort of posting and chat about


---------16:47----------
how they were like they did


---------16:51----------
they did kind of smarter or they did


---------16:53----------
well in school they were told


---------16:57----------
they were smart and like that's what I


---------17:00----------
see like that's the experience that I


---------17:02----------
get with gamers
