---------00:00----------
yeah great question so it starts by


---------00:02----------
recognizing


---------00:03----------
that like you're looking for answers


---------00:05----------
fundamentally because this is the way


---------00:07----------
you've been trained


---------00:08----------
so like literally the reason i ask you


---------00:10----------
the question where do you get the idea


---------00:12----------
that there is


---------00:13----------
a formula for success it's because like


---------00:16----------
everywhere around you like even though


---------00:17----------
you've figured out and this is huge for


---------00:19----------
you by the way i think it's awesome that


---------00:20----------
you figured this out


---------00:21----------
that your formula for success is not


---------00:23----------
your parents formula for success


---------00:26----------
the next step is for you to figure out


---------00:28----------
is there a formula for success


---------00:33----------
i'm actually not home i'm uh stuck


---------00:36----------
at hamburg germany right now because of


---------00:38----------
the corona


---------00:40----------
yeah so i have to like stream from phone


---------00:42----------
and work from chrome and like do


---------00:43----------
everything from my phone right now oh


---------00:45----------
wow so


---------00:46----------
yeah i'm sorry okay you're stranded


---------00:49----------

---------00:50----------
it's okay it's an experience you know


---------00:53----------

---------00:55----------

---------00:55----------

---------01:06----------
uh mira what are we talking about today


---------01:09----------
oh so much i wanted to talk to you about


---------01:13----------
well um first of all i wanted to say


---------01:16----------
that


---------01:17----------
i think what you've been doing on twitch


---------01:19----------
is


---------01:20----------
absolutely amazing just like


---------01:24----------
absolutely astonishing like uh


---------01:27----------
i'm just grateful that people


---------01:30----------
actually trying to bring awareness into


---------01:34----------
mental health in the gaming community


---------01:36----------
because i've been streaming on twitch


---------01:37----------
for like over five years and i've never


---------01:39----------
ever seen anything like so useful


---------01:43----------
like it's please keep doing what you're


---------01:46----------
doing that's all i wanted to say


---------01:47----------
thank you so much i i really appreciate


---------01:49----------
the the


---------01:50----------
support and and kind of the positive


---------01:53----------
wishes it keeps


---------01:54----------
us going so i'm grateful for your


---------01:56----------
support


---------01:58----------
yeah so yeah um i started


---------02:01----------
watching you from the very beginning


---------02:03----------
actually like the first stream that you


---------02:05----------
did with byron


---------02:06----------
yeah the first time that you stream with


---------02:08----------
byron i actually


---------02:10----------
uh watched the whole thing and i had


---------02:14----------
like a very strong reaction to that


---------02:16----------
uh for two reasons actually


---------02:20----------
well the first one is because i could


---------02:22----------
relate to like what byron was talking


---------02:23----------
about


---------02:24----------
um me and byron we don't keep in touch


---------02:27----------
but like back like


---------02:28----------
few like years ago we kind of had a


---------02:30----------
similar


---------02:31----------
like we connected on a level of like


---------02:33----------
depression and like how we


---------02:34----------
felt yeah um so when he was talking


---------02:37----------
about all these issues with you


---------02:39----------
it just it was like trigger point for me


---------02:42----------
so i was kind of like reliving some of


---------02:45----------
my experiences and all the conversations


---------02:47----------
that you were having with him i found


---------02:48----------
very helpful um like i kept reflecting


---------02:51----------
on that and


---------02:53----------
yeah so obviously that had um an impact


---------02:56----------
on me


---------02:57----------
and as i mentioned like the fact that i


---------03:00----------
haven't seen anything like this


---------03:01----------
useful on twitch for years and years i


---------03:04----------
mean yeah


---------03:05----------
twitch just brings some entertainment


---------03:08----------
here and there


---------03:08----------
but like actual like


---------03:11----------
knowledge like actual help


---------03:15----------
like it's just i just think it's amazing


---------03:17----------
so for me it was like wow


---------03:20----------
yeah so i i think um you know a lot of


---------03:22----------
people i think


---------03:23----------
byron's courage was really instrumental


---------03:26----------
in in


---------03:26----------
you know demonstrating to people that


---------03:28----------
like you can talk about things that are


---------03:30----------
normally hidden


---------03:31----------
and yeah and that you don't have to be


---------03:33----------
ashamed or afraid of


---------03:34----------
of what's on the inside and yeah


---------03:38----------
so what was it about and the other thing


---------03:40----------
that's you know i guess not that


---------03:42----------
surprising but i think a lot of


---------03:44----------
streamers and our community because


---------03:46----------
streamers are like


---------03:47----------
you know we think about streamers as


---------03:49----------
different but i think they're like


---------03:50----------
they're part of


---------03:51----------
our community right like they're just of


---------03:52----------
course yeah and


---------03:54----------
and so depression and mental health


---------03:56----------
problems are something that we all


---------03:58----------
struggle with


---------03:59----------
um and so was there something in


---------04:01----------
particular that like sort of


---------04:03----------
was uh you know resonated with you about


---------04:06----------
the the talk with byron


---------04:11----------
well yeah i already mentioned that


---------04:14----------
me and him like interacted before in the


---------04:16----------
past and


---------04:17----------
there was this one discussion that i had


---------04:20----------
with him


---------04:22----------
one-on-one with off stream we were


---------04:24----------
talking about


---------04:29----------
not feeling much


---------04:32----------
you know that issue when you feel like


---------04:35----------
you


---------04:35----------
have almost everything in life well you


---------04:37----------
know that like a normal person would


---------04:39----------
think they need to feel happy but you


---------04:41----------
just don't


---------04:42----------
feel happy and on top of that you just


---------04:46----------
don't feel much at all


---------04:49----------
and yes exactly


---------04:53----------
and like the more you you dug it with


---------04:55----------
byron the more like you realize that


---------04:56----------
there was


---------04:57----------
traumas that you know sort of affected


---------05:00----------
the way that he is


---------05:01----------
so i really i try to because i try to


---------05:05----------
contact you uh pretty much right after


---------05:07----------
you talk to byron


---------05:08----------
but it was a little hard to get in touch


---------05:10----------
so um but i didn't get disencouraged


---------05:12----------
no no it's absolutely understandable you


---------05:14----------
have other things to do


---------05:16----------
so um i try to sort of dig that on my


---------05:19----------
own and


---------05:19----------
i try to good for you um yeah i just try


---------05:23----------
to get like information


---------05:24----------
online and like work on myself and


---------05:25----------
figure out what was really wrong


---------05:28----------
and i mean i progressed kind of


---------05:31----------
ish i had some progress through that but


---------05:34----------
um can you tell us a little bit about


---------05:36----------
that journey


---------05:39----------
uh yeah i can


---------05:43----------
um well


---------05:46----------
i did realize that a lot


---------05:49----------
of my mental issues just came from the


---------05:51----------
way my parents raised me always in it


---------05:54----------
like that with everyone pretty much


---------05:56----------
and um a lot of it i didn't even realize


---------06:00----------
that i


---------06:01----------
had because i thought that's just how


---------06:05----------
world is


---------06:06----------
you know because their parents raised a


---------06:07----------
certain way and we like believe that's


---------06:09----------
it


---------06:09----------
absolutely yeah so it's kind of hard to


---------06:13----------
reflect on that like on your own but um


---------06:16----------
absolutely


---------06:17----------
so um let me just


---------06:21----------
sorry one second i'm gonna sit cross


---------06:24----------
like that's the tapping sorry about that


---------06:26----------
twitch


---------06:26----------
yeah that's what i'm doing too so


---------06:29----------
mira would you like like is it okay if i


---------06:32----------
ask you some questions about that


---------06:35----------
okay and if you know if there's anything


---------06:37----------
that i ask that you're not comfortable


---------06:38----------
answering just let me know and


---------06:40----------
and you know you don't have to say


---------06:42----------
anything that you're not comfortable


---------06:43----------
with


---------06:44----------
um so let's start with the so so when


---------06:46----------
you said that it was


---------06:47----------
a lot of it has to do with the way that


---------06:49----------
your parents raised you can you tell me


---------06:50----------
a little bit about what growing up was


---------06:52----------
like for you


---------06:55----------
yes i can


---------06:58----------
um i grew up in um


---------07:07----------
i have to be careful with the words i


---------07:08----------
choose you


---------07:10----------
um careful about the words you choose


---------07:16----------
uh my parents they're more or less like


---------07:18----------
public figures so


---------07:20----------
i have to like be careful okay


---------07:23----------
uh-huh so and that's like another big


---------07:27----------
thing that added to my childhood because


---------07:28----------
you can


---------07:29----------
truly do what you want


---------07:32----------
all the time you have to like be very


---------07:35----------
careful about like


---------07:35----------
how you present yourself okay


---------07:39----------
um not so much i guess on twitch they


---------07:42----------
can twitch


---------07:42----------
that's why i like try to you know keep


---------07:45----------
that part separate very separate


---------07:47----------
because i feel like i can um i feel more


---------07:49----------
free to express myself and twitch


---------07:51----------
but growing up i had a pretty strict


---------07:55----------
upbringing i guess


---------07:56----------
like my parents were open-minded about


---------07:58----------
some things but for the most part they


---------08:00----------
had a very specific ideas


---------08:03----------
about how we should be raised and like


---------08:06----------
what we need to do in life um and how


---------08:10----------
um i guess uh


---------08:14----------
what else we need to do to be happy and


---------08:16----------
stay sort of


---------08:17----------
uh very controlling in my opinion


---------08:20----------
and what did they think you needed to do


---------08:23----------
in life


---------08:25----------
you know the normal stuff you


---------08:30----------
graduate school then you go to college


---------08:33----------
you graduate college and of course you


---------08:34----------
have to have very good grades everywhere


---------08:36----------
and you have to be on your best behavior


---------08:38----------
everywhere


---------08:39----------
you have to make them proud what does


---------08:42----------
best behavior look like


---------08:47----------
you just have to be the best you just


---------08:50----------
have to be the best like there's nothing


---------08:51----------
else


---------08:52----------
like you have to have a ways like this


---------08:54----------
that's it like i just remember school is


---------08:57----------
very


---------08:57----------
stressful mainly because of that


---------09:00----------
so yeah and then when you graduate


---------09:01----------
college you need to


---------09:03----------
um you know you don't have to get a job


---------09:05----------
just like go straight into


---------09:07----------
marriage because like you have to have a


---------09:09----------
husband you have to have kids


---------09:11----------
and you're gonna feel happy there you


---------09:13----------
know


---------09:14----------
but then the time comes you realize okay


---------09:17----------
check check check check


---------09:19----------
i feel empty and what were the checks


---------09:23----------
what were the boxes that you had checked


---------09:26----------
okay i didn't get the


---------09:30----------
i didn't get the kids back i didn't get


---------09:32----------
a few boxes


---------09:33----------
but um i think it's really good that i


---------09:37----------
didn't have kids so i think you have to


---------09:39----------
be mentally very


---------09:41----------
healthy and financially also ready to


---------09:45----------
raise somebody else because if you have


---------09:46----------
issues like your kid's just gonna copy


---------09:48----------
you and that's


---------09:49----------
to be bad news bears so yeah um


---------09:52----------
so it sounds like you did well


---------09:54----------
academically


---------09:56----------
yes i did and did you


---------09:59----------
yeah sorry go ahead but even that like


---------10:02----------
didn't bring


---------10:03----------
much satisfaction to my life


---------10:06----------
i don't know i had some good jobs as


---------10:08----------
well um


---------10:11----------
just just nothing really it just all


---------10:13----------
felt very


---------10:14----------
off and i couldn't understand like why


---------10:17----------
and like lately when i started realizing


---------10:19----------
like analyzing things i was like hey


---------10:21----------
maybe like that over controlling


---------10:24----------
behavior from my parents just kind of


---------10:26----------
resulted in me


---------10:28----------
making one choices for myself in terms


---------10:30----------
of like that's not what i wanted that's


---------10:31----------
why i don't feel happy that's what they


---------10:33----------
wanted for me


---------10:34----------
sure so what do you want


---------10:48----------
like evelyn


---------10:53----------
i mean so so here's what i'm hearing


---------10:54----------
mira


---------10:57----------
you told us what you've you've given us


---------10:59----------
a nice picture of what your parents


---------11:01----------
wanted for you and you're telling me


---------11:04----------
that you kind of did what they wanted


---------11:06----------
basically right for the most part


---------11:10----------
for the most part yes and as you sort of


---------11:13----------
lived the life


---------11:14----------
they had wanted for you you


---------11:18----------
noticed yourself feeling not happy as


---------11:21----------
you should have been


---------11:22----------
and also maybe a little bit numb and


---------11:25----------
feeling a little bit


---------11:26----------
empty


---------11:30----------
and so then the question becomes okay if


---------11:32----------
that's if that's what they wanted


---------11:34----------
and we're thinking about like i'm


---------11:36----------
assuming that numbness and emptiness is


---------11:37----------
a problem for you is that


---------11:40----------
fair


---------11:42----------
i mean


---------11:47----------
should it be a problem other people say


---------11:50----------
it should be


---------11:52----------
uh yeah some people do believe that it


---------11:54----------
is a problem but


---------11:57----------
so what can i help you with today


---------12:03----------
how exactly uh can i ask you a question


---------12:06----------
about like your career path


---------12:08----------
sure do you remember the moment when you


---------12:11----------
realized like


---------12:12----------
you 100 want to do what you're doing


---------12:15----------
right now


---------12:15----------
like you want to study in that area and


---------12:17----------
you want to become who you are


---------12:21----------
yes and no so i would say that i had


---------12:24----------
a hundred percent knowledge of who i


---------12:26----------
wanted to be


---------12:28----------
and i was a hundred percent confident in


---------12:30----------
that and i turned out to be wrong


---------12:34----------
and then i kind of figured something out


---------12:36----------
and i sort of settled


---------12:38----------
for second best and then at another


---------12:41----------
point i sort of figured out a hundred


---------12:42----------
percent of who i wanted to be


---------12:44----------
and then i turned out to be wrong


---------12:47----------
and now i have a sense of a hundred


---------12:50----------
percent of who i want to be for the


---------12:52----------
third time in my life


---------12:53----------
and so far it seems to be going well and


---------12:56----------
each of those things when i knew what i


---------12:59----------
wanted to be i think i gained a lot from


---------13:00----------
it it's not like there was


---------13:02----------
failure right so


---------13:05----------
i think that you know there's this idea


---------13:07----------
that you have this revelation


---------13:09----------
and then you figure out what your true


---------13:11----------
path is in life but


---------13:12----------
in my experience it's a series of


---------13:14----------
revelations


---------13:16----------
that are kind of wrong and each of those


---------13:18----------
brings you one step


---------13:20----------
closer to like what you should be doing


---------13:24----------
do you feel like what you doing right


---------13:25----------
now in life


---------13:27----------
might be your life's purpose in terms of


---------13:30----------
your


---------13:31----------
job in terms of occupation i think it's


---------13:34----------
my life's purpose now


---------13:36----------
but what life has taught me is that your


---------13:38----------
purpose in life changes over time


---------13:42----------
right has it always been your occupation


---------13:46----------
like your main focus of your life


---------13:50----------
no so i view occupation is a vehicle


---------13:53----------
to accomplish what you want


---------13:57----------
right so like i'm a medical doctor but


---------13:59----------
like i don't have to be


---------14:02----------
so what i'm doing today doesn't have


---------14:04----------
much to do with being a medical doctor


---------14:06----------
right like


---------14:10----------
so so medical doctor is a part of my


---------14:12----------
training but what i'm really trying to


---------14:13----------
do is


---------14:14----------
help gamers and i teach them lots of


---------14:16----------
things that are completely outside of


---------14:17----------
medicine


---------14:18----------
so medical doctor like my occupation


---------14:20----------
serves my goal


---------14:22----------
it isn't my goal and this i think is


---------14:24----------
exactly what maybe like your parents


---------14:26----------
tried to


---------14:27----------
emphasize for you is that they felt like


---------14:30----------
a particular occupation


---------14:31----------
or a particular part a particular piece


---------14:34----------
of your life


---------14:35----------
is the goal for me it's not the goal


---------14:37----------
it's just a means


---------14:40----------
you play video games oh yeah i've been


---------14:42----------
doing since i was a kid


---------14:46----------
uh well now that i don't have my


---------14:47----------
computer i just been playing lots of


---------14:49----------
hearthstone


---------14:50----------
it's like a strategy card game so


---------14:53----------
i'm a boomer but not that much of a


---------14:55----------
boomer


---------14:57----------
so so when we think about like you know


---------15:00----------
like


---------15:00----------
when you're playing hearthstone you can


---------15:02----------
kind of think about like you have a


---------15:03----------
class right


---------15:04----------
and your class is kind of like your


---------15:05----------
occupation but the goal of the game


---------15:08----------
is like independent of what class you're


---------15:10----------
playing the goal of the game is to win


---------15:12----------
and the class just simply gives you a


---------15:15----------
certain set of tools to accomplish your


---------15:17----------
goal


---------15:17----------
and i think the purpose is not to be a


---------15:19----------
mage


---------15:21----------
the purpose is to win the game and if


---------15:22----------
you are a mage


---------15:24----------
then you need to be using like ice block


---------15:26----------
and blizzard


---------15:28----------
right does that make sense so i don't


---------15:30----------
think that my occupation


---------15:31----------
is my goal it's just i'm trying to help


---------15:34----------
people in the way in which i'm helping


---------15:36----------
people is like


---------15:37----------
has to do with like my particular class


---------15:39----------
it's almost like one of the you know the


---------15:40----------
tavern brawls


---------15:41----------
where you get like two classes you know


---------15:44----------
so like


---------15:45----------
what i am is like a mixture of two


---------15:46----------
things like it's part monk and part


---------15:48----------
doctor


---------15:50----------
and i combine both of those to like have


---------15:52----------
a set of


---------15:53----------
cards that then i use to help people but


---------15:55----------
the goal is really to help people but


---------15:56----------
you don't have to do what i do does that


---------15:58----------
make sense


---------15:58----------
like i don't think yeah absolutely yeah


---------16:01----------
i actually love when you make those


---------16:03----------
comparisons of like


---------16:05----------
our lives and video games like i've


---------16:07----------
noticed you do it often on streams it


---------16:09----------
just


---------16:09----------
helps people relate a lot better so yeah


---------16:12----------
i think there's deep deep wisdom within


---------16:14----------
video games


---------16:16----------
agreed so if video games would try to


---------16:20----------
win


---------16:20----------
what do you think winning would relate


---------16:22----------
to in real life


---------16:27----------
uh


---------16:31----------
yeah so i mean for me or for other


---------16:33----------
people for you


---------16:34----------
i would like to hear your opinion i


---------16:36----------
value sure


---------16:38----------
so for me it's like i see people


---------16:40----------
suffering and that matters to me


---------16:42----------
so what i determine like what winning


---------16:44----------
looks like comes from an internal sense


---------16:49----------
like i see a lot of people you know i


---------16:52----------
get messages and stuff


---------16:53----------
and and i really am sorry that we didn't


---------16:55----------
get back to you when you reached out to


---------16:56----------
us but we just


---------16:57----------
get like literally thousands of people


---------16:58----------
reaching out to us and each of those


---------17:01----------
messages i don't have time to read them


---------17:02----------
all but like i try to read as many


---------17:04----------
as i can i actually try to respond to as


---------17:05----------
many as i can and i have a choice


---------17:07----------
between


---------17:08----------
responding to all the messages that that


---------17:09----------
i get or having a job and twitch


---------17:12----------
streaming and being with my kids


---------17:14----------
and and every time i get one of those


---------17:17----------
messages and i read it i see that


---------17:19----------
someone is like suffering and lost


---------17:21----------
and i feel like i should help them so


---------17:24----------
that's what winning looks like to me


---------17:25----------
it's like helping all these random


---------17:27----------
people who are like messaging me


---------17:29----------
and in a sense it's also helping the


---------17:31----------
person that i used to be


---------17:32----------
like i remember what i used to feel like


---------17:34----------
and i remember feeling directionless


---------17:36----------
and i remember so i have parents that


---------17:38----------
are somewhat like yours i mean


---------17:40----------
i'm the son of two physicians who are


---------17:42----------
highly highly


---------17:44----------
motivated and emphasized education and


---------17:46----------
grades


---------17:48----------
and you know my dad when i was growing


---------17:49----------
up told i have an older brother so he


---------17:51----------
said one of y'all is going to be a


---------17:52----------
doctor and one of y'all is going to be a


---------17:54----------
lawyer


---------17:55----------
and those were our options and


---------17:58----------
and so sound familiar yeah


---------18:02----------
um so you know i i grew up and sort of


---------18:05----------
also recognized that like i didn't value


---------18:07----------
the things that


---------18:08----------
my family members valued like i didn't


---------18:12----------
care about being a doctor like i did it


---------18:14----------
because of ego and i did it because


---------18:16----------
when i was 15 and people asked me at


---------18:18----------
like a party


---------18:20----------
like you know my parents friends would


---------18:21----------
ask me what do you want to be when you


---------18:22----------
grow up and i would say doctor everyone


---------18:24----------
would get impressed


---------18:26----------
and they would like it was like i had


---------18:27----------
accomplished something like they would


---------18:28----------
give me praise


---------18:29----------
for stating something that i wanted to


---------18:31----------
be 15 years from now


---------18:33----------
and that's a really bizarre


---------18:35----------
reinforcement for a 15 year old


---------18:37----------
you know yeah even now i notice it with


---------18:40----------
my kids like when when my four-year-old


---------18:42----------
says yeah i want to be a doctor when i


---------18:43----------
grow up everyone's like so impressed


---------18:47----------
and it's like


---------18:51----------
so i i mean that's what drives me is


---------18:55----------
like helping


---------18:56----------
people and it it i think about the


---------18:59----------
person that i used to be


---------19:01----------
like when i grew up with my parents and


---------19:03----------
you know they did the best that they


---------19:04----------
could like i think yeah


---------19:06----------
that was the formula that worked for


---------19:07----------
them my dad grew up in a


---------19:10----------
in basically like a 10-foot room where


---------19:12----------
like eight people lived


---------19:14----------
and at night time they would have to


---------19:15----------
like literally sleep outside because


---------19:18----------
there wasn't enough room


---------19:19----------
for like everyone just like you can't


---------19:21----------
sleep eight people in the 10-foot room


---------19:23----------
10 by 10 room um so that's kind of what


---------19:27----------
i think about the person that i had i


---------19:28----------
had been when i was lost and


---------19:30----------
directionless and hopeless


---------19:32----------
and didn't understand myself for life


---------19:34----------
and i try to help that person


---------19:36----------
because that's what all oh you know


---------19:37----------
that's what the people are


---------19:39----------
who reach out to me and that's what


---------19:42----------
makes you happy the most


---------19:45----------
that's what makes me happy the most


---------19:48----------
that's what gives you that purpose in


---------19:50----------
life gives me purpose


---------19:52----------
but what makes me the happy mo the most


---------19:54----------
is probably gaming


---------19:55----------
and doing fun stuff and like watching tv


---------19:59----------
like i get a


---------20:00----------
an immense amount of well pleasure


---------20:04----------
pleasure yeah i feel like pleasure and


---------20:08----------
like feeling


---------20:09----------
happy is not really the same though not


---------20:11----------
for me at least


---------20:16----------
how are they different


---------20:19----------
like when you were describing those two


---------20:21----------
uh just from your


---------20:23----------
example if i had to choose like which


---------20:24----------
one would make me happy


---------20:26----------
playing video games or like


---------20:30----------
doing something useful feeling my


---------20:33----------
self-worth even if it's


---------20:34----------
in terms of uh you know for selfish


---------20:38----------
reasons but like i know i helped someone


---------20:41----------
i would choose the second one like the


---------20:43----------
second one actually would make me feel


---------20:48----------
happy first one it's like little fixes


---------20:51----------
of


---------20:52----------
dopamine or something it's just it's


---------20:54----------
nowhere close


---------20:55----------
have you felt that have you felt that


---------20:58----------
way before where you feel like you have


---------21:00----------
meaning and worth


---------21:06----------
uh actually yes i felt


---------21:11----------
really good recently


---------21:15----------
i felt really emotional about it too


---------21:17----------
which doesn't happen to me often


---------21:18----------
so um and it had to do


---------21:22----------
with uh my decision to go back to school


---------21:26----------
um you actually inspired me


---------21:30----------
a lot to do that too um sorry about that


---------21:34----------
what do you mean sorry about that i


---------21:38----------
you have no idea like how good i felt


---------21:41----------
after i like


---------21:42----------
figure out that puzzle because i was


---------21:45----------
trying to put like pieces together for a


---------21:47----------
really long time


---------21:49----------
but um i think i finally realized that


---------21:53----------
um there's


---------21:57----------
one thing i truly enjoy doing in life


---------21:59----------
and i have some sort of


---------22:01----------
skill for that i haven't even been


---------22:03----------
noticing so much


---------22:05----------
or at all actually just because i was


---------22:07----------
like


---------22:08----------
so carried away about what others want


---------22:10----------
of me or like what others think or


---------22:13----------
all of that so


---------22:16----------
can you hold yes one second sorry


---------22:20----------
hello


---------22:23----------
yes give me a second sorry


---------22:27----------
oh


---------22:30----------
let me see if this is better okay there


---------22:32----------
we go


---------22:35----------
sorry mira apparently my mic was too


---------22:38----------
quiet


---------22:40----------
can you keep going uh yeah


---------22:46----------
so you were saying that that you decided


---------22:48----------
to start education


---------22:50----------
uh yeah i decided to go back to school


---------22:52----------
um


---------22:53----------
so i got


---------22:56----------
accepted for my master's degree


---------23:00----------
congratulations yeah of psychology and


---------23:03----------
neuroscience actually


---------23:05----------
oh very cool what uh


---------23:09----------
what um hold on let me just make sure


---------23:12----------
that this audio stuff is okay is this


---------23:13----------
okay


---------23:14----------
i need to do it testing testing


---------23:19----------
there okay um


---------23:23----------
so you decided to get a degree in


---------23:25----------
psychology and neuroscience


---------23:27----------
congratulations thank you


---------23:30----------
so i felt really strong about that one


---------23:32----------
and


---------23:35----------
yeah but i still don't feel a whole lot


---------23:37----------
besides for that so it makes me think


---------23:40----------
like


---------23:40----------
is that because my body is trying to


---------23:44----------
pull me in direction of like


---------23:46----------
my career and just kind of showing me


---------23:48----------
that this is what you should be doing


---------23:49----------
this is what you should be focusing on


---------23:52----------
why do you think it's your body showing


---------23:53----------
you something


---------23:55----------
well recently i found out that most of


---------23:58----------
the emotions that we experience in it


---------24:00----------
they all just kind of come in from our


---------24:03----------
body and we have to live them through


---------24:04----------
our bodies


---------24:06----------
so i'm trying to listen a little bit


---------24:08----------
more you know


---------24:09----------
people call it the inner voice sometimes


---------24:11----------
right


---------24:12----------
so um i'm referring to my body as like


---------24:15----------
my inner voice


---------24:17----------
um and uh


---------24:20----------
i lost my type of thought okay let me


---------24:22----------
just think for a second okay


---------24:28----------
what did you feel when you decided or


---------24:30----------
when you got accepted to you said you


---------24:32----------
felt something


---------24:33----------
and that's not common for you or that


---------24:37----------
you


---------24:37----------
tend to be a little bit numb so what


---------24:39----------
were you feeling about


---------24:41----------
was it when you made the decision or


---------24:42----------
when you got accepted to the program or


---------24:45----------
when did you feel something


---------24:48----------
uh actually both of them well i did feel


---------24:51----------
really


---------24:52----------
emotional when i got accepted because it


---------24:53----------
was like a hard school to get accepted


---------24:55----------
to


---------24:56----------
so i was like damn you know i can do it


---------24:58----------
i obviously felt proud of myself


---------25:00----------
but um even before then


---------25:03----------
i think i was just searching i kept


---------25:06----------
i kept searching it was so hard i i just


---------25:09----------
couldn't figure out like how


---------25:11----------
to listen to myself how to like come up


---------25:14----------
with


---------25:14----------
decisions and opinions like is it my


---------25:18----------
opinion


---------25:18----------
is that what my mom wants my dad wants


---------25:21----------
what my viewers want what like the world


---------25:23----------
wants for me you know


---------25:24----------
it's very hard sometimes to figure that


---------25:25----------
out so


---------25:27----------
as much as i was trying to get like


---------25:28----------
information on that like how to learn to


---------25:31----------
listen to yourself and like what you


---------25:33----------
truly want from life


---------25:34----------
it just turned out to be so difficult


---------25:38----------
for me and i i couldn't really figure it


---------25:41----------
out but


---------25:43----------
with this specific example of me going


---------25:47----------
back to school


---------25:48----------
it just felt right and i'm not sure if


---------25:51----------
it felt right because i kind of set


---------25:53----------
myself up for it


---------25:55----------
or it truly is that one thing that is


---------25:58----------
supposed to be happening in my life like


---------26:00----------
i'm


---------26:00----------
finally making the right decision


---------26:04----------
where do you get the idea that there's a


---------26:05----------
right decision


---------26:11----------
so you're trying to say there's no wrong


---------26:13----------
decision and everything else is just an


---------26:15----------
experience that's going to lead to


---------26:16----------
no experience that's not what i'm saying


---------26:20----------
i'm asking you where do you get the idea


---------26:23----------
that there is a right decision


---------26:26----------
because i feel an emotional response


---------26:31----------
to something yes to something


---------26:37----------
it's a very good answer okay


---------26:40----------
is that how you usually figure out if


---------26:42----------
you're making like the right move


---------26:44----------
if you're feeling emotional about it


---------26:50----------
i think when you feel emotional about


---------26:52----------
something it


---------26:54----------
signals that that has value to you in


---------26:56----------
some way


---------26:58----------
but i think a lot of the right decisions


---------27:01----------
or something like a right decision that


---------27:03----------
i've made come with bad emotions


---------27:05----------
not necessarily good ones


---------27:11----------
so how does it make it right decision


---------27:15----------
that's a good point oh because in the


---------27:17----------
long term it brings like actually a


---------27:19----------
better outcome even though it


---------27:20----------
sort of hurts in the moment is that what


---------27:22----------
you're saying


---------27:23----------
yeah sort of i mean i i think like for


---------27:26----------
example if i think about grief


---------27:28----------
right so if i have to let go of


---------27:30----------
something that i care about


---------27:32----------
um that can come with negative emotions


---------27:35----------
but


---------27:36----------
it can be the right thing to do so if we


---------27:38----------
think about like let's say you're in a


---------27:40----------
romantic relationship which is just not


---------27:42----------
gonna work out


---------27:44----------
or becomes difficult for any number of


---------27:47----------
reasons and doesn't feel like the right


---------27:49----------
thing to do


---------27:49----------
even though you love that person and you


---------27:52----------
really enjoy spending time with them


---------27:54----------
but there could be like something that's


---------27:57----------
more important than that relationship


---------27:58----------
and so you have to give something up and


---------28:00----------
that can hurt


---------28:01----------
but it can still be the right thing to


---------28:02----------
do but how do you


---------28:04----------
know that that's the right thing to do


---------28:06----------
how do you know you're not supposed to


---------28:07----------
keep fighting


---------28:09----------
for whatever relationship you have there


---------28:11----------
however bad it is


---------28:13----------
that's a great question so mira i'm


---------28:15----------
going to answer that in a second the


---------28:17----------
first thing


---------28:18----------
i want to point out is that so usually


---------28:21----------
when people come on stream i tend to ask


---------28:23----------
more questions and give fewer answers


---------28:26----------
and you seem to have a lot of questions


---------28:28----------
which is perfectly fine


---------28:30----------
do you think that the most helpful thing


---------28:32----------
right now is for you to ask


---------28:34----------
questions and for me to answer them is


---------28:37----------
that helpful to you


---------28:42----------
yes do you agree with me


---------28:45----------
uh i think there are some upsides and


---------28:48----------
some downsides


---------28:50----------
can we split a 50-50 sure


---------28:53----------
we don't have to can i share with you


---------28:55----------
what i think the good things are about


---------28:57----------
that


---------28:57----------
and what the bad things are could be


---------28:58----------
about that


---------29:00----------
the first is that you know when i ask


---------29:02----------
you where do you get the idea that


---------29:03----------
there's a


---------29:04----------
right answer um


---------29:08----------
i was actually thinking a little bit


---------29:10----------
about like you know you were raised to


---------29:12----------
believe that there is like a formula for


---------29:14----------
success


---------29:16----------
right and and really what you what it


---------29:18----------
seems like you've done is you've


---------29:19----------
replaced


---------29:21----------
their formula with success with the idea


---------29:23----------
that you have a formula for success and


---------29:26----------
it just needs to be your formula for


---------29:28----------
success


---------29:29----------
does that make sense like there's still


---------29:31----------
a path


---------29:32----------
there's a set of check boxes that if i


---------29:35----------
do all of these things i'm going to feel


---------29:37----------
happy


---------29:38----------
the only difference is that before those


---------29:40----------
check boxes were your parents check


---------29:41----------
boxes and now you're trying to figure


---------29:43----------
out


---------29:44----------
what are your check boxes with me


---------29:48----------
are you saying we should raise the check


---------29:50----------
boxes


---------29:52----------
i'm wondering whether that's a


---------29:55----------
worthwhile proposition


---------29:57----------
right so you're doing something which is


---------29:59----------
very cool which is you're


---------30:00----------
when i say something you're going


---------30:02----------
through a set you're very smart


---------30:04----------
you're going through a set of reasoning


---------30:06----------
you're predicting where i'm leading you


---------30:08----------
and then you're asking me whether the


---------30:09----------
conclusion is correct


---------30:11----------
do you see that like you're like when i


---------30:13----------
ask you a question you're saying


---------30:14----------
are you saying like you're going you're


---------30:17----------
you're jumping ahead to the end of the


---------30:19----------
road and you're basically saying is this


---------30:20----------
what you're suggesting it's very


---------30:22----------
intelligent


---------30:23----------
a lot of do you think it's a waste of


---------30:24----------
energy to what


---------30:27----------
do you think what i'm doing there is a


---------30:28----------
waste of energy should just kind of


---------30:31----------
let it more become no i don't think it's


---------30:33----------
a waste of energy i think it tells us a


---------30:35----------
little bit about


---------30:36----------
how you perceive problems in the world


---------30:39----------
and i i don't think it's a waste of


---------30:40----------
energy i think that you could be missing


---------30:42----------
something


---------30:42----------
along the way right because you're


---------30:45----------
drawing conclusions from my questions so


---------30:50----------
i ask you a question


---------30:51----------
and then your response if you just


---------30:54----------
literally listen to what your response


---------30:55----------
is i'll ask you a question


---------30:56----------
where do you get the idea that there's a


---------30:58----------
formula for success


---------31:00----------
and then your response is not where you


---------31:02----------
get that idea your first response is


---------31:04----------
are you saying dot dot dot so you're not


---------31:07----------
actually


---------31:08----------
answering a question about yourself


---------31:10----------
you're trying to figure out what i think


---------31:14----------
yeah because i have just value yeah


---------31:16----------
maybe i should just go back to watching


---------31:18----------
your streams


---------31:20----------
yeah because i just want to know what


---------31:22----------
you think i just kind of want to listen


---------31:23----------
to you


---------31:24----------
more right so let's just think about


---------31:26----------
this for a second right like your


---------31:28----------
problem is that you don't know what you


---------31:30----------
want


---------31:30----------
and your default answer is to listen to


---------31:33----------
me more


---------31:35----------
because i think you have a better idea


---------31:37----------
of what those check boxes are


---------31:39----------
and etc etc yes right but like maybe


---------31:42----------
what you should do to figure out what


---------31:43----------
you want is instead of looking from


---------31:46----------
for the answer from me look for the


---------31:48----------
answer


---------31:49----------
from you so how does one do that


---------31:52----------
effectively yeah great question


---------31:55----------
so it starts by recognizing that like


---------31:58----------
you're looking for answers fundamentally


---------32:00----------
because this is the way you've been


---------32:02----------
trained


---------32:03----------
so like literally the reason i ask you


---------32:04----------
the question where do you get the idea


---------32:07----------
that there is


---------32:08----------
a formula for success it's because like


---------32:10----------
everywhere around you like even though


---------32:12----------
you've figured out and this is huge for


---------32:13----------
you by the way i think it's awesome that


---------32:14----------
you figured this out


---------32:15----------
that your formula for success is not


---------32:18----------
your parents formula for success


---------32:20----------
the next step is for you to figure out


---------32:22----------
is there a formula for success


---------32:26----------
and for a little while i was wondering


---------32:27----------
like why are you asking me the questions


---------32:29----------
that you're asking me


---------32:30----------
right like you're it's kind of


---------32:31----------
interesting because


---------32:33----------
and and so when when you ask me did you


---------32:35----------
have a moment


---------32:36----------
where you know what you're supposed to


---------32:38----------
be in the rest of your life


---------32:41----------
and that presumes that such moments


---------32:44----------
exist


---------32:45----------
and that you find yourself and then


---------32:47----------
you're you're set for life


---------32:49----------
right like does that make sense you're


---------32:51----------
kind of assuming that i had such a


---------32:52----------
moment


---------32:53----------
and my answer was actually yeah i've had


---------32:55----------
several of those moments and i turned


---------32:56----------
out to be wrong through several


---------32:57----------
several of them so it's been my


---------33:00----------
experience that there isn't


---------33:01----------
a formula for success and that thinking


---------33:04----------
in and of itself


---------33:05----------
is the thing that's holding you back


---------33:09----------
that you think that there is a answer


---------33:11----------
but here's the thing i think it's


---------33:12----------
wonderful that you're going to


---------33:13----------
get a degree in psychology and


---------33:15----------
neuroscience you're clearly very


---------33:16----------
cerebral


---------33:18----------
and very intelligent and very capable


---------33:21----------
and i think that you're gonna be


---------33:23----------
unsatisfied after this


---------33:26----------
why because that's not where happiness


---------33:30----------
comes from


---------33:31----------
where does happiness come from where do


---------33:34----------
you think it comes from


---------33:37----------
okay we're going 50 50 it's your turn to


---------33:39----------
answer


---------33:42----------
oh what makes it hard for you to answer


---------33:45----------
that question


---------33:50----------
well i don't think i have a very clear


---------33:55----------
idea


---------33:55----------
i mean obviously it's gonna be


---------33:57----------
subjective yeah


---------33:58----------
good so like like now we have to think a


---------34:01----------
little bit about this okay so now mira


---------34:03----------
i'm gonna ask you a question i'll


---------34:04----------
answer whatever questions you want okay


---------34:05----------
but i just want to make this point


---------34:07----------
so if you don't have a clear idea where


---------34:10----------
does


---------34:11----------
that clarity come from does it come from


---------34:13----------
you or does it come from me


---------34:14----------
let's just start there


---------34:18----------
it should be coming from me


---------34:21----------
but we're here right now


---------34:25----------
and i'm talking to you with a clear


---------34:27----------
intention of gaining knowledge


---------34:30----------
so i would like to hear your point of


---------34:32----------
view first and hopefully they'll help me


---------34:35----------
understand myself a little better


---------34:39----------
yeah so i'm fine with that if that's


---------34:41----------
really what you want to do but like


---------34:43----------
let's just think about that for a second


---------34:45----------
right like


---------34:46----------
sure you can learn from me


---------34:49----------
and hope to understand yourself a little


---------34:50----------
bit better that's absolutely a really


---------34:52----------
important


---------34:53----------
source of knowledge because we like the


---------34:55----------
whole reason that the aoe healing works


---------34:58----------
is because other people like the whole


---------35:00----------
idea behind healthy gamer is exactly


---------35:02----------
what you just said


---------35:03----------
that i can have a conversation with one


---------35:05----------
person and that a thousand people


---------35:07----------
watching at home


---------35:08----------
can learn something that has nothing to


---------35:10----------
do with an internal exploration


---------35:12----------
they can see it in another person and


---------35:15----------
they can learn from it


---------35:17----------
right that's what we're here about now i


---------35:20----------
get that you've watched our streams and


---------35:22----------
that you've gained a lot from it and i


---------35:24----------
i'm really


---------35:24----------
i'm really glad that that's happened i'm


---------35:27----------
happy for you and i'm also happy for


---------35:28----------
myself


---------35:29----------
that's why we do it and today of all


---------35:32----------
days mira you have a different


---------35:34----------
opportunity


---------35:36----------
you can watch me answer questions for


---------35:38----------
other people


---------35:39----------
as much as you want to but today you


---------35:41----------
have a very unique opportunity


---------35:44----------
to explore yourself with my help


---------35:48----------
and if that feels difficult for you


---------35:51----------
like i get the sense that you're really


---------35:53----------
resistant to doing that and i'm trying


---------35:55----------
to understand


---------35:56----------
why and i think it may have something to


---------35:59----------
do with


---------36:01----------
you being afraid that you don't know


---------36:03----------
answers and it's hard for you to be


---------36:05----------
ignorant in public


---------36:07----------
that would be my hypothesis but i'd have


---------36:09----------
to talk to you about it more


---------36:10----------
just when i think about children of high


---------36:12----------
functioning parents who are expected to


---------36:14----------
get all a's


---------36:15----------
not having the answer on stream is


---------36:18----------
probably going to be hard for you what


---------36:21----------
do you think


---------36:23----------
okay um


---------36:29----------
okay i hear you so um


---------36:33----------
would you like me to answer the question


---------36:35----------
about what happiness


---------36:37----------
is for me first


---------36:44----------
let me think about that


---------37:06----------
so you said earlier that pleasure and


---------37:08----------
happiness are different right


---------37:13----------
yes so help me understand how you


---------37:16----------
discovered that


---------37:26----------
we're talking about pleasure um


---------37:30----------
i can think about video games


---------37:34----------
sex just


---------37:37----------
little things like that it's it's


---------37:38----------
something that


---------37:42----------
is more physical


---------37:47----------
and short term for me


---------37:50----------
and happiness it's more of a


---------37:54----------
mental


---------37:59----------
long-term state okay so are you happy


---------38:09----------
i'm happier than i was before yes um but


---------38:13----------
i don't think it's my final form


---------38:16----------
hmm so have you been happy before


---------38:31----------
not in my final form no it's just


---------38:38----------
what does that mean final form


---------38:42----------
i think i have an idea of what


---------38:46----------
i want in the future like how i feel in


---------38:50----------
the future


---------38:51----------
and that's what i mean by the final form


---------38:54----------
so how do you even know that exists


---------39:01----------
because i made it up right


---------39:06----------
so but that's the thing right so like


---------39:08----------
there's a part of me that wonders a


---------39:10----------
little bit so i i do think that you can


---------39:11----------
feel happier and more fulfilled than


---------39:14----------
than you do right now if you say that


---------39:15----------
you don't feel happy and fulfilled


---------39:17----------
i i think the challenge is that


---------39:21----------
you're chasing something from your


---------39:24----------
imagination


---------39:26----------
and in doing so you may miss out


---------39:30----------
on sources of happiness that


---------39:34----------
because you're looking for something


---------39:37----------
right


---------39:38----------
like if you think about are you do you


---------39:40----------
mind if i ask you a couple of questions


---------39:41----------
about relationships


---------39:43----------
yeah go ahead are you in a relationship


---------39:46----------
right now


---------39:48----------
yes and


---------39:52----------
is that when you think about a good what


---------39:56----------
are you happy with your relationship


---------40:00----------
i'm uh definitely happier than i have


---------40:03----------
ever been in a relationship before


---------40:04----------
yes okay so when we think about like


---------40:08----------
what you imagine a good relationship


---------40:11----------
like looks like


---------40:12----------
and what your current relationship looks


---------40:14----------
like before your current relationship


---------40:16----------
when you envision what a good


---------40:17----------
relationship is


---------40:19----------
how similar is what you're doing now to


---------40:21----------
what you envisioned


---------40:23----------
oh i missed the first part uh before my


---------40:25----------
current relationship


---------40:26----------
yeah before you started your current


---------40:28----------
relationship when you looked into the


---------40:30----------
future and you said this is the kind of


---------40:32----------
relationship that i want


---------40:33----------
you created a fantasy or an ideal of


---------40:36----------
what a relationship should be


---------40:38----------
how similar is that ideal to what you're


---------40:40----------
living now


---------40:42----------
ooh really really close but not 100


---------40:46----------
which is why i'm i'm i'm having doubts


---------40:49----------
about it it's like should we really


---------40:52----------
settle if it's not 100


---------40:54----------
even if it's 99 you know


---------40:57----------
is it is it really the one how do you


---------40:59----------
know


---------41:00----------
if it's not 100


---------41:04----------
are you just wasting time are you just


---------41:06----------
settling


---------41:07----------
what do you think


---------41:11----------
ah i googled this so many times


---------41:16----------
google didn't help yeah


---------41:18----------
[Music]


---------41:19----------
well google thinks if you have any um


---------41:22----------
doubts at all like you probably


---------41:25----------
shouldn't even be in that


---------41:27----------
that's what google thinks what do you


---------41:29----------
think


---------41:32----------
i mean i'm just being really grateful


---------41:36----------
to what the present is compared to the


---------41:38----------
past


---------41:40----------
but then again maybe i'm just settling


---------41:43----------
down


---------41:44----------
because i


---------41:51----------
what do you think about settling are you


---------41:52----------
okay with settling


---------41:58----------
it depends if the worst thing is going


---------42:00----------
to come yes


---------42:01----------
but what if there's something better


---------42:04----------
please


---------42:06----------
okay so sorry for making you


---------42:08----------
uncomfortable we don't have to talk


---------42:09----------
about that more but i i think it's


---------42:11----------
i think the feelings that you're having


---------42:13----------
are very common in relationships right


---------42:15----------
like most people in relationships


---------42:17----------
think about whether this is the right


---------42:19----------
like until you're married and even after


---------42:21----------
you're married many people are you


---------42:22----------
married


---------42:24----------
okay um so you know


---------42:27----------
i think it's completely normal and


---------42:29----------
healthy to think about what else is out


---------42:31----------
there


---------42:32----------
because until you have those thoughts


---------42:34----------
like you can't settle down with someone


---------42:36----------
in a completely authentic way does that


---------42:39----------
make sense


---------42:40----------
like if i'm did you go through that too


---------42:45----------
no so you always knew that your wife


---------42:49----------
is the one like that's it that's


---------42:51----------
somebody i want to live the rest of my


---------42:52----------
life


---------42:53----------
settle in i feel happy even if you have


---------42:55----------
some moments like


---------42:57----------
that's it did i know that she was the


---------43:01----------
one


---------43:11----------
sort of but it was also


---------43:15----------
far from perfect from day one


---------43:18----------
okay right so my point was that when i


---------43:21----------
think about my ideal relationship


---------43:24----------
it was very different from what i


---------43:26----------
thought a relationship looked like


---------43:28----------
so you say that your current


---------43:29----------
relationship is pretty close to your


---------43:31----------
ideal


---------43:32----------
my ideal was very different


---------43:35----------
and one of the things now i'll answer


---------43:39----------
so one of the things that i've come to


---------43:41----------
appreciate is that there isn't a formula


---------43:43----------
for success


---------43:44----------
and perfection is an idea and that


---------43:47----------
i got a lot of happiness from letting go


---------43:49----------
of perfection


---------43:52----------
from letting you do that of looking for


---------43:54----------
100


---------43:58----------
but how did you get rid of that idea of


---------44:00----------
like


---------44:01----------
what if this is not my thing and i'm


---------44:03----------
just well it's the idea that


---------44:06----------
so it's the idea that something is your


---------44:08----------
thing or


---------44:09----------
isn't your thing that presumes that


---------44:11----------
there's an objective truth to what's


---------44:13----------
your thing and what isn't your thing


---------44:17----------
no there's not huh right and this comes


---------44:21----------
back to like where did you get the idea


---------44:22----------
that there's a formula for success it's


---------44:24----------
because


---------44:24----------
i think deep within you you have this


---------44:26----------
idea that things are done right


---------44:28----------
or they're done wrong there is a right


---------44:32----------
and there is a wrong there is a right


---------44:33----------
way to be at school there's a right way


---------44:35----------
to behave


---------44:36----------
when your parents friends come over


---------44:37----------
there's a right way to answer questions


---------44:39----------
there's a right way to look


---------44:43----------
there's a right way to present yourself


---------44:48----------
and twitch reinforces that


---------44:51----------
right right that there's a right way and


---------44:54----------
there's a wrong way


---------44:55----------
and the thing is mira you're not right


---------44:59----------
or wrong you're you


---------45:02----------
and they're going to be parts of you if


---------45:04----------
you measure yourself against the scale


---------45:06----------
of right and wrong


---------45:07----------
you're not you're never going to be


---------45:08----------
right


---------45:10----------
like you can't be completely right


---------45:12----------
you're just you you're flawed


---------45:13----------
any relationship that you engage in is


---------45:15----------
going to be flawed


---------45:17----------
okay okay okay that makes sense but


---------45:20----------
still there's got to be some sort of


---------45:24----------
signs that you derive probably from


---------45:26----------
within yourself


---------45:27----------
to figure out if this person is your


---------45:30----------
person


---------45:30----------
and not your person if this is what i


---------45:32----------
want to do in life like


---------45:34----------
job-wise or not so how do i get like


---------45:37----------
very sensitive to those feels like how


---------45:39----------
do i get to listen to myself better


---------45:41----------
yeah so i think that you are listening


---------45:44----------
to yourself better i think you just need


---------45:45----------
to listen


---------45:46----------
for different things i think you're good


---------45:47----------
at listening to yourself i think the


---------45:48----------
issue is when you say is this what i'm


---------45:50----------
supposed to do


---------45:50----------
in life you can't know


---------45:53----------
and no sense of yourself is going to


---------45:55----------
tell you what you're supposed to do


---------45:58----------
in life in a sense oddly enough what i


---------46:01----------
would encourage you to do is like what


---------46:02----------
are


---------46:03----------
what is something telling you in the


---------46:04----------
moment


---------46:06----------
and then reflecting on that so like is


---------46:09----------
is getting a master's degree in


---------46:10----------
psychology and neuroscience supposed to


---------46:12----------
be what you do


---------46:13----------
in life i'm not sure but i think it's a


---------46:15----------
wonderful thing for you to do now


---------46:18----------
and that was my whole point betw behind


---------46:20----------
my earlier answers like i thought at the


---------46:22----------
age of 21 that i wanted to become a monk


---------46:24----------
and it felt so right for and me


---------46:27----------
turned out to be like absolutely wrong


---------46:31----------
oh that was one of the things that you


---------46:32----------
said you accomplished and then you


---------46:35----------
realized it was wrong yeah i decided at


---------46:37----------
the age of 21 i wanted to become a monk


---------46:39----------
two weeks after i tried to like give up


---------46:41----------
my life and my teachers wouldn't quite


---------46:43----------
take me yet


---------46:44----------
i met the person who was gonna be my


---------46:45----------
wife and i was like i'm gonna be


---------46:47----------
celibate


---------46:48----------
no more women i'm finished and then i


---------46:51----------
met her


---------46:52----------
and then i was really confused because


---------46:54----------
you were kind of saying did i know she


---------46:55----------
was the one like


---------46:57----------
it was weird it was confusing because i


---------46:58----------
didn't think there was gonna be a one


---------47:00----------
does that make sense i let go of the


---------47:02----------
idea of success


---------47:03----------
i let go of the idea of a formula


---------47:07----------
that was going to be right for me i was


---------47:09----------
so


---------47:10----------
wrong and it felt so right it felt so


---------47:13----------
good


---------47:14----------
it felt so wonderful that i was going to


---------47:16----------
be this spiritually enlightened master


---------47:19----------
one day


---------47:20----------
and then i meet this girl and wow she is


---------47:23----------
kind of hot


---------47:25----------
no but no no no that's not for me that's


---------47:27----------
not who i am


---------47:28----------
that's for regular people


---------47:32----------
and she was attractive


---------47:36----------
and i just enjoyed being with her like


---------47:38----------
our first date


---------47:39----------
i didn't even realize it was a date like


---------47:41----------
i was like yeah i'll like i'll take you


---------47:42----------
to lunch like i'll i


---------47:43----------
like if you like thai food like there's


---------47:45----------
a really great restaurant so we like


---------47:46----------
went to lunch


---------47:47----------
and then 11 hours later i dropped her


---------47:52----------
off and we just hung out the whole day


---------47:56----------
and like there i was in my head feeling


---------47:58----------
like this is wrong


---------47:59----------
like not wrong but i was like oh yeah


---------48:01----------
this is not anything like i had feelings


---------48:03----------
in here


---------48:03----------
that i was actively ignoring because i


---------48:05----------
was doing the right thing like the right


---------48:07----------
thing was to be a monk


---------48:08----------
so i'm not going to have a relationship


---------48:10----------
with this girl


---------48:12----------
and so you never had you never had like


---------48:15----------
any big doubts about


---------48:17----------
her you never i had thousands of doubts


---------48:20----------
that's exactly what i'm saying


---------48:22----------
but like not about your relationship


---------48:24----------
with her her


---------48:25----------
you were sure about her you just not


---------48:27----------
we're not sure how she was fitting into


---------48:29----------
whatever idea of your life you had at


---------48:31----------
the moment no the whole problem was that


---------48:33----------
she wasn't fitting into my idea of my


---------48:35----------
life


---------48:36----------
right yeah but you still felt like she


---------48:39----------
is right for you


---------48:41----------
yeah i don't understand what i feel that


---------48:43----------
now i don't know that i felt that then


---------48:46----------
right so i didn't understand what i felt


---------48:48----------
that


---------48:49----------
and i still don't really know exactly


---------48:51----------
what it was looking back on it it makes


---------48:52----------
sense hindsight is 20 20.


---------48:55----------
but in the moment like this is why i'm


---------48:57----------
pressing you to like look within


---------48:58----------
yourself because in the moment like it's


---------49:00----------
a mess


---------49:02----------
and the other like the whole problem is


---------49:03----------
you're thinking like how do i look


---------49:05----------
within myself and find the right answer


---------49:07----------
my point is that i don't think there's a


---------49:08----------
right answer


---------49:09----------
there's only like the best answer you


---------49:11----------
can make today


---------49:16----------
so there's no like technique or trick


---------49:19----------
you can do


---------49:19----------
to like feel out your inner voice better


---------49:23----------
there are things you can do to hear out


---------49:25----------
your inner voice but i think like you're


---------49:26----------
still


---------49:27----------
attached to this idea that there is a


---------49:29----------
right answer out there


---------49:30----------
and there's a secret formula to uncover


---------49:32----------
what the right answer is


---------49:34----------
and oddly enough you're not wrong there


---------49:36----------
but i think what you really need to do


---------49:38----------
is move away from the idea that you can


---------49:40----------
get to a perfect answer


---------49:43----------
can absolutely do things to better and


---------49:46----------
if you want to learn a particular


---------49:47----------
practice


---------49:48----------
i will teach you a practice to enhance


---------49:51----------
the strength of your inner voice and


---------49:54----------
people think i'm a good psychiatrist but


---------49:56----------
i've said this several times


---------49:57----------
i'm not a i mean i'm a good psychiatrist


---------49:59----------
but what makes me exceptional is not


---------50:01----------
that i'm a good psychiatrist


---------50:03----------
what makes me exceptional is that i do


---------50:04----------
practices literally


---------50:06----------
the bulk of my spiritual practice is


---------50:08----------
about cultivating my inner voice


---------50:11----------
and that's what allows me to connect


---------50:12----------
with people because like i have data


---------50:14----------
that like other people don't have


---------50:17----------
and i think that that's through my


---------50:18----------
meditative practice so there's


---------50:19----------
absolutely things you can do that


---------50:21----------
that you can do and i'm happy to teach


---------50:23----------
you that but i want you to be careful


---------50:25----------
because it still presumes that there is


---------50:28----------
a right answer


---------50:32----------
like mira i think if you want to be


---------50:33----------
happy in life you need to start


---------50:35----------
making bad decisions


---------50:38----------
you


---------50:43----------
[Music]


---------50:46----------
i think what you need to start doing is


---------50:47----------
making imperfect decisions


---------50:49----------
instead of looking for the right answer


---------50:51----------
start accepting


---------50:53----------
that like you can do the best thing you


---------50:55----------
can do today and it may or may not work


---------50:57----------
out


---------50:59----------
and that over time if you do the best


---------51:02----------
thing for you


---------51:03----------
today tomorrow and the next day some of


---------51:05----------
those are not going to work out some of


---------51:06----------
them will work out and


---------51:08----------
over time hopefully you'll find yourself


---------51:10----------
in a situation


---------51:11----------
where you're happy but that happiness is


---------51:14----------
not something that can be chased it's


---------51:16----------
something that's found


---------51:20----------
right


---------51:23----------
have you always been in tune with your


---------51:26----------
inner voice


---------51:27----------
or is it something you came to no


---------51:30----------
yeah i mean i did years and years of


---------51:32----------
meditative practice i was


---------51:34----------
deaf to my inner voice for most of my


---------51:36----------
life why were you deaf


---------51:39----------
because i was like a normal gamer


---------51:44----------
like i played video games all day and


---------51:46----------
had no idea what i felt or how i felt


---------51:49----------
that way and all i know


---------51:50----------
is that every every night when i went to


---------51:51----------
bed if i wasn't absolutely exhausted


---------51:54----------
tons of emotions would come rushing up


---------51:57----------
that i hated


---------51:58----------
i got pissed off every single time my


---------52:01----------
parents asked me how did your classes go


---------52:03----------
today


---------52:04----------
it pissed me off so much the worst part


---------52:07----------
of my day would be like how did my


---------52:08----------
classes go because they didn't go well


---------52:10----------
and then i'd lie to them and i'd say


---------52:12----------
everything's fine


---------52:13----------
and i knew it was a lie and i


---------52:15----------
knew everything wasn't fine


---------52:17----------
and there was a part of me that was


---------52:19----------
telling me hey man you're kind of


---------52:20----------
 up here


---------52:22----------
and then what i did with that inner


---------52:23----------
voice was stuff it way down by playing


---------52:25----------
diablo 2 and warcraft 3.


---------52:28----------
and wow and all kinds of other stuff


---------52:32----------
you've been there done that so basically


---------52:35----------
it's by meditating


---------52:36----------
and just working on yourself you've got


---------52:38----------
into practice


---------52:40----------
that sensitivity within yourself


---------52:43----------
sure that's the way to get sensitivity


---------52:45----------
sure


---------52:46----------
okay like there are particular practices


---------52:49----------
which i believe


---------52:51----------
you know i believe that different


---------52:52----------
meditation techniques affect


---------52:54----------
different functions of the brain in


---------52:56----------
different ways there's some evidence to


---------52:58----------
this


---------52:58----------
i think there's some stuff on our


---------52:59----------
discord we've uploaded some papers and


---------53:01----------
stuff


---------53:02----------
so they they've done like eeg studies


---------53:04----------
you know what eg eeg is


---------53:07----------
okay so eeg is measures the electrical


---------53:10----------
activity of different parts of your


---------53:11----------
brain


---------53:12----------
and they've done studies on different


---------53:14----------
meditation techniques that show


---------53:16----------
that different meditation techniques


---------53:18----------
create different


---------53:19----------
patterns of electrical activity in your


---------53:20----------
brain and the electrical activity in


---------53:22----------
your brain


---------53:23----------
is a reflection of which parts of your


---------53:25----------
brain are quote-unquote


---------53:27----------
turned off and which parts are turned on


---------53:29----------
so


---------53:30----------
different meditations activate different


---------53:32----------
parts of the brain is kind of like a


---------53:34----------
simplistic


---------53:35----------
and frankly incorrect way of looking at


---------53:37----------
it but that's not really incorrect


---------53:39----------
it's just a simplistic way so if i were


---------53:41----------
to go on your discord


---------53:42----------
i can get more information about like


---------53:44----------
what meditation i can do


---------53:46----------
to help no you can get you can get


---------53:49----------
scientific papers


---------53:51----------
about the science behind whether


---------53:54----------
meditation techniques affect different


---------53:56----------
parts of the brain differently


---------53:58----------
but if you want to know what meditation


---------53:59----------
techniques to do i'm going to teach you


---------54:01----------
because i know what you need to do so


---------54:03----------
you can start with


---------54:04----------
one or two practices and then we can go


---------54:07----------
from there i'm happy to continue to


---------54:08----------
teach you like from time to time


---------54:11----------
thank you


---------54:14----------
this helping at all yeah it is okay


---------54:19----------
what are you hearing from me mira um


---------54:22----------
first i was a little confused


---------54:26----------
but yeah but i think it's because


---------54:29----------
i had my own idea of like what you think


---------54:32----------
i will


---------54:34----------
what i thought you would say but you


---------54:36----------
didn't give me a specific


---------54:38----------
answer you kind of just marked my the


---------54:41----------
answers that i was expecting out


---------54:43----------
and so i was confused but now i'm just


---------54:46----------
trying to like


---------54:49----------
i'm really uh so that meditation that


---------54:51----------
you just mentioned


---------54:53----------
is it something that we can do in stream


---------54:55----------
and then i can practice upstream as well


---------54:57----------
absolutely okay and i don't need to do


---------55:00----------
with someone else i can just do it by


---------55:01----------
myself


---------55:02----------
nope yeah you can do it by yourself okay


---------55:13----------
so can you help me understand a little


---------55:15----------
bit about what you're taking away from


---------55:16----------
this


---------55:19----------
um


---------55:20----------
[Music]


---------55:23----------
there's no formula


---------55:28----------
i need to stop oh


---------55:31----------
let's not say need maybe i shouldn't


---------55:35----------
focus


---------55:35----------
as much on specific steps i need to make


---------55:41----------
i said need again why that's okay you


---------55:43----------
like the word


---------55:45----------
it's okay for some reason i don't like


---------55:46----------
the word need they put


---------55:48----------
pressure on me it puts pressure on me


---------55:50----------
and i don't like that


---------55:52----------
anyways um but that's how you feel right


---------55:57----------
yeah i feel like i need i need i


---------56:01----------
i need like that get that very strongly


---------56:06----------
so the vibe that i got from you that i


---------56:08----------
just need to chill


---------56:10----------
the out and just kind of let things


---------56:12----------
go and let things


---------56:14----------
be which i thought i did last year


---------56:18----------
it was very what was i


---------56:21----------
i thought i was not doing anything i was


---------56:23----------
just like traveling and


---------56:25----------
enjoying life but so let's talk about


---------56:28----------
that for a second i


---------56:29----------
i think that you should live a life of


---------56:32----------
intentionality so i don't think that you


---------56:34----------
should chase pleasure


---------56:36----------
and just chill the out what i'm


---------56:38----------
saying is that you have this


---------56:40----------
i get the sense mira that within you you


---------56:43----------
have


---------56:44----------
like there's like a mirror inside you


---------56:45----------
with a whip


---------56:47----------
and she's just whipping you forward with


---------56:49----------
a whip and she's just whipping you


---------56:51----------
forward


---------56:53----------
she's like you need to grow and you need


---------56:54----------
to find yourself and you need to find


---------56:56----------
the right technique and you need to


---------56:57----------
cultivate your inner voice


---------56:58----------
and it's all like clouded by like this


---------57:01----------
very positive like language


---------57:03----------
like inner voice and discovering


---------57:05----------
yourself but at the end of the day like


---------57:06----------
you're whipping yourself forward you're


---------57:07----------
pressuring yourself to find the answer


---------57:09----------
the right answer find an answer what's


---------57:11----------
the right formula for success what


---------57:13----------
what are the check boxes that you need


---------57:14----------
to check and it's a huge step forward to


---------57:16----------
step away from your parents checkboxes


---------57:19----------
but there's still the idea that there


---------57:20----------
are check boxes


---------57:22----------
and you're trying to live a perfect life


---------57:24----------
you're trying to have perfection in your


---------57:26----------
relationship you're saying it's like 99


---------57:28----------
of what you want but


---------57:29----------
it may not be perfect like that's a


---------57:32----------
problem


---------57:35----------
right that you're you're looking for


---------57:36----------
perfection


---------57:38----------
but without the whip would there be any


---------57:41----------
movement


---------57:43----------
excellent question absolutely but this


---------57:46----------
is the hard thing for


---------57:47----------
for people like you and by people like


---------57:50----------
you i mean


---------57:51----------
people who have achieved this is the


---------57:54----------
most difficult thing that i


---------57:55----------
when i work with people who are high


---------57:57----------
achievers


---------57:59----------
the whip is what gets them to where they


---------58:00----------
are


---------58:02----------
and so the question is how can you care


---------58:04----------
about something without the whip


---------58:08----------
that make sense


---------58:11----------
so you're saying the energy can still


---------58:13----------
come within you


---------58:14----------
without you pushing like forcing


---------58:17----------
yourself to do things


---------58:20----------
absolutely


---------58:22----------
right and so so this is the thing the


---------58:24----------
reason that you don't


---------58:25----------
know what you want is because you're not


---------58:27----------
aware of that thing


---------58:29----------
like that's exactly what we're talking


---------58:30----------
about this entire time is that there is


---------58:32----------
a force within you


---------58:34----------
that can propel you forward without


---------58:36----------
whipping you


---------58:38----------
it's something that you gravitate


---------58:39----------
towards it's what feels right


---------58:43----------
it's what makes you happy it's your


---------58:44----------
internal compass it's your internal


---------58:46----------
voice


---------58:49----------
but you have lived a life where you have


---------58:51----------
whipped yourself towards a particular


---------58:53----------
external goal that you have lost sight


---------58:56----------
of like what your internal


---------58:57----------
compasses and even the way that you


---------59:01----------
find your internal compass is still


---------59:03----------
whipping


---------59:06----------
do you see that like you're asking me


---------59:07----------
for the perfect technique to find your


---------59:09----------
internal compass


---------59:10----------
that in and of itself is an external


---------59:12----------
goal that you have an idealized answer


---------59:14----------
for


---------59:15----------
you see that does that make sense yes it


---------59:18----------
does


---------59:19----------
right like that yeah how does one get


---------59:22----------
rid of the whip


---------59:24----------
you tell me


---------59:27----------
well realizing it is already a step


---------59:29----------
forward right


---------59:31----------
knowing that there is one and that


---------59:33----------
doesn't


---------59:36----------
maybe it's just not optimal for me it's


---------59:39----------
not the best way to go around it


---------59:41----------
because you know how they say that there


---------59:44----------
are different ways to get people to do


---------59:46----------
things and


---------59:47----------
like if you if you choose the stressful


---------59:49----------
one through like fear intimidation


---------59:51----------
manipulation whatever it's not as


---------59:53----------
effective as


---------59:54----------
opposed to when you inspire them or like


---------59:56----------
all of your answers are coming from the


---------59:58----------
outside


---------60:00----------
mira they're coming you're smart so


---------60:02----------
you've read a lot of things and you're


---------60:03----------
quoting a lot of theory it's very very


---------60:05----------
intellectual


---------60:07----------
it's not that right right it's not wrong


---------60:10----------
but it's incomplete it's all coming from


---------60:14----------
up here


---------60:17----------
and when i ask you questions like what


---------60:18----------
do you want like it's really hard for


---------60:20----------
you to answer that


---------60:22----------
and this is like where the numbness


---------60:23----------
comes from like the numbness is because


---------60:25----------
like you don't know what's going on in


---------60:26----------
here


---------60:28----------
right so i think oddly enough like the


---------60:30----------
way that you need to answer that


---------60:31----------
question is to look for yourself


---------60:33----------
like don't look for i mean i'm going to


---------60:35----------
teach you a technique because i think


---------60:36----------
you


---------60:36----------
have a very good temperament for this


---------60:39----------
and i think it'll help you a lot but at


---------60:41----------
the same time start to recognize that


---------60:43----------
like


---------60:44----------
the way that you need to find that


---------60:46----------
answer is by trying things and


---------60:48----------
up for a few times


---------60:52----------
right and and when i ask you have you


---------60:54----------
been happy before and you say no i don't


---------60:56----------
believe that


---------60:58----------
i think you've been happy basically


---------61:01----------
you said you haven't had your final form


---------61:02----------
of happiness which implies that like


---------61:05----------
you're saying like yeah it's kind of


---------61:06----------
like asking have you ever been


---------61:08----------
um have you ever had like a great horse


---------61:12----------
ride


---------61:13----------
and then you say yeah i've had like some


---------61:15----------
pretty good like horseback riding


---------61:16----------
sessions but i've never ridden a unicorn


---------61:18----------
before


---------61:20----------
that would be nice to ride a unicorn


---------61:22----------
absolutely it would be nice to write


---------61:24----------
a unicorn but what i'm saying is that


---------61:26----------
like you're looking for


---------61:27----------
answers from happiness from the outside


---------61:30----------
but like


---------61:31----------
there is no doubt in my mind that there


---------61:32----------
have been moments of time where you've


---------61:34----------
been like purely happy


---------61:38----------
and what you need to look for in terms


---------61:40----------
of like where to go is like go back and


---------61:42----------
look at those times


---------61:43----------
and i wouldn't be surprised if they're


---------61:44----------
 confusing because they may not


---------61:46----------
be what you thought they would look like


---------61:50----------
and we're not talking about playing


---------61:51----------
hearthstone or sex or other dopaminergic


---------61:53----------
pleasurable things


---------61:55----------
we're talking about a moment of pure


---------61:57----------
surprise


---------61:58----------
joy and happiness where you stopped


---------62:01----------
thinking about expectations


---------62:03----------
and you felt present and you loved being


---------62:05----------
where you were for a moment


---------62:16----------
is that weird that normally i only by


---------62:19----------
myself


---------62:20----------
no not at all


---------62:25----------
but see that's an important revelation


---------62:35----------
like i think it's telling that your


---------62:37----------
question was is it weird


---------62:40----------
right that's telling me that like what


---------62:42----------
you're discovering


---------62:43----------
is running a little bit contrary to what


---------62:46----------
you believe


---------62:49----------
because otherwise you would have said


---------62:50----------
yeah it was mostly when it's by myself


---------62:52----------
you said is it weird you're asking for


---------62:54----------
confirmation because it seems a little


---------62:56----------
bit confusing


---------62:58----------
which is exactly where you need to go


---------63:01----------
so tell me about that


---------63:07----------
don't come up with the right answer just


---------63:09----------
give me the answer that you've got


---------63:11----------
yes don't pull that with me


---------63:15----------
give me the imperfect answer


---------63:18----------
what were you thinking about when you


---------63:20----------
said it was is it weird that it was by


---------63:21----------
myself


---------63:25----------
um i mean society does tend to judge


---------63:28----------
that


---------63:29----------
but i i truly feel


---------63:33----------
i feel like my happiest moments were


---------63:35----------
just


---------63:36----------
with myself like when you started like


---------63:39----------
mentioning oh it's not true that you


---------63:41----------
didn't feel happy i was like


---------63:42----------
this i started just kind of like going


---------63:44----------
through that briefly and


---------63:47----------
most of them are by myself and can you


---------63:49----------
can you give me


---------63:50----------
an actual example yeah like what


---------63:54----------
um like


---------63:58----------
when i go to forest


---------64:02----------
well there were a few like really


---------64:03----------
intense ones but basically most of them


---------64:05----------
were just


---------64:06----------
in the nature and without anyone around


---------64:10----------
people just i don't i don't


---------64:14----------
like people very much i don't like being


---------64:16----------
around people very much


---------64:18----------
uh and it's pr it's probably me um my


---------64:21----------
bad like communicated


---------64:23----------
communication skills and stuff but


---------64:27----------
yeah maybe me trying to


---------64:40----------
so so many questions i haven't had


---------64:45----------
like so many things i just want to ask


---------64:46----------
you it's weird right you're asking me a


---------64:48----------
question but


---------64:49----------
instead i would just want to say this


---------64:51----------
this is your opinion


---------64:55----------
it's like well me trying to become


---------64:58----------
a psychologist will that get in the way


---------65:00----------
the fact that i don't really


---------65:01----------
like being around people but at the same


---------65:03----------
time i feel so fulfilled when i can talk


---------65:05----------
to someone and like


---------65:06----------
help one way or another uh that's just


---------65:09----------
like a random thought that just was


---------65:10----------
there


---------65:11----------
good now you're making progress what


---------65:14----------
what else do you have


---------65:20----------
i don't know if i should say it while


---------65:22----------
we're streaming


---------65:23----------
okay i i don't i don't know people tend


---------65:27----------
to get really weird on


---------65:28----------
twitch about stuff


---------65:32----------
i i have ptsd a little bit from twitch


---------65:35----------
okay


---------65:36----------
it's been a while okay


---------65:39----------
i don't know whether you should or


---------65:40----------
shouldn't say it because i know less


---------65:42----------
about twitch than you do and i don't


---------65:44----------
know what's in your head


---------65:45----------
but anyway so maybe move on to the next


---------65:49----------
thing


---------65:51----------
like like what other questions do you


---------65:54----------
[Music]


---------66:02----------
have


---------66:07----------
[Music]


---------66:09----------
sorry i'm a little slow so i'm just like


---------66:11----------
processing some of the things that you


---------66:12----------
said


---------66:13----------
and uh yeah not slow


---------66:16----------
mira you're doing it this is what you're


---------66:19----------
here to do


---------66:22----------
right this whole time you've had a


---------66:23----------
thousand questions for me


---------66:25----------
and now i'm asking you what are your


---------66:27----------
questions and


---------66:29----------
you're slow this is what exploration


---------66:32----------
looks like


---------66:33----------
this is what looking within yourself


---------66:35----------
looks like


---------66:43----------
[Music]


---------66:45----------
i mean if a person let's say the person


---------66:48----------
just ends up living the life


---------66:50----------
just by finding like


---------66:54----------
a good job and not necessarily like


---------66:57----------
build up good relationships or like


---------67:00----------
meaningful relationships in life like


---------67:02----------
without


---------67:02----------
getting married or having kids that's


---------67:04----------
totally fine too


---------67:05----------
right that doesn't have to be yeah but


---------67:08----------
that's me setting up again like a


---------67:10----------
checkbox like okay then


---------67:11----------
this is my plan i'm gonna get yeah no no


---------67:14----------
but i i don't think that's you setting


---------67:16----------
up a checkbox if you really listen to


---------67:18----------
that question


---------67:19----------
what that question is asking is can i be


---------67:21----------
happy if i don't check all the boxes


---------67:25----------
that's the question you need to be


---------67:26----------
asking do you see that


---------67:28----------
like that that scenario is actually


---------67:30----------
letting go of a few of the boxes it's


---------67:32----------
erasing a couple of the boxes


---------67:34----------
yeah i mean


---------67:38----------
i feel like relationships are overrated


---------67:40----------
anyways


---------67:46----------
yeah so


---------67:54----------
sorry i'm just i'm not i'm not voicing


---------67:57----------
it but i just have a bunch of


---------68:00----------
things going on okay good because i


---------68:03----------
i still have a filter because uh with


---------68:05----------
streaming and um


---------68:08----------
i i understand that we need to stream


---------68:10----------
because it's


---------68:11----------
useful when people listen to our


---------68:12----------
conversations and can we learn something


---------68:14----------
else but like i have to filter myself


---------68:16----------
like


---------68:17----------
when it comes to what i say okay i feel


---------68:20----------
like i need to


---------68:23----------
fine let's just respect that for a


---------68:25----------
moment okay


---------68:27----------
um and so one or two other


---------68:31----------
so one or two thoughts so like you're


---------68:33----------
asking a couple of questions which i


---------68:34----------
think are


---------68:35----------
good and you're making a couple of


---------68:36----------
observations which i think are good i'm


---------68:38----------
happy to still teach you about how to


---------68:39----------
find your inner voice and all that stuff


---------68:41----------
but i think this is actually the most


---------68:43----------
important thing that you're doing right


---------68:44----------
now


---------68:45----------
so you're noticing that actually when


---------68:47----------
i'm happy like it's in the woods


---------68:49----------
and also like the idea of being a


---------68:51----------
psychologist and working with someone


---------68:53----------
feels very gratifying


---------68:54----------
or when i've had very intimate


---------68:56----------
connections with people


---------68:57----------
and helped them in a significant way it


---------69:00----------
feels like it gives my life meaning


---------69:02----------
all that makes sense so i'm gonna try to


---------69:04----------
toss out one way


---------69:06----------
to understand that i think the biggest


---------69:07----------
thing about those two things i don't


---------69:08----------
think you need to be in the woods


---------69:10----------
i think you need to be free from


---------69:11----------
expectation


---------69:13----------
because what i'm hearing from you time


---------69:15----------
and time and time again


---------69:17----------
is that twitch your parents and


---------69:20----------
other people in your life have lots and


---------69:22----------
lots of expectations with


---------69:23----------
for for you and then you take those


---------69:26----------
expectations and you internalize them


---------69:28----------
in the check boxes are you good enough


---------69:30----------
are you pretty enough are you smart


---------69:31----------
enough


---------69:32----------
are you you know sharing enough are you


---------69:34----------
not sharing enough


---------69:35----------
and and you're so full of expectation


---------69:39----------
finding your final form of happiness and


---------69:42----------
and you know setting all these bars for


---------69:44----------
yourself that like you just don't know


---------69:46----------
how to be


---------69:47----------
except sometimes in your life you are


---------69:50----------
put in a particular place where


---------69:51----------
expectation


---------69:52----------
has no it just doesn't compute like when


---------69:55----------
you're with trees like what do they


---------69:57----------
expect of you


---------70:01----------
like there's just no way like nature


---------70:03----------
doesn't give a


---------70:05----------
and that's why i think it's wonderful


---------70:07----------
especially for people like you


---------70:09----------
so for people who have issues with


---------70:11----------
confidence and self-worth


---------70:13----------
which i think way deep down i think


---------70:15----------
you've got something going on there


---------70:18----------
you're afraid of the judgment of others


---------70:20----------
right and you have good reasons to be


---------70:22----------
afraid of the judgment of others it


---------70:23----------
sounds like i'm not saying you shouldn't


---------70:25----------
be afraid of that


---------70:26----------
but at the end of the day like nature


---------70:28----------
doesn't give a like if you


---------70:30----------
if you decide like i remember when i was


---------70:32----------
also going through my


---------70:33----------
growth and transformative period you


---------70:36----------
know there was like i remember seeing


---------70:38----------
this


---------70:38----------
like 12 or 14 foot boulder it was just


---------70:41----------
big and i was out


---------70:42----------
hiking one day and i said like i'm gonna


---------70:45----------
climb to the top of that whole


---------70:46----------
boulder and and i tried to climb into


---------70:49----------
the top and


---------70:50----------
what do you think happened mira you fell


---------70:54----------
no thankfully i didn't fall but i


---------70:56----------
couldn't make it to the top i was just


---------70:58----------
too out of shape and weak and


---------71:02----------
how do you think i felt about


---------71:11----------
how myself i feel if i couldn't climb a


---------71:14----------
boulder i was trying to climb


---------71:16----------
i would just keep climbing i would not


---------71:17----------
give up i would figure yeah


---------71:19----------
yeah so i did that for a while and then


---------71:22----------
i realized that it was physically


---------71:24----------
impossible


---------71:26----------
did you try putting stuff around it to


---------71:28----------
climb


---------71:29----------
no i felt like that was cheating like i


---------71:32----------
wanted to climb it you know


---------71:35----------
yeah yeah how did you try to work out


---------71:38----------
after that to get stronger and stuff


---------71:41----------
sort of like for a day or two but then


---------71:44----------
that fizzled


---------71:44----------
how do you think i felt when i when i


---------71:46----------
failed


---------71:48----------
how does failure feel like i


---------71:51----------
probably felt disappointed yeah


---------71:54----------
right i felt weak and i was like yeah i


---------71:57----------
need to work out and get into shape and


---------71:59----------
things like that


---------72:00----------
and then i remember this really strange


---------72:02----------
moment where i like looked around


---------72:05----------
and i looked around because i was like


---------72:07----------
does everyone realize how


---------72:09----------
out of shape i am was anyone watching


---------72:12----------
and i was like oh


---------72:13----------
like no one was watching and no one


---------72:14----------
gives a


---------72:16----------
and that like all of my disappointment


---------72:18----------
like comes from me it doesn't come from


---------72:20----------
anywhere else the boulder certainly


---------72:21----------
doesn't give a


---------72:23----------
but what if people were watching how


---------72:24----------
would you feel ah


---------72:26----------
so now people watch right


---------72:30----------
and so what i learned that day is like


---------72:32----------
most of the things that we beat


---------72:34----------
ourselves up for


---------72:35----------
come from us ultimately they all come


---------72:37----------
from us and that you can learn


---------72:39----------
a way to like literally become


---------72:41----------
impervious to the criticism of others


---------72:44----------
and that's what confidence is impervious


---------72:46----------
is immune


---------72:47----------
ice block okay so it's like


---------72:51----------
i'm ice blocked like you can't hurt me


---------72:52----------
anymore but that's what confidence is


---------72:55----------
like when you when you derive a sense of


---------72:57----------
self-worth


---------72:58----------
from in here people can say whatever the


---------73:01----------
 they want to


---------73:02----------
and it doesn't affect you your eyes


---------73:04----------
blocked it's not that you're numb it's


---------73:06----------
just that you realize that like


---------73:07----------
they're allowed to have that opinion and


---------73:09----------
it's not that they're wrong it's just


---------73:11----------
i'm not going to let


---------73:12----------
their opinions determine my value as a


---------73:15----------
human being


---------73:17----------
but what if they come what if they take


---------73:20----------
that opinion


---------73:21----------
even if it's not based on anything


---------73:24----------
factual


---------73:25----------
they group up they


---------73:28----------
make the group larger and they


---------73:31----------
use that let's call it one opinion just


---------73:34----------
because it's not based on facts


---------73:35----------
and they spread it all over the internet


---------73:38----------
and you get that sounds awful


---------73:42----------
a lot of negativity yes that's when you


---------73:45----------
have to


---------73:46----------
watch what you do and what you say right


---------73:48----------
so


---------73:49----------
so far i've been lucky enough to not


---------73:51----------
have experienced that


---------73:55----------
and i don't know if you know i i've


---------73:58----------
dealt with


---------73:58----------
criticism i've dealt with harsh


---------74:01----------
criticism before


---------74:02----------
i've dealt with criticism from people


---------74:04----------
that are important to me


---------74:06----------
and so far i've maintained my confidence


---------74:10----------
i'm not saying i think if twitch tried


---------74:11----------
to tear me down or the internet


---------74:13----------
tried to tear me down they'd succeed


---------74:15----------
because they're just that powerful


---------74:17----------
i think the big difference though mira i


---------74:19----------
really wonder when you say it's their


---------74:20----------
opinion and it's not based on fact i


---------74:22----------
would question that


---------74:23----------
because one of the biggest sources of my


---------74:25----------
confidence is when someone tells me


---------74:26----------
something


---------74:28----------
i don't assume that they're wrong i


---------74:29----------
assume that they're right


---------74:31----------
so if i get a criticism and there have


---------74:33----------
been lots of people who criticized me


---------74:35----------
since i started streaming on twitch


---------74:37----------
i start with the premise of like maybe


---------74:39----------
this person knows what they're talking


---------74:40----------
about


---------74:42----------
and then i test it and then i see like


---------74:44----------
okay are there things about this


---------74:45----------
criticism that are fair and sometimes


---------74:49----------
the internet definitely like bandwagons


---------74:51----------
onto things


---------74:52----------
but i think like this is an important


---------74:53----------
part of soul searching on your part that


---------74:55----------
if like a lot of people think that


---------74:56----------
you're


---------74:57----------
doing something out of line you should


---------74:59----------
at least


---------75:00----------
be objective and like look and maybe you


---------75:02----------
did do something out of line


---------75:05----------
when i get criticisms i don't i don't


---------75:07----------
assume that they're wrong i don't assume


---------75:09----------
that i'm an expert it's like


---------75:10----------
anyone is entitled to criticize me and


---------75:12----------
they could be right


---------75:16----------
but what if you looked into that you


---------75:18----------
really reflect it and


---------75:19----------
and you just


---------75:23----------
don't see what they see whatsoever


---------75:27----------
sure so practically what i do is i i try


---------75:30----------
to engage people now i think that that


---------75:32----------
can be hard so it's different from a man


---------75:34----------
and a woman and it's different with the


---------75:35----------
internet


---------75:36----------
right so i think like there are some


---------75:38----------
things that i've come to appreciate that


---------75:39----------
are different about gender


---------75:41----------
but generally speaking if i don't


---------75:43----------
understand someone's criticism


---------75:44----------
i will actually make a full faith effort


---------75:47----------
to ask


---------75:49----------
and then you know say like hey i really


---------75:51----------
don't get this


---------75:54----------
right like i don't understand why like


---------75:57----------
i'll give you an example so one of


---------76:00----------
i'm working with someone who has a


---------76:01----------
parent who's upset


---------76:03----------
about my work because their child is


---------76:06----------
doing something that they don't want


---------76:07----------
them to do


---------76:09----------
and their child is doing something


---------76:10----------
that's objectively bad and they kind of


---------76:12----------
blame me for it


---------76:13----------
they're like since he's seeing you and


---------76:15----------
we're paying you a ton of money like


---------76:17----------
aren't you supposed to prevent this kind


---------76:18----------
of and so then like i kind of


---------76:21----------
you know there's a part of me that says


---------76:22----------
like i don't think you guys understand


---------76:24----------
like i'm not responsible for your


---------76:25----------
child's behavior your child is


---------76:27----------
responsible for your child's behavior


---------76:28----------
but you guys think that you know their


---------76:31----------
parents


---------76:32----------
a lot like yours who think that their


---------76:35----------
child should behave a certain way that


---------76:37----------
there's a right and there's a wrong


---------76:38----------
there's no sense of agency there's just


---------76:40----------
like there's a right and there's a wrong


---------76:42----------
and if there's a problem we throw money


---------76:43----------
at it and we find the best person out


---------76:45----------
there and he fixes it and the problem


---------76:46----------
goes away like they don't get


---------76:48----------
that like the problem here is that like


---------76:51----------
you guys can't communicate with your


---------76:52----------
child and he doesn't respect you


---------76:54----------
because you guys don't respect him but


---------76:56----------
i'll definitely stop and ask them


---------76:58----------
you know that's what i think and it's


---------77:00----------
actually i believe that because


---------77:02----------
i talked to them and i was like well


---------77:03----------
what do you guys think you guys think


---------77:04----------
that i'm i'm


---------77:05----------
letting your son down and i'm letting


---------77:07----------
you down so like tell me about in what


---------77:08----------
ways and am i letting you down


---------77:11----------
and they said like this this this and


---------77:12----------
like we thought this would happen and it


---------77:14----------
actually turned out that they had a


---------77:15----------
couple of very good criticisms


---------77:17----------
you know i realized like oh actually


---------77:19----------
during covet i haven't been checking up


---------77:21----------
with him because he has been doing


---------77:22----------
better and it's been a stressful time


---------77:23----------
so i can do better at that am i


---------77:26----------
responsible for their son's behavior no


---------77:28----------
but can i do better absolutely


---------77:31----------
does that make sense yeah


---------77:40----------
i'm just trying to apply it to my


---------77:42----------
situation so here


---------77:46----------
okay so yeah i like that


---------77:49----------
you brought that part up about any


---------77:51----------
criticism regardless of how


---------77:53----------
stupid or not factual i think it is you


---------77:56----------
can still derive something like really


---------77:57----------
reflecting that


---------77:58----------
but imagine with that


---------78:02----------
even though you're just telling me what


---------78:03----------
we're talking about like do you want to


---------78:04----------
just tell me what the internet got


---------78:05----------
pissed at you about


---------78:07----------
i mean there's just so much stuff i it's


---------78:09----------
not even that it's like i


---------78:11----------
i pretty much forgot all about it but i


---------78:13----------
want to make sure that in the future i


---------78:15----------
have like a better


---------78:16----------
formula to react to stuff which is why


---------78:19----------
i'm asking you


---------78:21----------
so that's one way of it but you know


---------78:24----------
sometimes people are just so


---------78:26----------
unhappy like those parents let's say


---------78:28----------
they just had their own issues and they


---------78:30----------
just want to


---------78:31----------
take it out on someone they they're


---------78:33----------
struggling with their son


---------78:35----------
they don't want to take responsibility


---------78:36----------
they're very immature themselves


---------78:38----------
and they put it on you like why do you


---------78:40----------
need to put up with that and let's say


---------78:42----------
they also


---------78:42----------
talking to everyone around saying how


---------78:44----------
bad of a psychiatrist you are


---------78:49----------
why do you need to put up with that you


---------78:50----------
don't need to put up with that


---------78:52----------
does it affect you absolutely do i


---------78:55----------
ignore it


---------78:56----------
no i mean so i don't ignore it i try to


---------78:59----------
address their concerns directly and if


---------79:00----------
there's a population that


---------79:02----------
matters i will address it with the


---------79:05----------
population as well


---------79:08----------
so for example like if people complain


---------79:10----------
to my boss which has happened before


---------79:12----------
i will go to my boss and you know


---------79:15----------
there's a part of that that feels


---------79:16----------
hurtful but then i'll go to my boss and


---------79:18----------
i'll explain


---------79:18----------
my side of the story and then there are


---------79:21----------
also times where like


---------79:23----------
you know i've been in conflict with


---------79:25----------
people and you don't ignore it but you


---------79:26----------
also like


---------79:28----------
address it directly and then


---------79:31----------
you can walk away like i think now we're


---------79:33----------
speaking so abstractly that i don't know


---------79:35----------
if it really makes


---------79:36----------
sense but you know so i'll give you just


---------79:38----------
a very clear example so i had an


---------79:41----------
issue with i was about to take a job and


---------79:44----------
we got down to defining what my title


---------79:46----------
was


---------79:47----------
and i felt like the title that they were


---------79:49----------
giving me was not


---------79:51----------
appropriate for the kind of work that i


---------79:53----------
was doing


---------79:55----------
and so there were a lot of people who


---------79:58----------
were my mentors and stuff who thought


---------80:00----------
who basically told me they're like the


---------80:01----------
title really doesn't matter like


---------80:03----------
you should just do it and you'll get the


---------80:05----------
title that you want in a few years


---------80:08----------
and then i kind of took issue with that


---------80:10----------
and i said well


---------80:12----------
this title is actually not the title for


---------80:14----------
the job that i'm doing and i want the


---------80:15----------
title for the job that i'm doing it's


---------80:18----------
not about ego it's about like this is


---------80:19----------
what i'm doing and i want a title that's


---------80:21----------
commensurate with that


---------80:23----------
and they took an issue with that and so


---------80:25----------
then i said


---------80:30----------
goodbye


---------80:32----------
so there wasn't any confrontation you


---------80:35----------
didn't feel


---------80:38----------
i felt disrespected right i felt taken


---------80:41----------
advantage of


---------80:44----------
and i felt betrayed because these were


---------80:47----------
people who and i think they still


---------80:48----------
do care about me they genuinely do


---------80:50----------
they've been incredibly supportive for


---------80:52----------
years and years and years


---------80:53----------
and i'm sure they think i'm egotistical


---------80:56----------
because after everything they had done


---------80:58----------
for me i


---------80:58----------
walked away but i just didn't think it


---------81:00----------
was fair


---------81:03----------
right so i think if you're dealing with


---------81:05----------
like venom from the internet like you


---------81:06----------
have to be like centered in here


---------81:11----------
and the more you're centered in here the


---------81:13----------
less the criticisms matter to you like


---------81:15----------
if you're doing what you're supposed to


---------81:16----------
be doing and you really didn't do


---------81:17----------
anything wrong


---------81:18----------
chances are i mean i mean there were


---------81:20----------
things that i did that were out of line


---------81:22----------
and stuff like that so you reflect on


---------81:23----------
those and you grow from them


---------81:24----------
you even concede those points but i find


---------81:27----------
that


---------81:28----------
you know generally speaking like even


---------81:29----------
with twitch chat like there have been


---------81:30----------
times where i've made


---------81:31----------
mistakes of course


---------81:35----------
and what i usually do is like i don't


---------81:37----------
know i mean i don't know how often


---------81:38----------
this is actually i apologize a fair


---------81:40----------
amount on stream


---------81:43----------
and usually i find that the internet is


---------81:45----------
like actually a


---------81:46----------
bizarrely understanding place like i


---------81:48----------
respect twitch chat a lot like i don't


---------81:50----------
think they're a bunch of mindless noobs


---------81:52----------
who are haters i think you've got to be


---------81:54----------
careful because there certainly are


---------81:55----------
communities of people who are very toxic


---------81:58----------
and they can hate you yep


---------82:01----------
do you think there's prejudice towards


---------82:04----------
uh women because


---------82:05----------
absolutely people like i said


---------82:08----------
males young males i can't really relate


---------82:11----------
absolutely


---------82:13----------
right so i said that at the get-go like


---------82:14----------
i can get away with some things because


---------82:16----------
i'm a


---------82:17----------
man and you're gonna get a different


---------82:19----------
shake


---------82:20----------
and that's unfortunate like i can't and


---------82:23----------
i can't pretend


---------82:24----------
to say that what i can do is doable for


---------82:26----------
you because like


---------82:27----------
i think you just deal with more venom


---------82:29----------
than i do


---------82:32----------
right like yeah sometimes i really


---------82:35----------
question if


---------82:36----------
it's a waste of energy to even respond


---------82:38----------
but like if you don't put your five


---------82:40----------
cents in


---------82:40----------
people you will just say oh okay


---------82:42----------
whatever is going on it's right


---------82:44----------
but mira the only way i find


---------82:48----------
frustrating about this conversation is


---------82:50----------
that i don't know what you're talking


---------82:52----------
about


---------82:55----------
and i feel like if i understood what you


---------82:57----------
were talking about then it would be like


---------82:58----------
way easier to like


---------83:00----------
actually because we're talking about


---------83:01----------
hypotheticals


---------83:04----------
yeah but we use your situation it was


---------83:06----------
perfect because like i actually


---------83:08----------
the first example with the parents


---------83:11----------
it was actually perfect like i


---------83:16----------
i really don't want to go into that okay


---------83:18----------
because i don't know you know


---------83:20----------
it's water under the bridge so well i


---------83:22----------
don't think it is though


---------83:24----------
i don't think it's water under the


---------83:25----------
bridge because whatever happened there


---------83:27----------
shapes the way that you look at the


---------83:29----------
world and shapes who you are today


---------83:31----------
of course i'm like so careful right now


---------83:34----------
about everything i


---------83:35----------
avoid any type of collaborate with like


---------83:38----------
any any streamer at this point you're


---------83:40----------
probably the only


---------83:40----------
the first streamer i talked to in like


---------83:42----------
two years like i've been streaming on my


---------83:44----------
own since then it's just and now i find


---------83:46----------
myself being incredibly curious which i


---------83:48----------
i'm not trying to push you i'm just


---------83:49----------
sharing my feelings okay so please


---------83:51----------
i mean i i can imagine you're gonna feel


---------83:53----------
pushed so be aware of that


---------83:55----------
now i find myself like what the


---------83:56----------
actually happened with you mira like


---------83:58----------
what happened


---------84:02----------
you don't have to answer that that's


---------84:03----------
just like i hear you saying i haven't


---------84:05----------
talked to streamers in two years and


---------84:07----------
it's like holy like what is this


---------84:08----------
girl gone through


---------84:10----------
what happened to her


---------84:15----------
that's my that's my reaction when i hear


---------84:17----------
you say that


---------84:18----------
and you've been dodging questions from


---------84:20----------
the get-go and i i'm fine with that


---------84:22----------
like every time i ask you a question


---------84:24----------
like you know your default is to ask me


---------84:25----------
you've been deflecting


---------84:26----------
this whole time which is fine i i get


---------84:28----------
that you this has been a place where


---------84:30----------
you've gotten


---------84:32----------
screwed and attacked so of course you're


---------84:34----------
going to be doing that


---------84:36----------
i think yeah i feel like it doesn't


---------84:37----------
matter what i say like


---------84:39----------
there's just a lot of prejudice at this


---------84:41----------
point so it's better not to talk


---------84:44----------
about it at all that pisses me off so


---------84:46----------
much


---------84:48----------
because i do not want to live in a world


---------84:50----------
where it does not matter what you say


---------84:52----------
like that's not right your words should


---------84:56----------
always have value


---------84:57----------
and like i don't want you to believe


---------84:59----------
that about yourself like however


---------85:00----------
prejudiced it is


---------85:01----------
but like don't believe for a second that


---------85:03----------
your words don't matter because they do


---------85:08----------
yeah i guess maybe because i didn't


---------85:09----------
express like i said i am generally


---------85:11----------
pretty bad at communicating with people


---------85:13----------
you know sometimes you want to say


---------85:15----------
something you feel a certain way but it


---------85:16----------
comes out completely different and


---------85:18----------
people


---------85:19----------
uh take it differently so maybe because


---------85:23----------
i didn't do it correctly in the past


---------85:24----------
like whenever i


---------85:25----------
try to say what i wanted to say just


---------85:29----------
always turn out to be not good


---------85:32----------
so well like i'm talking about the


---------85:35----------
situations that we're not


---------85:38----------
you know like sticky iffy situations


---------85:43----------
so i think it's just best to probably


---------85:52----------
okay


---------85:54----------
i'm sorry if i pushed you in a way that


---------85:55----------
was like made you uncomfortable


---------85:59----------
um i no you you didn't


---------86:03----------
i it did remind me a little bit of like


---------86:06----------
how unfair some situations were and i'm


---------86:09----------
like


---------86:10----------
and it's still sitting there i can feel


---------86:11----------
that emotional response


---------86:18----------
but it's not really what i wanted to


---------86:19----------
talk to uh to talk about on stream today


---------86:21----------
that's not it's in the past um


---------86:24----------
i i feel like i'm i want to focus more


---------86:26----------
like the present and like what's going


---------86:28----------
on right now and


---------86:29----------
how much progress i made mira i i know


---------86:32----------
like i'm not


---------86:33----------
i'm sorry if i'm you got to really let


---------86:35----------
me know if i'm like doing something


---------86:36----------
that's


---------86:36----------
that's disrespectful but i don't think


---------86:38----------
it's in the past right like we're


---------86:40----------
well this whole conversation is about


---------86:42----------
you looking inside


---------86:44----------
and finding answers within yourself but


---------86:46----------
this is inside you


---------86:48----------
and you're looking away from it


---------86:52----------
you've been looking away from this


---------86:54----------
your entire life like


---------86:55----------
like and and the thing the problem i


---------86:59----------
mean there's so many subtle things that


---------87:00----------
are actually like really really


---------87:02----------
terrifying to hear you say


---------87:04----------
right like to hear you say that your


---------87:06----------
words don't matter and i have no doubt


---------87:08----------
in my mind that like


---------87:09----------
when you were growing up with your


---------87:11----------
parents you felt the exact same way


---------87:14----------
but the whole thing the whole point is


---------87:15----------
that you do matter and what you feel on


---------87:17----------
the inside


---------87:18----------
is important and if people hurt you


---------87:20----------
that's not okay


---------87:22----------
if they were unfair to you that's not


---------87:24----------
okay


---------87:28----------
and i want you to to find a place within


---------87:30----------
yourself where you can


---------87:32----------
sit with that and say that sometimes


---------87:33----------
people are on the outside


---------87:35----------
but it is not a reflection of who i am


---------87:37----------
as a person


---------87:41----------
that what you want in life is important


---------87:47----------
and that your words absolutely do matter


---------87:55----------
and you are intelligent and you're


---------87:56----------
capable and you care about people


---------87:59----------
and you're moving the right forward in


---------88:00----------
the right direction in life which i


---------88:02----------
think is amazing


---------88:04----------
given all the that you had to deal


---------88:06----------
with


---------88:08----------
growing up with a life where you've been


---------88:10----------
given check boxes


---------88:11----------
and then being in a place like being a


---------88:13----------
public figure where the world judges you


---------88:15----------
for what comes out of your mouth


---------88:17----------
is terrifying and for you to like start


---------88:21----------
to discover your own path


---------88:23----------
and to to a certain degree move past all


---------88:25----------
that is amazing


---------88:31----------
sorry sorry i should be apologizing


---------88:34----------
because you've signaled to me several


---------88:36----------
times


---------88:37----------
that this is an uncomfortable topic for


---------88:38----------
you and i just can't let this go because


---------88:40----------
like i don't want to let this go


---------88:44----------
because it's not water under the bridge


---------88:48----------
right it's water that's flooded your


---------88:49----------
basement


---------88:51----------
and it doesn't belong there and it's got


---------88:52----------
to get cleaned out because you deserve


---------88:54----------
to be happy in life


---------88:57----------
well i think this is one of the battles


---------89:00----------
i cannot win


---------89:03----------
you can't change their mind but you can


---------89:05----------
acknowledge for yourself that it hurts


---------89:08----------
and you can let it go


---------89:09----------
you can still speak your truth and take


---------89:12----------
solace in the fact that like


---------89:13----------
you were confident in who you are and


---------89:15----------
that you spoke your truth


---------89:17----------
and that other people are not willing to


---------89:22----------
listen


---------89:25----------
right now i think the problem is that


---------89:26----------
their opinions of you


---------89:28----------
affect the way that you view yourself


---------89:32----------
expectation that's why the trees are so


---------89:35----------
happy for you


---------89:36----------
because you don't have to deal with any


---------89:37----------
of that


---------89:41----------
the trees are wonderful yeah


---------89:53----------
but uh yeah to some degree it does


---------89:55----------
affect me there were some


---------89:57----------
points sometimes in my life where i was


---------90:01----------
googling again and why a psychopath or


---------90:04----------
seeing a therapist or generally asking


---------90:07----------
my psychopath


---------90:08----------
and when she was saying no i was like


---------90:09----------
how do you know if i'm a psychopath you


---------90:11----------
wouldn't know i would trick you


---------90:14----------
so twitch chat really makes you


---------90:17----------
put some funny ideas in your head huh


---------90:20----------
yeah so i think um i mean if it's any


---------90:23----------
consolation i'm kind of a psychopath


---------90:26----------
take that for what it's worth but um


---------90:30----------
in which way so i think so we got to do


---------90:32----------
a stream about


---------90:34----------
psychopathy and sociopathy because it's


---------90:36----------
been coming up time and again but like


---------90:39----------
i would love to watch that so


---------90:42----------
you know i think i think


---------90:45----------
doing so what what a sociopath or


---------90:48----------
psychopath is


---------90:49----------
someone who is able to separate their


---------90:52----------
emotions


---------90:53----------
or not feel emotions when they act in


---------90:55----------
certain ways


---------90:58----------
that's superior that's superior this is


---------91:01----------
not bad


---------91:02----------
yeah i don't think that sociopathy is


---------91:04----------
necessarily bad why is it perceived as


---------91:06----------
bad


---------91:08----------
because some people


---------91:11----------
because sometimes it leads to predatory


---------91:13----------
stuff


---------91:14----------
right so like people who can separate


---------91:16----------
their emotions are able to hurt and take


---------91:19----------
advantage of people


---------91:20----------
in a way that people who cannot separate


---------91:23----------
themselves from their emotions


---------91:25----------
can't so if i was free from all kinds of


---------91:28----------
guilt it's way easier for me to be a


---------91:29----------
criminal


---------91:31----------
right but if you test people for


---------91:34----------
sociopathy


---------91:35----------
you find that politicians test highly on


---------91:38----------
the sociopathy scale


---------91:39----------
but also physicians surgeons and


---------91:42----------
psychiatrists


---------91:44----------
surgeons and psychiatrists are the two


---------91:46----------
types of physicians who test the most


---------91:48----------
highly


---------91:48----------
and it's just because in my case like if


---------91:50----------
i got overwhelmed by all of the emotions


---------91:52----------
that i feel


---------91:53----------
with people i couldn't be able to help


---------91:55----------
anyone of course right


---------91:57----------
yeah so being able to separate yourself


---------92:00----------
from your emotions


---------92:01----------
is a little bit of an adaptive strategy


---------92:05----------
and in your case this comes back to the


---------92:07----------
numbness


---------92:08----------
like why do you feel numb it's because


---------92:10----------
you've got in there that you don't


---------92:12----------
want to feel


---------92:16----------
and the whole point of like if you want


---------92:17----------
to talk about how to find happiness you


---------92:19----------
can't be numb on the inside


---------92:21----------
but the problem is that you've got so


---------92:23----------
much down there that you turn down


---------92:25----------
the volume it's kind of like


---------92:26----------
i want you to imagine this for a second


---------92:27----------
right let's say you've got a radio and


---------92:29----------
there's a


---------92:30----------
station that's playing really bad music


---------92:31----------
and there's a station that's playing


---------92:33----------
really good music


---------92:34----------
and how do you deal with the really bad


---------92:36----------
music you turn the volume all the way


---------92:37----------
down


---------92:38----------
and then you can't listen to the good


---------92:39----------
music either because the volume is


---------92:40----------
turned all the way down


---------92:43----------
okay in order for you to be happy you


---------92:46----------
have to stop being numb


---------92:47----------
but the problem is that in order for you


---------92:49----------
if you stop being numb


---------92:50----------
you're gonna dig into all this that


---------92:52----------
you say is water on the bridge it's not


---------92:53----------
water


---------92:54----------
under the bridge it was water under the


---------92:55----------
bridge you wouldn't be feeling whatever


---------92:56----------
you've been feeling for the last couple


---------92:58----------
of minutes


---------93:00----------
and if people treated you bad like you


---------93:02----------
should feel bad about that and you


---------93:04----------
should feel


---------93:04----------
sorrow and you should say that's not


---------93:06----------
unfair and you should receive


---------93:08----------
comfort and if you up in some way


---------93:11----------
you should be reflective


---------93:12----------
and you should be honest with yourself


---------93:14----------
about whether you made mistakes or not


---------93:17----------
and you should learn from that and then


---------93:19----------
let it truly be water under the bridge


---------93:28----------
and then you can be happy


---------93:29----------
[Music]

[Music]


---------97:29----------
they get so confused when i'm home


---------97:32----------
and now we're home all the time so they


---------97:34----------
don't understand when it's play time and


---------97:35----------
when it's not play time


---------97:38----------
yeah i get it i get it so do you think


---------97:41----------
it's important that


---------97:42----------
i i really don't want to go into that


---------97:46----------
so if there's any type of i guess


---------97:49----------
negative emotion from the past


---------97:52----------
do you really think i need to like do


---------97:54----------
more


---------97:56----------
work on that and i guess try to close


---------97:59----------
that


---------97:59----------
gift i mean it doesn't have to be now


---------98:04----------
but if if it sits with you still like


---------98:07----------
you


---------98:08----------
you owe it to yourself to be unburdened


---------98:10----------
of that


---------98:14----------
right i can't just like


---------98:17----------
move on from that that doesn't really


---------98:20----------
work like that


---------98:21----------
um sorry


---------98:25----------
i'm so sorry about this mira i don't


---------98:27----------
know if there


---------98:31----------
give me a second okay i'm sorry


---------99:10----------
this


---------99:13----------
[Music]


---------99:15----------
i'm really sorry about that mirror you


---------99:16----------
were saying do you have to


---------99:20----------
you ha do you have to deal with those


---------99:21----------
emotions


---------99:23----------
uh yeah i mean it's been a while and i


---------99:25----------
sort of moved on from that but


---------99:27----------
um you know you kind of


---------99:31----------
brought up a few questions and erased


---------99:33----------
emotions in me so you're saying this


---------99:35----------
will


---------99:35----------
keep effect in my overall state


---------99:38----------
somewhere there


---------99:39----------
this is going to keep sitting and i need


---------99:40----------
to clean it up absolutely


---------99:47----------
cleaning it up may not be as hard as you


---------99:48----------
think it is though


---------99:51----------
well see when i try to talk to a


---------99:53----------
therapist about this most of times they


---------99:55----------
don't even get that stuff and i mean


---------99:58----------
talking to people that


---------100:02----------
cause the negativity in my life is


---------100:04----------
definitely


---------100:05----------
useless so a good way to be just


---------100:10----------
ignoring it i guess close enough well so


---------100:13----------
processing emotions doesn't have to


---------100:15----------
happen


---------100:16----------
through talking about them so i think


---------100:19----------
like this is where something like a good


---------100:21----------
meditative practice


---------100:22----------
could help but you know if you're going


---------100:24----------
to become a psychologist


---------100:26----------
at some point oftentimes the training of


---------100:28----------
becoming a psychologist


---------100:30----------
involves like doing therapy yourself


---------100:32----------
like being a client


---------100:33----------
or patient in therapy i'm not saying you


---------100:35----------
have to deal with it now


---------100:37----------
and it doesn't necessarily have to be


---------100:39----------
with a professional although i think


---------100:40----------
that's good and i'm surprised to hear


---------100:42----------
that you say that


---------100:43----------
you know therapists don't understand


---------100:45----------
this stuff


---------100:47----------
you know twitch and gaming and like so


---------100:49----------
far


---------100:50----------
from what like normies i shouldn't say


---------100:52----------
normally like normal people


---------100:55----------
yeah life are like they it's hard for


---------100:57----------
them to relate usually


---------101:00----------
well yeah but i mean i think a good


---------101:01----------
therapist is


---------101:03----------
like there are a lot of things i mean i


---------101:04----------
have a lot of clients that i don't


---------101:07----------
relate to because i can't understand


---------101:09----------
like take for example you like i can't


---------101:11----------
understand i've never been crucified on


---------101:13----------
the internet before


---------101:14----------
i'm not a woman on the internet and are


---------101:17----------
going to be fundamental things about


---------101:19----------
your experience that i will never be


---------101:21----------
able to understand


---------101:23----------
right like how can i know what it's like


---------101:26----------
to be a woman on the internet because


---------101:27----------
that's very different from being a man


---------101:29----------
on the internet


---------101:31----------
how do you advise in situations like


---------101:33----------
that you just do it for the best of your


---------101:35----------
knowledge


---------101:36----------
yeah so so if you don't know


---------101:40----------
like but in order to help someone you


---------101:42----------
don't have to be able to relate to them


---------101:44----------
fully


---------101:46----------
right you just need to be able to


---------101:47----------
support them uh you kind of like lead


---------101:50----------
them in the


---------101:50----------
through the process right and they do


---------101:52----------
not even lead them but like for example


---------101:55----------
you know when i have a client who talks


---------101:57----------
about postpartum depression


---------101:59----------
i have no idea what postpartum


---------102:01----------
depression is like like i can't even


---------102:03----------
begin to understand postpartum


---------102:05----------
depression because i can't begin to like


---------102:08----------
understand what it's like to be pregnant


---------102:10----------
and when i talk when i work with women


---------102:11----------
with postpartum depression they'll say


---------102:13----------
things like


---------102:14----------
you know they'll feel like bad mothers


---------102:16----------
like they're not


---------102:17----------
a good mother and like i can't i don't


---------102:19----------
know what that feels like right like i


---------102:21----------
don't know what it's like


---------102:23----------
when you can't breastfeed a child and


---------102:26----------
people judge you for not breastfeeding


---------102:28----------
because breastfeeding is healthier than


---------102:29----------
bottle feeding and all that kind of crap


---------102:31----------
there's a lot of stuff that i can't


---------102:32----------
understand but it doesn't mean that i


---------102:33----------
can't help people


---------102:35----------
and and the this is the beauty is that


---------102:37----------
like actually


---------102:38----------
mira like you don't need someone to


---------102:41----------
teach you and this is the whole thing


---------102:42----------
you're looking for me for answers like i


---------102:44----------
think you grossly underestimate


---------102:46----------
what you yourself are capable of


---------102:49----------
you don't need someone who's gone


---------102:51----------
through your experience and it's bad on


---------102:52----------
their part if they didn't


---------102:54----------
help you understand this or maybe they


---------102:56----------
didn't you just didn't have a good


---------102:57----------
connection with them


---------102:59----------
but like you're gonna you're able to do


---------103:00----------
most of this work on your own


---------103:02----------
like you need some help and some support


---------103:04----------
you need a space more than anything else


---------103:08----------
you need space to do this work and that


---------103:10----------
can come from trees it can come from


---------103:12----------
meditative practice it can come from a


---------103:14----------
person


---------103:17----------
and you need to feel those things and


---------103:19----------
then like recognize that you were hurt


---------103:22----------
and that you know you're scarred


---------103:26----------
and also let yourself recognize that it


---------103:28----------
doesn't make you a bad person


---------103:31----------
that there have been may have been


---------103:32----------
mistakes that you you made there may


---------103:34----------
have been things that you did that were


---------103:35----------
callous


---------103:37----------
what is callus callus is like unfeeling


---------103:42----------
right like you you may have


---------103:45----------
you may have done things without the


---------103:47----------
consideration of other people's feelings


---------103:50----------
ah okay but that too doesn't it doesn't


---------103:53----------
mean that you're a sociopath a lot of


---------103:55----------
times when people


---------103:56----------
are mean to other people it comes from


---------103:58----------
hurt


---------104:00----------
and so like if you did lash out in some


---------104:02----------
way or you were mean to people in some


---------104:04----------
way like does that come from hurt or


---------104:07----------
does that come from you being a bad


---------104:08----------
person


---------104:09----------
because somewhere inside you right now


---------104:11----------
is this idea that you're not good enough


---------104:13----------
or you're a bad person or something i


---------104:15----------
don't really know


---------104:16----------
like there's something in there about


---------104:18----------
the way that you view yourself where you


---------104:20----------
have this like


---------104:22----------
very very like relentless focus on


---------104:24----------
positivity and finding the right answer


---------104:27----------
but like why do you need the right


---------104:28----------
answer like why do you need to be better


---------104:30----------
like why can't you just be content with


---------104:31----------
the person that you are


---------104:35----------
because there's something within you


---------104:36----------
that's like deeply discontent


---------104:39----------
and what is that and why aren't you


---------104:42----------
happy right now


---------104:43----------
what's missing from your life is it


---------104:45----------
something external or is it something


---------104:48----------
do you believe that something that you


---------104:49----------
do in the outside world is gonna make a


---------104:51----------
certain feeling in here go away


---------104:55----------
it's honestly not that i feel like i'm a


---------104:57----------
bad person i feel bad about myself


---------105:00----------
it's that whip that's telling me that i


---------105:02----------
need to progress


---------105:03----------
i need to keep going just get better get


---------105:06----------
better


---------105:06----------
just fix everything be perfect get to


---------105:10----------
that final form that's what it is


---------105:12----------
yeah right but if you think about that


---------105:16----------
if you feel like you have to get better


---------105:18----------
you're not happy with who you are


---------105:22----------
those two things come hand in hand yeah


---------105:25----------
definitely not fully and so how can you


---------105:29----------
learn to be


---------105:30----------
happier and what is it that has taught


---------105:32----------
you to be unhappy with who you are


---------105:34----------
because that's learned top of the list


---------105:37----------
is tiger parents


---------105:39----------
honestly it's just the society around


---------105:42----------
i feel so good by myself like it's when


---------105:45----------
i interact with


---------105:46----------
other people not always but like there's


---------105:48----------
some interactions with other people it


---------105:49----------
just brings so much


---------105:50----------
traction and i'm just like oh yeah


---------105:54----------
being by yourself or somewhere in the


---------105:56----------
nature just it's that's


---------105:58----------
good so absolutely i'm not a social


---------106:00----------
human being i guess


---------106:01----------
no i don't know that it's your social


---------106:03----------
human being i think you're a human being


---------106:04----------
who's been hurt by other human beings


---------106:10----------
so what if those human beings think that


---------106:12----------
i heard them


---------106:15----------
they felt hurt by you i i don't know


---------106:19----------
maybe you were just not compatible


---------106:21----------
possibly


---------106:22----------
sure but you have to acknowledge the


---------106:26----------
possibility that you did hurt them


---------106:29----------
and maybe that's what you're steering


---------106:30----------
away from


---------106:36----------
so right mira we can definitely have


---------106:41----------
you know we can i'm gonna have to get


---------106:43----------
going in a couple of minutes


---------106:45----------
and i definitely want to teach you to


---------106:46----------
meditate and i want to give you a chance


---------106:47----------
to ask questions if you have questions


---------106:50----------
um but let me try to like tie things up


---------106:52----------
for you so the first thing is


---------106:54----------
i think that you're on a wonderful path


---------106:56----------
and i you know i really am rooting for


---------106:58----------
you


---------106:59----------
um i don't know exactly what happened


---------107:00----------
i'm not i sort of


---------107:02----------
sometimes i wonder whether it's a good


---------107:04----------
thing or a bad thing that i'm not too


---------107:05----------
familiar with like


---------107:07----------
who people are on twitch um


---------107:11----------
but i think it's wonderful that you're


---------107:12----------
like exploring this and you're trying to


---------107:14----------
figure out what you want to do and that


---------107:15----------
you want to help other people


---------107:17----------
very concretely i think you should spend


---------107:19----------
some time being happy on your own like


---------107:21----------
with trees and stuff


---------107:22----------
and the cool thing is like if you let


---------107:24----------
some of these emotions up i think the


---------107:26----------
trees are going to help you with those


---------107:28----------
and you kind of let it up and you let it


---------107:30----------
out and you leave them with the trees


---------107:31----------
the trees will take it


---------107:33----------
they have no problem with it and then


---------107:35----------
you kind of come back


---------107:36----------
and then i think that you've just been


---------107:38----------
hurt like you're someone who's been


---------107:39----------
traumatized


---------107:41----------
right and you've gotta like you can't


---------107:43----------
trauma


---------107:44----------
water under the bridge is not is a lot


---------107:46----------
of times what trauma feels like but it's


---------107:48----------
not really like under the bridge


---------107:50----------
it's just in the basement it's not truly


---------107:53----------
gone


---------107:53----------
it's just tucked away


---------107:56----------
and i think i can feel it on my own


---------107:58----------
right if i just


---------107:59----------
spend time with nature and just the good


---------108:02----------
things i hope so


---------108:05----------
i hope so but maybe you can't i don't


---------108:07----------
know


---------108:09----------
right yeah and and


---------108:12----------
you know i think there are definitely


---------108:14----------
some techniques that i can teach you


---------108:15----------
today which hopefully will give you a


---------108:17----------
better understanding of yourself


---------108:19----------
these techniques are not geared towards


---------108:21----------
understanding i mean they're not geared


---------108:22----------
towards healing they're geared towards


---------108:23----------
understanding


---------108:26----------
and yeah i mean i think that


---------108:31----------
i i don't know that you're gonna be able


---------108:34----------
to heal it


---------108:35----------
on yourself and even then we see a


---------108:37----------
subtle


---------108:39----------
example of your thought process which is


---------108:41----------
this ideal of you being healed


---------108:43----------
like can you accept that you may never


---------108:45----------
be fully healed you'll never get back to


---------108:47----------
100


---------108:48----------
hp you know that you'll get to 90. like


---------108:52----------
that comes back to this once again your


---------108:54----------
final form of a perfect healed


---------108:57----------
like that's the problem is like you you


---------108:59----------
have to accept that you're going to be


---------109:00----------
flawed


---------109:03----------
right right


---------109:06----------
okay


---------109:10----------
so thoughts questions before we meditate


---------109:13----------
let's get to it


---------109:15----------
okay so um


---------109:20----------
let me first ask you do you wanna


---------109:24----------
have you done like breath oriented


---------109:25----------
meditation before


---------109:28----------
um i tried one hot one okay


---------109:32----------
um so i have two techniques both of


---------109:34----------
which i've kind of taught i think on


---------109:36----------
stream before


---------109:37----------
so some of this may be familiar have you


---------109:39----------
seen the charging the laser beam


---------109:41----------
technique


---------109:43----------
that's what people call it here okay so


---------109:45----------
i'm going to teach you a form of


---------109:46----------
meditation that


---------109:47----------
is focused on your agna chakra agna


---------109:50----------
chakra is your third eye


---------109:53----------
i like that x in there


---------109:59----------
these are third eye meditations and if


---------110:01----------
you have the option to like if you ever


---------110:02----------
join like a yoga classroom meditation


---------110:04----------
class


---------110:05----------
and people have can teach you third eye


---------110:07----------
meditations i would learn those because


---------110:08----------
i think you have a talent for it


---------110:11----------
um so the technique is kind of weird so


---------110:13----------
i want you to take your middle finger


---------110:15----------
sit up straight take your middle finger


---------110:17----------
is it okay that i'm cross-legged


---------110:19----------
yeah cross-legged is great i'm actually


---------110:22----------
going to sit cross-legged myself


---------110:25----------
so take your middle finger close your


---------110:27----------
eyes sit up straight keep your neck


---------110:28----------
straight


---------110:29----------
and i want you to hover your middle


---------110:31----------
finger above


---------110:33----------
yeah a little bit further down yeah


---------110:35----------
right there close your eyes


---------110:37----------
don't touch your forehead


---------110:41----------
just hover it right above your forehead


---------110:44----------
and then focus on the sensation


---------110:48----------
on your forehead do you feel anything on


---------110:51----------
your forehead


---------110:52----------
with your finger hovering above it


---------110:59----------
i feel my left leg is falling asleep


---------111:02----------
okay you can adjust positions if you


---------111:05----------
need to but


---------111:06----------
just focus on the spot between your


---------111:08----------
eyebrows


---------111:14----------
okay so hover means like


---------111:17----------
one sorry english is your second


---------111:19----------
language like a millimeter away


---------111:21----------
center or okay


---------111:30----------
and if you don't feel anything you can


---------111:31----------
move a little bit closer but you don't


---------111:33----------
want to touch


---------111:36----------
and just concentrate on the point


---------111:38----------
between your eyebrows


---------111:42----------
maybe a few millimeters above


---------111:45----------
the center of your eyebrows


---------111:48----------
and hover your right hand middle finger


---------111:51----------
above it


---------112:11----------
and now go ahead and let your hand rest


---------112:13----------
come down


---------112:14----------
keep your eyes closed and focus on that


---------112:18----------
point in your forehead


---------112:21----------
try to send your attention


---------112:25----------
and your focus into that point


---------112:54----------
my headphones died sorry no problem


---------112:58----------
just focus your attention on


---------113:02----------
the center of your forehead kind of


---------113:04----------
between your eyebrows


---------113:09----------
and tell me if you feel anything


---------113:20----------
i think i feel


---------113:26----------
i feel warmth in my face but i think


---------113:29----------
it's because i'm just


---------113:30----------
hot right now okay so notice that


---------113:33----------
sensation


---------113:35----------
and return your concentration to the


---------113:38----------
to the eyebrow center


---------113:55----------
and now take a deep breath in


---------113:59----------
and notice the


---------114:02----------
air as it enters your nose


---------114:06----------
and notice the air as it leaves


---------114:18----------
and now with a breath inward


---------114:21----------
imagine the breath going up to that


---------114:23----------
point between your eyebrows


---------114:32----------
feel the coolness of the air as it


---------114:34----------
enters your nose


---------114:38----------
travels up


---------115:10----------
and now let your concentration return to


---------115:12----------
the point between your eyebrows


---------115:18----------
let go of the breath and bring your


---------115:21----------
finger up again


---------115:24----------
and point it at the spot


---------115:58----------
uh


---------116:10----------
bring it down


---------116:14----------
let your hand come down


---------116:33----------
concentrate on the spot


---------116:40----------
and now we'll bring the practice to a


---------116:42----------
close


---------116:44----------
put your palms together in front of you


---------116:49----------
i kind of like a namaste perfect rub


---------116:52----------
them together so you feel heat


---------116:53----------
and warmth and friction fast fast fast


---------116:56----------
fast fast fast fast


---------116:57----------
and then come over your eyes cup your


---------117:01----------
hands over your eyes


---------117:05----------
take a deep breath and as you exhale


---------117:07----------
slowly open your eyes


---------117:12----------
and let your hands come down when you're


---------117:22----------
ready


---------117:33----------
how do you feel


---------117:45----------
i feel a little bit lighter


---------117:52----------
i do have a lot of images going on


---------117:55----------
through my mind though when i close my


---------117:56----------
eyes uh do you have that too when you


---------117:59----------
meditate


---------118:00----------
not usually what do you mean by images


---------118:04----------
like first when you told me to put my


---------118:05----------
finger here


---------118:07----------
and i really started focusing on there


---------118:09----------
with my eyes closed i saw that i had a


---------118:11----------
big


---------118:11----------
bolt going through my hat


---------118:15----------
then as i started breathing deeply in


---------118:18----------
and it


---------118:18----------
said to push that air through it i kind


---------118:21----------
of pushed the bullet out


---------118:24----------
with the breath and i just had a hole


---------118:27----------
so i was thinking about the hole that i


---------118:29----------
have in there and my scalp


---------118:31----------
and then you told me to put the finger


---------118:33----------
there again and i put it all the way


---------118:34----------
through and i started


---------118:37----------
i had my hand and my head and going all


---------118:39----------
the way through my body it's just i have


---------118:41----------
a lot of images in my head usually when


---------118:43----------
i


---------118:43----------
take yeah good sounds good to me


---------118:48----------
yeah i think everyone's experience of


---------118:50----------
these techniques is different


---------118:52----------
but some of the sensations that you're


---------118:54----------
describing to me


---------118:56----------
make sense and like i think you're doing


---------118:59----------
it right basically


---------119:01----------
and and if you have those images let


---------119:02----------
those images come and


---------119:04----------
see you know not that you should analyze


---------119:07----------
them


---------119:07----------
too too extensively but if you want to


---------119:10----------
reflect on their meaning that's fine


---------119:12----------
and try to do the practice for let's say


---------119:14----------
three to five minutes and then


---------119:16----------
eventually work your way up to 10 or 15


---------119:18----------
minutes


---------119:19----------
i would shoot for three times a week


---------119:21----------
although if you want to be ambitious and


---------119:22----------
do every day that's


---------119:24----------
fine and then also


---------119:27----------
go ahead does it matter when i do that


---------119:30----------
so the short answer is any time is good


---------119:35----------
but sometimes are better


---------119:37----------
dawn and dusk are the best times for


---------119:38----------
meditation


---------119:41----------
there's some interesting stuff around


---------119:42----------
circadian rhythm cortisol levels


---------119:46----------
and like your body's natural cycle and


---------119:48----------
dawn and dusk are very attuned for


---------119:50----------
mental or spiritual activity


---------119:53----------
so if that's doable you know meditate at


---------119:55----------
sunrise or sunset


---------119:58----------
should i try not to think about anything


---------120:04----------
okay sorry


---------120:10----------
excuse me for a second


---------120:13----------
[Music]


---------120:17----------
i think i should let dr k go


---------120:21----------
you were saying should i try not to


---------120:22----------
think about anything


---------120:25----------
all right if i do have this


---------120:31----------
feeling right yeah so as you have


---------120:34----------
thoughts


---------120:35----------
you can kind of notice your thoughts but


---------120:37----------
don't get caught up in them


---------120:40----------
right and then you know you can have a


---------120:42----------
thought and then let your attention


---------120:43----------
return


---------120:44----------
to your forehead or your practice so


---------120:47----------
your attention is going to go away and


---------120:49----------
then it'll come back


---------120:50----------
and then if you have images you can sit


---------120:52----------
with those images i think that's fine


---------120:54----------
images or sensations just sit with those


---------120:56----------
and then a thought may happen but like


---------120:58----------
an image is not exactly a thought does


---------121:00----------
that make sense


---------121:02----------
right so i shouldn't try to block them i


---------121:04----------
can play with them right


---------121:05----------
yeah sure play with them and then then


---------121:08----------
don't


---------121:08----------
you'll you'll see i mean you'll let


---------121:10----------
yourself you can kind of play around


---------121:11----------
with it i think play with them is


---------121:12----------
actually the perfect thing to do


---------121:14----------
but don't get caught up in them unless


---------121:17----------
it feels


---------121:18----------
like don't get caught up in thoughts and


---------121:20----------
then after meditation


---------121:22----------
you may find that some of these thoughts


---------121:24----------
or sensations


---------121:25----------
or feelings start to arise and if they


---------121:28----------
arise after your meditation or before


---------121:30----------
your meditation


---------121:31----------
or even during your meditation you can


---------121:32----------
let them come up


---------121:36----------
don't get but don't go down the rabbit


---------121:38----------
hole with them


---------121:39----------
and if you want to reflect or process or


---------121:41----------
something like that you can do that


---------121:43----------
but i'd say especially after meditation


---------121:45----------
is when you should


---------121:46----------
let your mind be active and think and


---------121:49----------
try to understand and reflect on what


---------121:50----------
your experience has been


---------121:53----------
okay and in your case especially i don't


---------121:56----------
know that it's so much about time but i


---------121:58----------
do imagine it's about location


---------122:00----------
so i don't know where you live or what


---------122:02----------
the state of germa you said you're in


---------122:04----------
germany


---------122:05----------
yeah what germany is like but if you


---------122:07----------
have access to trees


---------122:09----------
i would strongly strongly recommend


---------122:12----------
that you make this practice part of like


---------122:15----------
even an hour-long thing where you go


---------122:18----------
outside you hike for a while


---------122:20----------
you find a spot sit down meditate for


---------122:22----------
like 15 or 20 minutes


---------122:24----------
and then you know let those thoughts


---------122:28----------
come up and those feelings come up and


---------122:30----------
then leave them


---------122:32----------
with the trees and then come back a


---------122:35----------
little bit lighter


---------122:37----------
yeah i'll do that thank you


---------122:42----------
strong work today thank you so much


---------122:45----------
any final thoughts or questions before


---------122:47----------
we wrap up


---------122:48----------

---------122:52----------

---------122:54----------

---------122:56----------

---------123:04----------

---------123:06----------

---------123:07----------

---------123:09----------
and if you run into if you have


---------123:10----------
questions about meditation or something


---------123:12----------
like shoot me a dm


---------123:13----------
and and we can talk about it okay all


---------123:15----------
right all right take care


---------123:17----------
bye-bye okay


---------123:23----------
[Music]


---------123:26----------
so


---------123:30----------
okay sorry about all the interruptions


---------123:32----------
guys i don't i think my daughter's


---------123:34----------
having a rough day today


---------123:35----------
um and so she's just you know it's


---------123:38----------
confusing for her because i'm at home


---------123:40----------
and she doesn't understand when


---------123:42----------
she can play with me and when she can't


---------123:44----------
so i apologize if that kind of disrupted


---------123:45----------
things


---------123:47----------
i think it sort of pulled mirror off the


---------123:49----------
hook though because she was getting you


---------123:50----------
know we were


---------123:51----------
going into some um pulled her off the


---------123:54----------
hook is maybe not the right term


---------123:56----------
but you know i think it was timely


---------123:59----------
that she went to a place that was


---------124:00----------
important for her and then also


---------124:02----------
got a break from it which is important


---------124:04----------
right we don't want to just like swim


---------124:05----------
around down there


---------124:07----------
we want to we want to we want to go


---------124:10----------
there for a time


---------124:11----------
and feel those feelings and then also


---------124:13----------
take a break for a time


---------124:14----------
right we don't want to like jump into


---------124:16----------
the ocean and live in the ocean we want


---------124:18----------
to


---------124:19----------
go for a quick dip and then come out and


---------124:21----------
dry off and then go again and then dry


---------124:24----------
off and


---------124:24----------
the more times you do that the better


---------124:26----------
you'll get it swimming


---------124:28----------

---------124:34----------
um we're unfortunately i don't have time


---------124:37----------

on friday we're going to have will sue


---------124:44----------
who's going to be talking about


---------124:45----------
psychedelics

---------124:49----------
harvard trained physician


---------124:51----------
who's an expert in psychedelics for both


---------124:53----------
medical and non-medical uses


---------124:56----------
so a big thing that's interesting about


---------124:58----------
will so will's a psychiatrist


---------124:59----------
um is that he's actually a proponent he


---------125:02----------
thinks that psychedelics are becoming


---------125:04----------
overly medicalized


---------125:06----------
and believes that they have value


---------125:08----------
outside of like treatment of


---------125:09----------
ptsd and depression and thinks that they


---------125:11----------
can be useful tools for


---------125:13----------
growth and understanding and


---------125:15----------
self-development
