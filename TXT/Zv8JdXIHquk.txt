---------00:00----------
foosley hello


---------00:03----------
hello it's working am i it might be


---------00:06----------
able to be heard hello yes it is working


---------00:09----------
wonderfully


---------00:11----------
this is very surreal already oh no


---------00:14----------
what is surreal about it wait what is


---------00:16----------
happening are you aware of something


---------00:18----------
oh no no it's because i i've seen a lot


---------00:21----------
of your uh


---------00:22----------
your episodes i watched them on youtube


---------00:25----------
who knows i told myself not to say that


---------00:28----------
and so i said that within the first


---------00:30----------
couple seconds


---------00:31----------
yeah so why would you tell yourself not


---------00:33----------
to say that though


---------00:34----------
because i don't want you to think that


---------00:38----------
i am expecting anything or


---------00:41----------
or have like a i don't know i guess it


---------00:43----------
just


---------00:44----------
it's like you go into a conversation


---------00:46----------
with somebody and you're like oh i


---------00:47----------
already know


---------00:48----------
everything about you not that i know


---------00:49----------
everything about you but like i


---------00:51----------
have seen like maybe i would say like 20


---------00:54----------
or 30 full episodes


---------00:55----------
so um it's like uh


---------00:59----------
i guess i just don't you know sometimes


---------01:00----------
you can just things are better left and


---------01:02----------
says you can let the conversation go


---------01:04----------
naturally


---------01:05----------
yeah so is the issue that you didn't


---------01:07----------
want me to think that you had


---------01:08----------
expectations or that you don't have


---------01:11----------
expectations


---------01:13----------
uh probably that i don't want you to


---------01:16----------
think


---------01:16----------
but you do have expectations oh um


---------01:20----------
no well i have like an idea of how it


---------01:22----------
might go because i've seen like you know


---------01:24----------
start to finish a lot


---------01:25----------
of them um but i'm willing for this to


---------01:28----------
go wherever so i didn't like you know


---------01:30----------
normally for something i would like


---------01:32----------
rehearse a bunch of things or like


---------01:34----------
um not like this is my first time


---------01:36----------
talking to any kind of therapist or any


---------01:39----------
like i've never talked so i i'm just


---------01:41----------
yeah i'm just interested to see where


---------01:43----------
this will go


---------01:43----------
but i didn't want this to be like oh i


---------01:45----------
know everything and i know you're going


---------01:46----------
to see this


---------01:47----------
and then we're going to do this at the


---------01:48----------
end oh no no no


---------01:51----------
someone has been doing replay analysis


---------01:53----------
and i'm at a disadvantage


---------01:55----------
oh no see that's what okay erase it all


---------01:58----------
okay chat she's figuring us out no i


---------02:01----------
haven't figured anything out i don't


---------02:02----------
know anything


---------02:03----------
it's okay you know yeah i think it's


---------02:05----------
totally fine um so


---------02:07----------
you know one of the things that we try


---------02:08----------
to do is like we bring things to the


---------02:10----------
surface and we become aware of them


---------02:12----------
so the fact that you have watched it i'm


---------02:13----------
really glad you told me we have talked


---------02:15----------
about it i'm aware of it


---------02:17----------
yeah totally fine so um but i am curious


---------02:19----------
where did you think this would go


---------02:22----------
i don't know like as in like me telling


---------02:24----------
you or like this


---------02:27----------
no no i mean the whole episode was there


---------02:30----------
something you wanted to talk about


---------02:32----------
no there's something i want to talk


---------02:33----------
about but it's not like um


---------02:36----------
i had this a whole like okay i'm going


---------02:37----------
to say this and you're going to say this


---------02:39----------
and i'm going to say this and then


---------02:39----------
you're going to say this and then we're


---------02:40----------
going to do the meditation thing and


---------02:41----------
then i'm going to go


---------02:43----------
yeah okay


---------02:46----------
great so yeah no i'm happy to for it to


---------02:51----------
go wherever


---------02:52----------
i feel like i'm like entering into a


---------02:53----------
game of starcraft where i'm thinking


---------02:54----------
about build orders and counters


---------02:57----------
yeah and i know i know every which way


---------02:59----------
this is gonna go


---------03:00----------
and i have an answer prepared prepare


---------03:03----------
for the sixth pool


---------03:04----------
if you know what that is but it's it's a


---------03:07----------
boomer term


---------03:08----------
it's a it's like so back in the


---------03:10----------
starcraft days


---------03:11----------
there was a race called zerg i guess the


---------03:13----------
zergs still exist


---------03:15----------
and and there was a super cheese strat


---------03:16----------
where you basically like don't build in


---------03:18----------
an economy


---------03:19----------
and you just like rush people with these


---------03:22----------
little things called zerglings and it


---------03:23----------
was like


---------03:24----------
people would rage a lot because it's


---------03:26----------
sort of like a low


---------03:27----------
it's a high risk high reward kind of


---------03:29----------
strategy and if you failed your sixth


---------03:31----------
pool you basically


---------03:32----------
lost the game i did that one time i


---------03:34----------
played starcraft for


---------03:35----------
like two days and then um my fiance was


---------03:38----------
helping me and he's like oh you just do


---------03:40----------
this strategy and he was like doing all


---------03:42----------
this stuff and then


---------03:43----------
i was like what are you doing and then


---------03:44----------
that was what it was i'm pretty sure he


---------03:46----------
was just


---------03:46----------
choosing them so i kind of know what


---------03:48----------
you're saying yeah cool


---------03:50----------
um so let's see if we can do better than


---------03:52----------
kind of for the rest of the conversation


---------03:54----------
okay so foosley um yeah this is a blast


---------03:58----------
i'm glad you you know yeah you mentioned


---------04:00----------
i just wanted to


---------04:01----------
but i would i'd feel like i was keeping


---------04:03----------
a secret if i didn't tell you that i had


---------04:05----------
watched 20 full episodes


---------04:07----------
okay probably more okay well that's


---------04:09----------
about


---------04:10----------
18 more than me so 18


---------04:14----------
more of i don't know yeah i don't watch


---------04:17----------
them


---------04:18----------
of your own oh yeah but you live them


---------04:21----------
yes yes that i i participate


---------04:25----------
um i find it very awkward to watch


---------04:27----------
myself i don't know if that's something


---------04:29----------
yeah i just can't i'm the same way i


---------04:31----------
can't watch myself i'm not well i would


---------04:33----------
never


---------04:33----------
like go stream myself and then come


---------04:36----------
like at the end of it go back and just


---------04:38----------
watch my whole stream but i do watch


---------04:40----------
funny clips of my own stream sometimes


---------04:42----------
if i'm like


---------04:43----------
what did people find funny and then i'm


---------04:45----------
like oh that was funny that was funny


---------04:47----------
something that strangely like disturbs


---------04:49----------
me is that my children have gotten used


---------04:51----------
to seeing


---------04:52----------
my face on the youtube recommended


---------04:54----------
algorithm


---------04:57----------
like at first they would comment on it


---------04:59----------
like they're like oh


---------05:00----------
that's daddy and then now it's just like


---------05:05----------
you know they just do they expect my


---------05:08----------
face to be on youtube which is strange


---------05:10----------
and do they watch like the okay


---------05:13----------
no they're three and five right


---------05:18----------
i was like i know i've seen them come in


---------05:20----------
and like


---------05:21----------
i can't imagine them like watching this


---------05:23----------
and like


---------05:24----------
really relating at all or understanding


---------05:27----------
the the only thing so the only piece of


---------05:29----------
hg content that they really do love to


---------05:31----------
consume is someone made


---------05:32----------
like some kind of like song where they


---------05:35----------
did like they made like a techno song


---------05:37----------
out of like me doing teaching and


---------05:39----------
meditation


---------05:40----------
and the kids absolutely love it and i


---------05:42----------
can't stand it like when they're


---------05:44----------
listening to it


---------05:45----------
but they really love it oh they remixed


---------05:47----------
you yeah yeah they like remix yeah


---------05:49----------
that's the word that's the word


---------05:51----------
yeah so they're like reflections


---------05:54----------
yeah well uh yeah just listen to it


---------05:56----------
without me


---------05:58----------
at the very end instead of meditating


---------05:59----------
we'll play the song and i'll just step


---------06:01----------
out of the room and you can just


---------06:02----------
jam i doubt um so


---------06:06----------
yeah foosley you are a very um


---------06:10----------
charismatic person oh really


---------06:13----------
yeah thanks oh cool it's a lot of fun to


---------06:17----------
talk to you


---------06:18----------
oh it's only been five minutes or ten


---------06:20----------
minutes oh i have to say one thing


---------06:22----------
so i was very nervous to come on um


---------06:25----------
even like last night i was like i have


---------06:27----------
to sleep early because i already know


---------06:29----------
i'm not i'm gonna have trouble sleeping


---------06:31----------
because i'm fine to sleep normally right


---------06:33----------
but then


---------06:34----------
if i have anything big the next day


---------06:36----------
anytime i need to talk to anything any


---------06:38----------
interview any


---------06:39----------
call it's like i have to give myself a


---------06:42----------
two


---------06:43----------
extra two hours to fall asleep yeah or


---------06:45----------
i'll because i know that like i'll close


---------06:46----------
my eyes i'm like just fall asleep


---------06:48----------
just fall asleep just fall asleep and


---------06:49----------
then like my mind starts racing with


---------06:51----------
like things and then i like open my eyes


---------06:53----------
and i'm like wide awake


---------06:54----------
so i tried different positions and i'm


---------06:56----------
like just fall asleep just anyway so


---------06:57----------
that was me last night i finally fell


---------06:59----------
asleep at some point


---------07:00----------
and then so i woke up and i was like


---------07:02----------
very


---------07:03----------
ready if anything what i did is i got


---------07:06----------
ready too early i was sitting in my


---------07:07----------
chair at 9


---------07:08----------
20 a.m ready and i just time to sit now


---------07:13----------
10 20. okay oh sorry for pst yeah so


---------07:16----------
so an hour i was ready and i just sat


---------07:20----------
here and like


---------07:21----------
my nerves would go and i felt my heart


---------07:24----------
going


---------07:25----------
and then and then it hit 10. and then


---------07:28----------
i'm actually very happy that you were


---------07:29----------
like you know we were we started a


---------07:31----------
little later


---------07:31----------
five minutes later because it gave my


---------07:33----------
heart time to like


---------07:35----------
calm down and then get nervous again and


---------07:36----------
then calm down and then


---------07:38----------
so that's just my morning anyways i just


---------07:41----------
wanted to


---------07:42----------
is that what you wanted to talk about do


---------07:44----------
you want to talk about maybe sleep


---------07:45----------
anxiety and


---------07:46----------
no uh well no i normally i i don't have


---------07:49----------
sleep anxiety i think that's


---------07:51----------
one thing that's just something that i


---------07:53----------
don't me


---------07:54----------
i feel like it's not a big deal like i


---------07:55----------
don't have insomnia i sleep really well


---------07:58----------
um eight nine hours a day if anything um


---------08:02----------
i'd say the thing i want to talk about


---------08:04----------
um


---------08:05----------
is more age pressure okay and um


---------08:09----------
age pressure and then like under age


---------08:12----------
pressure i think that comes with like


---------08:13----------
job pressure


---------08:14----------
um marriage pressure like there's just


---------08:16----------
it's like because


---------08:17----------
age is a thing um and i'm always


---------08:20----------
thinking about what i need to be doing


---------08:21----------
what's my step in life


---------08:23----------
then that leads to like me having


---------08:25----------
pressure with my job and pressure with


---------08:26----------
my


---------08:27----------
engagement slash marriage um and


---------08:30----------
no like never i'm always overthinking so


---------08:32----------
i'm never sure like


---------08:33----------
what's the right step to take if there's


---------08:35----------
a right step to take


---------08:37----------
um why am i doing something that i'm


---------08:39----------
doing is it because i want to or because


---------08:41----------
society wants me to or because that's


---------08:43----------
what


---------08:43----------
my parents want me to do or my viewers


---------08:45----------
want me to do


---------08:46----------
that's like an added layer it's like


---------08:48----------
being a streamer and being very open


---------08:50----------
on the internet about my thoughts and my


---------08:53----------
personal life they a lot of people have


---------08:55----------
inputs


---------08:58----------
so now i'm like oh okay i want to do


---------09:00----------
this but they want this one you know so


---------09:01----------
then


---------09:02----------
i get confused about what i want to do


---------09:05----------
yeah


---------09:05----------
dude i am so excited about this


---------09:08----------
conversation because i think it's


---------09:09----------
something that


---------09:09----------
for i don't know why i guess we just


---------09:11----------
haven't had someone talk about this but


---------09:13----------
like


---------09:13----------
i think engagement pressure absolutely


---------09:16----------
yeah absolutely right it's nuts like


---------09:18----------
it's nuts


---------09:20----------
um you know and maybe i'll kind of teach


---------09:22----------
a little bit towards the end but there's


---------09:23----------
actually an


---------09:24----------
interesting psychologist this guy named


---------09:26----------
eric erickson


---------09:27----------
who basically said that all of our


---------09:31----------
psychiatric problems like depression and


---------09:33----------
anxiety and stuff


---------09:34----------
come from sort of we have this


---------09:36----------
trajectory in life where like at each


---------09:38----------
stage of life we have


---------09:39----------
a different goal from like a


---------09:41----------
developmental standpoint


---------09:43----------
and when we don't succeed at that stage


---------09:46----------
of life we kind of get stuck there


---------09:48----------
so like teenagers are all about


---------09:50----------
individuating


---------09:51----------
and like developing my own identity so


---------09:54----------
we see people like coloring their hair


---------09:56----------
and getting piercings and going goth and


---------09:58----------
like whatnot like they're trying to


---------09:59----------
figure out who they are


---------10:00----------
and if they don't do that stuff properly


---------10:03----------
like if they don't do it successfully


---------10:05----------
then they kind of get stuck


---------10:06----------
and then you'll sometimes have like you


---------10:08----------
know older people who are still trying


---------10:10----------
to figure out who they are


---------10:11----------
no harm to them it's just you know so we


---------10:13----------
kind of get stuck


---------10:15----------
and so then like you know as we get into


---------10:16----------
like our 50s and stuff you start to look


---------10:18----------
back on your life and you start to think


---------10:20----------
like


---------10:20----------
did i do enough what did i like do


---------10:23----------
enough in the world and like make my


---------10:24----------
contribution because like


---------10:26----------
now you're kind of past the halfway


---------10:27----------
point you know things are starting to


---------10:29----------
wind down you got that hip pain


---------10:31----------
and you're balding and you're a little


---------10:33----------
bit overweight and like


---------10:34----------
you're like you know did i spend my


---------10:36----------
youth in a productive way


---------10:38----------
and and so it's kind of interesting


---------10:40----------
because you know i really like to think


---------10:42----------
about things the way that eric erickson


---------10:43----------
does and he sort of says like you know


---------10:45----------
at this age


---------10:46----------
group this is the problem at this age


---------10:47----------
group this is the problem and then


---------10:48----------
depending on how you kind of mess up


---------10:50----------
there


---------10:51----------
you can end up with different issues


---------10:53----------
like


---------10:54----------
later on so i i really


---------10:57----------
actually love this topic it's something


---------10:59----------
that we haven't really explored if


---------11:00----------
you've watched a lot of our videos maybe


---------11:01----------
you'll know that


---------11:02----------
um so i i think it's really fantastic i


---------11:04----------
appreciate so much about your


---------11:06----------
thoughtfulness about what to talk about


---------11:08----------
so tell me what kind of pressure do you


---------11:11----------
feel


---------11:13----------
okay well so should i talk about just


---------11:15----------
age pressure in general or like


---------11:17----------
because a job pressure marriage like i


---------11:19----------
feel like they all go together but


---------11:21----------
they are all their own thing so yeah so


---------11:24----------
i mean the one that i feel is the


---------11:25----------
juiciest is the engagement pressure yeah


---------11:28----------
that's the one that i'm personally the


---------11:29----------
most curious about


---------11:31----------
um but you know we can talk about


---------11:34----------
i'm just curious about you know what


---------11:35----------
pressure do you feel like what


---------11:37----------
leaps to your mind when i say that okay


---------11:40----------
so


---------11:40----------
i think i i can start with age and then


---------11:43----------
like engagement


---------11:44----------
stems very quickly from that so like i'm


---------11:46----------
28


---------11:47----------
um and i guess you know


---------11:51----------
our my whole life i'm was told like


---------11:54----------
you have to get married by this age uh


---------11:57----------
for me


---------11:57----------
i thought i was gonna marry get 25


---------11:59----------
really uh and have kids by


---------12:01----------
actually thought i'd be married but 23


---------12:02----------
have kids by 26 i don't know my


---------12:04----------
my mind was always like in my 20s i'm


---------12:06----------
going to have a family 30s i'm going to


---------12:08----------
be like


---------12:09----------
super established job kids husband all


---------12:12----------
this right but my fiance is literally


---------12:13----------
33. so


---------12:14----------
it's like that's not that like it's so


---------12:17----------
anyways


---------12:17----------
um i guess i was oh sorry this is just


---------12:21----------
me talking with my hands


---------12:23----------
oh this is our age different this is our


---------12:24----------
age gap


---------12:26----------
okay but so okay okay okay keep going


---------12:29----------
so he's 33 i'm 28. um uh


---------12:33----------
i guess my whole life i always thought


---------12:35----------
right i would get


---------12:36----------
married 20 early 20s


---------12:39----------
kids right and then now i'm 28 so i


---------12:42----------
didn't fulfill any of that


---------12:44----------
and i feel this pressure i guess


---------12:47----------
not even it's not even my parents if


---------12:49----------
anything i've talked to my parents about


---------12:51----------
this and they're very understanding that


---------12:53----------
like i think my mom growing up has


---------12:56----------
always been like you


---------12:56----------
you should have you should get married


---------12:58----------
and have kids and all this but recently


---------13:00----------
i've told her a bit about the pressure


---------13:01----------
and just


---------13:02----------
a bit about how streaming has like come


---------13:04----------
in from like


---------13:05----------
left field and kind of taken like the


---------13:07----------
forefront of my life


---------13:09----------
and i can't just have kids right now


---------13:12----------
like it just feels weird to have a kid


---------13:13----------
all of a sudden or sorry get married


---------13:15----------
first of all


---------13:16----------
and then have kids um sorry my thoughts


---------13:19----------
are a bit


---------13:19----------
sporadic so yeah you will have to i'm


---------13:22----------
sorry i


---------13:22----------
just try to follow where they're going


---------13:24----------
so um


---------13:25----------
i guess i i can start with i got engaged


---------13:29----------
oh sorry i got


---------13:30----------
me and my boyfriend sorry this is weird


---------13:32----------
me and my


---------13:33----------
fiance started dating in 2016 when i was


---------13:36----------
23


---------13:37----------
and i was already like when i met him i


---------13:40----------
have a journal entry of me saying like


---------13:42----------
you know i met this guy and like i'm 23


---------13:44----------
so


---------13:45----------
dating isn't just like we're not just


---------13:46----------
like casual like this could turn into


---------13:48----------
something


---------13:49----------
like if i was 17 and i'm at the same guy


---------13:51----------
i'd be like i'm in a boy and like we're


---------13:53----------
you know boyfriend girlfriend who you


---------13:54----------
know wherever this goes right but


---------13:56----------
i'm 23 so in my mind it's like this


---------14:01----------
could turn into like my husband like i'm


---------14:03----------
not just dating for fun i'm dating


---------14:05----------
to like i'm dating at 23. so


---------14:08----------
so anyways that was my first i literally


---------14:10----------

---------15:21----------
still have it but we're like


---------15:22----------
we told our wedding planner to cancel it


---------15:24----------
because we are


---------15:25----------
basically i just feel very a lot of


---------15:27----------
pressure because i don't know


---------15:29----------
uh if i'm getting married like because


---------15:32----------
of the viewers


---------15:33----------
because of my parents because i want to


---------15:36----------
um all this stuff my sometimes i have


---------15:39----------
this urge to run to the courthouse


---------15:41----------
with edison and get married on the same


---------15:43----------
day and then some days i want to plan


---------15:45----------
this like big elaborate wedding


---------15:47----------
and i don't know does this make sense


---------15:52----------
the only thing that doesn't make sense


---------15:53----------
is the chipotle bag


---------15:56----------
that's the only thing that i'm


---------15:57----------
everything else is crystal clear


---------15:59----------
okay okay the chipotle bag is just he


---------16:02----------
was trying to


---------16:02----------
like like uh hide the ring and he's like


---------16:05----------
i got you a surprise and i was like


---------16:07----------
chipotle


---------16:08----------
but it was a wedding ring got it i was


---------16:10----------
like is that some weird product


---------16:12----------
placement or like what


---------16:13----------
what exactly like not yet chipotle


---------16:16----------
where weddings happen


---------16:20----------
you know it's like they're they're


---------16:21----------
fighting with de beers like a diamond is


---------16:23----------
forever but a


---------16:24----------
burrito is for today they have to they


---------16:27----------
will cut cater my wedding


---------16:28----------
that's a great idea not you've given me


---------16:30----------
yeah so


---------16:32----------
sorry yeah uh foosley i'm i'm yeah so


---------16:35----------
let me let me tell you what i'm hearing


---------16:37----------
and then you tell me if you're making


---------16:38----------
sense okay yes


---------16:40----------
so so like i'm hearing that you kind of


---------16:42----------
had this script


---------16:44----------
in your mind about how life is supposed


---------16:46----------
to go


---------16:47----------
and yeah oddly enough you're sort of


---------16:49----------
following the script


---------16:51----------
but what i'm hearing is that you're


---------16:52----------
actually like genuinely like i don't


---------16:55----------
you know it sounds to me like you're


---------16:56----------
genuinely in love with edison is his


---------16:58----------
name


---------16:59----------
yeah okay um so you're


---------17:02----------
in love with like you met him at 23


---------17:04----------
which is when you're supposed to meet


---------17:05----------
your husband and it turns out that you


---------17:06----------
kind of probably met your husband there


---------17:08----------
yeah and but i'm also hearing that


---------17:10----------
there's a lot of like genuineness


---------17:12----------
so you were supposed to follow the


---------17:13----------
script but it turns out that there's


---------17:15----------
actually like a lot of genuineness


---------17:17----------
to this relationship and that you


---------17:19----------
actually do want to get married and now


---------17:21----------
sort of feels like the right time


---------17:23----------
so so you may have kind of followed the


---------17:25----------
script or were aware of the script but


---------17:26----------
that you're actually sort of living your


---------17:28----------
own life


---------17:29----------
and and now you're it's kind of like


---------17:31----------
where you know what is my life


---------17:33----------
and what is like the script and should


---------17:36----------
my life be based on the script like


---------17:38----------
is it actually better you know because


---------17:40----------
the script is based on something right


---------17:42----------
yeah and and you know so i'm i'm hearing


---------17:45----------
you kind of trying to figure out like


---------17:48----------
you know what should you do yes


---------17:51----------
yes yes that's it's very spot on


---------17:54----------
yeah so what what do i do


---------17:59----------
well i i mean you know i gotta say i i


---------18:02----------
think you gotta marry edison


---------18:04----------
no yeah yeah that's the steps but how


---------18:07----------
but


---------18:07----------
because i i don't know um i don't know


---------18:09----------
many people who propose with the


---------18:10----------
chipotle bag


---------18:11----------
i know yeah


---------18:14----------
but so so let me ask you um


---------18:18----------
can i think for a second yes yes yes


---------18:27----------
so let me just kind of map out a couple


---------18:28----------
of other things you said you said like


---------18:30----------
job pressure


---------18:32----------
parental pressure but i'm sort of


---------18:33----------
hearing that the parents actually aren't


---------18:35----------
pressuring you much


---------18:37----------
yeah so really quick it's like my


---------18:40----------
parents


---------18:41----------
are great like my i always


---------18:44----------
uh like i was a good student my whole


---------18:46----------
life


---------18:47----------
and it was never because my parents were


---------18:49----------
like you don't get an a


---------18:50----------
bad you know spank like it was me doing


---------18:53----------
that to myself


---------18:54----------
so my mom if anything like i guess they


---------18:56----------
wanted me to do well and they're very


---------18:57----------
like they've been proud of me


---------18:59----------
but my mom and dad have never like been


---------19:01----------
mad at me for not doing well


---------19:03----------
if anything maybe a little when i was


---------19:05----------
younger um i went to a private school


---------19:08----------
initially and then i couldn't handle the


---------19:09----------
pressure but i got really bad grades


---------19:11----------
there


---------19:12----------
and then when i moved to public school i


---------19:14----------
think


---------19:15----------
everything ingrained in me from private


---------19:17----------
school like i was like


---------19:19----------
i became very like on top of everything


---------19:22----------
very like musket a's musket


---------19:23----------
bees pluses like it must do well um


---------19:27----------
or else you know i'm gonna be mad at


---------19:29----------
myself so my mom if anything said leslie


---------19:31----------
don't be so hard on yourself like you


---------19:32----------
did well like you did well on this


---------19:34----------
test i'm like i didn't set the curve on


---------19:36----------
this exam though like i


---------19:38----------
i only got an a like i wanted to be like


---------19:40----------
top three


---------19:41----------
four in my in my college class like i


---------19:44----------
i would be upset over that and then my


---------19:46----------
mom's just like


---------19:47----------
like or my parents in general just be


---------19:50----------
like you don't need to


---------19:51----------
you're doing fine like if anything like


---------19:52----------
you work too hard so that's been my


---------19:54----------
even in college i was like that so in in


---------19:57----------
um


---------19:58----------
in in streaming i'm also my mom is just


---------20:01----------
constantly reminding me to


---------20:03----------
breathe to stop stressing to stop


---------20:05----------
working so hard


---------20:07----------
she's like leslie like slow down like


---------20:09----------
you don't need to do


---------20:10----------
if anything she thinks streaming's bad


---------20:11----------
for my health because she's like you


---------20:13----------
need to just step back and like it's


---------20:15----------
it's too much happening in your life too


---------20:17----------
quickly like you're you're running life


---------20:18----------
on like stop like fast forward like


---------20:20----------
you're too many events or you're


---------20:22----------
traveling like when when i could travel


---------20:24----------
you were


---------20:24----------
i was traveling like five six maybe more


---------20:26----------
six seven times a year


---------20:28----------
events and like you know very high like


---------20:30----------
very stimulating events


---------20:32----------
meeting a lot of people and you know


---------20:35----------
when i


---------20:35----------
yeah i guess it just felt like i would


---------20:37----------
do what


---------20:38----------
um most people would do like event wise


---------20:41----------
like


---------20:42----------
in ten years in like two years you know


---------20:44----------
just like why do you feel like you have


---------20:46----------
to run


---------20:47----------
life on fast forward i don't well


---------20:50----------
um i don't feel like i have to but i


---------20:52----------
feel like that's just the pace of


---------20:54----------
streaming and like this


---------20:55----------
whole industry it's like conventions and


---------20:58----------
and then


---------20:59----------
okay it feels like i work like a ton


---------21:02----------
i gotta stream a bunch and then to take


---------21:05----------
you have to like take an extreme break


---------21:07----------
to make up for the extreme work like um


---------21:10----------
this is like before when i could


---------21:12----------
so so pre-covered it'd be like i'd


---------21:14----------
stream like an intense amount and then


---------21:16----------
i would go to like korea for like


---------21:20----------
a week and then like instead of i feel


---------21:22----------
like taking weekends because i didn't


---------21:23----------
have weekends the way i'd look at it is


---------21:25----------
like


---------21:25----------
stream and then like vacation and then


---------21:28----------
stream


---------21:29----------
vacation instead of like work weekend


---------21:31----------
work week and work week you know


---------21:32----------
i'd do it like like weekends would be my


---------21:35----------
vacations and i would treat them less


---------21:37----------
frequently


---------21:39----------
yeah yeah what what made you


---------21:43----------
do it that way this industry is like


---------21:47----------
very like


---------21:48----------
you know like you i guess it'd be very


---------21:50----------
like


---------21:52----------
there'd be conventions right i wouldn't


---------21:53----------
want to miss conventions because that's


---------21:55----------
when i get to meet up with like people


---------21:56----------
like uh you know i have friends from


---------21:58----------
different parts of the world and i never


---------22:00----------
would get to meet them and then they're


---------22:01----------
like hey are you going to pax east or


---------22:03----------
are you going to twitchcon are you going


---------22:05----------
to


---------22:06----------
this event and that'd be my time to like


---------22:08----------
meet up with people


---------22:10----------
so i felt like kind of like i have to go


---------22:13----------
i have to travel to go meet my friends


---------22:16----------
that from you know different places and


---------22:18----------
and to just make memories with my


---------22:19----------
current friends because we're all just


---------22:20----------
in our room playing games all day or


---------22:22----------
streaming all day so i felt like that


---------22:25----------
this is the time so it's not that i want


---------22:27----------
to live life on fast forward


---------22:29----------
it's that that's just kind of like it's


---------22:30----------
very easy to to


---------22:32----------
just just start doing that um very


---------22:34----------
exciting a lot of things are happening


---------22:36----------
and it was great it's just sometimes i


---------22:39----------
do feel like i need to slow down


---------22:40----------
um sure so so i think in order to if you


---------22:44----------
think you need to slow down in order to


---------22:45----------
slow down you have to figure out first


---------22:47----------
why you're running it fast forward


---------22:50----------
right and what i'm hearing you say so


---------22:52----------
i'm just going to point out some stuff


---------22:54----------
in your language so when i ask you you


---------22:57----------
know why do you feel like you have to


---------22:58----------
run life on fast forward and then you


---------23:00----------
say i don't feel like i have to run


---------23:02----------
on my life on password it's the industry


---------23:05----------
sure right and then as we dig into that


---------23:07----------
we begin to see that like


---------23:09----------
you start to act because you make it


---------23:11----------
sound like an external force


---------23:13----------
pressure so pressure is an external


---------23:16----------
force coming from the outside


---------23:17----------
age pressure like every year you look at


---------23:19----------
your driver's license and you look at


---------23:21----------
the calendar and it's like there's this


---------23:22----------
external pressure like the calendar is


---------23:24----------
like


---------23:25----------
have children right like it's like a


---------23:27----------
pressure


---------23:28----------
and then like there's job pressure


---------23:29----------
there's industry pressure but but this


---------23:31----------
is what i think a really key thing is


---------23:32----------
that as we tunnel down into it


---------23:35----------
there isn't actually industry pressure


---------23:39----------
i know it sounds weird but when you get


---------23:42----------
a phone call


---------23:44----------
something happens in your mind and then


---------23:47----------
you


---------23:47----------
feel the pressure like your friends are


---------23:50----------
just asking you if you're going to be at


---------23:51----------
an event


---------23:52----------
and you could say no


---------23:55----------
but you won't let yourself say no


---------23:59----------
right and yeah that's it like it's not


---------24:01----------
like they're like


---------24:03----------
foosley you have to come otherwise i


---------24:05----------
will never speak to you again like


---------24:06----------
that's


---------24:06----------
no they say it oh they do oh god joking


---------24:10----------
jokingly


---------24:12----------
yeah no it's more like but i'll never


---------24:13----------
see you i'll never have the opportunity


---------24:15----------
to see you like


---------24:16----------
yeah yeah okay okay okay okay so that's


---------24:20----------
actually a very important detail right


---------24:21----------
because


---------24:22----------
it you know it it sounds like actually


---------24:24----------
that is external pressure


---------24:27----------
i mean it's like joking and then i know


---------24:29----------
they're not actually going to be mad at


---------24:31----------
me


---------24:31----------
it's more of like this is our one


---------24:32----------
opportunity to meet like in this you


---------24:34----------
know in the past it's been like


---------24:36----------
uh that's true you know we've been


---------24:38----------
friends online for six months a year


---------24:40----------
it'd be really cool to meet this person


---------24:43----------
you know


---------24:43----------
i guess it's the pressure of like you


---------24:45----------
don't want to miss out on


---------24:47----------
meeting people and you know in my mind


---------24:49----------
it's like life is about


---------24:51----------
making these personal connections and


---------24:52----------
then like i never regret having a really


---------24:54----------
nice talk with somebody


---------24:56----------
like you know in general and so it feels


---------24:59----------
really like


---------25:00----------
yeah it'd be worth it to fly to berlin


---------25:01----------
to like talk to this person that i've


---------25:03----------
known


---------25:04----------
and we can just have a good talk off


---------25:05----------
stream and and and i'll feel very like


---------25:08----------
fulfilled and happy by that


---------25:09----------
but then now i'm hearing now i'm hearing


---------25:13----------
a couple of other themes one is missing


---------25:15----------
out


---------25:16----------
right that you have this opportunity and


---------25:17----------
you should take care of you should take


---------25:19----------
advantage of this opportunity


---------25:20----------
while it's there and that also that like


---------25:24----------
the sacrifice is


---------25:25----------
worth it i'm hearing that living life on


---------25:28----------
fast forward is worth it


---------25:29----------
because you get to live more life in a


---------25:32----------
shorter amount of time


---------25:34----------
yeah yeah is that how it feels


---------25:39----------
yeah some some not because like it feels


---------25:41----------
like i'm only comes back to age pressure


---------25:43----------
i'm only in my 20s


---------25:44----------
once i'm at like it feels like my


---------25:48----------
i mean i'm past my physical prime


---------25:50----------
definitely been struggling but


---------25:52----------
i'm kind of you know this is what is


---------25:54----------
that hold on what i'm having some


---------25:56----------
shoulde you know some arm pain some some


---------25:59----------
pain you know that i wouldn't have when


---------26:01----------
i was 17.


---------26:02----------
so i'm a little bit like you know


---------26:04----------
getting you're saying 28 is past your


---------26:06----------
physical


---------26:08----------
i feel like i would you know like you


---------26:11----------
would like


---------26:11----------
i get up in the morning and go and i'm


---------26:14----------
like oh


---------26:16----------
that's how it feels now but when i was


---------26:17----------
17 i would just go whoa


---------26:19----------
and then jump out of bed and like


---------26:20----------
[Laughter]


---------26:23----------
so now i feel um a bit


---------26:26----------
i mean definitely a little bit more


---------26:28----------
right so anyways my brain's like


---------26:30----------
leslie you're in your 20s you're going


---------26:31----------
to be in your 30s soon you're about to


---------26:33----------
hit the big 3-0


---------26:34----------
and in my mind 30 is like have your life


---------26:38----------
together married kids you know so my


---------26:40----------
brain is


---------26:40----------
like there's not much time even though


---------26:42----------
i've seen other people on the other side


---------26:44----------
of 30 and they're not doing that and


---------26:46----------
they're fine and i don't look at them


---------26:47----------
any less for not doing like


---------26:48----------
it's all on like it's me putting my own


---------26:51----------
like


---------26:52----------
views of like my past self like being


---------26:54----------
like when you're 30 you're going to do


---------26:56----------
all these things and have this and so


---------26:58----------
where does that come from


---------27:01----------
i don't know just you know i guess


---------27:02----------
growing up you just hear it


---------27:04----------
it's like you know you you have to like


---------27:06----------
that just


---------27:07----------
i guess can you tell me about private


---------27:10----------
school


---------27:12----------
sure okay so i went to private school


---------27:15----------
until sixth grade sixth grade


---------27:19----------
and let me think uh i think i had new


---------27:23----------
uniforms i it was a primarily


---------27:26----------
there it was mostly asians at my school


---------27:30----------
it was um a lot of competition


---------27:34----------
i felt like there's very every everyone


---------27:37----------
was very


---------27:38----------
uh like very strict i got yelled at a


---------27:40----------
lot i was the


---------27:42----------
out the kid out of line all the time


---------27:45----------
um and um


---------27:49----------
i rebelled a lot in private school i


---------27:51----------
hung out with the


---------27:52----------
kids that were not as smart like i was


---------27:54----------
not i was one of the kids getting c's


---------27:56----------
all the time


---------27:57----------
in private school i hung out with like a


---------27:58----------
group of three girls who we're all kind


---------28:00----------
of trouble


---------28:02----------
back then we like gossip a lot


---------28:05----------
talk about boys a lot right on our


---------28:07----------
zangas


---------28:08----------
you know just a lot it was just i would


---------28:10----------
rebel against


---------28:11----------
the teachers i always thought the


---------28:13----------
teachers had something against me


---------28:14----------
um i i did like a few of my teachers but


---------28:17----------
a few of them i was like


---------28:18----------
i would put the toilet paper in soap and


---------28:20----------
i'd throw it at the ceilings and then


---------28:22----------
they'd stick to the ceilings i got in


---------28:23----------
trouble a lot for that


---------28:25----------
um what's your understanding of why you


---------28:27----------
did that


---------28:32----------
um i didn't like the teachers


---------28:36----------
so one of them i sort of knew i would


---------28:38----------
get in trouble but i did it anyway


---------28:40----------
oh i did bad stuff i stuck stepped on


---------28:42----------
some bees and i would like put the bees


---------28:44----------
in bags and then put those


---------28:46----------
in lockers of girls i didn't like i was


---------28:48----------
a really bad kid back in the day i don't


---------28:49----------
know where it stemmed from but i think


---------28:51----------
it came from


---------28:53----------
um i was


---------28:56----------
upset at like girl other girls for being


---------28:59----------
mean


---------29:00----------
i was mean to other girls uh i was


---------29:03----------
i don't know i was just rebelling a lot


---------29:05----------
and


---------29:06----------
it was just like i guess i hung around


---------29:08----------
also like some kids who like


---------29:10----------
encouraged that and so i you know i fed


---------29:12----------
into it as well like we both we


---------29:14----------
it was like you you know you find


---------29:15----------
someone you kind of both just like yeah


---------29:17----------
let's do this and


---------29:18----------
you do and then you just enable each


---------29:20----------
other sure


---------29:21----------
what did your parents think about you


---------29:23----------
know getting in trouble and the seas and


---------29:25----------
whatnot


---------29:27----------
they pulled me out of private school i


---------29:28----------
would complain i think that was it


---------29:30----------
i wanted to be out of private school so


---------29:32----------
badly there was this thing called


---------29:33----------
recitation on fridays we'd have to go in


---------29:35----------
front of the class every friday and


---------29:36----------
recite this


---------29:37----------
poem and every week it was it gave me so


---------29:40----------
much anxiety every week


---------29:41----------
i just wanted and i said public school


---------29:42----------
mom they don't have recitation


---------29:44----------
they don't have to do this and i'd


---------29:45----------
always complain about private school


---------29:47----------
private so i don't want to be here


---------29:49----------
until i think i i guess i just made so


---------29:51----------
much trouble


---------29:52----------
that my mom's like yeah let's you don't


---------29:55----------
need to go to private school


---------29:56----------
i think maybe that was a bit of it is i


---------29:58----------
really just didn't like it


---------30:00----------
i i think i just didn't like it


---------30:03----------
what didn't you like about recitation


---------30:05----------
what would it feel like the night before


---------30:07----------
what were thursday nights like for you


---------30:11----------
dress it was like every thursday night


---------30:13----------
was like this


---------30:14----------
this past night the sleeping thing i i'm


---------30:17----------
terrified i just like would be like


---------30:19----------
tomorrow i'm gonna get up in front of


---------30:20----------
the class i'm gonna pull the stick out


---------30:22----------
see that i have to go sixth or whatever


---------30:24----------
and then my heart's gonna be racing for


---------30:25----------
the entire person in front of me and


---------30:27----------
then i'm gonna go up and i'm gonna


---------30:29----------
mess up all my lines and i'm just gonna


---------30:31----------
like be


---------30:32----------
staring out of the class and everyone's


---------30:34----------
gonna be judging me waiting for me to


---------30:35----------
mess up


---------30:36----------
and then i'm going to mess up and i'm


---------30:37----------
going to stand there embarrass myself oh


---------30:39----------
and i have to do it and then i finish it


---------30:40----------
get it over with


---------30:41----------
get like my b or whatever and then go


---------30:43----------
through it and then like


---------30:45----------
it's like a cool down and then i have to


---------30:46----------
do it all over again every friday


---------30:49----------
and it was just the worst i remember


---------30:51----------
just i hated that


---------30:52----------
and so did you ever think about did you


---------30:55----------
ever fantasize about


---------30:56----------
what you could do that would prevent


---------31:00----------
that horrible future


---------31:05----------
like as in like people prepared or


---------31:09----------
yeah so it's kind of like a leading


---------31:10----------
question i'm really sniffing for


---------31:12----------
something and i


---------31:12----------
i think i'm actually not gonna find


---------31:14----------
anything but seems good on paper


---------31:16----------
um so like i'm just kind of envisioning


---------31:19----------
you know


---------31:19----------
what must have been in your head about


---------31:22----------
if you were a different person


---------31:24----------
or if you did things differently because


---------31:26----------
like usually when


---------31:28----------
like did you have those kinds of


---------31:30----------
thoughts like if i was


---------31:32----------
yeah i mean yeah the way i thought about


---------31:35----------
it is like i wish i would


---------31:36----------
i i could be more like this student or


---------31:38----------
this year like there was a


---------31:39----------
kid named ayush in my class who was just


---------31:41----------
the best at it


---------31:43----------
i remember he'd get up there and he'd


---------31:44----------
like commit


---------31:46----------
yeah i know and it was just like he just


---------31:48----------
killed it every week and he


---------31:50----------
i was just like how he closed his eyes


---------31:53----------
he used his hands


---------31:54----------
and he would just give it his all every


---------31:56----------
week and he would


---------31:57----------
everyone would be like wow and i was


---------32:00----------
just like


---------32:00----------
i can't do that why can't i be like him


---------32:03----------
and that was the one thing maybe i would


---------32:05----------
think i'd fantasize a world where i


---------32:06----------
could probably be


---------32:07----------
better at speaking or more charismatic


---------32:09----------
like he could be yeah but instead i just


---------32:11----------
get up there and go


---------32:13----------
like like and i just stuttered my way


---------32:16----------
all the way through it and


---------32:17----------
i would and i had a horrible fear of


---------32:19----------
public speaking all the way i always


---------32:21----------
talk about it like all the way up


---------32:22----------
to even until streaming i i can't i


---------32:26----------
public speaking is just the worst and um


---------32:29----------
and so that that i guess that was it


---------32:32----------
what did you think was different about


---------32:34----------
ayush versus you


---------32:36----------
he didn't care what other people thought


---------32:38----------
he was just like


---------32:39----------
or maybe he did but he he didn't show it


---------32:42----------
he


---------32:42----------
wasn't afraid to be dramatic and like


---------32:46----------
it felt like he was that was his happy


---------32:47----------
place like he was like i'm here to


---------32:49----------
perform this is my moment


---------32:51----------
versus me i'm like dreading this moment


---------32:52----------
like oh god everyone's gonna think i'm


---------32:54----------
weird and if i try to commit like him


---------32:55----------
they're gonna be like


---------32:56----------
like why is she doing that even why is


---------32:58----------
she trying so hard you know


---------32:59----------
so if anything i just wanted to


---------33:01----------
disappear i just wanted to say it get it


---------33:03----------
over with and


---------33:04----------
everyone forget about it be the complete


---------33:06----------
just be completely average up there and


---------33:08----------
be


---------33:08----------
not memorable in any way um and yeah he


---------33:11----------
i knew he just went up there and he he


---------33:14----------
like


---------33:14----------
yeah he felt it felt like if anything he


---------33:16----------
was excited to go up


---------33:17----------
every week


---------33:21----------
do you think yeah do you think ayush was


---------33:25----------
living his life on fast forward


---------33:30----------
probably not if i had to guess yeah is


---------33:33----------
that


---------33:33----------
is that how you saw it i didn't think


---------33:37----------
about fast forward


---------33:38----------
back then because life felt so so so in


---------33:41----------
the moment


---------33:41----------
and slower back then like i was just


---------33:45----------
living every moment back then as like


---------33:47----------
this is forever


---------33:48----------
because when you're a kid like that's


---------33:50----------
that that's how it feels


---------33:52----------
yep yeah yeah so i'm gonna need


---------33:55----------
so maybe i'm barking up the wrong tree


---------33:57----------
here foosley so this is gonna be really


---------33:59----------
for you to decide but like here's what


---------34:00----------
i'm noticing so what you are is kind of


---------34:03----------
ultra conformist


---------34:04----------
in your head yeah right like


---------34:07----------
there is a there is a path to success


---------34:10----------
and we have to follow it


---------34:12----------
and then like you get really bent out of


---------34:14----------
shape


---------34:15----------
if you are like not ultra conforming


---------34:18----------
like


---------34:18----------
23 26 marriage gotta do this and there's


---------34:21----------
a very like there's a very like


---------34:23----------
reasonable part of you that's sort of


---------34:24----------
like i can't really get married because


---------34:26----------
of covid


---------34:27----------
i'm not really ready to have kids i'm in


---------34:29----------
a happy relationship i enjoy my career


---------34:31----------
my life is pretty good i'm actually


---------34:33----------
happy on a daily basis but


---------34:34----------
inside is like a nun who's like


---------34:38----------
foosley this is the way of doing things


---------34:41----------
and


---------34:41----------
and so then the really interesting thing


---------34:43----------
is to hear you talk about private school


---------34:45----------
it's like


---------34:46----------
actually the voice in your head seems to


---------34:48----------
be the very opposite of what you have


---------34:50----------
now


---------34:51----------
like you used to be a rebel you used to


---------34:53----------
be like no f in rules like


---------34:55----------
f you guys like toilet paper on the


---------34:57----------
ceiling like bees in the lockers


---------34:59----------
like you know screw age like


---------35:02----------
you know like yeah it's interesting


---------35:05----------
because i


---------35:06----------
and and so i'm just wondering when i see


---------35:08----------
such a drastic shift in someone's like


---------35:10----------
internal dialogue i sometimes wonder if


---------35:14----------
those are like


---------35:15----------
connected um and i wonder if sort of


---------35:18----------
like you sort


---------35:19----------
you know your road out of private school


---------35:22----------
was that


---------35:23----------
you became exactly what you wanted to be


---------35:26----------
and now you're the person like you used


---------35:29----------
to be one thing in private school


---------35:31----------
and then you realize like this is not


---------35:33----------
working


---------35:34----------
i have to turn myself into something


---------35:36----------
that is not the rebel


---------35:38----------
and then like you became this ultra


---------35:40----------
conformist and now like what i'm hearing


---------35:41----------
is that you know your parents didn't


---------35:43----------
make you the ultra conformist


---------35:44----------
it's like age who made you the ultra


---------35:46----------
conformist because ayush was like


---------35:48----------
i'm gonna i'm gonna show you how it's


---------35:50----------
done and you have to like take every


---------35:52----------
opportunity and


---------35:52----------
every friday is like a chance for life


---------35:55----------
in joy


---------35:56----------
and passion and then you get this phone


---------35:58----------
call from your twitch friends and


---------36:00----------
they're like do you want to do this and


---------36:01----------
you're like


---------36:02----------
what would a you should do is what you


---------36:03----------
some part of your mind is telling you


---------36:04----------
you're like


---------36:05----------
ash would not skip it aish doesn't


---------36:08----------
[ __ ] take weekends


---------36:15----------
i can't believe we're talking this is so


---------36:18----------
funny um


---------36:19----------
yeah i mean i uh


---------36:22----------
but i could be barking up the wrong tree


---------36:24----------
there you know sometimes i work myself


---------36:26----------
up


---------36:27----------
yeah no no i i feel that like i


---------36:30----------
i don't in my mind i wasn't asking about


---------36:31----------
ayush i don't think i


---------36:33----------
really thought back to that until like


---------36:35----------
but yeah people like him


---------36:37----------
i was i was jealous because they they


---------36:40----------
felt i'm jealous of people who are able


---------36:42----------
to like


---------36:42----------
pause you know and live life in the


---------36:45----------
moment


---------36:46----------
and i feel like i'm always like leslie


---------36:49----------
take this opportunity take this


---------36:50----------
opportunity yes say yes say yes so that


---------36:52----------
later you can relax but why


---------36:54----------
later why not now why can't i just you


---------36:56----------
know


---------36:57----------
yeah yeah but so it's there's a very


---------36:59----------
interesting conundrum there because


---------37:00----------
you're not actually talking about living


---------37:02----------
in the moment


---------37:03----------
right because if you were really gonna


---------37:04----------
live in the moment you would pass on the


---------37:06----------
opportunity


---------37:08----------
yeah so like what you envy


---------37:11----------
it and so it's let me just sit


---------37:14----------
does that make sense uh i think so yeah


---------37:19----------
i feel like there is a more profound or


---------37:21----------
clear way that i can explain this


---------37:23----------
but because


---------37:26----------
it's interesting because you talk about


---------37:28----------
living in the present and living in the


---------37:29----------
moment


---------37:30----------
but then the other thing that i kind of


---------37:31----------
want to point out is that like


---------37:33----------
you were stuck in the present when you


---------37:35----------
were in private school


---------37:37----------
yes and you hated it yes


---------37:40----------
and now you you have this idea of what


---------37:43----------
it is to


---------37:44----------
live in the present but there's another


---------37:45----------
part of your mind that's like f that


---------37:47----------
we want to live we don't want to like


---------37:49----------
pause the video


---------37:51----------
we're gonna fast forward fast forward


---------37:55----------
fast forward the video


---------37:57----------
right yes well i don't want i don't


---------37:58----------
choose to fast forward


---------38:00----------
sure i can't control the speed at which


---------38:02----------
life is going like when i was


---------38:04----------
a kid all i wanted to do was be older i


---------38:06----------
was like i remember being 12 or like 11


---------38:08----------
i was i went to the store and i sat in


---------38:10----------
the this chair that's supposed to you


---------38:11----------
know it's like a massage chair


---------38:13----------
i sat in it and they're like i'm sorry


---------38:14----------
you can't like how old are you and i was


---------38:16----------
like 11 and they're like you can't sit


---------38:17----------
in that chair it's going to mess up your


---------38:19----------
bones or whatever and i was like


---------38:20----------
are you serious why are you like that


---------38:22----------
shoulder problem that's the chair


---------38:24----------
so it's they wouldn't like i was so mad


---------38:27----------
i was like oh i just want to be 18. like


---------38:29----------
that's all i want to be


---------38:30----------
18. and then like when i was 18 oh i


---------38:32----------
want to be 21 like i just want to be


---------38:34----------
able to drink


---------38:35----------
i want to be 21. 21 like then i'm like


---------38:38----------
wait slow down slow down


---------38:40----------
yeah what age do you want to be now


---------38:44----------
22. 22 or 23 forever


---------38:48----------
yeah 21 i feel like is a bit young so 23


---------38:51----------
because


---------38:53----------
now i'm like approaching the age well


---------38:55----------
actually 25 is good too


---------38:56----------
i like i feel like now i'm like i don't


---------39:00----------
want to be


---------39:00----------
30 because it's forward because then i'm


---------39:02----------
just gonna get old


---------39:03----------
and irrelevant and ugly


---------39:10----------
i feel like i'm just gonna it feels like


---------39:13----------
when i was 23 i thought that of 28


---------39:16----------
i'm gonna be honest i thought wow leslie


---------39:18----------
have five years left in your career when


---------39:20----------
you're 28


---------39:21----------
it's over it's done no one's gonna


---------39:23----------
relate to you


---------39:24----------
no one's gonna watch you you're 20


---------39:25----------
you're gonna be 28.


---------39:27----------
you're gonna be married and you're


---------39:28----------
probably gonna be having kids in the


---------39:29----------
next year so


---------39:31----------
that was 28 for me and so it is somewhat


---------39:33----------
relieving to be 28 now


---------39:36----------
and think that way about 32 but then i


---------39:39----------
know 32 is gonna happen


---------39:41----------
well i think that way about 38 when


---------39:44----------
around 38


---------39:45----------
lefty 42 142 would that be 48 you know


---------39:48----------
and so i guess um


---------39:52----------
yeah i guess i just i'm scared of


---------39:56----------
the future i i guess it feels like


---------39:58----------
time's running out especially when my


---------40:00----------
career is like you know it started when


---------40:02----------
i was 23 and it feels like you know i'm


---------40:04----------
in front of a camera i'm on twitch


---------40:06----------
it's a job that doesn't have like this


---------40:08----------
obvious next path


---------40:10----------
as well so it feels like i have to make


---------40:12----------
the most of


---------40:13----------
what i have now like this is my career


---------40:15----------
i'm probably just gonna try to do this


---------40:17----------
for 10 years and then like it's over


---------40:19----------
like something's gonna happen and people


---------40:20----------
are gonna be like oh she is old


---------40:22----------
okay i can't watch her anymore like i


---------40:24----------
just think that p i have this fear that


---------40:26----------
people are gonna just


---------40:27----------
click to just that i'm old and they


---------40:29----------
shouldn't watch me because


---------40:30----------
i don't they don't relate to me or that


---------40:32----------
it's just that i'm just


---------40:34----------
old now and it's like ew i'm gonna be


---------40:36----------
watching like my mom


---------40:37----------
you know so something like that so


---------40:40----------
foosley thanks a lot for sharing all


---------40:41----------
that i i think i'm hearing a very very


---------40:43----------
common thread here which is that


---------40:45----------
you're never happy with where you are


---------40:48----------
right it's like you either want to be


---------40:50----------
older or you want to be younger like


---------40:52----------
your mind is like retreating


---------40:53----------
it in whatever way it can except like


---------40:56----------
nowhere but the present


---------40:58----------
yeah like like present is unacceptable


---------41:00----------
sorry anywhere but the present


---------41:02----------
yes and and so it's like you know when


---------41:05----------
you were young you were thinking about


---------41:06----------
the future now that you're


---------41:08----------
old you're thinking about the past and


---------41:10----------
you're like 23 to 25


---------41:12----------
maybe there's a little bit of erickson


---------41:13----------
here where you you will feel ready to be


---------41:16----------
older than 23


---------41:17----------
once you get married because that's the


---------41:19----------
milestone that you associate with 23 so


---------41:21----------
maybe there's something there


---------41:23----------
but really what i'm hearing is that you


---------41:25----------
detest and by you i mean a part of you


---------41:28----------
because this is a weird confusing thing


---------41:29----------
about our mind as we think about our


---------41:31----------
mind as monolithic but it's not like one


---------41:33----------
way right but like what i'm hearing is


---------41:35----------
that you never wanted to be where you


---------41:37----------
are


---------41:39----------
like age-wise in general


---------41:43----------
but yeah age-wise sure yeah well i can't


---------41:46----------
say


---------41:46----------
i don't like i think i'm very i am very


---------41:49----------
happy with where i am


---------41:50----------
like like i'm very i mean there's parts


---------41:52----------
of me that are


---------41:53----------
yeah struggling but like overall i think


---------41:55----------
i am but yeah


---------41:56----------
so so so just to quickly explain kind of


---------41:59----------
how that works if you've heard me talk


---------42:00----------
to


---------42:01----------
talk about some scars you know it's like


---------42:03----------
that part of you that is unhappy with


---------42:05----------
where you are


---------42:06----------
is something you carry with you and


---------42:09----------
sometimes gets activated


---------42:11----------
like if i have a phobia of snakes


---------42:14----------
that phobia of snakes is something i


---------42:15----------
carry with me and i can be like happy


---------42:18----------
and then then i see a snake and then the


---------42:19----------
phobia arises


---------42:21----------
so you're like happy in the day to day


---------42:23----------
but you carry this thing with you that


---------42:25----------
like


---------42:25----------
sand in the hourglass is running out i'm


---------42:27----------
too old i'm not 23 i was supposed to get


---------42:29----------
married i was supposed to have kids


---------42:31----------
you know i'm not even gonna like touch


---------42:33----------
this we're


---------42:34----------
i don't know if you recognize this but


---------42:36----------
we're you know we're circling around


---------42:37----------
potentially like talking about being too


---------42:39----------
old to have kids


---------42:40----------
and that thing right so that i'm just


---------42:43----------
steering clear


---------42:44----------
of that one unless you want to talk


---------42:45----------
about it but


---------42:48----------
i mean in my mind it's just certain that


---------42:51----------
i will have kids


---------42:52----------
when i'm like 32. if i'm feel about that


---------42:57----------
i'm just preparing i'm like okay my my


---------43:00----------
basically my mind like maybe 33


---------43:04----------
or 34. but like i know that i want to


---------43:06----------
have kids


---------43:07----------
i know that i don't really have a choice


---------43:08----------
to have kids but after i'm 40


---------43:10----------
so i have to like i can choose to get


---------43:13----------
married like married is like


---------43:14----------
you know i have to you know it's not


---------43:16----------
like a biological thing but if i'm


---------43:18----------
having kids at 45 like you know i take a


---------43:20----------
risk


---------43:20----------
my kids so i i am like yeah i have to if


---------43:24----------
i want to have kids then i gotta do that


---------43:27----------
when i'm in my 30s so in my mind it's


---------43:30----------
since it's a set decision


---------43:31----------
almost i feel less anxiety about it and


---------43:34----------
kids are cute so i've started to get


---------43:37----------
more excited i see kids i'm like


---------43:39----------
and anderson's like oh i'm kind of


---------43:42----------
looking forward to it and i have a cat i


---------43:44----------
don't know where he is but


---------43:45----------
caring for him makes me feel like this


---------43:47----------
love so


---------43:49----------
i want that yeah yeah


---------43:52----------
so it actually sounds like you're pretty


---------43:54----------
good around the kids thing yeah i don't


---------43:56----------
feel too much anxiety about it because i


---------43:57----------
want to have kids yeah


---------43:59----------
yeah sometimes when people are very like


---------44:01----------
sensitive about their age


---------44:02----------
they also like there's a like for women


---------44:05----------
there's a lot of pressure to have kids


---------44:06----------
at a certain time and


---------44:08----------
and you know things like that but i'm


---------44:09----------
actually not hearing that from you right


---------44:10----------
so it sounds like you're


---------44:12----------
okay having kids at 32. i feel like


---------44:14----------
maybe because it's also kind of far


---------44:16----------
like it's like well it's like full


---------44:18----------
that's actually not that far


---------44:20----------
five because it could be from 32 to like


---------44:22----------
my mom had me when she was 38.


---------44:24----------
so because i feel like that's some ways


---------44:27----------
away


---------44:27----------
um i think if it was like uh


---------44:31----------
you know i was married and then we're


---------44:32----------
like me and edison are sitting down


---------44:34----------
all right you wanna have kids you know


---------44:35----------
that maybe might


---------44:37----------
start to freak me out a bit because


---------44:39----------
that's a huge like life


---------44:40----------
change but because it's still somewhat


---------44:42----------
distant


---------44:44----------
um i don't feel it entirely but as i'm


---------44:46----------
having this conversation you know i am


---------44:48----------
thinking a little bit yeah it does give


---------44:49----------
me a little bit of work it does worry me


---------44:51----------
a little bit


---------44:52----------
because i'm not sure how much that would


---------44:53----------
change my life and also edison we've had


---------44:55----------
the talk about it and he's like


---------44:58----------
if you want kids we have kids if you


---------44:59----------
want one kid we have one kid if you have


---------45:01----------
two you have two if you don't want


---------45:02----------
you what we don't have kids he says like


---------45:04----------
your body you know


---------45:06----------
like i don't have to go through it so


---------45:08----------
i'm not gonna make you have kids


---------45:09----------
so him saying that gives me like


---------45:13----------
makes me feel so free like there's this


---------45:14----------
option in where i don't have kids maybe


---------45:17----------
so i think that that also is like


---------45:22----------
yes yeah that that was instantly like a


---------45:25----------
so much relief like oh like i don't have


---------45:28----------
to have kids


---------45:29----------
so maybe there's a small part of me that


---------45:32----------
isn't sure i'm gonna have


---------45:33----------
no i'm pretty sure but like maybe a ten


---------45:35----------
five percent chance that like


---------45:36----------
if i randomly decide not to that i don't


---------45:39----------
have someone


---------45:39----------
pressuring me as well and my parents


---------45:41----------
also don't always


---------45:42----------
don't pressure me about it at all they


---------45:44----------
don't i think that obviously they want


---------45:46----------
to


---------45:46----------
but they don't say anything about it so


---------45:49----------
i don't have like this yapping voice


---------45:51----------
like kids kids kids kids kids grandkids


---------45:53----------
you know so it's


---------45:54----------
it feels kind of it sounds like you have


---------45:56----------
that voice in your head sometimes


---------45:58----------
it's my own voice yeah i was gonna say i


---------46:01----------
i think you're you know your parents


---------46:03----------
learned that that you're


---------46:05----------
you know you have your own yapping voice


---------46:08----------
they don't want to add another yapping


---------46:09----------
voice yeah


---------46:10----------
yeah and and so is there like a type of


---------46:13----------
pressure that we sort of haven't touched


---------46:15----------
on i mean do you feel like we've covered


---------46:16----------
age pressure or drop yeah i yeah i think


---------46:20----------
you really hit the nail on the head with


---------46:22----------
um


---------46:23----------
like i'm just never happy like


---------46:26----------
like uh like when i was a kid i wanted


---------46:29----------
to be older


---------46:30----------
when i'm older like i wanted to be


---------46:32----------
younger and when i was


---------46:33----------
the age i wanted to be time just went


---------46:36----------
like that


---------46:37----------
so it just feels like also on twitch


---------46:40----------
it's very like you know the boomer


---------46:41----------
zoomer


---------46:42----------
jokes like they're everywhere every even


---------46:44----------
so one of my friends brought up like


---------46:46----------
yesterday or two days ago why are we


---------46:47----------
always talking about age like


---------46:49----------
i feel like it comes up in every


---------46:51----------
conversation and i'm like it's because


---------46:53----------
like you say something like you're such


---------46:54----------
a boomer and then you're like i'm not a


---------46:56----------
boomer


---------46:56----------
i'm gonna justify why you're not old or


---------46:58----------
it's like i try to say something young


---------47:00----------
and hip but they're like


---------47:01----------
leslie stop it you're talking like the


---------47:02----------
you know gen z and like the zoomers and


---------47:04----------
it's all about like


---------47:05----------
age these days like how old you are what


---------47:07----------
jokes you can say or can't say


---------47:09----------
or like if you get something or don't oh


---------47:12----------
you're so boomer you're too much of a


---------47:13----------
zoomer to understand like it's very


---------47:16----------
the culture especially i think in gaming


---------47:17----------
and streaming it's very prevalent social


---------47:19----------
media


---------47:20----------
so my age comes up a lot in terms of


---------47:23----------
at least in my own head i don't even


---------47:25----------
always say like oh i'm 28 you know


---------47:27----------
i just i just hear it a lot and so it


---------47:29----------
makes me think a lot about how old i


---------47:31----------
am um and it does it's not like a big


---------47:35----------
issue


---------47:35----------
in my mind it's just like a voice like


---------47:37----------
you said or something i'm always like


---------47:39----------
thinking it's always in the back of my


---------47:40----------
head


---------47:41----------
that of things i should be doing or or


---------47:43----------
like am i too old to do this or


---------47:45----------
um so it's nothing like crazy


---------47:49----------
it's just like i think that that's just


---------47:51----------
a general thing i'm carrying with me


---------47:53----------
and it's of the yapping voice i mean i


---------47:56----------
want to just


---------47:57----------
learn how to like slow down


---------48:00----------
and like actually just you know not like


---------48:03----------
live


---------48:04----------
like when i was a kid yeah but you don't


---------48:06----------
want to live when you were like a kid in


---------48:08----------
fact i think the reason you're in this


---------48:09----------
trouble is because you're trying to get


---------48:11----------
away from the way you were living as a


---------48:12----------
kid


---------48:13----------
yeah so like live like the times


---------48:16----------
the top how slow it is outside it just


---------48:19----------
felt like


---------48:20----------
yeah how did it feel outside of school


---------48:23----------
it was good it was great like um


---------48:26----------
i would go to my cousin's house every


---------48:28----------
day after school and we'd rollerblade


---------48:30----------
around the streets have knee pads and


---------48:33----------
fall down


---------48:34----------
and um


---------48:36----------
[Music]


---------48:38----------
yeah it was it was good so


---------48:41----------
yeah do you so what part of you makes


---------48:44----------
you think you're living too fast


---------48:46----------
um living too fast uh


---------48:57----------
time birthdays are happening so quickly


---------49:01----------
every day is the same i'm like living in


---------49:03----------
a it feels like a


---------49:05----------
like a wake up do the same thing every


---------49:06----------
day and i know that when i do the same


---------49:08----------
thing every day


---------49:09----------
it just all blurs together like one big


---------49:12----------
year just went by like what did i do i


---------49:14----------
woke up


---------49:14----------
every day streamed played games went to


---------49:16----------
sleep some days i remember that one day


---------49:19----------
that i left the house with edison and we


---------49:20----------
went on a cute date


---------49:22----------
um but usually it's very routine and


---------49:25----------
routine tense like when i'm a kid


---------49:27----------
um you know i've only lived so long so


---------49:29----------
every day is like a new memory right and


---------49:31----------
so it feels like


---------49:32----------
um time is slower because


---------49:36----------
that's like every day is like it's like


---------49:39----------
a


---------49:39----------
bigger a fraction of my life like it


---------49:41----------
takes up


---------49:42----------
you know like but now every day is like


---------49:44----------
less of that so i think that


---------49:46----------
i have so many memories that are like so


---------49:48----------
it feels like time is just racing


---------49:50----------
um but yeah i noticed like wow i'm


---------49:52----------
always saying oh my gosh march went by


---------49:54----------
2020 just happened like that


---------49:56----------
um everything is just going by so


---------49:59----------
quickly


---------50:00----------
um and i think that that


---------50:04----------
yeah that that and also i used to break


---------50:06----------
things up a bit more i


---------50:07----------
would travel right and stuff and that


---------50:09----------
would weirdly it would be by having all


---------50:12----------
these things it would


---------50:13----------
slow me down in a way or at least make


---------50:15----------
the year very memorable for me


---------50:17----------
like oh i remember i went to here and


---------50:18----------
then i went to this and then i traveled


---------50:20----------
there lucy can i ask you to just pause


---------50:22----------
for a second


---------50:23----------
yeah i want to just try to because i


---------50:25----------
think you're sharing a lot of really


---------50:27----------
important stuff i just want to be able


---------50:28----------
to process it before you keep going


---------50:30----------
go ahead


---------50:35----------
i'm going to need like a long second


---------50:37----------
okay take your time


---------51:06----------
can you tell me about transitioning to


---------51:07----------
public school and how that was different


---------51:09----------
for you


---------51:14----------
yeah um so i i really wanted to get out


---------51:16----------
of public school because


---------51:18----------
because i was so rebellious and stuff i


---------51:20----------
also caused a lot of


---------51:22----------
drama with my friends and so when i left


---------51:25----------
i remember


---------51:26----------
being very dramatic about it and like i


---------51:27----------
didn't say bye to anybody


---------51:29----------
and people were like leslie it really


---------51:32----------
hurt this guy


---------51:33----------
who liked you that you didn't say bye or


---------51:35----------
you're like i remember just drama like


---------51:37----------
on the last day and i was


---------51:38----------
so happy to get out of there and it was


---------51:39----------
a new start so i went to public school


---------51:42----------
and then


---------51:44----------
uh it was different because i kind of


---------51:47----------
came from being like a cool kid in


---------51:48----------
public school to a private


---------51:50----------
school to a complete like nobody


---------51:53----------
like new kid at a public school where


---------51:56----------
everybody already knew each other


---------51:57----------
because i joined in seventh grade and


---------51:58----------
everyone had already


---------52:00----------
been together since sixth grade so


---------52:01----------
things were established and i remember


---------52:03----------
walking around like i didn't know


---------52:04----------
anybody and i would like my mom signed


---------52:06----------
me up for choir so i immediately joined


---------52:08----------
choir and i found like a home


---------52:10----------
in choir luckily and i found like a


---------52:12----------
really close knit of like


---------52:14----------
a group of three friends i think we met


---------52:16----------
in like my history core class


---------52:18----------
or something but i found a nice knit of


---------52:21----------
friends but i was


---------52:22----------
um and i hung out with my cousin who i


---------52:24----------
rollerbladed a lot with


---------52:25----------
she was also like my best friend so we


---------52:28----------
went to school together and


---------52:29----------
luckily we had each other so that was


---------52:31----------
that um


---------52:32----------
i also shot up my grades i was instantly


---------52:35----------
like an a student


---------52:36----------
because like uh because i came from like


---------52:39----------
redoing like i took geometry or like


---------52:41----------
classes that i was basically redoing a


---------52:43----------
year because i was going faster at


---------52:45----------
private so i already know that stuff so


---------52:47----------
i immediately became a really good


---------52:48----------
student so that was nice i started


---------52:50----------
writing for the school newspaper


---------52:52----------
um how did you feel about yourself


---------52:55----------
great i was like wow i'm actually smart


---------52:58----------
like it felt weird to go from being


---------53:00----------
the dc student like okay i'm just the


---------53:02----------
stupidest kid at my school


---------53:04----------
to i'm passing this class and like


---------53:08----------
helping other kids like learn how to do


---------53:10----------
stuff and i'm like hey like you need


---------53:11----------
help i like i


---------53:12----------
i did the stuff last year so immediately


---------53:15----------
um and i would like kind of gravitate


---------53:17----------
towards smarter students too


---------53:19----------
what happened with the toilet paper in


---------53:21----------
the soap


---------53:24----------
what about it did you continue doing it


---------53:27----------
no


---------53:28----------
no way i felt uh at


---------53:31----------
it in sixth grade or fifth grade i felt


---------53:34----------
like


---------53:34----------
everyone knew me to be rebellious i


---------53:37----------
would


---------53:38----------
go out of my way to make trouble because


---------53:40----------
that was my reputation as well and also


---------53:42----------
it felt good to be rebellious and to say


---------53:45----------
yeah


---------53:46----------
um oh um


---------53:50----------
it felt good to well


---------53:54----------
i don't know i felt it felt like i


---------53:59----------
was pissing off the people that like


---------54:01----------
were mean to me like my teachers


---------54:03----------
i was like why are you so mean and like


---------54:05----------
why do you get me in trouble all the


---------54:07----------
time or call me out all the time


---------54:09----------
so to do that felt like yeah i did that


---------54:12----------
and i don't care um and i guess i just


---------54:15----------
that was my attitude it's really bad and


---------54:17----------
so i got really bad remarks on my


---------54:19----------
report card all the time i remember just


---------54:21----------
like out of line talks too much


---------54:24----------
causes troubles you know all this i was


---------54:26----------
like yeah


---------54:27----------
and what what happened when you i i sort


---------54:29----------
of jumped in a couple of times so what


---------54:31----------
happened when you


---------54:32----------
so you were doing better in school the


---------54:33----------
rebelliousness


---------54:35----------
went away do you have a sense of why


---------54:38----------
well at a new school i'm i've gone to


---------54:41----------
this private school since i was like a


---------54:42----------
child like i literally like first grade


---------54:45----------
second all the way


---------54:47----------
um um i do remember one year sorry


---------54:50----------
i went to fourth grade i switched


---------54:52----------
schools because my mom switched work so


---------54:54----------
i moved to


---------54:55----------
the same private school just a different


---------54:56----------
branch of it in fourth grade


---------54:59----------
and i have an incident of i don't know


---------55:02----------
why


---------55:02----------
it happened but like or like i can't


---------55:04----------
really but maybe this will


---------55:06----------
but basically my teacher asked me like


---------55:09----------
what


---------55:09----------
or i had a best friend named danielle


---------55:11----------
and her mom like worked she had really


---------55:12----------
her mom had a really cool job


---------55:14----------
and my teacher and she asked me like


---------55:17----------
what my mom


---------55:17----------
did and i would tell all my friends i


---------55:21----------
lied and i said


---------55:22----------
my mom works at the monterey bay


---------55:24----------
aquarium i don't know why i just thought


---------55:25----------
it was the coolest job ever and my mom


---------55:27----------
was an accountant


---------55:28----------
which i think is great now but back then


---------55:30----------
i was like my mom's gonna count it


---------55:32----------
that's so boring


---------55:33----------
so my friends moms were like i felt like


---------55:35----------
they were like oh really cool i don't


---------55:36----------
know so


---------55:37----------
they're like your mom works at the


---------55:38----------
aquarium and i was like


---------55:40----------
yep so so anyways


---------55:43----------
my everyone started talking about my mom


---------55:45----------
who works at the monterey bay crime how


---------55:47----------
cool is that anyway so then


---------55:48----------
my teacher like one time walked me to my


---------55:52----------
car


---------55:52----------
my mom was there to pick me up and he's


---------55:54----------
like oh i'm gonna come with you to talk


---------55:55----------
to your mom about her job and i was like


---------55:57----------
you do not need to do that


---------56:00----------
and he's like no no hey mrs foo i heard


---------56:03----------
you work at the monterey bay aquarium my


---------56:05----------
mom's like


---------56:06----------
no i'm gonna count


---------56:09----------
oh gosh i was so embarrassed i was like


---------56:12----------
yeah i lied


---------56:13----------
i don't know why i lied but that i don't


---------56:15----------
know that was like


---------56:16----------
this one side year i like lied a bunch i


---------56:19----------
i don't know i just felt this need to be


---------56:22----------
cooler than i was


---------56:24----------
um or and that was this one year where i


---------56:26----------
came from


---------56:27----------
the rebel rebellious school went to here


---------56:30----------
and then


---------56:31----------
and after that year i went back to that


---------56:32----------
same school and then i started doing all


---------56:34----------
the shenanigans again


---------56:36----------
um but i don't know there's just a side


---------56:38----------
tangent and then


---------56:39----------
yeah um lovely story that's just


---------56:42----------
embarrassing i still sound


---------56:43----------
sounds mortifying it was awful but i


---------56:46----------
brought it upon myself


---------56:48----------
so um so then uh yeah so


---------56:52----------
switching to the new school like i think


---------56:54----------
i'm not just gonna go to a new school


---------56:56----------
with a brand new like no reputation


---------56:57----------
right and then just start causing


---------56:59----------
trouble


---------56:59----------
i'm just like this is my chance to have


---------57:01----------
a new to turn over a new leaf and to


---------57:03----------
make a good reputation and


---------57:04----------
so i think the first thing that gave me


---------57:07----------
an identity was i was having a really


---------57:08----------
easy time in school


---------57:09----------
and so i started to make friends with


---------57:11----------
all the other smarter kids so i started


---------57:12----------
hanging out with smart


---------57:13----------
smart kids and i'm like wow you guys are


---------57:15----------
really smart so we're also


---------57:16----------
all kind of smart and so we all just you


---------57:18----------
know we'd work on school and we'd have


---------57:20----------
we'd talk about things but we weren't


---------57:21----------
like the cool kids or anything kind of


---------57:22----------
hang out and eat in the classroom and


---------57:24----------
stuff


---------57:25----------
um but that was fine and it was


---------57:28----------
definitely different


---------57:29----------
um and it's not like i was like goody


---------57:31----------
two shoes i was always talkative


---------57:33----------
and we get in trouble in almost all my


---------57:35----------
classes like i just talk a lot so in


---------57:37----------
high school i remember


---------57:38----------
my i would yap all the time my teacher


---------57:41----------
would spray water at me sometimes


---------57:42----------
because


---------57:42----------
i was talking so much and then so that


---------57:44----------
was all the way until like senior year


---------57:46----------
of high school


---------57:46----------
so i was never like shy or anything or


---------57:49----------
just like


---------57:50----------
good eating when they sprayed water at


---------57:51----------
you what do you imagine your teacher was


---------57:54----------
feeling in that moment


---------57:58----------
angry that i'm not paying attention


---------58:01----------
disrespecting her like just having side


---------58:04----------
conversations while she's like


---------58:05----------
trying to talk to the class so let me


---------58:08----------
ask you something this is once again


---------58:10----------
loaded question i love this hypothesis


---------58:11----------
may not be


---------58:12----------
so did you when you moved schools did


---------58:14----------
you become age


---------58:20----------
no i couldn't achieve him what ayush was


---------58:23----------
i've never been able to be asus


---------58:25----------
i've like i've never gotten to that


---------58:27----------
point he's he achieved


---------58:28----------
that by fourth grade boy do you try


---------58:32----------
yeah i'm i still am envious of there's


---------58:35----------
and i see in people on twitch as well


---------58:38----------
it's like their ability to


---------58:40----------
to just immerse themselves and


---------58:43----------
live in the moment i see it in the way


---------58:44----------
they are and just the ability to like


---------58:47----------
not care i have like this thing holding


---------58:49----------
me back that's like


---------58:50----------
that's like don't do that or else like


---------58:53----------
you're gonna embarrass yourself so just


---------58:55----------
it you know it's always this thing


---------58:57----------
i'm afraid of failure so i don't let


---------58:59----------
myself try those things but ayush


---------59:01----------
if he was committed right and then he


---------59:03----------
stumbled it felt like that stumble would


---------59:05----------
be more embarrassing than someone who's


---------59:06----------
already fumbling


---------59:08----------
like if he's committed and then and then


---------59:10----------
he goes uh


---------59:11----------
oh crap so i might but he and he would


---------59:14----------
but he just carried on through it


---------59:16----------
but i always thought if i committed so


---------59:18----------
hard to something and i


---------59:19----------
choked that i would i would never be


---------59:22----------
able to live that down so i was like


---------59:24----------
okay it's fine just just


---------59:25----------
just be just be average just don't like


---------59:28----------
do don't


---------59:29----------
don't stick out or don't like fully like


---------59:31----------
commit to anything and then you won't


---------59:33----------
fully fail and that's why


---------59:34----------
i still have that voice uh holds me back


---------59:37----------
a lot from trying things and


---------59:39----------
um yeah so one day i hope to like be


---------59:42----------
able to achieve that or in my mind i


---------59:43----------
actually


---------59:44----------
think in my in my head i tell myself


---------59:46----------
you're not actually capable of that


---------59:48----------
that's just not who you are you're not


---------59:50----------
able to like


---------59:51----------
just let go and fully commit to


---------59:54----------
something


---------59:55----------
without i i sense it in um you know


---------59:58----------
actors


---------59:59----------
actors who can like completely like i


---------60:02----------
feel like they're almost like a


---------60:03----------
different breed like


---------60:04----------
people who can just like you know like


---------60:05----------
action and then they can like


---------60:07----------
commit to a scene so hard i i admire


---------60:11----------
those people i feel like that is just so


---------60:13----------
cool that they can do that in front of


---------60:14----------
so many people and cry


---------60:16----------
and be vulnerable but like


---------60:20----------
i i could never like i i just keeps you


---------60:22----------
from doing that


---------60:24----------
uh fear of i'm just insecure i think i'm


---------60:27----------
just like


---------60:28----------
i of of trying and then someone being


---------60:30----------
like yeah that's not it


---------60:32----------
yeah he retried though you know i think


---------60:34----------
there's that voice


---------60:36----------
of uh rejection of telling me like you


---------60:39----------
know if i never try


---------60:40----------
can't fail in that aspect right so i'm


---------60:41----------
just oh i just look at actors and


---------60:43----------
admire them um but not just


---------60:46----------
i view them as like like yeah like i'm


---------60:49----------
pretty sure


---------60:50----------
she was like in drama and all that stuff


---------60:51----------
i think it comes with a lot of


---------60:53----------
people who are able to put themselves


---------60:55----------
out there it's so cool and i i've always


---------60:57----------
looked up to them


---------60:57----------
but never have i wanted to dock someone


---------60:59----------
in my whole life


---------61:03----------
i want to track down and i don't know if


---------61:05----------
that's the right term


---------61:06----------
i do i'm so curious what this guy's up


---------61:09----------
to now


---------61:12----------
i know okay so


---------61:16----------
so foosley i i think um for better or


---------61:20----------
for worse i i think i have some guidance


---------61:22----------
for you


---------61:23----------
okay


---------61:29----------
so i think it's beautiful that you


---------61:30----------
shared that little anecdote at the


---------61:31----------
beginning about falling asleep


---------61:34----------
because you know the funny thing about


---------61:37----------
falling asleep is that the harder you


---------61:39----------
try the harder it becomes


---------61:41----------
yes and and i think that's a beautiful


---------61:44----------
parallel for like just


---------61:45----------
you so there's some like weird kind of


---------61:48----------
like psychological stuff going on so i


---------61:50----------
think part of your hesitation to commit


---------61:52----------
is because there's a part of you that


---------61:53----------
still feels so


---------61:55----------
what i what i'm guessing foosley and


---------61:57----------
this is you know i don't really know


---------61:58----------
it's just something for you to think


---------61:59----------
about


---------62:00----------
so i tend to offer people hypotheses as


---------62:02----------
opposed to conclusions but i make them


---------62:04----------
sound like conclusions really you


---------62:05----------
who decides so what i'm getting the


---------62:07----------
sense is that like


---------62:09----------
there's private school leslie who's


---------62:12----------
buried


---------62:12----------
underneath public school leslie who's


---------62:14----------
buried underneath you


---------62:16----------
and so the problem is that like the


---------62:18----------
foosley of today can't ever commit


---------62:20----------
because you don't


---------62:22----------
know whether private school leslie or


---------62:25----------
public school leslie


---------62:27----------
you don't know like who you are like


---------62:28----------
which one of those is the real you


---------62:30----------
and the reason you can't commit is


---------62:32----------
because like because now you've built up


---------62:34----------
this kind of shell right like where


---------62:36----------
you're like private school leslie like


---------62:37----------
you're successful you're engaged


---------62:39----------
you're a streamer you have all these


---------62:41----------
things to be proud of but underneath


---------62:43----------
like


---------62:45----------
is public school i mean is private


---------62:46----------
school leslie just like lurking like is


---------62:48----------
that person who couldn't do anything


---------62:50----------
right and no matter how hard she tried


---------62:52----------
right because that's the fear is like


---------62:54----------
you you gave it your best and it just


---------62:56----------
wasn't enough yeah


---------62:59----------
and you know i heard you rebelling and i


---------63:01----------
think it's interesting because when you


---------63:02----------
we conceptualize things we're like a lot


---------63:04----------
more


---------63:06----------
um we think of ourselves as far more


---------63:09----------
autonomous than we are


---------63:11----------
so i don't think that you went to your


---------63:13----------
new school and were like this is an


---------63:14----------
opportunity for me to reinvent myself i


---------63:17----------
think it's actually the other way around


---------63:18----------
where like


---------63:20----------
you went to a new school you were filled


---------63:21----------
with anxiety you kind of stumbled into


---------63:23----------
being one of the smart kids and you're


---------63:25----------
like oh wait a second


---------63:26----------
i don't have to be what i was before i


---------63:29----------
can reinvent myself


---------63:30----------
but that process of reinvention happens


---------63:33----------
after like the realization that you're


---------63:35----------
reinventing itself


---------63:36----------
comes second not first the reinvention


---------63:39----------
already happens


---------63:40----------
so what i'm really hearing from you is


---------63:42----------
that like you know you're


---------63:44----------
you can't you can't commit to being who


---------63:46----------
you


---------63:47----------
are and you call it insecurity which i


---------63:49----------
think is a wonderful umbrella term


---------63:50----------
but what it really is is like i think


---------63:52----------
you're you know i would venture that


---------63:54----------
you're maybe afraid


---------63:56----------
that who you are fundamentally


---------63:59----------
is not good enough and that's where we


---------64:02----------
get to the age pressure


---------64:03----------
because if you don't have faith in


---------64:04----------
yourself you need a playbook


---------64:08----------
right like if i trust who i am


---------64:11----------
i can go up on stage and i can give it


---------64:13----------
my all and come hell or high water like


---------64:15----------
it'll


---------64:16----------
i'll fail magnificently or i'll succeed


---------64:19----------
gloriously


---------64:20----------
there's still magnificence and glory in


---------64:22----------
each one


---------64:23----------
but if i don't have faith in myself


---------64:27----------
and i'm not willing to do that then i


---------64:29----------
need a teleprompter


---------64:31----------
right like i need a playbook that like


---------64:33----------
by 23 i gotta do this by this i gotta do


---------64:35----------
this because like walking my own path


---------64:36----------
like may not be good enough


---------64:39----------
because i think this is where we sort of


---------64:40----------
get into the age pressure which is sort


---------64:41----------
of


---------64:42----------
you know you talk about living in the


---------64:44----------
present and and now we get to something


---------64:45----------
which is like i think you've learned


---------64:47----------
that the present is actually a really


---------64:48----------
painful like it sucks to be the present


---------64:50----------
yeah right and and you kind of say that


---------64:53----------
you're kind of talking about and it's


---------64:54----------
it's definitely a shared experience


---------64:56----------
where you know


---------64:57----------
the four years between 14 and 18 are way


---------65:00----------
longer than the 10 years between 25 and


---------65:02----------
35


---------65:04----------
yes and and so that's a common shared


---------65:06----------
experience


---------65:07----------
and so i i think you sort of started to


---------65:09----------
like


---------65:10----------
adopt like you started to like become


---------65:12----------
something right in


---------65:13----------
in public school and you're like okay


---------65:15----------
i'm gonna do things right and this is


---------65:17----------
where the voice comes in


---------65:19----------
and like the voice is like okay i've to


---------65:21----------
do a good job i've got to do a good job


---------65:22----------
i've got to do it the right way i can't


---------65:24----------
do it


---------65:25----------
because in public in private school did


---------65:27----------
you do it the right way or did you do it


---------65:29----------
your way


---------65:31----------
my way and how did that work out for you


---------65:35----------
bad and when you were in public school


---------65:37----------
did you do it the right way or did you


---------65:39----------
do it your way


---------65:41----------
the right way and how did that work out


---------65:43----------
for you


---------65:45----------
better yeah good right and so now we see


---------65:48----------
like the pressure there's a script


---------65:50----------
because you learned like very early on


---------65:53----------
that your way is a bad way


---------65:56----------
and the right way is a good way and and


---------65:59----------
now it's getting even more confusing


---------66:01----------
because now you're actually learning


---------66:02----------
that that's not actually true


---------66:05----------
that you can do it your way and your way


---------66:07----------
can do the right way but then there's


---------66:09----------
like


---------66:09----------
there's like a like a private school


---------66:12----------
little


---------66:13----------
fourth grade leslie who's like why would


---------66:16----------
you stop being a ush


---------66:18----------
you you did it you did it you were on


---------66:21----------
the right track and


---------66:22----------
even now you can hear the qualification


---------66:23----------
right you've never become age and i


---------66:25----------
asked you


---------66:26----------
in in public school was at the right and


---------66:28----------
you were like yeah it was decent


---------66:29----------
there's a step in the right direction


---------66:30----------
you qualify it you can't really own it


---------66:33----------
and so there's this part of you that


---------66:34----------
like wants to be this perfect thing and


---------66:36----------
like


---------66:36----------
being you is not that perfect thing but


---------66:38----------
now you're confused because as you're


---------66:39----------
mature and stuff like that there's a 28


---------66:41----------
year old you who's like


---------66:42----------
i found my person we're gonna get


---------66:44----------
married when it's like convenient for us


---------66:45----------
to get married


---------66:46----------
we're gonna probably have kids i want to


---------66:48----------
have kids and but it's weird because you


---------66:50----------
have these like three voices right


---------66:52----------
there's private school leslie


---------66:53----------
there's public school leslie and then


---------66:55----------
there's like the leslie of today


---------66:58----------
and so you say and now what what you're


---------67:01----------
noticing is like


---------67:02----------
actually i'm living way too fast like


---------67:03----------
this is too much too


---------67:05----------
fast and this is where you kind of talk


---------67:07----------
about the industry


---------67:08----------
and there's like this is this one


---------67:09----------
opportunity to like go to germany and


---------67:11----------
meet this person and this is this one


---------67:12----------
opportunity and this one opportunity let


---------67:14----------
me live in the present let me live in


---------67:15----------
the present let me look i have so much


---------67:17----------
present to live in


---------67:18----------
oh my god let's live in all the present


---------67:19----------
let's do it all right now every day


---------67:21----------
live in the present baby let's go let's


---------67:23----------
go let's go live in a present oh


---------67:25----------
yeah right yeah it's like like you're


---------67:28----------
falling into this really bizarre trap of


---------67:30----------
like


---------67:31----------
trying to force yourself to fall asleep


---------67:35----------
and it's like the more you try to live


---------67:37----------
in the present


---------67:39----------
the more fast forward your life becomes


---------67:41----------
it's like yeah let's take advantage of


---------67:42----------
this opportunity separation is only


---------67:44----------
going to happen once


---------67:45----------
in the present yeah yeah let's go


---------67:49----------
right so true


---------67:55----------
and so it like it's it's really


---------67:56----------
challenging because i think in order


---------67:58----------
to live in the present now now you know


---------68:00----------
we get to be wise


---------68:02----------
you ready for the wisdom yes i'm ready


---------68:04----------
in order to in order to live in the


---------68:06----------
present you have to let go of the desire


---------68:08----------
of living in the present


---------68:11----------
because it is the desire for living in


---------68:12----------
the present that has you living in the


---------68:14----------
future and fast forwarding your life


---------68:18----------
i'm sorry do i get rid of that desire to


---------68:20----------
live in the present


---------68:22----------
you don't get rid of the desire to live


---------68:24----------
in the present you just don't give in to


---------68:26----------
it


---------68:28----------
right so like like i i know it sounds


---------68:30----------
weird but very practically


---------68:32----------
you know like i know it sounds weird but


---------68:35----------
like


---------68:36----------
so if you go to a conference and you ask


---------68:40----------
yourself the question


---------68:41----------
is this me trying to live in the present


---------68:44----------
and then your answer is going to be yes


---------68:46----------
because this is a wonderful opportunity


---------68:47----------
that i can treasure


---------68:48----------
and i can be in the present if i go to


---------68:50----------
the conference but that's what you've


---------68:51----------
always said and then you go to six


---------68:53----------
conferences and then


---------68:54----------
life passes you by so oddly enough


---------68:57----------
you should ask yourself is this me


---------68:59----------
trying to live in the present and if the


---------69:00----------
answer is yes don't do it


---------69:03----------
it's gonna be really difficult i know


---------69:06----------
it's confusing isn't it


---------69:11----------
what okay i but then when will i ever


---------69:16----------
do anything exactly and that's what


---------69:20----------
living in the present is


---------69:21----------
right because the present is not about


---------69:23----------
doing it's about is it's about being


---------69:25----------
it's not about doing


---------69:28----------
so like what what you are is a doer


---------69:31----------
instead of a beer


---------69:33----------
yeah like doing is about like like even


---------69:36----------
when you


---------69:37----------
do something truly in the present you're


---------69:40----------
not doing it you're becoming it


---------69:42----------
like like i know this sounds weird but


---------69:44----------
like you know i i've been working


---------69:46----------
with some esports professionals recently


---------69:48----------
and we talk about


---------69:49----------
becoming one with the game they're not


---------69:51----------
playing the game anymore


---------69:53----------
they like become this weird like super


---------69:56----------
human thing where they're like one with


---------69:58----------
the game and you'll see it if you like


---------69:59----------
watch esports where there


---------70:00----------
there's like one thing where like it


---------70:02----------
looks like they're hacking


---------70:04----------
like they their game sense is just out


---------70:07----------
of this world


---------70:09----------
and they like predict things it looks


---------70:11----------
like their reactions like they've got


---------70:12----------
some sort of weird like


---------70:13----------
you know like map hacker like you know


---------70:15----------
some like you know aimbot or something


---------70:18----------
it's not that they have an aimbot it's


---------70:19----------
that they know where the enemy is going


---------70:21----------
to be


---------70:23----------
yeah and they even like shoot the bullet


---------70:25----------
before they see them on the screen


---------70:26----------
and then lo and behold the person shows


---------70:28----------
up and then you know they get sniped


---------70:31----------
and it's and isn't that like float flow


---------70:33----------
state


---------70:34----------
absolutely so the flow state is not like


---------70:37----------
and so the more that you try to do


---------70:40----------
yeah the less you be


---------70:43----------
and the purest form of doing is actually


---------70:46----------
being


---------70:47----------
when you become like one with the object


---------70:51----------
right like like when i'm not i'm not a


---------70:53----------
person


---------70:54----------
anymore like i'm not someone who's doing


---------70:57----------
something i


---------70:58----------
am that thing like you become like like


---------71:01----------
you know an embodiment of like valorant


---------71:04----------
whatever that is or whatever you know


---------71:08----------
yeah what what do you think about that


---------71:12----------
i i actually think that that makes sense


---------71:14----------
i have like


---------71:15----------
watched a lot of videos about like the


---------71:17----------
flow state and like yeah when i


---------71:19----------
and i've like i want to achieve that and


---------71:21----------
i know how it feels


---------71:22----------
to like be in that flow state


---------71:25----------
uh and like i know i love that feeling


---------71:29----------
and sometimes it's me even like working


---------71:31----------
or something i'm like


---------71:32----------
i just feel like this sense of like i


---------71:34----------
can't be interrupted because what i'm


---------71:36----------
doing is i'm just so one with what i'm


---------71:38----------
doing


---------71:38----------
my mind is like going and i'm like i


---------71:41----------
feel like very present in that moment


---------71:42----------
and i


---------71:43----------
really love that but i don't know how to


---------71:44----------
access it regularly yes so we're gonna


---------71:46----------
get to that


---------71:47----------
yeah so i'm so perfect so let me ask you


---------71:49----------
something


---------71:51----------
when you access the flow state before


---------71:55----------
you access the flow state did you want


---------71:56----------
to access the flow state


---------71:59----------
i think i always want to but i i didn't


---------72:02----------
uh


---------72:03----------
look at refresh yes did you try to


---------72:06----------
access the flow state when you succeed


---------72:08----------
in accessing the flow state uh


---------72:11----------
sometimes sometimes sometimes it's like


---------72:13----------
i put myself in the right minds i clean


---------72:14----------
my space


---------72:15----------
i take drink lots of coffee and i like


---------72:18----------
clear my mind i have everything else


---------72:21----------
done


---------72:21----------
around me so i don't have random


---------72:23----------
distractions and i can like set myself


---------72:25----------
up but i can't always


---------72:26----------
guarantee it it's kind of like a it


---------72:29----------
sometimes is and sometimes there isn't


---------72:30----------
good so so so so i know it sounds okay


---------72:33----------
so


---------72:34----------
let me think about it okay we're going


---------72:35----------
to talk about flow state and the prac


---------72:37----------
like the practicalities then we're going


---------72:38----------
to talk about your life again and this


---------72:40----------
whole like


---------72:40----------
stop trying to do so much yeah um and


---------72:44----------
and that kind of business okay so the


---------72:45----------
first thing is that so i like sleep


---------72:47----------
a lot because um and i like this


---------72:49----------
discussion of the flow state because


---------72:51----------
like the yogis in india understood this


---------72:53----------
really really well


---------72:54----------
so part of the thing is that they they


---------72:56----------
have so many different they have like as


---------72:58----------
many words for snow that eskimos do is


---------73:00----------
like


---------73:00----------
they have tons of words for


---------73:02----------
consciousness in states of mind


---------73:04----------
so what they recognized is that you


---------73:06----------
can't enter


---------73:07----------
a state a flow state so flow state is a


---------73:09----------
state of consciousness


---------73:11----------
called diana and that's one word for it


---------73:14----------
anyway


---------73:15----------
so diane is like a state of mind so it's


---------73:17----------
kind of like


---------73:18----------
sleep so can you go to sleep


---------73:23----------
think thank you how tell me


---------73:26----------
instruct me in how to sleep close your


---------73:29----------
eyes


---------73:30----------
and then you you think i my trick is


---------73:33----------
that i


---------73:34----------
think about a very specific memory from


---------73:37----------
like


---------73:37----------
fourth or fifth grade and i try to


---------73:40----------
recall every detail of that story


---------73:43----------
it's like i'm watching a mini movie of


---------73:44----------
my life or like yes last night i did


---------73:46----------
high school


---------73:46----------
but like every night i pick a night or a


---------73:49----------
day i think ah


---------73:50----------
seventh grade and i just go down seventh


---------73:52----------
grade in my mind


---------73:54----------
and like what it was like and who i was


---------73:56----------
talking with or a specific


---------73:58----------
aim conversation i had with them and as


---------74:00----------
i think more and more details


---------74:04----------
so interesting so the way that you sleep


---------74:07----------
is you start


---------74:08----------
so sleep is recalling lots of memories


---------74:10----------
about a particular day in your past


---------74:12----------
yeah is that what sleep is well no


---------74:15----------
that sleep is when you're actually


---------74:16----------
unconscious and then it that


---------74:18----------
that helps me relax and then but


---------74:22----------
how do i sleep is recall


---------74:25----------
sleep because you're telling me that


---------74:26----------
what you're doing is recall no


---------74:29----------
recall leads to sleep for me okay so now


---------74:32----------
we get


---------74:32----------
good so one is an action one is a doing


---------74:36----------
the recall is the doing and the sleep is


---------74:38----------
the happening


---------74:40----------
there's a doing and there's a happening


---------74:42----------
there's a doing and there's a being


---------74:44----------
and the two are different fundamentally


---------74:45----------
different and so your problem about like


---------74:48----------
trying to live in the present


---------74:50----------
is that you're trying to do the being


---------74:54----------
yeah but the being in the doing are


---------74:56----------
different


---------74:58----------
yes right just like you said so you've


---------74:59----------
figured out a dharma so now we get to


---------75:02----------
the verb part


---------75:03----------
so diane or the flow state is a state of


---------75:06----------
mind it's a noun it's not a verb


---------75:08----------
you can't do it you can't be in the


---------75:11----------
present


---------75:12----------
being and just think about it for a


---------75:14----------
second b is a beaver


---------75:16----------
right it's not like an action verb so


---------75:17----------
you can't be in the present


---------75:20----------
like it's not something you can do you


---------75:23----------
can exist in the present


---------75:24----------
but it's not like an action like i'm not


---------75:26----------
like uh okay


---------75:28----------
i'm gonna do a little bit of being right


---------75:29----------
now you ready


---------75:33----------
oh man do you see that guy that guy is


---------75:35----------
an olympic runner man he can run so fast


---------75:38----------
that guy's a pro gamer he can play so


---------75:40----------
well dude did you see that guy


---------75:41----------
look at him being man like oh damn that


---------75:44----------
guy's like olympic level


---------75:46----------
pro level being look at him oh


---------75:49----------
right right damn look at that


---------75:53----------
oh my god did you see his moves


---------75:56----------
look at him being there oh my god sick


---------76:01----------
sick can't do that you can't do the big


---------76:05----------
the doing being are fundamentally


---------76:06----------
different things if i am saying like i


---------76:09----------
am in the present that statement alone


---------76:11----------
is like now i'm not in the present


---------76:13----------
sort sorry okay yeah so so so like


---------76:17----------
i would say that you can still be in the


---------76:19----------
present


---------76:20----------
but i'm trying to be in the present


---------76:23----------
means you're not in the present like the


---------76:24----------
trying is like the action verb right so


---------76:26----------
it's like


---------76:27----------
so so so the focusing technique so this


---------76:30----------
is what the the


---------76:31----------
yogi's figured out the same thing you


---------76:33----------
figured out good job foosley


---------76:34----------
which is that there is there is a verb


---------76:37----------
called focus


---------76:38----------
so this is so what you do is a focusing


---------76:42----------
technique


---------76:42----------
you like pick a particular memory and


---------76:45----------
what you do is you make your mind


---------76:46----------
one pointed on one thing and so like the


---------76:49----------
way this works with sleep is that


---------76:50----------
normally


---------76:51----------
all these different thoughts interfere


---------76:53----------
with our ability of sleep


---------76:54----------
so our mind can't we can't clear our


---------76:56----------
mind but what the mind is really good at


---------76:59----------
is letting one thing block out


---------77:01----------
everything else which is why we love


---------77:02----------
video games and why they're so [ __ ]


---------77:04----------
addictive


---------77:05----------
because like i can play a video game and


---------77:07----------
it can knock out everything


---------77:09----------
else so what you start is a focus


---------77:13----------
a verb and then when you do the dharuna


---------77:17----------
is as long as you sit with that tarana


---------77:19----------
for a while


---------77:20----------
your mind does something really cool


---------77:22----------
which is a general principle which is


---------77:24----------
like


---------77:24----------
it acclimatizes that and and it starts


---------77:27----------
stops


---------77:28----------
experiencing it and so what i mean by


---------77:30----------
that is like if you walk into a room


---------77:32----------
you'll notice the smell and then within


---------77:34----------
a few seconds


---------77:35----------
your brain literally blocks out the


---------77:37----------
signal of the smell


---------77:39----------
it acclimatizes to it when i put on this


---------77:41----------
shirt i feel it


---------77:42----------
but then within a few seconds i stopped


---------77:44----------
feeling it so over time when you focus


---------77:46----------
on one thing


---------77:47----------
you use that to push all the other


---------77:49----------
thoughts out of your mind and then when


---------77:51----------
you sit with that one thing


---------77:52----------
eventually your mind will get used to it


---------77:54----------
and then it's gone


---------77:55----------
and then you are in a no-mind state


---------77:58----------
that's when you


---------77:59----------
fall asleep when you acclimatize to it


---------78:04----------
yeah okay so and also you figured out


---------78:07----------
like just like the flow state like it's


---------78:09----------
weird that you talk about these weird


---------78:10----------
things like you clean your room before


---------78:12----------
it flow safe how on earth does that work


---------78:14----------
so once again there's a sanskrit word


---------78:16----------
for that


---------78:18----------
means cleansing and so what people


---------78:20----------
figured out is that an important part of


---------78:22----------
meditation practice


---------78:23----------
is people who clean their room enter the


---------78:26----------
state of dion more easily than people


---------78:27----------
who do not


---------78:30----------
and it's just something about that like


---------78:32----------
the rote mechanical


---------78:33----------
like putting things in order there's


---------78:35----------
some kind of like if you really think


---------78:36----------
about it like cleaning


---------78:38----------
is like not a mentally activating


---------78:41----------
activity


---------78:43----------
it is like a mentally like calming


---------78:45----------
activity right so like your mind is like


---------78:46----------
focused on this little menial task


---------78:48----------
you can't really think about other stuff


---------78:51----------
so cleaning is actually a really


---------78:53----------
powerful form


---------78:54----------
of almost like daruna because you know i


---------78:56----------
can't really


---------78:57----------
you know my mind if i'm sitting there


---------78:59----------
i'll get bored and my mind can wander it


---------79:00----------
can think about all kinds of things


---------79:02----------
anxieties and whatnot when i'm cleaning


---------79:04----------
it's like it requires just enough brain


---------79:06----------
power


---------79:07----------
so that i can't be anxious at the same


---------79:09----------
time yeah


---------79:11----------
yes when i'm stressed i clean when i do


---------79:13----------
like when anything is bothering me


---------79:15----------
i look around my room and i just start


---------79:16----------
picking things up and it immediately


---------79:18----------
alleviates it as things are getting


---------79:19----------
clean yeah so it's weird but like you


---------79:22----------
figured this stuff out which is


---------79:23----------
fantastic so yeah so that should be


---------79:25----------
and so like there are other things that


---------79:26----------
you can do to prime yourself to be


---------79:28----------
kind of in the present so i'm gonna have


---------79:30----------
to think a little bit about you know


---------79:31----------
i'll teach you a formal practice to try


---------79:33----------
to get you into the flow state in a few


---------79:35----------
minutes i just have to think about what


---------79:36----------
that is and where you are


---------79:38----------
but now i want to talk a little bit


---------79:40----------
about living in the present so i want to


---------79:41----------
go back to this idea of like you know if


---------79:43----------
you


---------79:44----------
tell yourself in order to live in the


---------79:46----------
present i must go do this


---------79:49----------
how do you feel about not doing those


---------79:51----------
things


---------79:55----------
sad because it's like in my mind that's


---------79:59----------
what life is kind of all about it's like


---------80:01----------
to go make those connections that to


---------80:04----------
those people that you met


---------80:06----------
or to like i don't know that's just and


---------80:08----------
go travel see other parts of the world


---------80:10----------
and me staying in my room or at my house


---------80:13----------
is like more of the same so time if


---------80:15----------
anything in my mind will pass quicker


---------80:16----------
because it's the same


---------80:18----------
it's like routine so my brain will just


---------80:20----------
mesh all those days together but if i


---------80:22----------
get up


---------80:23----------
go somewhere and you know talk to all


---------80:26----------
these people meet all these people


---------80:28----------
um it it's like yeah that that's


---------80:32----------
in my mind that's gonna if anything slow


---------80:34----------
things down


---------80:35----------
um yeah so so that makes a lot of sense


---------80:39----------
so let me add a couple of like nuances


---------80:41----------
or caveats here so the first is that


---------80:44----------
if you're not going to a conference and


---------80:47----------
you maintain your same routine at home


---------80:50----------
it's not going to work at all so the


---------80:52----------
goal


---------80:53----------
is for you to like not do your home


---------80:56----------
routine


---------80:57----------
at home which i know sounds weird


---------81:01----------
um but then then you may actually have


---------81:02----------
to leave so like i'm not saying don't go


---------81:05----------
somewhere because it could be a good


---------81:06----------
idea to leave but what i want you to be


---------81:07----------
careful about


---------81:09----------
is going somewhere with the intention


---------81:12----------
of getting the most juice out of life


---------81:16----------
yeah because it is that juice it is that


---------81:19----------
desire


---------81:20----------
of getting the most out of something it


---------81:22----------
is that hunger from the flow state


---------81:24----------
which prevents you from getting into the


---------81:26----------
flow state to begin with


---------81:29----------
right so like i think you can go


---------81:31----------
somewhere by all means


---------81:33----------
like go somewhere peaceful but don't try


---------81:37----------
to be in the present just go there just


---------81:39----------
to


---------81:39----------
hang out don't try to accomplish


---------81:41----------
anything because flow states are not


---------81:43----------
about accomplishing and in fact


---------81:45----------
the harder you try to accomplish the


---------81:48----------
further away the flow state becomes


---------81:49----------
the flow state is about letting go sleep


---------81:52----------
is about letting go


---------81:53----------
the harder you tell yourself oh my god i


---------81:55----------
need to fall asleep i need to fall


---------81:56----------
asleep right now i'm gonna be so tired


---------81:57----------
tomorrow i'm gonna be so tired tomorrow


---------81:58----------
let's go oh let's go baby olympic


---------82:00----------
sleeper let's go


---------82:02----------
oh yeah let's go


---------82:05----------
let's go son that's me right


---------82:08----------
yeah and so the more that your mind is


---------82:11----------
doing that like


---------82:12----------
the less in the present you're going to


---------82:14----------
be because your mind is like let's go


---------82:16----------
fast forward baby like six conferences


---------82:19----------
in one year like


---------82:20----------
two is for scrubs yeah


---------82:24----------
private school leslie like we're like


---------82:26----------
we're like hey you should do


---------82:27----------
ten every week he shows up and he goes


---------82:30----------
to every one of those conferences


---------82:31----------
and he performs like it was his last day


---------82:35----------
on earth so we're gonna go to this


---------82:36----------
conference it's gonna be a last


---------82:37----------
conference on earth we're gonna form


---------82:39----------
connections we have deep conversations


---------82:40----------
let's go that's me yeah that's exactly


---------82:45----------
how it feels it's like okay like


---------82:47----------
this one's over now on to the next one


---------82:48----------
at that one i'm gonna schedule all these


---------82:50----------
times to meet all these people


---------82:52----------
i'm gonna boom boom boom boom boom and


---------82:53----------
then it goes like that and i'm like wow


---------82:56----------
where did that go yeah absolutely right


---------82:58----------
so so if we think about it you know this


---------83:00----------
the speed of your thoughts is going to


---------83:01----------
correlate with like something about your


---------83:03----------
experience of time


---------83:05----------
and there you are whipping yourself to


---------83:07----------
get like the most out of this experience


---------83:09----------
that the experience


---------83:12----------
whooshes right by you and so in order to


---------83:15----------
slow down you have to like


---------83:16----------
stop trying to slow like get so much out


---------83:19----------
of life you know it's sort of like


---------83:20----------
okay like let's go to this conference


---------83:22----------
and just see how it goes like


---------83:25----------
maybe i'll i'll hang out with some


---------83:26----------
people like that's cool


---------83:28----------
i love that but how do i do that like i


---------83:31----------
ah you love the idea of it so


---------83:34----------
so this is how you do it see your


---------83:37----------
problem is the question that you just


---------83:39----------
asked


---------83:41----------
because you're like how do i do that


---------83:42----------
there it is again there's your mind


---------83:44----------
do it let's go like how do i like yeah


---------83:47----------
like tell me


---------83:48----------
tell me how do i be in an olympic level


---------83:50----------
yeah that's what i want


---------83:52----------
yeah let's go sorry


---------83:56----------
there you are again you see yeah yeah


---------83:59----------
i'm all about


---------84:00----------
efficiency in life yeah and like yeah


---------84:03----------
like


---------84:03----------
i when i buy things that's like best


---------84:05----------
reviewed things


---------84:07----------
sit with this foosley you don't


---------84:12----------
you don't do what i'm telling you to do


---------84:15----------
you can't do it


---------84:20----------
how does that feel


---------84:25----------
and if i can't do it then


---------84:28----------
and then it's impossible he said i can't


---------84:30----------
do it so


---------84:32----------
so if i can't do it then then i might as


---------84:34----------
well


---------84:35----------
well


---------84:39----------
keep going keep going it's new territory


---------84:42----------
for you so it's going to


---------84:44----------
you're saying i can't i i can't


---------84:48----------
uh like what can't i do


---------84:51----------
like be present i can't be present it's


---------84:54----------
just not possible for me to remember


---------84:56----------
yep it's just impossible so then what


---------84:59----------
does your mind do


---------85:00----------
well go back to the conventions and


---------85:04----------
just go back to how it was if i can't


---------85:06----------
achieve the other one


---------85:07----------
yep yeah and in doing so you will be one


---------85:10----------
step closer to being present


---------85:15----------
just by acknowledging or see because


---------85:18----------
it's


---------85:18----------
it's it's kind of like saying like ah


---------85:20----------
[ __ ] it this night is ruined


---------85:22----------
i'm i'm not gonna be able to fall asleep


---------85:25----------
and then it disarms the anxiety and you


---------85:27----------
pass out


---------85:28----------
yeah that's very true once i give up


---------85:31----------
and snap my eyes open i'm like eh yeah


---------85:34----------
yeah so so like so being in the present


---------85:37----------
is about


---------85:38----------
letting go now you understand what


---------85:40----------
letting go is


---------85:41----------
because when once you take that burden


---------85:44----------
away from yourself


---------85:45----------
that you don't have to be a ush you


---------85:47----------
don't have to make the most of it are


---------85:48----------
you going to go to the conference


---------85:49----------
absolutely but you know what you're not


---------85:51----------
going to be able to be present


---------85:53----------
because you just suck at that all right


---------85:56----------
so let's just


---------85:56----------
go and let's just like let's at least


---------85:59----------
have a good time like


---------86:00----------
sure it's gonna pass me by i'm gonna


---------86:02----------
feel exhausted at the end of it i'm


---------86:04----------
gonna have to go back to streaming


---------86:05----------
i'm gonna regret it in a couple of days


---------86:08----------
and i'm gonna have all these like


---------86:09----------
choice memories to hang on to and at


---------86:11----------
least i'll have made the most of it


---------86:13----------
but i'm not gonna be present it's gonna


---------86:14----------
actually be kind of crappy it'll be like


---------86:16----------
sort of fun but it'll be like exhausting


---------86:18----------
it's just like it is what it is let's


---------86:19----------
just go for it


---------86:21----------
and then boom you'll be present


---------86:25----------
but you can't trick yourself into doing


---------86:27----------
that because you can't say oh oh oh this


---------86:29----------
is how i'd be present i pretend that i'm


---------86:30----------
not going for the presents


---------86:33----------
oh oh oh let's pretend i'm gonna


---------86:36----------
beat that and uh the no no you can't


---------86:39----------
trick yourself you really have to just


---------86:41----------
you can't do it yeah yeah


---------86:45----------
this i had like um so twitchcon


---------86:48----------
um is it i don't know if you've been to


---------86:49----------
oh i probably haven't been to twitchcon


---------86:51----------
but twitchcon is like this


---------86:52----------
convention that like you know you go and


---------86:54----------
it's like a very hyped up event because


---------86:56----------
it's like the one time of year


---------86:57----------
i'm gonna be at a place and all the


---------86:59----------
people who watch me are my friends or


---------87:01----------

---------87:01----------

---------87:03----------
that one place and they find each other


---------87:04----------
it's like this super hype weekend


---------87:06----------

---------87:24----------
fight like


---------87:25----------
right before it to the point where like


---------87:27----------
i was like we're arguing and i'm like


---------87:29----------

---------87:31----------
right now because i need to go


---------87:33----------

---------88:34----------
there's no word yeah


---------88:38----------
like that is not being in the present


---------88:40----------
yeah i know


---------88:44----------
what i'm hearing is accept those moments


---------88:47----------
where you're not like that like edison


---------88:51----------
right it sounds like you just met a dude


---------88:52----------
and he's dope


---------88:54----------
it's like oh my god he proposed to me he


---------88:57----------
rented out the entire symphony hall


---------88:59----------
and there was a 64-piece orchestra it


---------89:01----------
was so great we had an instagram


---------89:03----------
photographer who took care of everything


---------89:04----------
no he he proposed to you with


---------89:09----------
chipotle bag yeah


---------89:12----------
at the end of a marathon stream where he


---------89:14----------
was like mentally fatigued


---------89:16----------
that's your life and it's perfect


---------89:19----------
the way it is you don't need to have the


---------89:22----------
script yeah


---------89:25----------
right and so in terms of twitchcon by


---------89:27----------
all means be on on twitchcon but what's


---------89:28----------
happening the other 51 weekends of the


---------89:30----------
year


---------89:37----------
uh i'm working usually streaming


---------89:40----------
okay so like i will allow you


---------89:44----------
and it sounds so controlling but i will


---------89:46----------
allow you


---------89:47----------
to be bent out of shape for twitchcon


---------89:49----------
let that go you can't you can't be


---------89:51----------
present during twitchcon don't worry


---------89:52----------
about it don't try to be present


---------89:54----------
too much pressure too important too


---------89:56----------
professional


---------89:57----------
too important for your career fine so


---------89:59----------
let that what about the other 51


---------90:00----------
weekends


---------90:02----------
you know well well there's another


---------90:04----------
twitchcon in europe that happened so


---------90:05----------
that twitchcon as well ah


---------90:07----------
oh okay so that's two out of 52.


---------90:11----------
what about the other 50 then okay


---------90:14----------
there's lacks okay well uh


---------90:16----------
okay fine right so like like so there's


---------90:18----------
like six or eight


---------90:20----------
and sure so like that's where you gotta


---------90:21----------
all really think about do you need to go


---------90:23----------
to all these why do you need to go to


---------90:24----------
all these because ah


---------90:27----------
okay you know how you just described


---------90:28----------
that as how my weeks are


---------90:30----------
like i have an empty week on my calendar


---------90:32----------
and it'll be like monday tuesday


---------90:33----------
wednesday thursday friday saturday


---------90:34----------
sunday right


---------90:34----------
and i have empty bubbles for it and then


---------90:37----------
my weeks


---------90:38----------
all slowly fill up as people say hey can


---------90:41----------
you do this sponsor


---------90:42----------
hey can you do this call at this time


---------90:44----------
for that sponsor hey do you want to play


---------90:45----------
this game on this day


---------90:46----------
hey and my brain is like yep yep yep


---------90:49----------
sounds good okay oh excited cool my


---------90:50----------
week's filling out doom


---------90:51----------
doom so i slowly start typing it at all


---------90:53----------
and then my week starts going like it


---------90:54----------
looks


---------90:56----------
i'm like whoa and i read that out and


---------90:59----------
then people are like you need to slow


---------91:00----------
down yeah yep so so that's where the key


---------91:03----------
thing there


---------91:03----------
is when you get that phone call what


---------91:06----------
happens in your mind


---------91:07----------
can you do this it says well


---------91:12----------
okay well yes so for me it's like of


---------91:14----------
course i can do that


---------91:16----------
i want to do that because uh if it's a


---------91:18----------
sponsor it's like well


---------91:20----------
it goes back to well here's x amount of


---------91:22----------
dollars


---------91:23----------
and i'm not going to be able to make x


---------91:25----------
amount of dollars when i'm 35


---------91:26----------
because i'm not gonna have a job in my


---------91:28----------
mind because that you know


---------91:30----------
back to where i thought so now i must


---------91:32----------
work now so


---------91:33----------
yes i will take that and the call i have


---------91:36----------
to take that because that goes along


---------91:37----------
with the sponsor


---------91:38----------
uh you know and then my friends asked me


---------91:39----------
to play a game well of course i'm gonna


---------91:40----------
play the game because


---------91:41----------
i knock two things out at once i get to


---------91:43----------
hang out with my friends and work


---------91:45----------
so and content double which you know so


---------91:47----------
of course


---------91:48----------
so it starts to fill out like that and


---------91:50----------
then everything is like i can always


---------91:51----------
reason it back to of course yes


---------91:53----------
yes must yes yep so so good so


---------91:56----------
the couple random questions are you


---------91:58----------
afraid of death


---------92:01----------
do you i always think death a lot all


---------92:03----------
the time


---------92:05----------
twice a day twice a day yeah okay


---------92:09----------
yeah you sound something to me like


---------92:10----------
someone who's afraid of death um


---------92:12----------
so so um wait what does that mean


---------92:16----------
you sound to me like someone who's


---------92:18----------
afraid of death


---------92:20----------
like i mean everyone's a little bit


---------92:21----------
afraid of death but this sounds to me


---------92:23----------
like someone who like thinks about it


---------92:24----------
twice a day


---------92:25----------
yeah okay um so so because it's kind of


---------92:27----------
like this idea that like


---------92:29----------
you know once you're gone you can't have


---------92:31----------
anything with anyone so there's a


---------92:33----------
certain like desperation


---------92:35----------
to like living life it's like you've got


---------92:37----------
to live as much life as you can before


---------92:39----------
it's too late


---------92:41----------
so oddly enough you know one thing that


---------92:42----------
you can do is work on your fear of death


---------92:44----------
and as you get


---------92:45----------
more comfortable with that a lot of the


---------92:46----------
stuff will actually melt away


---------92:48----------
um it's weird but there's a there's an


---------92:51----------
interesting book called the tibetan book


---------92:53----------
of living and dying and


---------92:54----------
and there's a there's there's a


---------92:56----------
particular sect of monks who sort of


---------92:58----------
think that


---------92:59----------
all of our fears and attachments come


---------93:01----------
from a fear of death hasn't been really


---------93:03----------
my experience i think


---------93:04----------
you know some of our attachments come


---------93:05----------
from


---------93:07----------
you know seeing ayush every week uh but


---------93:10----------
yeah you know but but i i think so sorry


---------93:13----------
for


---------93:14----------
i just wanted to check that box or try


---------93:17----------
to see if this kind of makes sense but


---------93:19----------
um kind of coming back to what to do so


---------93:21----------
i want you to notice that in that chain


---------93:22----------
there's one really important thing which


---------93:24----------
is like when i'm


---------93:25----------
35 this opportunity won't be available


---------93:28----------
yeah and in a sense that could be true


---------93:31----------
but like why is that a problem


---------93:36----------
um because then you know in my mind i'm


---------93:39----------
my work i always think


---------93:41----------
uh protect yourself from the worst case


---------93:43----------
scenario so


---------93:45----------
you know when a time when like cancel


---------93:46----------
culture is very real


---------93:48----------
um and i've seen like a lot of my peers


---------93:50----------
just like


---------93:51----------
lose their jobs and stuff i kind of like


---------93:53----------
don't know what i do


---------93:54----------
without my job right now or like i'm not


---------93:57----------
sure how to handle it so i kind of want


---------93:58----------
to like


---------93:59----------
cushion myself for like that time when


---------94:03----------
i'm unemployed


---------94:04----------
so that's why so foosley i think this


---------94:07----------
this gets tricky i think it's probably


---------94:09----------
beyond the scope of what we can cover


---------94:10----------
because this is a whole thing that we do


---------94:12----------
with like creators as a whole like in


---------94:15----------
our i don't know if you know this but we


---------94:16----------
have like a creator coaching program


---------94:18----------
so there's like you know we talk about


---------94:20----------
you know like cancel


---------94:22----------
ptsd and and things like that but um


---------94:26----------
we just this is where i think there's a


---------94:28----------
balance between being like


---------94:30----------
calculated and acknowledging that this


---------94:33----------
opportunity may not last forever and


---------94:36----------
also


---------94:36----------
recognizing that there is the truth


---------94:40----------
of that and then there is the fear of


---------94:42----------
that


---------94:44----------
right and be really careful about which


---------94:47----------
one is dictating your actions


---------94:49----------
because i suspect that strategizing for


---------94:53----------
it


---------94:55----------
and being afraid of it that you're


---------94:57----------
actually like a little bit heavier on


---------94:59----------
the fear end of the spectrum


---------95:00----------
so that's what's causing you to like


---------95:03----------
take too many opportunities


---------95:05----------
yeah and what we actually find is that


---------95:08----------
like when people start to really


---------95:09----------
acknowledge this


---------95:10----------
that actually their performance actually


---------95:12----------
improves


---------95:15----------
right so it's kind of weird but like we


---------95:17----------
had a call


---------95:18----------
in from an investment banker a couple


---------95:20----------
like a week ago


---------95:21----------
monday maybe and and it's i've worked


---------95:24----------
with a lot of investment bankers and


---------95:25----------
they're so


---------95:26----------
anxious about doing a good job that they


---------95:28----------
do a bad job


---------95:30----------
you know absolutely right because it's


---------95:33----------
like i'm trying so hard it's like


---------95:35----------
uh gotta be calm gotta be relaxed gotta


---------95:38----------
sound good like gotta be in a good mood


---------95:40----------
gotta crack jokes gotta be impressive


---------95:42----------
gotta do all of it and then like the


---------95:44----------
more you


---------95:44----------
uh it like the worse you do


---------95:48----------
and so what actually happens is like


---------95:50----------
like what i have to train them in


---------95:52----------
is like learning how to let go of doing


---------95:54----------
a good job


---------95:56----------
right and the more you let go of doing a


---------95:58----------
good job like sure you have to account


---------95:59----------
you can't like


---------96:00----------
show up on twitch and like you know drop


---------96:02----------
n bombs or like say like really like of


---------96:04----------
course you're going to get cancelled


---------96:05----------
but like the strategic thinking around


---------96:07----------
avoiding getting cancelled


---------96:09----------
and the fear of getting canceled


---------96:12----------
controlling your decisions


---------96:14----------
and like letting that desperation drive


---------96:16----------
you is not going to lead to like


---------96:18----------
contentment happiness and living in the


---------96:19----------
present it's going to lead to the rat


---------96:22----------
race


---------96:24----------
rat race like


---------96:27----------
it's gonna read lead to this idea of


---------96:29----------
like you know constantly on the move


---------96:31----------
always got to be grinding fast forward


---------96:34----------
yeah that's me right


---------96:38----------
and so yeah i mean i think you just


---------96:40----------
really got to be careful about that


---------96:41----------
decision-making process and like ask


---------96:43----------
yourself


---------96:44----------
when am i giving in to fear like is this


---------96:47----------
decision


---------96:48----------
strategic or fearful and there's always


---------96:50----------
going to be a good reason


---------96:52----------
to take those calls right and so just


---------96:55----------
think a little bit about like try to


---------96:56----------
block off one time where there's like no


---------96:58----------
stuff during that time


---------97:00----------
and then you're going to want to move it


---------97:01----------
around and someone's going to be like


---------97:03----------
can you do this and they're like yeah oh


---------97:04----------
i can do that yeah absolutely


---------97:07----------
and then just be aware like no this is


---------97:09----------
my time and you're gonna have to do


---------97:10----------
things that can are gonna feel stupid to


---------97:12----------
you


---------97:13----------
like it's gonna feel dumb like i'm gonna


---------97:15----------
miss out on this opportunity yeah


---------97:16----------
you're gonna miss out on the opportunity


---------97:18----------
absolutely that's the point you need to


---------97:20----------
learn how to miss out on opportunities


---------97:23----------
yeah and then you'll be able to be in


---------97:25----------
the present


---------97:26----------
and during that time of nothingness like


---------97:30----------
is there something i should do god


---------97:32----------
that's a terrible question


---------97:35----------
you're learning you see


---------97:39----------
you see you see how like how calcified


---------97:42----------
it is


---------97:43----------
yeah it's my first thought like what do


---------97:45----------
i do during that time


---------97:47----------
of nothing um yeah


---------97:51----------
dr k how can i make the how can i make


---------97:53----------
the most productive use of my


---------97:55----------
nothingness time


---------97:57----------
how do i be the most efficient is there


---------97:59----------
a practice can i meditate a particular


---------98:01----------
way yes yes


---------98:03----------
so notice the absurdity of it right it's


---------98:05----------
like what


---------98:10----------
how do i have the most fun during my


---------98:12----------
relaxation time


---------98:13----------
yes ah it's ingrained it is


---------98:16----------
absolutely right so that's how our mind


---------98:18----------
works it's ingrained


---------98:20----------
the good news is that every time you


---------98:21----------
notice it foosley it gets less ingrained


---------98:26----------
yeah so noticing actually chips away at


---------98:28----------
it and then i will give you a practice


---------98:30----------
so let me just think about that unless


---------98:32----------
you have other questions


---------98:34----------
no that was very helpful like that just


---------98:37----------
that


---------98:38----------
yeah yeah good


---------98:41----------
right so so like here's the cool thing


---------98:44----------
is that


---------98:45----------
when you made that realization you


---------98:47----------
weren't


---------98:48----------
oh right you were like


---------98:52----------
lol that's what it is


---------98:55----------
it's like it's like a realization that's


---------98:56----------
actually calm the harder you try like


---------98:58----------
you weren't actually paying attention


---------99:01----------
you caught it you didn't hunt it does


---------99:04----------
that make sense


---------99:05----------
at that moment and so that's what


---------99:07----------
happens those moments of realization are


---------99:08----------
not


---------99:09----------
hunted they're discovered and there's a


---------99:12----------
big difference one is doing one is being


---------99:16----------
i'm just scared that like i mean i have


---------99:18----------
to cut like it's very easy for me to


---------99:20----------
fall back into that like i need


---------99:22----------
sure you in my head to remind me


---------99:26----------
you know yeah yeah so so this is where


---------99:29----------
foosley no you don't


---------99:31----------
you don't need me because it's okay to


---------99:34----------
fall back into it


---------99:37----------
that's you see how like it's okay to


---------99:39----------
fall like you're gonna fall


---------99:40----------
so be it you don't need to be perfect


---------99:44----------
that's like a slightly different thing


---------99:45----------
but it's kind of the same thing where


---------99:46----------
you don't need me you're fine just the


---------99:48----------
way you are


---------99:49----------
you caught it like i didn't point it out


---------99:50----------
to you you caught it yourself


---------99:52----------
have faith right you'll catch it


---------99:57----------
true okay so meditation


---------100:03----------
okay so i'm gonna teach you a technique


---------100:05----------
that is a little bit


---------100:07----------
um has two parts so one part i'm happy


---------100:11----------
to teach


---------100:11----------
um today and then if you do this


---------100:14----------
technique for some amount of time and we


---------100:15----------
do meet at a convention i will teach you


---------100:17----------
part two but part two really shouldn't


---------100:19----------
be talked publicly


---------100:20----------
it's not like shady or anything but um


---------100:23----------
it you know other humans can be in the


---------100:24----------
room it's not


---------100:25----------
but but it is it is something that's


---------100:27----------
like a little bit more


---------100:28----------
so there are some cases of


---------100:29----------
meditation-induced psychosis


---------100:32----------
and meditation is not without risks so


---------100:35----------
this is a technique


---------100:36----------
that like sometimes like needs to be


---------100:37----------
taught like when people are ready for it


---------100:39----------
so i won't like teach it publicly


---------100:42----------
oh okay it does it doesn't have to be


---------100:44----------
like late at night or like other humans


---------100:45----------
can be in the room i just don't want to


---------100:46----------
teach it on stream or even i can teach


---------100:48----------
you privately in a call


---------100:49----------
in a video call um but there's sort of a


---------100:52----------
phase one and there's a phase two okay


---------100:53----------
because phase two is like really intense


---------100:56----------
um but phase one is gonna be uh a


---------100:59----------
technique called thrataka which i think


---------101:00----------
would be a good fit for you so trotaka's


---------101:02----------
fixed point gazing


---------101:04----------
so here are the reasons that i think


---------101:05----------
it'll be good for you first is that


---------101:06----------
technically it's a should be technique


---------101:08----------
it's a cleansing technique even though


---------101:10----------
we teach it as meditation


---------101:12----------
what it actually does is sort of cleanse


---------101:14----------
your mind that's the mechanism through


---------101:16----------
which it works


---------101:17----------
antarctica is fixed point gazing so what


---------101:19----------
we're going to do is teach you to stare


---------101:21----------
at like one point and like just stare at


---------101:24----------
it without closing your eyes


---------101:26----------
and then the reason the long-term reason


---------101:27----------
i'm sort of picking this a couple of


---------101:29----------
other things from a temperamental


---------101:30----------
standpoint


---------101:31----------
one is that it sounds like you're


---------101:32----------
actually good at focusing your attention


---------101:35----------
like you practice you practice this


---------101:37----------
sounds like every night before you go to


---------101:38----------
bed


---------101:39----------
so this is going to be practicing your


---------101:40----------
attention in a slightly different way


---------101:43----------
it's a hard technique to teach people


---------101:44----------
like usually for introductions i'll


---------101:46----------
teach like breathing stuff because


---------101:47----------
breathing is easy


---------101:48----------
it's a little bit more hardcore it's a


---------101:49----------
little bit more okay


---------101:51----------
which you're so good at and the second


---------101:53----------
thing is the second phase of this


---------101:55----------
technique


---------101:55----------
will start to help you work on that fear


---------101:57----------
of death


---------102:00----------
okay so that's why i want to kind of


---------102:02----------
teach you this so what i'm gonna do


---------102:04----------
is pull something up okay


---------102:08----------
okay sorry for you know if i was


---------102:11----------
creeping you out with all the has to be


---------102:12----------
taught in private no


---------102:14----------
no i i didn't think it was i just was


---------102:16----------
like what what could be


---------102:17----------
yet to go like i don't know i just i was


---------102:21----------
just


---------102:21----------
yeah not creeped out


---------102:24----------
let me ask you something um


---------102:28----------
what do you want in your life i know


---------102:31----------
it's kind of a broad question


---------102:34----------
what do you want i want


---------102:40----------
um


---------102:45----------
like can i just list off a bunch of


---------102:47----------
things that i want yes go for it

---------102:54----------

---------103:02----------
be present and yeah and


---------103:06----------
um to be secure


---------103:12----------
in like financially but also just myself


---------103:15----------
to accept myself um


---------103:20----------
if i had to give you a choice between


---------103:22----------
power wisdom and happiness which one


---------103:24----------
would you pick


---------103:25----------
happiness okay


---------103:29----------
perfect


---------103:33----------
alright so this is what we're gonna do


---------103:38----------
i'm going to show you i'm going to


---------103:40----------
screen share something with you okay


---------103:45----------
uh how am i going to do this we're going


---------103:47----------
to do see if this works


---------103:49----------
nope so we're not gonna see your


---------103:53----------

---------103:55----------

---------103:57----------

---------104:22----------
focus your eyes on the red dot in the


---------104:24----------
center


---------104:25----------
do you see the red dot in the center yep


---------104:28----------
okay


---------104:28----------
so i'll explain the practice first so


---------104:30----------
what we're going to do is try to look at


---------104:32----------
the red dot in the center without


---------104:33----------
blinking


---------104:34----------
and then what i'm going to have you do


---------104:36----------
is rotate your attention to different


---------104:38----------
things


---------104:39----------
so i'll ask you like what colors you see


---------104:42----------
in particular places but i don't want


---------104:46----------
you to change where your eyes are


---------104:47----------
looking


---------104:48----------
i want you to keep your eyes focused on


---------104:50----------
the red dot but then kind of answer my


---------104:52----------
questions


---------104:53----------
okay okay so a couple of things about


---------104:57----------
thratika so


---------104:58----------
you know there's going to be a little


---------104:59----------
bit of a strain on the eyes if it starts


---------105:02----------
to get like really unbearable you can go


---------105:04----------
ahead and close them


---------105:05----------
but we're gonna do our best not to blink


---------105:08----------
and not to close our eyes


---------105:09----------
okay we're gonna try to not blink for


---------105:11----------
about 60 seconds to begin with


---------105:14----------
you may end up blinking which is okay


---------105:15----------
you can do a quick blink and then open


---------105:17----------
them again and then keep looking


---------105:19----------
okay okay so start by closing your eyes


---------105:23----------
sitting up straight and take a deep


---------105:28----------
breath


---------105:34----------
and another


---------105:42----------
just take a moment just keep breathing


---------105:44----------
deeply take a moment to just sort of


---------105:46----------
notice


---------105:47----------
that the conversation has been pretty


---------105:49----------
animated


---------105:51----------
we've talked about a lot of stuff maybe


---------105:53----------
there's a lot to think about


---------105:54----------
whatever notice just all those kind of


---------105:57----------
thoughts


---------105:57----------
all these desires goals whatever just


---------106:00----------
kind of notice the energy of the


---------106:01----------
conversation


---------106:03----------
and that now we're going to kind of


---------106:04----------
recalibrate and just for


---------106:06----------
a few moments we're going to be


---------106:08----------
completely encompassed by our practice


---------106:12----------
and that the stream and the rest of the


---------106:14----------
world will kind of continue


---------106:15----------
onward outside of our bubble but that


---------106:18----------
for a few moments like 60 seconds 90


---------106:20----------
seconds


---------106:21----------
maybe two or three minutes we're just


---------106:22----------
going to try to be at this inside this


---------106:24----------
bubble


---------106:27----------
and now when you're ready open your eyes


---------106:29----------
and then stare at the red dot


---------106:35----------
are you looking yes so now what i want


---------106:39----------
you to do


---------106:40----------
is tell me while you're staring at the


---------106:41----------
red dot what is the outermost color


---------106:44----------
of the image um


---------106:48----------
yellow okay and what is the next color


---------106:51----------
inside the yellow green


---------106:55----------
and then inside that


---------106:59----------
yellow and inside that


---------107:04----------
blue and inside that


---------107:07----------
yellow and inside that


---------107:11----------
um yellow okay so now what i want you to


---------107:14----------
do is go


---------107:15----------
all the way look at each color put your


---------107:17----------
attention on each color on your own just


---------107:19----------
like i'm asking you


---------107:22----------
and notice the color and then move in


---------107:24----------
and move in


---------107:26----------
and move in at your own pace and try to


---------107:29----------
keep


---------107:29----------
all of your kind of like keep your eyes


---------107:31----------
focused on the dot and let your


---------107:33----------
concentration collapse inward towards


---------107:36----------
the dot


---------107:36----------
one layer at a time


---------107:42----------
this is very difficult yes it is so move


---------107:50----------
at your own pace it's okay


---------107:53----------
[Music]


---------108:03----------
it's really hard i can't do this so so


---------108:06----------
then go


---------108:06----------
close okay closer to the screen no no no


---------108:10----------
no just look at the red dot


---------108:11----------
just okay put all of your attention now


---------108:14----------
on the red dot


---------108:16----------
okay okay just stare at the red dot


---------108:20----------
and then look at the color that is


---------108:23----------
closest to the red dot what do you see


---------108:26----------
yellow


---------108:27----------
and what's the color outside of that


---------108:29----------
green


---------108:30----------
and then black and then


---------108:35----------
red and then


---------108:38----------
blue now go back in


---------108:42----------
um red


---------108:48----------
black


---------108:52----------
green


---------108:56----------
yellow red and now let yourself just


---------108:59----------
rest on the red


---------109:03----------
just focus fully drive your attention


---------109:06----------
towards it


---------109:17----------
focus on it do your best not to blink


---------109:20----------
we're gonna try to go for 10 more


---------109:22----------
seconds


---------109:27----------
and now close your eyes


---------109:31----------
and what i want you to do is notice the


---------109:33----------
after image


---------109:36----------
do you see the after image yes


---------109:40----------
just look at it


---------109:53----------
just let yourself see what's there


---------109:58----------
let your breathing relax


---------110:02----------
and we'll just meditate silently and you


---------110:04----------
can just focus on the image for about


---------110:06----------
another minute


---------110:22----------
yes


---------110:36----------
you may start to notice it kind of


---------110:38----------
fading away no problem


---------110:44----------
let it go


---------110:48----------
see if you can find it


---------110:51----------
if you can't focus on your breathing


---------111:03----------
it's not so much about finding or


---------111:05----------
holding as it is waiting for it to


---------111:18----------
appear foreign


---------111:36----------
and now we're going to take three deep


---------111:37----------
breaths


---------111:39----------
breathe in for three seconds


---------111:44----------
and out for three seconds


---------111:50----------
in for three and out for five


---------112:02----------
and in for three and out for seven


---------112:08----------
nice slow exhalation


---------112:15----------
as you finish your breath put your palms


---------112:17----------
together in front of you


---------112:21----------
rub them together


---------112:24----------
and then cup your hands your palms over


---------112:26----------
your eyes


---------112:28----------
and while your palms are over your eyes


---------112:30----------
go ahead and open


---------112:33----------
and then let your hands come down


---------112:44----------
how are you feeling


---------112:48----------
yeah that was hard


---------112:51----------
that was hard um i wasn't sure what to


---------112:55----------
expect from that


---------112:56----------
the picture so i thought


---------113:00----------
in the beginning i thought that i didn't


---------113:02----------
like it the colors all start to


---------113:04----------
turn to gray so i was like oh oh like i


---------113:08----------
thought well in my mind i


---------113:09----------
have it's like my eyes i was wondering


---------113:11----------
if there's something wrong with my eyes


---------113:12----------
so i was like trying to blink to clear


---------113:15----------
it but


---------113:16----------
it would work but i realized after i


---------113:18----------
realized that


---------113:19----------
i'm sort of supposed to struggle there


---------113:21----------
um


---------113:22----------
then i was able to let that go


---------113:25----------
and focus more um after closing my eyes


---------113:30----------
the the image was very vivid and i could


---------113:33----------
point out every color backwards


---------113:36----------
um or like they weren't the same colors


---------113:38----------
but i could point out the negatives i


---------113:40----------
suppose and then um


---------113:41----------
like clear as day and then as i


---------113:44----------
struggled to see it more it would fade


---------113:46----------
and when i'd relax it would show up


---------113:48----------
again


---------113:48----------
and so it was kind of like the more i


---------113:50----------
wanted it the less i could have it


---------113:52----------
and then if i just yeah


---------113:58----------
perfect so this is a technique


---------114:02----------
to train you to learn how to find what


---------114:05----------
you're looking for


---------114:07----------
by not looking right


---------114:10----------
so do this technique


---------114:14----------
and like yeah that's what we're looking


---------114:16----------
for


---------114:18----------
right because you'll begin like


---------114:20----------
literally your brain will learn


---------114:22----------
how to like let go and like let things


---------114:25----------
come


---------114:27----------
right and the last thing i'll leave you


---------114:29----------
with foosley


---------114:31----------
you are where you are because of your


---------114:33----------
hard work


---------114:34----------
but you're really where you are because


---------114:37----------
you let


---------114:38----------
things come


---------114:41----------
right like i don't know if you went out


---------114:43----------
and hunted for edison


---------114:46----------
you know but not at all


---------114:56----------
you let him come oh god


---------115:00----------
i wasn't thinking like i wasn't thinking


---------115:04----------
like that no i didn't know it's like


---------115:05----------
it's like that you like you know


---------115:07----------
you can't like as i was doing the yoga


---------115:09----------
talk i was doing the yoga talk you can't


---------115:11----------
blame me for it


---------115:12----------
it's the natural thing to say yes it is


---------115:15----------
it is no and i was thinking about it


---------115:16----------
that way that i was


---------115:18----------
thinking about it in the other way and


---------115:19----------
then and then i would guess


---------115:21----------
yeah no but really right like i mean


---------115:24----------
like you


---------115:24----------
like you allow things to


---------115:28----------
i can't i can't yes you know what i mean


---------115:30----------
yes yes it is


---------115:32----------
i went i didn't go looking for him at


---------115:34----------
all right stumble that's a good word


---------115:37----------
yes right like so you just let him


---------115:38----------
stumble into your life


---------115:40----------
and like that's you like like life is


---------115:42----------
like just let it stumble into you you


---------115:44----------
know


---------115:44----------
you don't need to go looking for it so


---------115:46----------
hard


---------115:48----------
fantastic so do this practice i'd say


---------115:50----------
you know start with 60 seconds you can


---------115:52----------
work your way up to like three minutes


---------115:54----------
five minutes


---------115:55----------
if you want an alternative you can also


---------115:57----------
look at a candle flame


---------115:59----------
and and if you look at a candle flame


---------116:01----------
like what you can do is like


---------116:02----------
you know you can just see the colors in


---------116:04----------
the room and then work your way in


---------116:06----------
and so oddly enough really foosley it's


---------116:08----------
not about


---------116:09----------
getting it right like that's the other


---------116:11----------
thing that you can learn to let go of


---------116:13----------
just like you did like


---------116:14----------
know what you know it's not great


---------116:16----------
there's no grades


---------116:17----------
what you're really practicing is just


---------116:20----------
the struggle of attention and then


---------116:21----------
letting go


---------116:23----------
right so it's not actually about the


---------116:26----------
colors


---------116:28----------
is are you gonna send the photo yeah


---------116:30----------
i'll i'll send you


---------116:31----------

---------116:33----------
i will send you a photo


---------116:34----------

---------116:36----------
is i would recommend that you print it


---------116:38----------
out


---------116:39----------
or you can like order them on amazon or


---------116:40----------
something so ideally you're not looking


---------116:43----------
at a screen because that does all kinds


---------116:44----------
of other things to your brain but i'll


---------116:46----------
