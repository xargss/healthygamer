---------00:00----------
and we had another question from Lula is


---------00:02----------
your experience in your experience what


---------00:04----------
are common problems that eSports


---------00:06----------
athletes tend to have okay so you know


---------00:10----------
on stream I work a fair amount with


---------00:13----------
these sports athletes and there are a


---------00:14----------
ton of them to be short I think the one


---------00:17----------
that I've been thinking about the most


---------00:19----------
recently is actually so I think a lot of


---------00:24----------
so one huge problem is that eSports


---------00:29----------
doesn't have a physical limitation so


---------00:32----------
what happens is like if you look at like


---------00:33----------
a professional athlete lately and say


---------00:35----------
like an NFL player or like a base of


---------00:37----------
baseball player or soccer player or


---------00:39----------
something you know you can't you can't


---------00:41----------
practice football for like more than six


---------00:44----------
hours a day so I've also worked with


---------00:46----------
like NFL athletes and things like that


---------00:48----------
and their training regimen is like you


---------00:49----------
know somewhere between four and eight


---------00:51----------
hours a day because there's just


---------00:52----------
physical limitations of the human body


---------00:54----------
with eSports athletes there isn't that


---------00:57----------
limitation so another thing is I think


---------01:00----------
that eighteen year olds are just not


---------01:02----------
like cognitively prepared for this


---------01:04----------
degree of stress so a lot of times so


---------01:07----------
that's another big thing that that they


---------01:09----------
face is that you know you think about it


---------01:11----------
like you're in high school right and


---------01:12----------
you're streaming a lot or you're playing


---------01:14----------
a lot of overwatch and like that's


---------01:16----------
working great but then suddenly you're


---------01:18----------
in this like incident one of the things


---------01:20----------
that happens is when you're streaming


---------01:22----------
and before you get a pro contract you're


---------01:25----------
like one of the best alright so you're


---------01:27----------
kind of the best of the best and that's


---------01:29----------
what gets you the pro contract and then


---------01:31----------
once you enter the actual league then


---------01:33----------
suddenly your average or even below


---------01:36----------
average and so a lot of these it's a


---------01:38----------
huge psychological blow to be someone


---------01:41----------
who is the best and then suddenly be


---------01:43----------
lumped into people who are in like the


---------01:45----------
average or below average


---------01:47----------
and that psychological blow is really


---------01:49----------
hard to get over the funny thing is I


---------01:51----------
had a buddy who went to Harvard Law


---------01:52----------
School and I asked him after his first


---------01:54----------
year like how's law school going and he


---------01:56----------
said it's like it's actually kind of


---------01:57----------
sucks I asked him like well why does it


---------02:00----------
suck and he says one of the cruelest


---------02:01----------
things you can do is to take a bunch of


---------02:04----------
people who think that they're


---------02:06----------
exceptional and make them average and


---------02:07----------
when you do that to people they become


---------02:09----------
nasty and so I think eSports it's hard


---------02:13----------
to be you know it's cool like you think


---------02:15----------
about like Oh being an eSports athlete


---------02:16----------
like it's awesome and in a lot of ways


---------02:18----------
it is but it's really hard


---------02:19----------
psychologically the other thing that


---------02:21----------
happens is that there's a lot of stress


---------02:23----------
around job security because no one


---------02:24----------
really knows like you know um so I do


---------02:27----------
people know about you know okay so


---------02:30----------
kangaroo had the I had the option to go


---------02:33----------
pro after college and League of Legends


---------02:36----------
and at the same time I also had an offer


---------02:40----------
for better than school so I turned on


---------02:43----------
the contract to go pro and went to


---------02:44----------
medical school instead yeah so I think a


---------02:47----------
lot of people are concerned about job


---------02:48----------
security right so this is especially


---------02:50----------
true for the pro players that I work


---------02:53----------
with that are a little bit older like


---------02:54----------
once you hit 20 to 23 you know like


---------02:57----------
after you like if you get kicked from


---------02:59----------
your team then like what do you do can


---------03:02----------
you find a job like how does that work


---------03:03----------
so it you know it's an emerging field


---------03:05----------
there's a lot of stress there's a lot of


---------03:07----------
uncertainty about job security which can


---------03:09----------
be pretty stressful


---------03:10----------
what about self-imposed burnout who


---------03:13----------
possess him it seems that a lot of times


---------03:15----------
not just the teams that said the


---------03:17----------
schedule but the players themselves seem


---------03:19----------
to burn themselves out yes that was


---------03:20----------
actually a great question because I was


---------03:22----------
about to segue into that I think this is


---------03:24----------
also something that I see with streamers


---------03:26----------
right yeah this is not necesary pro


---------03:28----------
players but the other thing that's


---------03:30----------
happening is like people push themselves


---------03:32----------
and if you become a streamer there are


---------03:34----------
all kinds of like psychological weights


---------03:36----------
that get put on you because when you


---------03:38----------
when you become a streamer or even if


---------03:40----------
you become like a pro eSports


---------03:41----------
athlete you kind of start to become


---------03:44----------
someone that you're not and maintaining


---------03:47----------
being someone that you normally aren't


---------03:49----------
because before you go pro you really


---------03:52----------
loved to play the game and that's the


---------03:53----------
reason that you were playing the game


---------03:55----------
but let's say a year after you go pro


---------03:57----------
you know you're playing overwatch now


---------03:59----------
you've been playing overwatch for like


---------04:00----------
two and a half years and maybe you want


---------04:03----------
to stop playing over because if you


---------04:05----------
think about most gamers like what do you


---------04:07----------
guys do when you want to stop playing


---------04:09----------
the game you stop playing a game but in


---------04:12----------
this case you kind of can't your tracked


---------04:14----------
you're stuck and when I work with


---------04:16----------
streamers like that's also a big problem


---------04:18----------
is that they have invested so much and


---------04:20----------
building their stream that they feel


---------04:22----------
like they have to be this personality


---------04:23----------
and they can't actually be themselves


---------04:25----------
because if you start changing the


---------04:28----------
content of your stream your viewers may


---------04:30----------
leave yeah and you start to build up an


---------04:32----------
identity that you feel like you have to


---------04:34----------
maintain and that identity becomes like


---------04:36----------
a house of cards and then people just


---------04:38----------
they just burn out they just can't


---------04:40----------
handle it
