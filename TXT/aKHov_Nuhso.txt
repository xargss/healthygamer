---------00:00----------
and so today i wanted to talk to you


---------00:02----------
guys a little bit about


---------00:02----------
conscientiousness


---------00:04----------
and so um i know this is kind of weird


---------00:06----------
but like i got this question a year ago


---------00:08----------
like literally like


---------00:10----------
a year ago or maybe even over a year ago


---------00:13----------
and um i i know this sounds bizarre but


---------00:16----------
i actually did not have an answer so


---------00:18----------
people


---------00:19----------
kept on asking me like how do i improve


---------00:20----------
my conscientiousness


---------00:22----------
so i've been working on it for like a


---------00:23----------
year and trying to figure out like


---------00:25----------
reading papers on on personality


---------00:27----------
assessment you know like reading


---------00:28----------
some of these old texts on yoga um


---------00:32----------
and things like that so in trying to


---------00:33----------
figure out like okay how can we improve


---------00:35----------
conscientiousness is there a way to do


---------00:37----------
it


---------00:37----------
so came up with a couple of theories and


---------00:39----------
then tried to test them out with a


---------00:41----------
couple of people over the last


---------00:42----------
few years what does it mean i know we'll


---------00:45----------
we'll um


---------00:46----------
uh we'll get into i'll explain what all


---------00:48----------
that is and so then tested it with a few


---------00:50----------
people and it turns out that it actually


---------00:51----------
does kind of work


---------00:52----------
at least anecdotally so that's what i


---------00:55----------
want to kind of talk to you guys about


---------00:56----------
today


---------00:58----------
so this is going to be we're going to


---------00:59----------
use um you know like


---------01:01----------
i'm going to draw a little bit so let's


---------01:03----------
kind of dive in


---------01:05----------
okay so the first thing to understand is


---------01:08----------
that


---------01:09----------
um so when we look at different kinds of


---------01:11----------
different people


---------01:12----------
we have different personalities or


---------01:14----------
different kind of cognitive traits or


---------01:15----------
styles


---------01:16----------
and in the east we look at systems like


---------01:18----------
ayurveda or traditional chinese medicine


---------01:21----------
which will use elements


---------01:22----------
to describe what kind of person someone


---------01:24----------
is um so they'll say that like for


---------01:27----------
example


---------01:27----------
a vata person is like a wind type and so


---------01:30----------
their mind is like the wind so it


---------01:32----------
it blows hard in one direction and then


---------01:33----------
like changes direction easily


---------01:35----------
so vatas are people who get bored who's


---------01:37----------
easily pick things up very quickly


---------01:40----------
they can be very passionate about things


---------01:41----------
for like 15 minutes and then it kind of


---------01:43----------
like


---------01:44----------
you know isn't stable isn't consistent


---------01:46----------
so that's where the eastern system


---------01:48----------
in the western system there's one really


---------01:50----------
good uh


---------01:52----------
validated model of personality and that


---------01:55----------
is the five


---------01:55----------
factor model and so the five factor


---------01:58----------
model basically


---------02:01----------
studied people's personalities and what


---------02:03----------
they found using a technique called


---------02:04----------
factor analysis


---------02:06----------
is that personality tends to cluster in


---------02:09----------
five different


---------02:10----------
groups okay so these groups are


---------02:12----------
extraversion


---------02:14----------
openness agreeableness conscientiousness


---------02:17----------
and neuroticism


---------02:18----------
and so what do these five factors mean


---------02:20----------
so extroversion


---------02:22----------
is like how extroverted or introverted


---------02:25----------
you are


---------02:26----------
um so people who have high extraversion


---------02:28----------
like tend to get


---------02:29----------
relaxed with other people they draw


---------02:31----------
energy from other people


---------02:32----------
people who have low extroversion prefer


---------02:34----------
to be like by themselves


---------02:36----------
um it doesn't necessarily have anything


---------02:38----------
to do with how many friends you make or


---------02:39----------
how charismatic you are it's just sort


---------02:40----------
of


---------02:41----------
you know what you prefer so openness is


---------02:44----------
like is a tendency to like


---------02:46----------
openness new experiences so you tend to


---------02:48----------
be like open-minded


---------02:50----------
as opposed to like a little bit more


---------02:51----------
traditional


---------02:53----------
agreeableness is like how likely you are


---------02:55----------
to get along with other people and like


---------02:57----------
kind of


---------02:58----------
be malleable or flexible with your


---------03:00----------
thinking


---------03:01----------
it doesn't mean that you're nice or mean


---------03:03----------
it just means that like you kind of


---------03:06----------
you know are pretty like open mind uh


---------03:08----------
you're willing to sort of


---------03:10----------
change your views to accommodate others


---------03:12----------
um


---------03:13----------
and then we get to conscientiousness so


---------03:15----------
this is kind of a big thing in the


---------03:17----------
gaming community because people who like


---------03:19----------
so this is a cool thing about the gaming


---------03:20----------
community is that a lot of people


---------03:21----------
nowadays who like read the internet


---------03:23----------
are actually like amateur psychologists


---------03:25----------
which i think is fantastic so you guys


---------03:27----------
you know do


---------03:27----------
a lot of research you guys read a lot of


---------03:29----------
stuff on the internet you watch


---------03:30----------
educational videos and then one of the


---------03:32----------
things that comes up is this trait of


---------03:34----------
conscientiousness so conscientiousness


---------03:36----------
is your ability to sort of


---------03:37----------
focus on a task for extended periods of


---------03:40----------
time


---------03:41----------
um it also governs things like impulse


---------03:43----------
control so people with low


---------03:44----------
conscientiousness tend to be impulsive


---------03:46----------
and have trouble with follow-through


---------03:47----------
whereas people with high


---------03:48----------
conscientiousness tend to be um


---------03:51----------
you know like disciplined organized and


---------03:54----------
will follow through


---------03:56----------
and so um one of the interesting things


---------03:59----------
is that like people tend to think that


---------04:01----------
certain


---------04:01----------
attributes of uh you know certain


---------04:03----------
attributes are better than others


---------04:06----------
so generally speaking a lot of like the


---------04:07----------
gaming community feels like they have


---------04:09----------
low conscientiousness and therefore they


---------04:11----------
like


---------04:12----------
lost the lottery right so if you're kind


---------04:14----------
of born or nurtured in


---------04:15----------
in a way where your personality forms


---------04:17----------
with high conscientiousness


---------04:19----------
you're actually okay doing things like


---------04:21----------
delaying gratification working hard


---------04:23----------
working towards a goal and following


---------04:25----------
through and then there's


---------04:26----------
us who's like well we don't we're not


---------04:29----------
good at that i'm kind of lazy i'm


---------04:31----------
undisciplined


---------04:32----------
and so people ask me the question is we


---------04:34----------
were you know talking about the five


---------04:35----------
factors like how do i


---------04:36----------
increase my conscientiousness so that's


---------04:38----------
when what today's lecture is going to be


---------04:40----------
about


---------04:42----------
and the last uh attribute is actually


---------04:44----------
neuroticism which is your tendency to


---------04:46----------
worry so people may think that


---------04:48----------
neuroticism which is like


---------04:50----------
your tendency to like suffer up here is


---------04:52----------
a bad thing


---------04:53----------
and it certainly causes suffering but


---------04:55----------
there are a lot of things that show that


---------04:56----------
neuroticism is actually an adaptive


---------04:58----------
trait


---------04:59----------
so people with super low neuroticism are


---------05:01----------
what i think of as like the classic


---------05:02----------
pothead


---------05:03----------
like sit around all day do nothing like


---------05:06----------
not really worry about anything like


---------05:08----------
they don't get worried about stuff


---------05:09----------
they're just super chill


---------05:10----------
and so as a result they don't get


---------05:12----------
motivated to do things because


---------05:14----------
you know they don't really care about


---------05:15----------
the consequences


---------05:17----------
and um so for example doctors or


---------05:20----------
actually medical students


---------05:21----------
is a better way to put it tests very


---------05:22----------
high in neuroticism and hit very high in


---------05:24----------
conscientiousness


---------05:26----------
and the reason for that is because like


---------05:27----------
they were the kids that were worried


---------05:29----------
about getting a b


---------05:30----------
on a test when they were in college


---------05:32----------
which pushed them to study like on


---------05:34----------
friday nights


---------05:35----------
instead of going to parties and they're


---------05:37----------
also kind of hard working so like


---------05:39----------
that combination of traits is what sort


---------05:42----------
of allows people to like


---------05:43----------
be successful medical students or get


---------05:45----------
into medical school


---------05:47----------
so it's not like high neuroticism is


---------05:49----------
better than low neuroticism and oddly


---------05:51----------
enough it's not like


---------05:52----------
low conscientiousness is better than


---------05:53----------
high conscientiousness


---------05:55----------
but in our society we tend to select


---------05:58----------
or reward people who have high


---------06:00----------
conscientiousness


---------06:02----------
so that gets to the crux of today's


---------06:04----------
lecture which is that if i have low


---------06:06----------
conscientiousness


---------06:07----------
am i sol am i screwed


---------06:11----------
or is there something that i can do to


---------06:13----------
boost conscientiousness


---------06:15----------
and so people basically think if i have


---------06:17----------
low conscientiousness like


---------06:19----------
you know i drew the short straw in life


---------06:22----------
what can i do about it


---------06:23----------
so it took me a little while um


---------06:27----------
but it actually turns out that you can


---------06:28----------
improve conscientiousness


---------06:30----------
or at least i think so and here's the


---------06:32----------
best way that i've been able to kind of


---------06:34----------
figure out how


---------06:35----------
okay so let's start by thinking about


---------06:38----------
what actually happens in the mindset of


---------06:40----------
someone who has low conscientiousness


---------06:41----------
okay


---------06:43----------
so um when we're thinking about like


---------06:46----------
conscientiousness like


---------06:47----------
oh sorry yes let's think about low


---------06:49----------
versus high conscientiousness


---------06:50----------
so let's say that like it's a wednesday


---------06:53----------
afternoon and i'm done with my classes


---------06:55----------
and i've got two choices


---------06:56----------
i can play apex legends or


---------07:00----------
i can study for my like test next


---------07:03----------
tuesday


---------07:04----------
right and so in the mind of someone who


---------07:05----------
has high conscientiousness it's a little


---------07:07----------
bit easier


---------07:08----------
for them to study instead of like play a


---------07:10----------
game and


---------07:12----------
um if we think about it like i have two


---------07:14----------
impulses right so like one


---------07:16----------
impulse is like what i want to do and


---------07:19----------
one impulse


---------07:20----------
is like what i don't want to do we're


---------07:21----------
not going to say it's good for me or not


---------07:23----------
good for me because the first thing to


---------07:24----------
understand is like


---------07:25----------
the impulses are what's what i want to


---------07:26----------
do and what i don't want to do


---------07:30----------
and so you kind of get distracted um and


---------07:34----------
you end up going towards ipex legends


---------07:35----------
right so if you have high


---------07:36----------
conscientiousness you choose the thing


---------07:37----------
that you don't want to do


---------07:39----------
you have low conscientiousness you


---------07:41----------
basically give in to the thing that you


---------07:42----------
want to do


---------07:43----------
so you have this impulse to play a video


---------07:45----------
game and you give in to it


---------07:46----------
so if we kind of think about it is there


---------07:48----------
any way to train ourselves


---------07:51----------
to do what we don't


---------07:54----------
or not not do what we don't want to do


---------07:57----------
is there any way to train ourselves


---------07:59----------
to avoid doing the thing that we want to


---------08:01----------
do


---------08:02----------
and there's kind of a a subtle answer


---------08:05----------
what we really mean by that is


---------08:06----------
is there anything that i can do that


---------08:09----------
will


---------08:10----------
set myself and what i want aside


---------08:13----------
because that's basically what we're


---------08:14----------
doing right so if i want to play a video


---------08:16----------
game that's like prioritizing me


---------08:18----------
and like can we set that thinking aside


---------08:20----------
in favor of something else


---------08:22----------
how do we train our minds to set aside


---------08:24----------
what we want


---------08:25----------
in favor of like what's good for us and


---------08:28----------
so the subtle thing there


---------08:29----------
is that it's not necessarily a choice


---------08:31----------
between what's


---------08:32----------
good for me and what i want it's just


---------08:35----------
the key act if you look at the cognitive


---------08:37----------
act it's actually setting aside what you


---------08:39----------
want which is the important thing it's


---------08:40----------
the impulse control


---------08:41----------
which is the important thing and so


---------08:43----------
conscientiousness is associated with


---------08:45----------
with higher degrees of impulse control


---------08:47----------
and so the funny thing is that the


---------08:48----------
answer is actually right in the word


---------08:50----------
okay so if we think about


---------08:51----------
conscientiousness what do we when we


---------08:54----------
think about a person who's conscientious


---------08:56----------
what does that mean right so if we think


---------08:59----------
about like what are the different term


---------09:00----------
what are the different ways in which we


---------09:02----------
use that term to describe people


---------09:04----------
so the first okay so people say


---------09:08----------
aware conscious so it's not necessarily


---------09:12----------
conscious


---------09:13----------
right so it's it's like they think about


---------09:15----------
people who are like hard-working


---------09:17----------
but when when she think when we also


---------09:19----------
think about we think about people who


---------09:20----------
are caring like so if we think about a


---------09:21----------
person who's like very conscientious


---------09:23----------
that person is like


---------09:24----------
thoughtful about other people and so the


---------09:27----------
funny thing


---------09:28----------
there's a really simple way to do to


---------09:30----------
boost conscientiousness which is just to


---------09:31----------
be


---------09:32----------
thoughtful for other people or to i know


---------09:34----------
it sounds kind of weird but like to just


---------09:36----------
be a nice person


---------09:37----------
to be a good person to try to put other


---------09:38----------
people first to be selfless


---------09:41----------
and so this is really subtle because if


---------09:43----------
you think about it like when i do


---------09:45----------
something for someone else like let's


---------09:46----------
say i've got like


---------09:48----------
a pizza right and i've got like this a


---------09:50----------
whole pizza to myself


---------09:51----------
and if i think about it i'm sort of like


---------09:53----------
okay well let me think about what i can


---------09:54----------
do for someone else


---------09:56----------
i can eat the whole pizza myself or i


---------09:59----------
can share the pizza with someone else


---------10:01----------
and in that moment i have an impulse


---------10:03----------
let's say it's eat the pizza all by


---------10:04----------
myself


---------10:05----------
and what i'm doing when i when i care


---------10:07----------
about other people in a very like


---------10:08----------
thoughtful and deliberate way


---------10:10----------
is i'm setting aside my own impulses so


---------10:12----------
i want you guys to think


---------10:14----------
about helping other people and how


---------10:16----------
helping other people


---------10:17----------
almost certainly comes at a cost to


---------10:19----------
yourself


---------10:20----------
right you have to give something up in


---------10:23----------
order to help someone else


---------10:24----------
so if you share something that you have


---------10:25----------
you know you lose half of it if i


---------10:28----------
have a friend who's sick and i make them


---------10:29----------
like you know chicken noodle soup or


---------10:32----------
whatever like


---------10:32----------
lentil stew whatever and i like bring it


---------10:34----------
over there i lose like an hour two of my


---------10:37----------
time i can't play video games during


---------10:38----------
that time


---------10:39----------
i have to go and do something for


---------10:40----------
someone else i essentially expend


---------10:42----------
effort at a cost to myself for the


---------10:44----------
benefit of another person


---------10:46----------
and i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------10:47----------
if you really look at what happens in


---------10:49----------
the mind of someone who helps another


---------10:51----------
person


---------10:52----------
there's a really really key common


---------10:54----------
element


---------10:55----------
which is the avoidance or restraining


---------10:58----------
your impulse to benefit yourself


---------11:00----------
right so if i do anything that's nice


---------11:02----------
for someone else it has to come at a


---------11:04----------
cost to me


---------11:05----------
and that's actually a really wonderful


---------11:06----------
thing because that is what allows us


---------11:09----------
to train conscientiousness okay


---------11:13----------
so let's kind of think about that so


---------11:14----------
then like the tricky thing about the


---------11:16----------
personality models


---------11:17----------
is that um you know people also look at


---------11:20----------
things like empathy right


---------11:21----------
and so they say oh isn't helping other


---------11:24----------
people


---------11:24----------
empathy isn't that what makes you an


---------11:26----------
empathic human being and the short


---------11:28----------
answer is


---------11:29----------
not really and this is why it's a subtle


---------11:31----------
there's a lot of nuance here


---------11:32----------
so empathy is the capacity to feel


---------11:36----------
what someone else is feeling and so


---------11:38----------
people who are naturally


---------11:39----------
empathic naturally like or more helpful


---------11:42----------
towards other people


---------11:43----------
that's not what we're talking about


---------11:45----------
right so what i'm actually talking about


---------11:47----------
the best example of what i'm talking


---------11:49----------
about


---------11:49----------
is the altruistic sociopath so i don't


---------11:52----------
know if you guys know this but


---------11:53----------
sociopathy is another like personality


---------11:55----------
kind of scale it doesn't really fit into


---------11:57----------
the five factor model or


---------11:58----------
it maps onto the five factor model in


---------12:00----------
its own way it's sort of like low


---------12:02----------
agreeableness maybe a certain amount of


---------12:03----------
conscientiousness


---------12:05----------
but the altruistic sociopath is actually


---------12:08----------
like what we're going to look at to


---------12:09----------
understand this


---------12:10----------
so i don't know if you guys know this


---------12:12----------
but there are a lot of people who are


---------12:13----------
like really really good people who are


---------12:15----------
not


---------12:15----------
empathic they just choose to be good


---------12:19----------
people


---------12:20----------
so i've worked with some of these people


---------12:21----------
and a lot of times like the problem with


---------12:23----------
sociopaths is that


---------12:24----------
the ones that get like so if you look at


---------12:26----------
incarceration rates and stuff like that


---------12:28----------
sociopathy is like higher in a prison


---------12:30----------
population but the tricky thing there


---------12:32----------
there's there's some


---------12:33----------
evidence that suggests that like the


---------12:35----------
sociopaths who wind up in prison


---------12:37----------
are the ones that like get caught and


---------12:39----------
aren't actually very good at it


---------12:42----------
um and so they actually may have like a


---------12:44----------
lower iq so so you it is possible to


---------12:46----------
have these like altruistic sociopaths


---------12:48----------
and i


---------12:49----------
see these a lot so i work with a lot of


---------12:50----------
c-suite executives and these people test


---------12:52----------
very highly on the sociopathy scale


---------12:54----------
i myself test highly on the sociopathy


---------12:56----------
scale psychiatrists actually routinely


---------12:59----------
test highly on the sociopathy scale


---------13:00----------
surgeons test highly on the sociopathy


---------13:02----------
scale


---------13:03----------
it's kind of strange right so if you


---------13:04----------
think about what what is it that


---------13:07----------
why are psychiatrists high on the


---------13:08----------
sociopathy scale it's because in a sense


---------13:10----------
we have


---------13:11----------
like a very protective or low level of


---------13:13----------
empathy and what i mean by that is that


---------13:16----------
like


---------13:16----------
when i'm sitting with someone with


---------13:18----------
depression i can't let that person's


---------13:20----------
depression


---------13:21----------
like wash over and affect me i actually


---------13:24----------
need a barrier or it helps


---------13:26----------
if like i can look at their depression


---------13:28----------
like clinically without feeling


---------13:30----------
sad like with them and then feeling like


---------13:32----------
helpless with them


---------13:33----------
so instead of feeling feeling that


---------13:35----------
empathic helplessness it's actually


---------13:36----------
protective for me to like


---------13:38----------
be insulated from that and so if you


---------13:40----------
look at an altruistic sociopath what you


---------13:42----------
see is someone who


---------13:43----------
does a lot of things for other people


---------13:46----------
but


---------13:46----------
also doesn't do it because of empathy


---------13:50----------
so they do it sort of cognitively right


---------13:52----------
so what they do is like eat


---------13:54----------
up here what they say is like they wake


---------13:55----------
up in the morning and they're like okay


---------13:56----------
what can i do


---------13:57----------
oh this will be like something i can do


---------13:58----------
for someone else and like that's a good


---------14:00----------
thing


---------14:01----------
it's not based on a feeling it's sort of


---------14:03----------
based on a cognitive process


---------14:05----------
of choosing to set someone else


---------14:08----------
above you okay and so this is the key


---------14:12----------
thing about boosting conscientiousness


---------14:13----------
is people look at it and they say like


---------14:15----------
okay


---------14:16----------
it's hard for me to train myself to like


---------14:18----------
not watch youtube and study ahead


---------14:20----------
instead i completely agree that's really


---------14:22----------
hard it's like fighting an uphill battle


---------14:24----------
the trick is to use altruism


---------14:28----------
is your tool like that's going to be


---------14:30----------
essentially like the weights that you


---------14:32----------
practice with


---------14:33----------
right so what i want you guys to


---------14:34----------
understand is that if your conscientious


---------14:36----------
is low


---------14:36----------
conscientiousness is low do stuff for


---------14:39----------
other people


---------14:41----------
very simply right so in that process


---------14:43----------
what you're gonna have to do is set


---------14:45----------
aside


---------14:46----------
parts of yourself in favor of other


---------14:48----------
people and by doing that what you're


---------14:50----------
gonna train


---------14:51----------
in your mind is the capacity to set


---------14:54----------
aside what you want


---------14:55----------
and so and the cool thing is if you look


---------14:57----------
at the gaming population like


---------14:58----------
this is actually something that's really


---------15:00----------
awesome about us is that we actually


---------15:02----------
are really good at helping other people


---------15:03----------
like you guys can get off your ass if it


---------15:05----------
involves like doing something


---------15:06----------
substantive for someone else so if we


---------15:08----------
look at that motivational hump


---------15:10----------
that you need to get over to train your


---------15:12----------
conscientiousness


---------15:13----------
once you throw someone else into the


---------15:15----------
picture it actually becomes a lot easier


---------15:18----------
so just to kind of summarize you can


---------15:20----------
absolutely


---------15:22----------
train conscientiousness and the way that


---------15:24----------
you do it is by being


---------15:26----------
a conscientious human being which is to


---------15:28----------
be like


---------15:29----------
nice towards other people and to try to


---------15:30----------
do things for them


---------15:32----------
and the really fascinating thing about


---------15:34----------
this discovery is that this is not like


---------15:36----------
a new idea right so


---------15:37----------
if you really think about it like in the


---------15:40----------
eastern or karmic religions they talk


---------15:42----------
about karma


---------15:43----------
or karma and what they say is like what


---------15:45----------
goes around comes around right so they


---------15:47----------
sort of say that


---------15:48----------
if you do good things for other people


---------15:50----------
like your life will be improved


---------15:52----------
and that's really weird right so like if


---------15:54----------
you want to assume there's some sort of


---------15:56----------
like


---------15:56----------
cosmic principle or god or someone who's


---------15:59----------
like


---------16:00----------
you know using omnipotence to benefit


---------16:03----------
people that they deem to be good


---------16:05----------
that system sort of makes sense but we


---------16:06----------
don't really have any


---------16:08----------
evidence of any of that so let's just


---------16:09----------
scrap all that sort of religious stuff


---------16:12----------
let's try to understand is there like an


---------16:14----------
actual worldly observation


---------16:16----------
that supports this theory of karma which


---------16:19----------
is that like if you do


---------16:20----------
good by other people your life will be


---------16:22----------
improved and the funny thing is that


---------16:24----------
this revelation about conscientiousness


---------16:26----------
is like the perfect


---------16:27----------
link that explains that because what the


---------16:30----------
theory of karma essentially discovered


---------16:32----------
like thousands of years ago


---------16:34----------
was that when i do things for other


---------16:36----------
people i am in training my


---------16:37----------
conscientiousness


---------16:39----------
and by doing things for other people i'm


---------16:41----------
training my mind to be


---------16:43----------
more restrained i'm training my mind to


---------16:46----------
not be a victim to my own desires


---------16:48----------
i'm training my mind to be less


---------16:51----------
impulsive


---------16:52----------
i am being the controller of my mind


---------16:54----------
instead of the mind being the controller


---------16:56----------
of me


---------16:57----------
and what they realize is that the people


---------16:58----------
who consistently do things for other


---------17:00----------
people


---------17:02----------
will i don't know if they put these two


---------17:04----------
pieces together but they made the


---------17:05----------
observation that people who consistently


---------17:06----------
do things for other people


---------17:09----------
their lives start to improve and the


---------17:10----------
reason for that is really simple it's


---------17:12----------
because as you train your


---------17:13----------
conscientiousness


---------17:14----------
like you're able to study more easily


---------17:17----------
you're able to like


---------17:18----------
work harder and clean and be like have


---------17:20----------
better discipline and better follow


---------17:22----------
and then naturally as a consequence of


---------17:25----------
that happening then people like start


---------17:26----------
doing better in their jobs they start


---------17:27----------
doing better in their families they


---------17:29----------
start


---------17:29----------
like they start being more respected


---------17:31----------
like there are a lot of positive things


---------17:32----------
that come out of that


---------17:34----------
and so it's it's really kind of


---------17:36----------
fascinating because like the last thing


---------17:37----------
that i just


---------17:38----------
kind of want to say is that it's


---------17:39----------
interesting that karma is like so you


---------17:41----------
specific


---------17:42----------
and what i mean by that is like how on


---------17:44----------
earth in a cosmic


---------17:45----------
level does me like helping a lady with


---------17:49----------
her groceries


---------17:50----------
improve my life like that doesn't make


---------17:52----------
any sense


---------17:53----------
right there's no like cosmic energy that


---------17:55----------
is going to like wrap around and get to


---------17:57----------
me like we don't have any evidence of


---------17:59----------
that so if we look at it


---------18:00----------
how does the theory of karma work it the


---------18:02----------
only way the theory of karma


---------18:04----------
can work is actually through you because


---------18:06----------
you're the only common element


---------18:08----------
like if i help an old lady over here and


---------18:10----------
then my life gets better over here


---------18:12----------
what's the dot that connects


---------18:14----------
these two things it's you and so the


---------18:17----------
medium


---------18:18----------
of action for karma must be the


---------18:20----------
individual


---------18:22----------
and once we realize that then we realize


---------18:24----------
oh [ __ ] like that makes perfect sense


---------18:25----------
right because


---------18:26----------
now if we look at the the medium of like


---------18:30----------
how we improve our lives through helping


---------18:32----------
others it has to be through us


---------18:34----------
there has to be a change within our


---------18:35----------
brain or body but let's assume brain


---------18:38----------
because that's usually what


---------18:39----------
you know is responsible for stuff so


---------18:41----------
there had you know there has to be a


---------18:42----------
change in your brain


---------18:43----------
that connects helping an old lady with


---------18:46----------
her groceries with like improving your


---------18:47----------
life


---------18:48----------
and i think that missing link is


---------18:50----------
literally this this piece of


---------18:51----------
conscientiousness


---------18:53----------
so it's really fascinating because you


---------18:55----------
know if we look at like how to improve


---------18:57----------
your life


---------18:57----------
we've got this like theory that's


---------18:59----------
thousands of years old


---------19:01----------
which has sort of survived the test of


---------19:03----------
time right so if you think if you look


---------19:05----------
at it


---------19:06----------
like there's a darwinian effect for


---------19:09----------
concepts


---------19:10----------
in human history so the concepts that


---------19:12----------
tend to be like more reliable and


---------19:14----------
successful will be the ones that get


---------19:16----------
propagated through time


---------19:17----------
and the concepts that are like not


---------19:20----------
reliable


---------19:21----------
won't get propagated through time right


---------19:23----------
so if you look at religions for example


---------19:26----------
like horus and zeus aren't like


---------19:29----------
any better than like you know whatever


---------19:32----------
god


---------19:32----------
was around like you know in other


---------19:34----------
cultures so there's like


---------19:36----------
there's a sense that religions will be


---------19:38----------
born and die because


---------19:39----------
those particular like figures won't


---------19:43----------
don't add anything it's some of these


---------19:45----------
core concepts from religion which will


---------19:47----------
actually last through time


---------19:49----------
so the theory of karma has been saying


---------19:51----------
this for thousands of years and what i


---------19:52----------
think is super cool


---------19:53----------
is that now that we understand


---------19:54----------
personality analysis we see this


---------19:56----------
interesting link


---------19:58----------
that okay so the conscientiousness and


---------20:00----------
doing things for other people and


---------20:01----------
improving your own life


---------20:03----------
actually is like kind of explained


---------20:05----------
through our current understanding


---------20:06----------
of like validated science around


---------20:08----------
personality


---------20:10----------
so at the end of the day how do you


---------20:12----------
improve your life


---------20:13----------
how do you improve your


---------20:14----------
conscientiousness how do you become a


---------20:16----------
hard


---------20:17----------
worker when you can't restrain your


---------20:19----------
impulses and you can't do it for


---------20:21----------
yourself


---------20:22----------
you recruit a certain amount of altruism


---------20:24----------
you recruit doing it for someone else


---------20:27----------
and when you do it for someone else


---------20:28----------
literally what you have to do is set


---------20:30----------
aside what you want or things that


---------20:32----------
benefit you


---------20:33----------
are giving in to your impulses for the


---------20:35----------
sake of another human being


---------20:37----------
and the more you do that you train your


---------20:39----------
muscle that sets aside your impulses


---------20:41----------
and the more you train your muscle to


---------20:43----------
set aside your impulses


---------20:45----------
the more conscientious you will become


---------20:47----------
the more conscientious you become


---------20:49----------
the more you will be able to study and


---------20:51----------
like work


---------20:52----------
and read instead of playing video games


---------20:54----------
or watching youtube


---------20:55----------
or netflix or whatever and that's really


---------20:57----------
like it's that simple so i've been


---------20:59----------
you know i put this theory together like


---------21:01----------
about six seven months ago


---------21:03----------
and i've been piloting it with a couple


---------21:05----------
of the clients that i work with and it


---------21:06----------
actually seems to be working pretty well


---------21:08----------
that when people start to put themselves


---------21:10----------
like second instead of putting


---------21:12----------
themselves first


---------21:14----------
in their interpersonal relationships


---------21:16----------
they start to like do things like


---------21:17----------
there's one person i was working with


---------21:19----------
that


---------21:19----------
has a degree and hasn't had a job in


---------21:21----------
eight years so they like finished their


---------21:22----------
degree and they like never got a job


---------21:24----------
and you know for a little while they


---------21:26----------
were just working on repairing their


---------21:27----------
interpersonal relationships and like now


---------21:29----------
they have a job using their degree for


---------21:30----------
the first time


---------21:32----------
and it's like it's night and day for


---------21:34----------
them so here's what i'd say


---------21:36----------
you know hopefully this works but this


---------21:38----------
is where you guys have to try it out


---------21:40----------
right


---------21:41----------
so like this is where i can propose to


---------21:44----------
you guys i mean


---------21:45----------
i'm not the speaker of truth this is


---------21:46----------
just the hypothesis that i've come up


---------21:48----------
with which i feel pretty confident about


---------21:50----------
because i think it's sort of supported


---------21:51----------
by like eastern theory and western


---------21:53----------
science


---------21:54----------
it's sort of anecdotally tested in like


---------21:56----------
half a dozen of people


---------21:58----------
and based on my own explorations of mine


---------22:00----------
and frankly


---------22:01----------
the healthy gamers so i'm also a great


---------22:03----------
example of this where i have low


---------22:04----------
conscientiousness


---------22:05----------
right so like i suck at this stuff i


---------22:08----------
have a vata mind


---------22:10----------
and so if you think about it what is it


---------22:11----------
that keeps me motivated is like thinking


---------22:14----------
about you guys


---------22:15----------
so like over the last week i've written


---------22:17----------
31 000 words of like maybe a non-fiction


---------22:20----------
book and like what motivates me to do


---------22:22----------
that


---------22:22----------
instead of playing video games it's the


---------22:24----------
idea that like oh my god


---------22:26----------
like i may die in like a year or two


---------22:28----------
years or five years or 10 years


---------22:30----------
and it would be a real pity if i spent


---------22:33----------
all my time learning this stuff


---------22:35----------
and like some random accident happened


---------22:37----------
and like i didn't


---------22:39----------
you know like it's weird like i was like


---------22:40----------
thinking about that and like i only have


---------22:42----------
a limited amount of time on this earth


---------22:44----------
so i better


---------22:44----------
get busy because i won't be around


---------22:46----------
forever right and i don't mean that to


---------22:48----------
be like


---------22:49----------
you know i don't want people to get sad


---------22:50----------
and stuff i mean it's like it's really


---------22:51----------
like a cognitive sort of thing


---------22:53----------
this is where thankfully the sociopathy


---------22:54----------
within me is it's nice because i can sit


---------22:56----------
with that thought like without


---------22:57----------
getting overwhelmed it's just like a


---------22:59----------
real practicality right


---------23:00----------
but it's actually thinking about you


---------23:02----------
guys that motivates me to work like it's


---------23:04----------
it's thinking about you guys and trying


---------23:06----------
to help other human beings


---------23:07----------
that restrains my conscientiousness


---------23:09----------
which is like pretty low because i'm a


---------23:10----------
supervisor person


---------23:12----------
right i'm bad at follow through and all


---------23:13----------
that kind of good stuff too


---------23:15----------
and so it kind of works so i encourage


---------23:18----------
you guys to test it out


---------23:19----------
right so like try it out for yourselves


---------23:22----------
and see what happens if you start


---------23:24----------
putting other people first


---------23:25----------
and if you do put other people first


---------23:27----------
like notice what's happening in your


---------23:28----------
mind when you do that


---------23:30----------
notice that every time you put someone


---------23:32----------
else first you have to put yourself


---------23:34----------
second


---------23:34----------
and that putting yourself second is


---------23:36----------
setting aside that impulse


---------23:38----------
and so every time you do that you're


---------23:39----------
getting a little bit stronger you're


---------23:40----------
gaining a little bit of xp


---------23:42----------
you're leveling up just a tiny well


---------23:43----------
you're not leveling up because that's


---------23:44----------
like you know incremental


---------23:46----------
but you know you're getting xp and then


---------23:47----------
like what you'll do is you'll notice a


---------23:49----------
level up


---------23:50----------
at some point right like you'll notice


---------23:51----------
that like oh wow i'm actually able to


---------23:53----------
like clean my room now because


---------23:55----------
it's weird i wasn't able to do that


---------23:57----------
that's a level up i'm actually able to


---------23:59----------
put together my resume i'm actually able


---------24:00----------
to apply for the job i'm actually able


---------24:02----------
to


---------24:03----------
learn this extra thing that i've always


---------24:05----------
wanted to learn like if you're a


---------24:06----------
programmer and you like we're like oh


---------24:08----------
i'd really like to learn this and you


---------24:09----------
never get around to it


---------24:11----------
so try and put other people first and if


---------24:14----------
it doesn't work as a diablo the divine


---------24:15----------
has a great question


---------24:16----------
if it doesn't work shocking in the


---------24:19----------
meantime with your failure you have made


---------24:20----------
the world a better place


---------24:23----------
oh [ __ ]


---------24:34----------
sucks um if you guys want to work


---------24:37----------
through some of this stuff right so we


---------24:38----------
teach these concepts the whole reason


---------24:40----------
that we have a coaching program


---------24:42----------
is so that like you can work with a


---------24:43----------
coach to actually like problem solve


---------24:45----------
your particular issues


---------24:47----------
and um kind of work through those things


---------24:50----------
like with someone and then like it tends


---------24:51----------
to be pretty effective


---------24:52----------
so coaching is a great way to sort of


---------24:55----------
explore


---------24:56----------
like testing and improving your


---------24:58----------
conscientiousness overcoming laziness


---------25:00----------
um figuring out like how to implement


---------25:03----------
changes in your life and things like


---------25:04----------
that


---------25:04----------
they'll also help you find a little bit


---------25:06----------
about your dharma and all that kind of


---------25:08----------
good stuff


---------25:10----------
[Music]


---------25:12----------
okay


---------25:14----------
[Music]


---------25:18----------
uh
