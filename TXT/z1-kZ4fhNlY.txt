---------00:00----------
so we had a really cool post the other


---------00:01----------
day that i thought was super interesting


---------00:03----------
and so we actually


---------00:04----------
invited the person who posted to come on


---------00:07----------
stream and talk about it because i think


---------00:08----------
it is something that


---------00:09----------
isn't talked about very much and


---------00:11----------
specifically


---------00:12----------
the poster made a post about um only


---------00:16----------
fans


---------00:17----------
and uh the dude actually like has a


---------00:19----------
girlfriend now but like


---------00:20----------
he finds that only fans sort of


---------00:23----------
is more appealing in some ways than a


---------00:25----------
real life relationship


---------00:27----------
and so i think we haven't really had a


---------00:29----------
chance to really talk to people about


---------00:31----------
some of these


---------00:32----------
uh you know generally speaking


---------00:34----------
non-talked about


---------00:35----------
things right so usually when people talk


---------00:38----------
about only fans


---------00:39----------
it's just memes and judgment so here at


---------00:41----------
healthy game where we like to understand


---------00:43----------
like where people are coming from and


---------00:44----------
why they do what they do


---------00:46----------
and only fans is is you know just wildly


---------00:49----------
successful so i think that they're


---------00:50----------
tapping into something


---------00:52----------
that is like a need that really hasn't


---------00:54----------
been explored


---------00:55----------
um tends to get judged a lot right so


---------00:58----------
like people will say oh it's like toxic


---------01:00----------
and stuff and it very well maybe i


---------01:01----------
really don't know but um here what we do


---------01:04----------
at healthy gamer is we really try to


---------01:05----------
understand things in a non-judgmental


---------01:07----------
way and try to like learn a little bit


---------01:08----------
about ourselves


---------01:15----------
hey man


---------01:18----------
um so thank you so much for coming on by


---------01:21----------
the way you're the you're the dude who


---------01:22----------
posted on reddit


---------01:24----------
yeah okay cool so can you um what do you


---------01:27----------
go by friend


---------01:29----------
spencer okay spencer so spencer um


---------01:32----------
thanks


---------01:32----------
uh first of all a lot for posting on


---------01:34----------
reddit i think it's a really


---------01:36----------
um important topic that you mentioned


---------01:38----------
and thank you very much for coming


---------01:40----------
on stream because i think um you know


---------01:41----------
parasocial relationships and only fans


---------01:44----------
is


---------01:44----------
something that we don't really talk


---------01:46----------
about um


---------01:48----------
and so i i i commend you for you know


---------01:51----------
having the balls to


---------01:53----------
talk about it man yeah so


---------01:56----------
first of all i have to say that the post


---------01:59----------
was a debate it's a lie i'm sorry


---------02:02----------
oh really


---------02:06----------
yeah okay


---------02:10----------
i've never been on only fence so yeah


---------02:14----------
okay um


---------02:17----------
let me think about that for a second


---------02:19----------
okay so then can you help us


---------02:20----------
understand uh why you posted that


---------02:25----------
yeah um i'm sort of confused too


---------02:29----------
i i kind of wanted to come on stream


---------02:33----------
so that was basically sort of the point


---------02:35----------
i made a post or


---------02:36----------
i i applied to it earlier and then i


---------02:39----------
figured like so i sometimes i do


---------02:42----------
stuff that there are sort of conflicting


---------02:46----------
desires or something and then i pick the


---------02:49----------
thing that


---------02:50----------
my intuition tells me not to because i


---------02:53----------
tend to sort of


---------02:54----------
learn the most by following the opposite


---------02:57----------
that my


---------02:58----------
intention in my um


---------03:02----------
yeah that my sort of heart is telling me


---------03:06----------
okay um can can you help me understand


---------03:10----------
that a little bit


---------03:11----------
like what do you mean about your


---------03:12----------
intuition yeah sure so


---------03:15----------
basically i tend to sometimes not be


---------03:18----------
able to trust my own


---------03:20----------
emotions and


---------03:23----------
by doing the opposite it sort of makes


---------03:26----------
me learn a lot more


---------03:27----------
it's it's kind of strange like it's


---------03:31----------
ugh so for example like telling someone


---------03:35----------
how i feel


---------03:36----------
used to be something that's that's real


---------03:38----------
it's really something that


---------03:42----------
that doesn't fit with me or that that


---------03:44----------
doesn't fit with my intuition and as


---------03:46----------
soon as


---------03:47----------
sometimes i've been i've done sort of


---------03:50----------
inappropriate things


---------03:52----------
just because like


---------03:55----------
when you feel like for example okay this


---------03:58----------
is not an example that i


---------04:00----------
that i have but for example if you have


---------04:01----------
to choose between


---------04:03----------
love and money and you go for money


---------04:06----------
because


---------04:06----------
you know that okay i picked the wrong


---------04:09----------
side now my heart tells me i'm going for


---------04:11----------
love


---------04:11----------
but if i go for money now then the next


---------04:14----------
time it's easier not to


---------04:15----------
have more uh desires and to just


---------04:19----------
to just just go for love


---------04:24----------
okay can i just think for a second i'm


---------04:25----------
just still catching i'm trying to


---------04:27----------
process the debate


---------04:29----------
and try to think about you know what to


---------04:32----------
do


---------04:38----------
so i can talk a bit more if you want uh


---------04:41----------
sure go ahead


---------04:43----------
so basically i've watched mostly most


---------04:46----------
of all streams and i relate to a lot of


---------04:49----------
them but one point


---------04:50----------
that's really big in my life is a


---------04:53----------
subject that you haven't talked about


---------04:55----------
unfortunately not only fans but


---------04:57----------
something else and i was wondering like


---------04:59----------
could i just sort of like tell my story


---------05:02----------
and sort of


---------05:03----------
try to understand myself a little bit


---------05:06----------
um can you just tell me what the general


---------05:09----------
topic is


---------05:11----------
uh psycho-immunology you've sort of


---------05:14----------
touched on it before but i'm just


---------05:16----------
curious what you


---------05:17----------
have to say about it more um sure we can


---------05:20----------
talk about psycho


---------05:22----------
immunology i'm a little bit curious


---------05:25----------
about


---------05:26----------
um you know the


---------05:29----------
what went through your head in terms of


---------05:32----------
making that reddit post


---------05:34----------
and and what kind of motivated you to so


---------05:37----------
it sounds like you


---------05:38----------
basically lied yeah


---------05:42----------
and so i'm i'd like to try to understand


---------05:44----------
that


---------05:45----------
um do you feel comfortable talking about


---------05:48----------
that or


---------05:48----------
no yeah but at the same time i feel like


---------05:52----------
i'm it's kind of sort of complex and i


---------05:55----------
feel like i


---------05:57----------
i would feel a lot more comfortable if


---------05:59----------
you understood me a little bit


---------06:01----------
as if yeah if i get the chance to


---------06:04----------
like explain myself a little bit or


---------06:06----------
where i come from


---------06:07----------
sure for we but before i give you the


---------06:11----------
steering wheel to talk about what i


---------06:12----------
think


---------06:14----------
okay sure can i share one feeling with


---------06:16----------
you spencer


---------06:17----------
and then you can drive so i feel


---------06:19----------
somewhat taken advantage of


---------06:23----------
that's fair um i feel like


---------06:27----------
you know there's you you made a post on


---------06:30----------
on reddit


---------06:31----------
and um i i i i do want to give you a


---------06:34----------
chance to kind of explain your side and


---------06:36----------
and i'm i'm happy to hear um you know


---------06:39----------
what you have to say but i think in


---------06:41----------
order for me to really listen to you


---------06:42----------
with an open mind


---------06:44----------
i have to get some stuff off of my chest


---------06:46----------
does that make sense


---------06:49----------
yeah so i feel like we have a process


---------06:53----------
and really what we're here to do is to


---------06:55----------
try to help the most


---------06:56----------
people possible and


---------07:00----------
that's really the compass that we use is


---------07:02----------
to try to help


---------07:03----------
you know the most people possible and i


---------07:05----------
understand that you know it sounds like


---------07:06----------
you


---------07:07----------
sound like you need help and stuff and


---------07:08----------
i'm sure that we can make this


---------07:09----------
productive for other people


---------07:11----------
but at the same time i feel like we're


---------07:13----------
starting off this discussion


---------07:15----------
based on essentially a lie um


---------07:18----------
and so i sort of feel taken advantage of


---------07:20----------
and i just feel like i need to get that


---------07:21----------
off my chest


---------07:25----------
yeah that's fair so i didn't expect


---------07:29----------
anything other than that and i


---------07:31----------
at the same time i feel a lot of


---------07:34----------
like i feel that i lied and i feel bad


---------07:36----------
about it


---------07:37----------
but at the same time i felt like i had


---------07:39----------
to do this okay


---------07:41----------
i i think that that so that makes sense


---------07:44----------
to me


---------07:45----------
um so in my experience spencer a lot of


---------07:47----------
people


---------07:49----------
who do things like lie or do things that


---------07:52----------
we would generally think of


---------07:54----------
as bad are pushed by extreme


---------07:57----------
measures or circumstances and i


---------08:00----------
oftentimes find that


---------08:01----------
you know people will sometimes have to


---------08:03----------
do whatever they have to do


---------08:05----------
to get their needs met


---------08:08----------
and so i'm doing my best not to try to


---------08:10----------
judge you and i hope that you can


---------08:13----------
does that make do you feel judged


---------08:17----------
yeah sure but that's from a fair point


---------08:20----------
right yeah


---------08:20----------
so i am judging you i'm doing my best


---------08:23----------
not to but


---------08:23----------
i absolutely am judging you and i'm


---------08:25----------
trying to be understanding and


---------08:27----------
compassionate


---------08:28----------
about what would motivate you to do


---------08:31----------
to go so far is to like take advantage


---------08:34----------
of me


---------08:35----------
um and at the same time i do feel taken


---------08:37----------
advantage of and i think like


---------08:38----------
i just needed to kind of get that off my


---------08:40----------
chest and maybe we can circle back and


---------08:42----------
talk a little bit more about


---------08:44----------
why you felt like you had to do it down


---------08:46----------
the road


---------08:48----------
and we can go to you know you can tell


---------08:50----------
me a little bit about yourself how does


---------08:51----------
that sound


---------08:53----------
yeah sure okay cool go for it bro


---------08:57----------
so basically


---------09:01----------
so i'm 26 years old i'm from the


---------09:04----------
netherlands


---------09:04----------
i've got an older brother and older


---------09:06----------
sister and i've got a lot of older


---------09:08----------
cousins and nephews


---------09:10----------
and basically ever since i was born i


---------09:12----------
was taught to


---------09:13----------
[Music]


---------09:15----------
not feel sadness or anger and


---------09:19----------
to never express that so that was a big


---------09:22----------
part of me


---------09:23----------
um and it was also how so


---------09:26----------
i i always had to it was just yeah


---------09:30----------
it was just strict it was i can't


---------09:34----------
like there was nothing that was


---------09:37----------
so true for me except that and and it


---------09:39----------
was like sometimes i was


---------09:41----------
having sort of needs where i was being


---------09:43----------
sad and i was sort of


---------09:45----------
struck by my dad i don't know if that's


---------09:46----------
the right word i wasn't sort of it


---------09:48----------
wasn't


---------09:49----------
that abusive but it like it wasn't i


---------09:52----------
wasn't allowed to be sad or angry like


---------09:54----------
what what what can you give me an


---------09:56----------
example of like what that would actually


---------09:57----------
like what happened


---------10:01----------
yeah so just like


---------10:05----------
i felt like


---------10:09----------
i wanted something and i felt sad about


---------10:11----------
that and he sort of struck me on the


---------10:13----------
head like with


---------10:14----------
with his hand it wasn't hard or


---------10:16----------
something it wasn't abusive but


---------10:18----------
like sort of like this isn't something


---------10:20----------
you should


---------10:21----------
do or something and when you said you


---------10:24----------
would


---------10:24----------
feel sad how would your dad know that


---------10:26----------
you're feeling sad


---------10:29----------
uh because i cried so you would be


---------10:32----------
crying


---------10:33----------
and then he would kind of okay so


---------10:38----------
is it okay if i sort of so basically


---------10:40----------
within my story it will sort of


---------10:42----------
sound like as if there are a thousand


---------10:44----------
problems and at the same time sort of


---------10:46----------
there are no problems but


---------10:48----------
it's sort of weird it's sort of subtle


---------10:51----------
and


---------10:52----------
complex in a way like can i just talk


---------10:55----------
for a while without questions i mean


---------10:58----------
there will be so many questions that you


---------10:59----------
will want to ask but


---------11:01----------
i feel like


---------11:05----------
sure go ahead okay so basically


---------11:08----------
i was told to not feel sad or not


---------11:11----------
express sadness or anger


---------11:13----------
and i was taught to always be nice to


---------11:15----------
watch others


---------11:16----------
and so from a young age like six or


---------11:18----------
seven years old i was


---------11:20----------
bullied quite a lot or at least not like


---------11:22----------
viciously bullied but


---------11:25----------
i felt always felt left out and i was


---------11:27----------
always sort of


---------11:29----------
i wasn't very social and i was always


---------11:31----------
sort of


---------11:32----------
outsider and i was i wasn't very


---------11:35----------
approachable


---------11:36----------
and i felt like a lot of other kids were


---------11:40----------
like pretty nice or pretty cool they


---------11:43----------
weren't nice again


---------11:44----------
nice towards me but i felt like um those


---------11:47----------
are great people


---------11:48----------
and if they bully me or they are harsh


---------11:51----------
again


---------11:51----------
against me then it's my fault or that


---------11:54----------
then it's sort of because of me


---------11:57----------
um and that sort of struck and


---------12:00----------
i sort of never like i was never allowed


---------12:03----------
to


---------12:04----------
feel those feelings and at home it was


---------12:07----------
it felt like um whenever i will talk


---------12:11----------
about something then they would say like


---------12:13----------
well is it your fault like what what did


---------12:15----------
you do isn't it your fault so it never


---------12:17----------
sort of took my side and felt judge at


---------12:19----------
home


---------12:19----------
so that stayed for a while and i think


---------12:22----------
after


---------12:23----------
like when i was 13 or 14 and started


---------12:26----------
having more


---------12:27----------
like sort of friends i've i never felt


---------12:29----------
like i had an identity


---------12:31----------
but who does at that age but either way


---------12:35----------
um


---------12:36----------
so i was sort of starting to learn to


---------12:39----------
get out of my comfort zone


---------12:41----------
while at the same time sort of


---------12:44----------
not following my own feelings and when i


---------12:47----------
was


---------12:47----------
like yeah when i was 15 or so i was i


---------12:51----------
was starting to get a lot of


---------12:52----------
injuries like i sported a lot but from


---------12:55----------
15 years old i started getting injures


---------12:57----------
injuries and at 17 or 18 years old i


---------13:02----------
went to college


---------13:03----------
and i chose a degree or i


---------13:06----------
chose psychology actually um for the


---------13:09----------
reason that


---------13:10----------
not that i wanted to help people i yeah


---------13:12----------
i wanted to help people but mostly i


---------13:14----------
just


---------13:14----------
i felt like if i knew


---------13:17----------
what people were feeling and if people


---------13:20----------
told me what they were feeling then i


---------13:22----------
would be loved or i would be


---------13:24----------
liked by them so it was kind of the


---------13:26----------
weird the


---------13:27----------
the bad way of choosing psychology


---------13:30----------
because that was sort of


---------13:32----------
selfish in a weird way because i was


---------13:34----------
sort of


---------13:35----------
i thought like if if people told me what


---------13:38----------
was


---------13:38----------
on their heart then they would like me


---------13:41----------
and that became like i got a few toxic


---------13:44----------
relation or toxic friendships out of


---------13:46----------
that


---------13:48----------
and basically so i i still continue to


---------13:51----------
be


---------13:51----------
on that um like to be


---------13:55----------
out of my comfort zone so when i was 18


---------13:57----------
i went to


---------13:58----------
a i went to become a entertainer on the


---------14:02----------
camping


---------14:02----------
like an entertainer entertains kids well


---------14:05----------
i don't really like it


---------14:07----------
but it was like i'm gonna do stuff that


---------14:09----------
i don't like


---------14:11----------
and i went to germany but i don't speak


---------14:13----------
german they asked me like can you speak


---------14:15----------
german and i said


---------14:16----------
yeah sure so that was basically like


---------14:19----------
i'm just gonna do this because it i


---------14:21----------
can't do this and that's why i have to


---------14:23----------
do this


---------14:23----------
so i just sure did the opposite of what


---------14:26----------
i


---------14:27----------
felt or what i wanted


---------14:30----------
so this is a bit where the mess sort of


---------14:33----------
starts


---------14:34----------
so like two days later i um


---------14:38----------
i got a lump in my throat or at least it


---------14:41----------
felt like i got pain in my throat


---------14:43----------
and so i after two days it felt like


---------14:46----------
yeah a


---------14:47----------
big orange in my my throat and from that


---------14:50----------
moment on i was


---------14:51----------
mute for a year or so like i couldn't


---------14:53----------
talk for a year


---------14:55----------
and that was kind of strange so i


---------14:58----------
dropped out from college


---------14:59----------
and the two years after that it


---------15:03----------
was um


---------15:07----------
i kind of did nothing like i there was


---------15:11----------
a lot of fear within like okay how i


---------15:13----------
will


---------15:14----------
how will i be able to like how will my


---------15:18----------
future look like and then i felt like


---------15:19----------
okay


---------15:20----------
i have to the only way to make money now


---------15:22----------
is to gamble


---------15:24----------
so i kind of gambled gambled a lot


---------15:27----------
um not anymore by the way but


---------15:31----------
it and went up to thousands or tens of


---------15:34----------
thousands


---------15:35----------
um but yeah it was that was sort of


---------15:39----------
strange and


---------15:41----------
after like two years it went a little


---------15:43----------
bit better but after one year i got


---------15:45----------
also got like i got increasing


---------15:49----------
amounts of pain within my stomach and


---------15:51----------
after a year was


---------15:52----------
diagnosed like one night


---------15:55----------
i woke up with pain in my stomach and i


---------15:58----------
got


---------15:58----------
diagnosed with crohn's disease which is


---------16:01----------
a


---------16:02----------
chronic inflammatory disease within your


---------16:05----------
digestive system and


---------16:09----------
i felt like


---------16:12----------
it's weird so you've talked about the


---------16:15----------
the rapid


---------16:16----------
experiment with where they take like


---------16:19----------
the feces from a depressed red


---------16:22----------
and place it in a healthy red and the


---------16:24----------
the healthy red


---------16:26----------
feels more depressed and so it's it's


---------16:28----------
weird to see like when i


---------16:31----------
when i feel ill i also feel way more


---------16:34----------
down


---------16:34----------
and sure so


---------16:38----------
that went on for a while and that sort


---------16:40----------
of that went that


---------16:42----------
went way worse and way worse and i also


---------16:44----------
got like


---------16:46----------
other um my injuries with that like for


---------16:52----------
like eight years ago or so i


---------16:55----------
fell on my um what's the word


---------17:00----------
like the the last bone of your um


---------17:05----------
of your back like the the tailbone i


---------17:07----------
fell on my tailbone


---------17:09----------
okay i thought it was still bone but


---------17:11----------
that's okay


---------17:12----------
um but i fell on myself same thing okay


---------17:16----------
i fell on my tailbone bone and


---------17:18----------
throughout the years it became worse and


---------17:20----------
worse and now it sort of


---------17:22----------
is it feels like it's sort of twisted in


---------17:25----------
a way it is sort of twisted in a way


---------17:27----------
like they made scans and stuff


---------17:29----------
and i went to the best like a physical


---------17:32----------
therapist


---------17:33----------
to sort of change that or something but


---------17:36----------
it feels like


---------17:37----------
every moment it feels like uncomfortable


---------17:40----------
in the way that


---------17:42----------
it feels like i want to stretch and it


---------17:43----------
sort of pops but it never pops


---------17:46----------
so it's like it's a weird


---------17:49----------
feeling it's like always uncomfortable


---------17:52----------
and i feel like you had wanted me to


---------17:56----------
listen and not ask questions i was just


---------17:58----------
curious do you know how


---------17:59----------
far along we are and what you wanted to


---------18:01----------
share


---------18:04----------
yeah so basically what i feel like is


---------18:06----------
with


---------18:07----------
immuno with psycho immunology


---------18:11----------
that with autoimmune diseases i


---------18:15----------
i've like i've talked to a lot of


---------18:18----------
people who also have immune diseases and


---------18:21----------
i felt like


---------18:23----------
it would be um


---------18:27----------
wants to learn more about it or wanted


---------18:29----------
to talk about it


---------18:32----------
okay yeah so a couple of things let's


---------18:34----------
just kind of


---------18:36----------
lay some ground rules so one thing is i


---------18:38----------
i i can't dispense medical advice over


---------18:40----------
the internet


---------18:42----------
right so that i understand um and and so


---------18:46----------
we can talk a little bit about


---------18:48----------
psychoimmunology


---------18:50----------
but my sense is that the money is not


---------18:54----------
going to be an


---------18:55----------
intellectual discussion about


---------18:56----------
psychoimmunology


---------18:58----------
so let me explain is there anything else


---------19:01----------
you wanted to share by the way i was


---------19:02----------
just trying to get a sense of


---------19:03----------
how far along in your narrative you were


---------19:07----------
[Music]


---------19:09----------
yeah um a bit of stuff but that's okay


---------19:13----------
okay so so if we let's just talk about


---------19:15----------
psychoimmunology for a second


---------19:17----------
okay so the if we understand so it's


---------19:21----------
really psychoneuroimmunology


---------19:23----------
is is really the field that i think is a


---------19:24----------
little bit better to understand so what


---------19:26----------
this means is that


---------19:27----------
we have a mind so our mind is not a


---------19:29----------
physical thing


---------19:31----------
our mind is like a representation of


---------19:33----------
like thoughts like conscious and


---------19:35----------
unconscious and whatnot


---------19:37----------
and depending on the kinds of thoughts


---------19:39----------
we have


---------19:40----------
it changes the way that our brain


---------19:42----------
functions or


---------19:44----------
there's a correlation between our brain


---------19:46----------
and our thoughts


---------19:47----------
and then furthermore our brain secretes


---------19:49----------
chemicals that affects our immune system


---------19:52----------
and physical body okay so for example


---------19:55----------
if i have anxious thinking


---------19:59----------
um you know that'll cause


---------20:02----------
the secretion of potentially adrenaline


---------20:05----------
and cortisol


---------20:06----------
and then cortisol will hyper activate my


---------20:09----------
immune system


---------20:10----------
and if there's nothing for my immune


---------20:12----------
system to fight against


---------20:14----------
that cortisol can result in like


---------20:16----------
autoimmune kind of phenomenon or a


---------20:18----------
dysregulated immune system


---------20:20----------
and by dysregulated immune system it's


---------20:21----------
like it's like you're turning your


---------20:23----------
immune system on high alert and there's


---------20:25----------
nothing to attack


---------20:27----------
and if there's nothing to attack your


---------20:28----------
immune system sort of gets jittery and


---------20:30----------
starts like


---------20:30----------
attacking healthy parts of you because


---------20:33----------
it doesn't


---------20:34----------
know what else to do and so that's sort


---------20:36----------
of where psychoneuroimmunology is


---------20:39----------
um you know there are a lot of


---------20:40----------
interventions which you can do for


---------20:42----------
psycho


---------20:42----------
neuroimmunology but my sense is that you


---------20:45----------
know what we tend to talk about here


---------20:48----------
is to try to help people understand


---------20:50----------
themselves


---------20:51----------
and i think in your case there are


---------20:53----------
certainly things that we can talk about


---------20:55----------
i don't know if it's what you want to


---------20:58----------
talk about


---------20:59----------
in fact i'm getting the sense that it's


---------21:00----------
not what you want to talk about


---------21:02----------
but if you ask me what is the most


---------21:04----------
helpful towards you


---------21:06----------
i would say that it's more on the psycho


---------21:08----------
part as opposed to the neuro part or


---------21:10----------
immunology part


---------21:13----------
how do you feel about that


---------21:18----------
yeah that makes sense okay um


---------21:22----------
so the next thing is if you have


---------21:24----------
specific questions i mean you've gone to


---------21:26----------
all of this trouble


---------21:27----------
and we're here now do you have any


---------21:29----------
specific questions for me that you'd


---------21:31----------
like me to answer


---------21:34----------
no not really i have to say that i sort


---------21:37----------
of


---------21:39----------
this is sort of like sometimes i did


---------21:42----------
things


---------21:42----------
where my intuition told me to not to do


---------21:45----------
stuff and sometimes i learned a lot


---------21:47----------
about it and sometimes i figured out


---------21:49----------
that my intuition has sort of lied to me


---------21:51----------
or that some feels a big part of my


---------21:53----------
feelings lie to me and in this


---------21:55----------
case i feel like i should have listened


---------21:58----------
to my intuition because this feels


---------22:00----------
quite uncomfortable and i shouldn't have


---------22:03----------
done this


---------22:04----------
yep so we'll talk about that so what


---------22:06----------
what was your intuition telling you to


---------22:08----------
do


---------22:11----------
it's okay spencer we're here now so


---------22:12----------
we're gonna make the most of it


---------22:14----------
i won't say that i'm glad that you did


---------22:16----------
what you did but i think that we're here


---------22:18----------
now


---------22:19----------
and so let's try to understand and try


---------22:21----------
to help you as much as we can


---------22:24----------
yeah so


---------22:28----------
what did my intuition tell me not to do


---------22:31----------
now it was like


---------22:33----------
um okay how do i say this


---------22:37----------
so some ah okay so there's this


---------22:39----------
interview with


---------22:40----------
an actor uh matt damon who got


---------22:43----------
on his 25th uh


---------22:47----------
like when he was 25 he got an egg and he


---------22:49----------
got an oscar


---------22:50----------
and in the interview like years later he


---------22:52----------
told me or


---------22:54----------
he told an interview like um


---------22:57----------
i'm so happy to have had that interview


---------22:59----------
or to have to add that


---------23:01----------
oscar on a young age because imagine


---------23:04----------
becoming 80 and then figuring out like


---------23:07----------
uh


---------23:08----------
i fought all that time for an oscar and


---------23:10----------
it doesn't feel that hole in me it


---------23:12----------
doesn't take away the pain


---------23:14----------
and so i feel like whenever there's a


---------23:18----------
part of me that


---------23:19----------
wants something and a huge part of me


---------23:22----------
that doesn't want that


---------23:23----------
then i'll just go for that small part


---------23:25----------
that does want something because


---------23:28----------
either i found find out that there's


---------23:30----------
something that takes away the


---------23:31----------
pain or i find out that i


---------23:35----------
never wanted part again because i found


---------23:37----------
out the hard way


---------23:39----------
sort of okay i sort of lost you there


---------23:41----------
but let me


---------23:42----------
respond so the first thing is that i'm


---------23:44----------
going to replace the word intuition with


---------23:46----------
need


---------23:49----------
okay okay that's what it feels like to


---------23:51----------
me so i think that like


---------23:53----------
what i'm hearing is that you have some


---------23:55----------
kind of like need or hunger


---------23:58----------
and then there's a large part of you


---------23:59----------
that sort of doesn't want


---------24:01----------
that need or hunger to control your


---------24:03----------
actions


---------24:05----------
you want to act in a different way and


---------24:07----------
then what ends up happening


---------24:09----------
and this is where i sort of lose you and


---------24:10----------
i think it's i don't really know that we


---------24:12----------
need to explore this right now but


---------24:14----------
but that you end up sort of giving in to


---------24:16----------
the need or hunger


---------24:20----------
and then this is where i sort of lose


---------24:22----------
you you say that you end up learning


---------24:24----------
more that way


---------24:25----------
what does that mean


---------24:29----------
yeah so sometimes like


---------24:32----------
the first time i told someone like


---------24:36----------
okay i feel sad was really


---------24:40----------
i've done a lot of things that were


---------24:42----------
really really inappropriate


---------24:44----------
and bad or self-destructive before i


---------24:49----------
talked to someone and told them that i


---------24:52----------
felt sad


---------24:53----------
very very good observation okay keep


---------24:58----------
going


---------25:00----------
okay now i lost my trainer for sorry so


---------25:02----------
i i think i think so let's


---------25:03----------
let's just talk so spencer i'm gonna


---------25:06----------
respond to you okay


---------25:07----------
so normally i talk to people more


---------25:12----------
before i sort of offer some thoughts


---------25:13----------
about them but i think in your case


---------25:16----------
you've actually given us a lot of


---------25:17----------
richness of information


---------25:19----------
with the way that we even started the


---------25:21----------
interview okay


---------25:24----------
so let's just let me kind of run you


---------25:27----------
through what what


---------25:28----------
i heard so you kind of said you're not


---------25:29----------
allowed to be sad


---------25:31----------
right like that's a big problem and so


---------25:34----------
what i'm hearing is that people haven't


---------25:36----------
allowed you to be sad


---------25:38----------
and that maybe what that's doing is like


---------25:40----------
some kind of suppressed


---------25:41----------
emotion is affecting your immune system


---------25:44----------
and physical health


---------25:46----------
how does that sound to you okay can i


---------25:49----------
keep going yeah at


---------25:50----------
like up to a year or so like until a


---------25:53----------
year or so i started


---------25:54----------
learning that i started learning that it


---------25:56----------
was okay to be sad and i started


---------25:58----------
learning that


---------25:59----------
stuff weren't like not everything is my


---------26:01----------
fault and that


---------26:02----------
that i feel like really deep in my heart


---------26:05----------
good i don't think


---------26:07----------
yeah go ahead sorry but at the same time


---------26:09----------
i feel like


---------26:12----------
there's still so much down there


---------26:15----------
from the first 25 years of my life


---------26:18----------
and i don't know how to not feel that i


---------26:21----------
don't know how to


---------26:23----------
process that i'm with you bro okay so


---------26:25----------
let's talk about this


---------26:26----------
so you said that the basic issue growing


---------26:29----------
up is that you weren't allowed to feel


---------26:30----------
sad correct


---------26:32----------
yeah when we started this interview did


---------26:35----------
i let you feel sad


---------26:38----------
did you let me see you said i mean yeah


---------26:41----------
sure


---------26:43----------
i disagree why not right so so this is


---------26:46----------
like so let's think about what happened


---------26:47----------
so usually


---------26:48----------
people don't have to fight me to tell


---------26:50----------
their story


---------26:52----------
you came on here and you wanted me to


---------26:54----------
listen right you're like the one person


---------26:57----------
that i pushed back


---------27:01----------
you're like hey i can i just tell you


---------27:03----------
about myself like i want you to listen i


---------27:06----------
want you to tell me


---------27:07----------
i i want you to listen to like the


---------27:09----------
difficulties that i've had


---------27:11----------
you're the one [ __ ] person that i


---------27:14----------
didn't want to listen to


---------27:16----------
how do you understand that


---------27:20----------
how do i not understand that like i


---------27:22----------
completely understand your situation


---------27:24----------
like in my head


---------27:26----------
it didn't go this way but i felt like


---------27:28----------
okay i just have to do this


---------27:31----------
but why is it that you're the one person


---------27:34----------
so your problem is that people don't


---------27:36----------
listen to you right like your dad when


---------27:38----------
you're feeling sad and you're crying


---------27:40----------
he kind of hits you upside the head like


---------27:43----------
this whole muteness right so this like


---------27:46----------
psychological mutinous is what it sounds


---------27:48----------
like it doesn't sound like it was


---------27:49----------
medical but we'll get to that in a


---------27:50----------
second


---------27:51----------
but like the whole point is that people


---------27:53----------
don't care about you


---------27:55----------
right spencer


---------27:58----------
like they don't listen to you that's it


---------28:01----------
that's a big conclusion based on that


---------28:03----------
but


---------28:03----------
yeah i mean is that how you feel


---------28:09----------
i've absolutely felt that but


---------28:13----------
i feel last year i feel like


---------28:16----------
people do care in a bit but yep


---------28:19----------
it's just so much


---------28:22----------
yeah let me jump in okay so let me put


---------28:24----------
it this way why does someone


---------28:26----------
have to lie to get their needs met


---------28:30----------
it's because they're afraid or their


---------28:32----------
experience is that if they don't lie


---------28:34----------
they don't get their needs met


---------28:36----------
does that make sense


---------28:40----------
yeah right so like why did you lie


---------28:44----------
to come on stream


---------28:49----------
to get my knees wet absolutely right is


---------28:52----------
that a hard feel


---------28:53----------
yeah i mean because you were like i i


---------28:55----------
needed to do this


---------28:56----------
that's what you tell us right


---------29:00----------
yeah okay so i think this is the this is


---------29:02----------
the challenge because when you do that


---------29:06----------
like you're kinda it's interesting


---------29:08----------
because you kind of pull me into this


---------29:10----------
dynamic which i i think could be present


---------29:12----------
in a lot of parts of your life


---------29:13----------
i don't blame you for like the stuff


---------29:15----------
with your dad or whatever but it's kind


---------29:16----------
of interesting because you're like the


---------29:18----------
one person that i don't want to listen


---------29:19----------
to


---------29:21----------
and i want to listen to everyone and so


---------29:23----------
how the [ __ ] does that happen and it's


---------29:26----------
because of the way


---------29:27----------
like you create a self-fulfilling


---------29:29----------
prophecy and when you kind of say you


---------29:31----------
have self-destructive behavior i see it


---------29:32----------
absolutely


---------29:33----------
because that's what you did to me right


---------29:35----------
like you created a conversation under


---------29:37----------
false pretenses


---------29:38----------
and then like dr k doesn't want to


---------29:41----------
listen to what you have to say


---------29:43----------
and that's gotta hurt right


---------29:46----------
and then what happens like you have to


---------29:48----------
you literally said can i just talk


---------29:50----------
and i was like whoa what the [ __ ] is


---------29:52----------
happening like no one has ever said that


---------29:53----------
to me on stream


---------29:55----------
no one has ever had to fight for the


---------29:57----------
ability to speak


---------29:58----------
and then i paused and i was thinking


---------29:59----------
like what just happened here


---------30:01----------
and then i realized like we're we're


---------30:03----------
playing out this drama


---------30:05----------
where like you're creating a situation


---------30:08----------
where


---------30:08----------
i don't feel like listening to you


---------30:11----------
i don't want to listen to you because i


---------30:13----------
feel taken advantage of


---------30:15----------
and then that in turn makes you


---------30:18----------
feel like you're not allowed to be sad


---------30:20----------
because you're talking to someone


---------30:22----------
who doesn't want to listen to you and so


---------30:23----------
then of course you're going to feel like


---------30:25----------
oh [ __ ] people don't want to listen to


---------30:26----------
me


---------30:27----------
and then what that does is reinforces


---------30:29----------
the need for you to lie to get your


---------30:31----------
needs met


---------30:32----------
does that make sense yeah absolutely


---------30:36----------
i don't think it applies to all my life


---------30:38----------
though


---------30:39----------
i doubt it applies okay go ahead


---------30:43----------
i sorry yeah so


---------30:46----------
a lot of like a big part of my life i


---------30:49----------
felt like


---------30:50----------
i lied about me like i


---------30:53----------
i told people like okay i don't feel sad


---------30:56----------
and i still sort of


---------30:57----------
sometimes struggle with it and i had a


---------30:59----------
lot of


---------31:00----------
i had some friendships where people like


---------31:04----------
only came to me and sort of


---------31:07----------
that i was sort of crying the shoulder


---------31:09----------
to cry on in the way


---------31:11----------
sure and now i feel like i'm so


---------31:14----------
overwhelmed and i'm so


---------31:15----------
i can't take much more


---------31:19----------
no stuff from others that i feel like


---------31:22----------
it's i can't sort of have a two-way


---------31:24----------
street anymore


---------31:26----------
absolutely first i was first it was such


---------31:28----------
a big one-way street


---------31:30----------
where people wanted me and now i sort of


---------31:33----------
am overwhelmed and now sort of i want


---------31:36----------
someone else and


---------31:37----------
in some ways i can sort of get it but


---------31:39----------
there's just


---------31:40----------
it's it's like an unlimited need for


---------31:44----------
support or for someone to listen


---------31:48----------
yeah so i i think that that's sort of


---------31:49----------
tangential because like so i


---------31:51----------
totally get so first of all i don't


---------31:53----------
think you're a bad person okay let me


---------31:54----------
just


---------31:54----------
say that i don't think twitch should


---------31:56----------
think you're a bad person either


---------31:58----------
i think you're someone who has some


---------31:59----------
psychological levers


---------32:01----------
that are being pulled in you and we kind


---------32:02----------
of call it a need or a hunger


---------32:04----------
and your road forward is going to be the


---------32:06----------
same as every single person's road


---------32:08----------
forward whoever comes on stream which is


---------32:09----------
to understand this dynamic within


---------32:11----------
yourself


---------32:12----------
i do think you're self-destructive i do


---------32:15----------
think that some of the stuff that you're


---------32:17----------
doing


---------32:17----------
is sort of created by you you don't


---------32:19----------
realize you're doing it i sort of don't


---------32:21----------
blame you for it but it's like


---------32:22----------
it's weird that like you came on stream


---------32:24----------
and like i didn't want to talk to you


---------32:26----------
right and so i think that what you're


---------32:28----------
saying is that i'm a good emotional


---------32:30----------
support for a lot of people which i


---------32:32----------
completely believe and completely agree


---------32:33----------
with i think you're a good person i


---------32:35----------
think people value having you in their


---------32:36----------
life


---------32:38----------
what you're missing is not that you're


---------32:40----------
not a good person


---------32:42----------
or that other people don't benefit from


---------32:43----------
having you around it's that you don't


---------32:46----------
know how to get


---------32:47----------
your emotional needs met right hence the


---------32:50----------
psychoneuroimmunology


---------32:52----------
i'm you're not allowed to be sad


---------32:55----------
like people don't listen to you people


---------32:58----------
it's not a two-way street and you want a


---------33:00----------
two-way street


---------33:02----------
and then what i think you end up doing


---------33:04----------
is that that need or hunger is so


---------33:06----------
powerful


---------33:07----------
that it pushes you to do things that


---------33:10----------
then make it


---------33:11----------
harder for your needs to be met by the


---------33:13----------
other person


---------33:15----------
which in turn makes you feel even


---------33:17----------
hungrier and hungrier


---------33:19----------
enhances the need and then causes you to


---------33:23----------
do more desperate


---------33:24----------
things i don't know


---------33:27----------
like i completely follow what you're


---------33:29----------
saying but


---------33:30----------
at the same time there are friends who


---------33:32----------
listen to me and at the same time


---------33:33----------
it's it's like i'm trying to


---------33:38----------
i don't know where and i'm just thinking


---------33:40----------
out loud it feels like i


---------33:42----------
need someone to listen to in order to


---------33:45----------
get rid of the stuff that's on my heart


---------33:48----------
yeah


---------33:49----------
i'm getting rid of the stuff that's on


---------33:51----------
my heart get better like


---------33:53----------
uh physically but at the same time they


---------33:57----------
have


---------33:57----------
like some some instances i know that


---------33:59----------
people have listened to me


---------34:01----------
and my physical stuff has been improving


---------34:04----------
a lot but other interesting instances it


---------34:07----------
feels like i'm


---------34:08----------
trying to fix um


---------34:11----------
things within myself by things from


---------34:14----------
the outside world okay spencer let me


---------34:17----------
let me so i


---------34:18----------
i don't i'm not disagreeing with you


---------34:20----------
what you're saying but i think it's


---------34:22----------
i still think you have emotional so let


---------34:24----------
me just put it this way you say you have


---------34:25----------
you have friends that do listen to you


---------34:27----------
sometimes i completely agree


---------34:29----------
great and at the end of the day you


---------34:31----------
still have that need or hunger that push


---------34:33----------
you to lie


---------34:34----------
about something on reddit and come on


---------34:35----------
stream and if your friends were


---------34:38----------
listening to you sufficiently


---------34:40----------
that hunger would be satisfied the fact


---------34:43----------
that you did what you did


---------34:46----------
pushes me to conclude that your needs


---------34:49----------
are not being


---------34:51----------
sufficiently met


---------34:54----------
it doesn't mean that they're not being


---------34:55----------
met at all it's just the [ __ ]


---------34:57----------
hunger's still there


---------34:59----------
yeah but maybe the hunger is in a


---------35:01----------
different way like maybe


---------35:03----------
like for example if i think like okay uh


---------35:06----------
money can solve my issue


---------35:07----------
and i got hundred dollars and it doesn't


---------35:09----------
didn't fix now maybe


---------35:11----------
when i get a thousand dollars it will


---------35:12----------
fix and it's like


---------35:14----------
no money doesn't fix it and in the same


---------35:16----------
way attention or


---------35:18----------
someone to listen won't fix it but i'm


---------35:20----------
just the reason i came here


---------35:22----------
is partly like i don't know if


---------35:26----------
the listening ear will fix this so i


---------35:29----------
will give get to the sort of


---------35:31----------
this will sound weird highest source of


---------35:34----------
of listening ears


---------35:35----------
or sort of like a lot of people watching


---------35:38----------
or listening


---------35:39----------
just to see if like


---------35:42----------
the listening will help and sure


---------35:46----------
maybe like maybe it doesn't though maybe


---------35:48----------
it's in a different


---------35:50----------
like maybe i have to find the answer in


---------35:52----------
a different spot and then i know this


---------35:54----------
like


---------35:56----------
there's there's a part of me that knows


---------35:57----------
this but there was a also a part of me


---------36:00----------
like well maybe it does help and that's


---------36:02----------
why i have to come on


---------36:04----------
that's why sure so so once again i think


---------36:07----------
you're trying to


---------36:08----------
just you're trying to get that need met


---------36:10----------
right you're trying to figure out is


---------36:11----------
listening


---------36:12----------
enough totally fine so let me ask you


---------36:14----------
this spencer


---------36:15----------
when you applied to come on stream and


---------36:19----------
you


---------36:19----------
didn't and we didn't say yes how did you


---------36:24----------
feel


---------36:27----------
uh frustrated


---------36:31----------
and angry


---------36:34----------
okay part of it like


---------36:38----------
what were you mad at


---------36:43----------
uh i felt like


---------36:47----------
so this conversation is going different


---------36:49----------
than i sort of


---------36:51----------
wanted it to be like i know that i've


---------36:53----------
worked with a lot of people also have


---------36:55----------
crohn's disease or collided or


---------36:56----------
autoimmune diseases


---------36:58----------
and i felt like this is really


---------37:01----------
like egocentrical to to say this but


---------37:05----------
i felt like it would be sort of


---------37:09----------
good to talk about not only for me but


---------37:11----------
for


---------37:12----------
viewers or for i don't know i think this


---------37:14----------
is there are so many


---------37:15----------
things that were yeah but there was so


---------37:18----------
many things that are sort of


---------37:20----------
contradicting each other and that that's


---------37:22----------
like


---------37:23----------
it happens it happens often within me


---------37:25----------
that are contradicting


---------37:27----------
stuff yep and that's why


---------37:30----------
it it works for me to follow the stuff


---------37:32----------
that is


---------37:33----------
against my intuition or needs


---------37:36----------
okay so i i don't i'm not sure if you


---------37:39----------
were talking


---------37:40----------
i i'd asked you when we rejected you


---------37:43----------
from coming on stream


---------37:45----------
you said you felt frustrated and angry


---------37:48----------
yeah what was frustrating and what were


---------37:51----------
you angry at


---------37:57----------
um well it wasn't like


---------38:01----------
it was frustrating and angry or i was


---------38:04----------
frustrated and angry


---------38:06----------
but then didn't take the l i felt like


---------38:08----------
okay now i have to just


---------38:10----------
just sort of fight a different way sure


---------38:14----------
i i understand that so but what were you


---------38:16----------
angry at so


---------38:17----------
anger like usually is directed towards


---------38:19----------
something right


---------38:23----------
like so who are you mad at


---------38:33----------
i don't know i i don't think i was that


---------38:35----------
angry like


---------38:36----------
i didn't feel like i was rejected


---------38:39----------
because i


---------38:40----------
knew that i could try and try again and


---------38:42----------
that


---------38:43----------
even if i was lying that i would still


---------38:46----------
like it wouldn't matter to get my needs


---------38:48----------
met


---------38:50----------
okay so


---------38:53----------
i knew that i didn't okay you didn't


---------38:55----------
feel frustrated and angry


---------39:00----------
part of me did but i knew that there


---------39:02----------
were still other options


---------39:04----------
okay so i understand that not taking the


---------39:07----------
l lets you put aside the frustration and


---------39:10----------
anger


---------39:12----------
right is that a good way to put it


---------39:15----------
but i'm still curious what you are angry


---------39:18----------
at


---------39:26----------
so this is yeah and it's okay to say i'm


---------39:30----------
selfish but


---------39:31----------
i wanted no yeah i don't know partly but


---------39:34----------
at the same time it feels too selfish to


---------39:36----------
say it but i felt like


---------39:38----------
i want it and then it's just like okay i


---------39:41----------
can't


---------39:42----------
get it and then it's yeah not getting


---------39:44----------
what you want


---------39:45----------
is frustrating so it isn't it isn't that


---------39:49----------
i'm


---------39:49----------
i'm angry towards you or towards myself


---------39:52----------
but it's just


---------39:53----------
just a temper transfer


---------39:57----------
okay you're not you weren't angry at me


---------40:05----------
yeah okay maybe but at the same time we


---------40:07----------
can understand so it's


---------40:09----------
i don't know so spencer this is


---------40:11----------
something you really i think this is


---------40:12----------
part of the reason you're confused


---------40:13----------
internally is because i don't think you


---------40:16----------
accept some of the things that you feel


---------40:18----------
because of your


---------40:19----------
internal judgments like if you want to


---------40:23----------
come on stream and you're really


---------40:24----------
suffering and we say no


---------40:26----------
like how on earth are you not angry at


---------40:28----------
us


---------40:32----------
because i'm at the same time sort of


---------40:35----------
angry or frustrated at myself


---------40:37----------
like okay yeah i mean at that time at


---------40:40----------
this time i'm sort of frustrated in


---------40:41----------
myself


---------40:42----------
okay what kind of what are you why are


---------40:45----------
you frustrated with yourself


---------40:50----------
because


---------40:52----------
my judgment was sort of wrong like


---------40:56----------
sometimes it works sometimes it works to


---------40:59----------
go against my own judgment


---------41:02----------
and this time it was wrong and like i


---------41:05----------
know that's


---------41:06----------
why was how do you know that your


---------41:08----------
judgment was wrong


---------41:09----------
what is the measuring stick you use how


---------41:12----------
do you rate your judgment


---------41:15----------
yeah because i know that it feels way


---------41:18----------
more uncomfortable right now


---------41:20----------
like sometimes it sometimes i do stuff


---------41:22----------
and then afterwards i feel better about


---------41:24----------
it i feel like


---------41:26----------
um like for example a while ago i stood


---------41:30----------
up for myself


---------41:30----------
and before that i felt like oh i


---------41:33----------
shouldn't do this i shouldn't do this i


---------41:35----------
shouldn't do this


---------41:36----------
and a small part of me was like i should


---------41:38----------
do this and therefore i will do this


---------41:40----------
because it's more


---------41:41----------
small part will be something that you


---------41:43----------
like follow


---------41:46----------
and it was great like afterwards it felt


---------41:49----------
great


---------41:49----------
and it felt like i grew a little bit


---------41:53----------
inside it felt like i


---------41:55----------
gained self-respect which was sort of


---------41:58----------
something i didn't feel in that way


---------41:59----------
before because i always seem to


---------42:01----------
de-escalate


---------42:03----------
and that's why


---------42:06----------
yeah like sometimes you win sometimes


---------42:08----------
you lose and in this


---------42:09----------
this case i feel like


---------42:12----------
so my judgment wasn't extremely


---------42:16----------
wrong like i knew that there was a dick


---------42:18----------
chance that


---------42:19----------
this would be wrong and therefore i kept


---------42:22----------
my mask and my head on


---------42:24----------
to be not recognized but


---------42:27----------
at the same time i felt like i have to


---------42:29----------
do this so there was a big chance that i


---------42:31----------
that it would be wrong but yeah it was


---------42:34----------
worth it


---------42:34----------
and how do you do you feel uncomfortable


---------42:36----------
right now


---------42:40----------
yeah but mostly because myself i don't


---------42:42----------
feel judgment from you or something


---------42:44----------
so i feel yeah help me understand that


---------42:48----------
what do you feel right now


---------42:56----------
i should know better there's no weight


---------43:02----------
so a part of me just like i knew that


---------43:06----------
this would be wrong i knew it and that's


---------43:10----------
why it's frustrating are you frustrated


---------43:13----------
with yourself for losing control


---------43:17----------
it wasn't losing control it wasn't like


---------43:20----------
it wasn't one minute where i saw a


---------43:22----------
cupcake and i bought it and it's like i


---------43:24----------
shouldn't have bought that cupcake


---------43:26----------
it was weeks and therefore it's like


---------43:31----------
i'm not losing control of yourself are


---------43:33----------
you frustrated with losing control of me


---------43:35----------
of what this session would become are


---------43:37----------
you frustrated because this didn't turn


---------43:39----------
out the way that you wanted it to


---------43:43----------
yeah yeah pretty much


---------43:46----------
okay so and also frustrated but i'm


---------43:50----------
i'm like it's a lesson for me as well in


---------43:52----------
a way that


---------43:53----------
in my head are like


---------43:56----------
it was difficult not to think about this


---------43:58----------
conversation


---------43:59----------
during the last couple of weeks and


---------44:03----------
this was not what i expected yes


---------44:06----------
so this is important spencer okay so i


---------44:09----------
want you to really like


---------44:10----------
so i feel pretty i still have some


---------44:14----------
negative emotions rolling around inside


---------44:16----------
me so hopefully that doesn't interfere


---------44:18----------
with things


---------44:19----------
i don't just let me think about this


---------44:25----------
i was about to say i don't dislike you


---------44:26----------
but let me just make sure that that's


---------44:28----------
true


---------44:31----------
yeah i don't think i dislike it okay um


---------44:34----------
so here's here's what i see is going on


---------44:36----------
okay so i i think


---------44:38----------
spencer you've got to be really careful


---------44:40----------
because i i think you're


---------44:41----------
it seems to me like you're quite


---------44:43----------
manipulative


---------44:45----------
and i know that that has a negative


---------44:46----------
connotation to it so i'm going to


---------44:47----------
explain what i mean by that


---------44:49----------
so if i understood you correctly you


---------44:50----------
signed up for something in germany


---------44:52----------
telling people that you spoke german and


---------44:54----------
you didn't speak german


---------44:56----------
is that correct and what's your


---------44:58----------
understanding can you tell me like why


---------45:00----------
you did that like what's your


---------45:01----------
understanding of what was going on


---------45:03----------
inside you


---------45:06----------
i felt like i in that position i really


---------45:10----------
didn't like myself and i felt like


---------45:12----------
i should get as far away as possible


---------45:15----------
from myself


---------45:16----------
in order to find out


---------45:19----------
how to grow sort of sure why did you


---------45:22----------
need to lie about speaking german


---------45:30----------
to be fair i could speak a few words


---------45:33----------
but nice dodge like


---------45:37----------
yeah um


---------45:42----------
i don't know yeah because lying gets you


---------45:46----------
somewhere sometimes


---------45:48----------
even though like it doesn't get you the


---------45:50----------
big things like you can't lie yourself


---------45:52----------
into


---------45:53----------
people liking or loving you try


---------45:58----------
but


---------46:00----------
yeah all right let's be honest


---------46:04----------
so spencer let me say this so i i think


---------46:06----------
i think it's


---------46:07----------
fine you came on today um because i i


---------46:10----------
think that a lot of people can relate to


---------46:11----------
this and i think this can help a lot of


---------46:13----------
people so


---------46:14----------
at the end of the day i still am


---------46:16----------
grateful for you


---------46:17----------
for coming on today i still think it


---------46:19----------
takes a different kind of balls


---------46:21----------
to come on and say in the first you know


---------46:23----------
second first 10 seconds on stream by the


---------46:25----------
way i lied and it was sort of a debate


---------46:27----------
and none of that [ __ ] was


---------46:28----------
true so i i still appreciate that you


---------46:30----------
kind of came on and stuff like that and


---------46:32----------
you know i think that you're struggling


---------46:33----------
with things that a lot of people


---------46:34----------
struggle with and i want to kind of


---------46:35----------
point some of those out to you okay


---------46:38----------
um sure so i think a lot of this is


---------46:41----------
about


---------46:42----------
control okay so like i think what you're


---------46:43----------
frustrated with yourself


---------46:45----------
for is that you had this vision of what


---------46:48----------
you wanted from me


---------46:50----------
right and then you like applied the


---------46:53----------
stream and it didn't work so you're like


---------46:55----------
i'm gonna get what i [ __ ] want from


---------46:56----------
you


---------46:57----------
and so then you went the next level this


---------46:59----------
game isn't over yet i'm not taking the l


---------47:01----------
and then you were like okay so i'm going


---------47:04----------
to make this reddit post fine so then


---------47:06----------
like you did that you showed up on


---------47:07----------
stream


---------47:08----------
and then you were honest and then you


---------47:10----------
still wanted a particular thing


---------47:13----------
and then i pushed back a little bit and


---------47:14----------
then you were like no i still want this


---------47:16----------
thing from you i want to talk about


---------47:17----------
psycho immunology


---------47:18----------
can i please just talk about this can i


---------47:21----------
get what i need


---------47:22----------
from you and then i was like sort of


---------47:25----------
sure


---------47:26----------
and then what happened is like instead


---------47:27----------
of talking to you about psychoimmunology


---------47:29----------
and teaching you things and like


---------47:31----------
living up to your expectations i keep on


---------47:33----------
going in this different direction and


---------47:35----------
the more that i move away from the


---------47:36----------
vision that you had


---------47:38----------
the more you feel frustrated with


---------47:39----------
yourself for losing control of the


---------47:40----------
situation


---------47:42----------
you didn't lie about the only fans thing


---------47:44----------
just to have this conversation


---------47:45----------
you lied about the only fan's thing to


---------47:46----------
have the conversation that you wanted


---------47:50----------
right and so like what's yeah yeah


---------47:53----------
like like i should have just taken the l


---------47:56----------
if this is what i was gonna get


---------47:58----------
so like that's the frustration that i'm


---------48:01----------
getting from you and i think this is


---------48:02----------
really


---------48:03----------
your problem spencer i don't blame you


---------48:05----------
for having it i think we can explore


---------48:06----------
where this comes from but


---------48:07----------
i want you to notice this in the present


---------48:09----------
because i think you probably do a lot of


---------48:11----------
self-destructive things


---------48:13----------
to get your emotional needs met and then


---------48:16----------
you drive other people away


---------48:17----------
you put them in weird situations


---------48:20----------
right so and and what i mean by that is


---------48:22----------
like


---------48:24----------
you know so like you kind of showed up


---------48:28----------
in this conversation


---------48:29----------
to be under false pretense under false


---------48:31----------
pretenses and then you make it very


---------48:33----------
difficult


---------48:34----------
for me to give you what you wanted to


---------48:36----------
begin with


---------48:38----------
and the whole reason that you put us in


---------48:40----------
that situation in the first place


---------48:41----------
is because you wanted to control the


---------48:43----------
outcome you're not


---------48:45----------
giving me agency in this conversation


---------48:50----------
you're not giving me control to


---------48:52----------
participate in this conversation


---------48:55----------
and i think the reason that you're not


---------48:57----------
doing that is because somewhere along


---------48:58----------
the way


---------49:01----------
people didn't meet you halfway right


---------49:03----------
somewhere along the way you showed up


---------49:05----------
and you showed your feelings to other


---------49:07----------
people


---------49:08----------
and they were like [ __ ] you and so now


---------49:11----------
what you have to do


---------49:12----------
almost as a survival mechanism is


---------49:14----------
manipulate people


---------49:16----------
into being in the situation where they


---------49:19----------
won't reject you


---------49:21----------
and you keep on like maneuvering people


---------49:24----------
until like you get them into the


---------49:25----------
situation that you want to


---------49:28----------
but then that kind of shoots you in the


---------49:30----------
foot because i think the more open you


---------49:32----------
try to be with people


---------49:33----------
the more you open yourself up to like


---------49:36----------
toxic relationships


---------49:37----------
because you have these kind of patterns


---------49:39----------
like you have these hungers


---------49:41----------
and you're so hungry that it kind of


---------49:42----------
like you know you kind of talk about


---------49:44----------
trusting your intuition or not trusting


---------49:45----------
your intuition i think it's really good


---------49:47----------
that this is happening to you right now


---------49:48----------
i think this is actually going to help


---------49:50----------
you grow a lot


---------49:51----------
but if you take away the right lessons


---------49:52----------
from it which is


---------49:55----------
don't the lesson to take away from this


---------49:57----------
conversation is not to ever do this


---------49:58----------
again it's to do this way more


---------50:01----------
because if you genuinely want people to


---------50:04----------
connect with you


---------50:05----------
and respect you and love you you have to


---------50:08----------
give them a [ __ ] choice


---------50:11----------
you can't manipulate them into a corner


---------50:13----------
and then expect them to love you


---------50:16----------
that's how you end up in toxic


---------50:18----------
relationships and once again i don't


---------50:20----------
blame you for doing this i'm not mad at


---------50:23----------
you or anything like that i care about


---------50:24----------
you as a person i think you're a good


---------50:25----------
person i think it's actually a very


---------50:27----------
helpful stream


---------50:28----------
because i don't think a lot of people


---------50:30----------
realize that a lot of their manipulative


---------50:32----------
behavior


---------50:33----------
comes from a source of protection it


---------50:36----------
comes from hurt


---------50:37----------
it comes from like having this


---------50:39----------
fundamental need that like needed to be


---------50:41----------
met


---------50:42----------
that hasn't been met and can you really


---------50:45----------
br


---------50:45----------
blame a starving kid for like stealing a


---------50:48----------
loaf of bread


---------50:50----------
so a lot of the the things that we do


---------50:52----------
that are self-destructive


---------50:54----------
are like to meet fundamental needs that


---------50:57----------
we have


---------50:59----------
you look like you're can i say something


---------51:01----------
about it yeah yeah


---------51:03----------
so i have to say that the


---------51:08----------
like the decisions where i do stuff


---------51:11----------
that is not the thing that


---------51:14----------
i should or that not the thing that my


---------51:17----------
body tells me that


---------51:18----------
i should do are


---------51:23----------
oftentimes i do that in a in a sort of


---------51:25----------
mode in which i'm not


---------51:27----------
in which i'm not myself sounds sort of


---------51:30----------
weird but i see it as even a sort of


---------51:32----------
experimental sort of mode


---------51:33----------
yep and i keep limits to where


---------51:37----------
it's okay when i feel shame and it's


---------51:40----------
okay when


---------51:41----------
i am like when people see me sort of


---------51:44----------
weirdly


---------51:45----------
i never do it when i hurt other people


---------51:48----------
like there's there's a very


---------51:50----------
yeah it's i don't


---------51:53----------
i'm okay with with sounding or seeming


---------51:56----------
weird or manipulative at this point


---------52:00----------
but i don't want to be seen evil because


---------52:03----------
that's not who i am


---------52:05----------
yeah i i don't so that's why i've been


---------52:07----------
trying to be very careful about saying i


---------52:08----------
don't think you're a bad person spencer


---------52:10----------
i think what


---------52:11----------
what's happened with you is that you've


---------52:12----------
had a long-term emotional need that has


---------52:15----------
been relatively unmet


---------52:17----------
and your brain has learned


---------52:20----------
a particular tactic that sort of gets it


---------52:23----------
met


---------52:26----------
so it's just it's just like it's kind of


---------52:28----------
like saying like you know if i'm a kid


---------52:30----------
and i grew up starving and i stole


---------52:31----------
loaves of bread


---------52:33----------
to like feed myself when i'm a young


---------52:36----------
adult i'm gonna be a thief


---------52:39----------
and like that's just what i had to learn


---------52:41----------
to survive right it doesn't make me a


---------52:42----------
bad person it just like


---------52:46----------
it still means that i'm sort of


---------52:47----------
manipulative and not doing the right


---------52:49----------
thing but like there's a damn good


---------52:50----------
reason for it


---------52:52----------
and i'm not here to judge you i i think


---------52:54----------
i did at the beginning but i really


---------52:55----------
don't anymore because like what i'd


---------52:57----------
what i'd say is that like i think all


---------52:59----------
this [ __ ] is like just the way that you


---------53:00----------
learned how to survive


---------53:03----------
right because as you said i think you're


---------53:05----------
a pretty insightful dude and like you


---------53:06----------
weren't allowed to be sad and you had


---------53:08----------
emotional needs


---------53:09----------
and somewhere along the way you realize


---------53:11----------
that if you like kind of manipulate


---------53:12----------
people or if you


---------53:14----------
manipulating is such a negative


---------53:16----------
connotation i'm going to try to stop


---------53:17----------
using that word so let me


---------53:19----------
let me rephrase so i think you figured


---------53:21----------
out that there were certain


---------53:22----------
circumstances that you could create


---------53:25----------
that made it easier for your emotional


---------53:27----------
needs to be met


---------53:31----------
i think the challenge is that those


---------53:32----------
circumstances tend to


---------53:34----------
take free will away from other people


---------53:37----------
you kind of force them into a scenario


---------53:39----------
and i think the reason you end up in


---------53:41----------
toxic relation


---------53:42----------
we haven't even talked about any of this


---------53:43----------
[ __ ] but if i had to hypothesize


---------53:45----------
i'd say that you kind of probably like


---------53:47----------
pushed people into situations or they


---------53:49----------
pushed you into situations


---------53:50----------
there's something going on about like


---------53:52----------
you guys aren't too free


---------53:54----------
human beings with free will making


---------53:56----------
unencumbered choices


---------53:57----------
things are kind of tangled up and


---------53:59----------
confusing and you're kind of like


---------54:01----------
you're playing a game of chess with


---------54:02----------
another human being instead of like


---------54:04----------
having a conversation with them


---------54:07----------
because what you do is maneuver right


---------54:09----------
okay i applied to be on stream that


---------54:11----------
didn't work


---------54:12----------
let me move my queen over here let me


---------54:14----------
make a fake post on reddit and maybe


---------54:15----------
that'll work


---------54:16----------
and boy are you good at it my dude


---------54:18----------
you're very good at it


---------54:20----------
right you are the first person who has


---------54:22----------
made a reddit post that we've invited to


---------54:24----------
come on stream


---------54:26----------
and so you're very good at it


---------54:30----------
and we're not improving i'm not


---------54:32----------
impervious to manipulation in fact i'm


---------54:34----------
very easy to manipulate


---------54:37----------
i tend to let myself be manipulated


---------54:38----------
because i think it's okay


---------54:40----------
right so i i tend to recognize that


---------54:42----------
oftentimes people are manipulative not


---------54:44----------
because they're bad but because they've


---------54:45----------
like


---------54:46----------
they've learned some weird like you know


---------54:48----------
algorithm to get some need met


---------54:51----------
and in your case i think you've got to


---------54:52----------
be really careful spencer because i


---------54:54----------
think you're going to continue being


---------54:55----------
self-destructive in relationships


---------54:57----------
until you let people start rejecting you


---------55:02----------
but then good


---------55:07----------
so i feel like sure so i feel like i


---------55:10----------
hope that after this stream like i


---------55:12----------
feel like i can sort of close


---------55:15----------
this stuff off in my head that this


---------55:19----------
won't


---------55:20----------
fix me you know like that that


---------55:24----------
i can't manipulate or i can't sort of


---------55:27----------
force


---------55:29----------
something in order to not feel the pain


---------55:33----------
that i feel


---------55:34----------
absolutely but at the same time like


---------55:43----------
i think that's it yeah


---------55:46----------
so that's something i i i i very much


---------55:48----------
agree with that right like so i i think


---------55:50----------
that there's like weird stuff going on


---------55:52----------
like the


---------55:53----------
you know being mute for a year and stuff


---------55:55----------
like that like i'd love to ask you more


---------55:57----------
questions about that kind of stuff but i


---------55:58----------
just want to kind of lay out this


---------55:59----------
framework first that


---------56:00----------
i mean you've got to let people reject


---------56:02----------
you


---------56:04----------
right you've got to let people have


---------56:06----------
their agency


---------56:08----------
because as long as you maneuver people


---------56:11----------
to get


---------56:11----------
your needs met it's going to feel really


---------56:15----------
bad on the other side


---------56:18----------
because what are you doing to me spencer


---------56:19----------
you're not giving me a choice in this


---------56:21----------
matter


---------56:23----------
right you're getting your needs met but


---------56:25----------
what about my needs what about what i


---------56:30----------
wanted


---------56:35----------
right like what do you think about that


---------56:41----------
yeah so


---------56:46----------
part of me thinks that so i'm struggling


---------56:48----------
between


---------56:49----------
thinking that either way it would be


---------56:51----------
sort of helpful


---------56:53----------
and at the other end that i


---------56:56----------
sort of felt like being selfish would be


---------57:01----------
i don't know like


---------57:04----------
part of me is like okay i was being


---------57:06----------
selfish and this was sort of my


---------57:09----------
my way to try out if


---------57:12----------
this helps me and at the same time


---------57:16----------
i'm struggling with words i think


---------57:21----------
okay take your time


---------57:25----------
can you repeat the question yeah so so i


---------57:28----------
i'm actually okay with you being selfish


---------57:31----------
right so like


---------57:32----------
if you want to be selfish what i have a


---------57:33----------
problem with is you not being


---------57:34----------
transparent


---------57:37----------
because people come on here and are


---------57:39----------
[ __ ] selfish all the time like that's


---------57:41----------
what we're here for like i'm here for


---------57:42----------
you


---------57:43----------
every person who comes on stream i'm


---------57:44----------
here for them it's not about my needs


---------57:46----------
it's about their


---------57:47----------
needs and at the same time i think


---------57:50----------
you've got to be careful because like


---------57:53----------
i'm not hearing any consideration


---------57:56----------
from in your mind about what we're here


---------58:00----------
for


---------58:03----------
doesn't mean it isn't there it's just


---------58:04----------
i'm not hearing it so by all means if


---------58:06----------
it's there


---------58:07----------
let us know but i think like this is a


---------58:10----------
child


---------58:11----------
yeah go ahead i wanted to say it's


---------58:13----------
absolutely there


---------58:15----------
okay how so


---------58:18----------
i mean


---------58:23----------
so i generally genuinely appreciate


---------58:26----------
what you're doing and what's what's


---------58:29----------
healthy


---------58:32----------
gamer um


---------58:36----------
did you still hear me sorry the screen


---------58:37----------
went out yeah it lagged for a second but


---------58:40----------
i think we're back


---------58:41----------
okay


---------58:45----------
but i felt like whatever we would talk


---------58:48----------
about that would


---------58:49----------
be sort of for the greater good


---------58:52----------
anyway so it wasn't like i did this


---------58:54----------
purely for my own


---------58:57----------
reasons and i wouldn't like


---------59:02----------
in my head it felt like this wouldn't be


---------59:05----------
harmful for you so it wasn't


---------59:07----------
it's it still feels like it still still


---------59:10----------
sounds like this is really controlling


---------59:12----------
but


---------59:13----------
i felt like the limit within being


---------59:16----------
selfridge


---------59:17----------
was that it wasn't harmful or it wasn't


---------59:19----------
bad towards you


---------59:21----------
so i think that's a very good thing that


---------59:22----------
you're sharing spencer because i think


---------59:24----------
this is where you've got to be careful


---------59:26----------
okay so i think it's fine that you did


---------59:29----------
this


---------59:29----------
sort of i mean i don't want other people


---------59:31----------
to do it but i think it's fine that you


---------59:32----------
did it


---------59:34----------
and and but i think you've got to be


---------59:37----------
careful because i understand that you


---------59:39----------
have an


---------59:39----------
internal standard about what is harmful


---------59:42----------
to other people


---------59:43----------
and what isn't right here's the real


---------59:47----------
problem


---------59:47----------
is that like you've got to be careful


---------59:49----------
about you being


---------59:51----------
the determiner or the decider about what


---------59:54----------
is harmful for me


---------59:57----------
you can't use your standard of


---------60:01----------
harmfulness


---------60:02----------
if you're not being transparent


---------60:05----------
right the whole point of like agency in


---------60:08----------
a relationship and equality in a


---------60:09----------
relationship


---------60:10----------
is that you have to give me the option


---------60:13----------
to decide whether this is harmful for me


---------60:15----------
or not you don't get to pick


---------60:21----------
i understand where you're coming from i


---------60:23----------
don't think it's


---------60:24----------
an unreasonable way to think but i think


---------60:27----------
it's like


---------60:28----------
if you really want to have stable


---------60:30----------
healthy fulfilling relationships


---------60:32----------
i think you've really got to work on


---------60:33----------
this you've got to let


---------60:35----------
other people decide for themselves like


---------60:37----------
what's harmful or helpful


---------60:39----------
instead of figuring out what works for


---------60:41----------
you and doesn't hurt them


---------60:43----------
like all on your own like they have to


---------60:44----------
be involved in that process


---------60:46----------
does that make sense


---------60:50----------
yeah so i feel like


---------60:53----------
i do have a lot of healthy relationships


---------60:55----------
but i do have a lot of


---------60:57----------
unhealthy relationships i just want to


---------60:59----------
say that it's all


---------61:00----------
not all bad and that yep um


---------61:04----------
that it's helpful to hear this for


---------61:07----------
that unhealthy part and that i do


---------61:10----------
recognize me in it


---------61:12----------
and


---------61:15----------
yeah i don't know i have to i will have


---------61:17----------
to think about this later


---------61:18----------
i want to sort of let this sink in so i


---------61:21----------
also think spencer i'm not saying that


---------61:23----------
all of your relationships are a dumpster


---------61:25----------
fire i think if you look at your healthy


---------61:27----------
relationships


---------61:28----------
and your unhealthy relationships what i


---------61:30----------
would suspect and i encourage you to do


---------61:32----------
this


---------61:33----------
is that in some of them this whole all


---------61:35----------
this [ __ ] that we're talking about


---------61:37----------
is more active and in others


---------61:40----------
that hunger or that need that drives you


---------61:42----------
to like never take the l


---------61:44----------
you're able to control that a little bit


---------61:46----------
more or the reason that they're healthy


---------61:48----------
is because you do give those people


---------61:50----------
agency in relationships


---------61:51----------
you are transparent with them even if


---------61:53----------
you're selfish


---------61:55----------
because i i think it's fine for you to


---------61:56----------
be selfish in a relationship as long as


---------61:58----------
you're like


---------61:58----------
open with the other person you're like


---------62:00----------
hey man i've had a rough week


---------62:02----------
i actually don't give a [ __ ] about your


---------62:03----------
problems today can i just talk about


---------62:05----------
mine


---------62:06----------
and the whole reason that like this got


---------62:09----------
repaired i don't know if you recognize


---------62:10----------
this but


---------62:11----------
the whole reason that this was


---------62:12----------
salvageable is because you came out and


---------62:14----------
you were transparent in the first


---------62:15----------
sentence


---------62:18----------
and when you do that it gives us it sure


---------62:20----------
it can be hurtful


---------62:22----------
and feels like a betrayal a lot of that


---------62:23----------
good stuff but it helps


---------62:25----------
you and i move forward


---------62:29----------
can i ask you a question then yeah um


---------62:32----------
so the healthy relationships are those


---------62:34----------
where


---------62:35----------
i know that the other person will be


---------62:37----------
there either way and


---------62:39----------
that freedom gives me like sometimes i


---------62:42----------
i don't like sometimes i don't want to


---------62:45----------
talk about


---------62:45----------
stuff that i'm that's bothering me and


---------62:48----------
sometimes i do


---------62:49----------
and that freedom gives me a lot and then


---------62:51----------
it's not like it doesn't sucks energy


---------62:53----------
out of me when someone else complains or


---------62:57----------
someone else


---------62:57----------
like opens their heart to me


---------63:00----------
but whenever there's like a relationship


---------63:04----------
where our friendship where


---------63:07----------
the other person complains a lot and i


---------63:10----------
feel like


---------63:10----------
i want sort of i want to be a part of it


---------63:13----------
or i want to sort of


---------63:14----------
open my heart now and it feels like


---------63:20----------
so i know that i struggle with


---------63:23----------
the like with my own sort of


---------63:27----------
emotions over my own like whenever


---------63:30----------
there's emotions


---------63:31----------
i feel it physically because


---------63:34----------
yeah that's that's sort of what that


---------63:36----------
autoimmune stuff is and i


---------63:38----------
i like whenever someone like for example


---------63:41----------
when someone


---------63:42----------
is angry or is sort of expressing that


---------63:44----------
anger or sadness towards me


---------63:46----------
i get ill for a couple of days or weeks


---------63:49----------
and i know that the emotions of other


---------63:51----------
people can really like


---------63:53----------
really hurt me as like sticks and stones


---------63:56----------
may break my bones but words will


---------63:59----------
make my intestines bleed


---------64:02----------
and so it feels like


---------64:07----------
part of me sort of has to manipulate in


---------64:09----------
order to not get ill or if it's like


---------64:12----------
good but like some yeah relationships


---------64:15----------
the other person


---------64:16----------
[Music]


---------64:18----------
should give me the room to speak


---------64:21----------
more like should give me all the freedom


---------64:24----------
as like


---------64:25----------
i give them freedom because then i


---------64:30----------
and i heard less yeah so i i think


---------64:33----------
spencer that's once again very good


---------64:37----------
understanding on your part because i


---------64:38----------
think now we understand


---------64:41----------
how a good person can become so


---------64:44----------
manipulative


---------64:46----------
right so like like i think that's a very


---------64:48----------
good explanation of like


---------64:51----------
i can't afford to let


---------64:54----------
other people like reject me and make me


---------64:57----------
feel sad because my intestines start


---------64:59----------
bleeding when


---------65:00----------
when when that happens and so i think


---------65:03----------
this is like absolutely a learned


---------65:05----------
behavior dude


---------65:06----------
where like you learned a long time ago


---------65:08----------
that like you need to control because


---------65:10----------
you can't deal with the consequences if


---------65:12----------
they do reject you


---------65:14----------
and it makes perfect sense to me that


---------65:16----------
you feel free with some people because


---------65:18----------
if you know that they're get


---------65:19----------
if if their love for you is


---------65:21----------
unconditional you have no reason to


---------65:23----------
manipulate them


---------65:25----------
and so what i'm saying is that they're


---------65:26----------
like two like somewhere along the way


---------65:28----------
there's a fork in the road


---------65:29----------
and i think what happens is like you


---------65:31----------
sort of test them a little bit


---------65:33----------
you probably start out a little bit


---------65:35----------
manipulative and the more


---------65:37----------
that they like are unconditional towards


---------65:40----------
you the less you need to use those


---------65:42----------
things


---------65:44----------
right but like the more that they kind


---------65:46----------
of start to


---------65:48----------
push back against that kind of stuff or


---------65:50----------
if they don't give you what you need


---------65:52----------
this kind of controlling part of you


---------65:54----------
starts to rise up because


---------65:55----------
like it's very like physically painful


---------65:58----------
and like bad for your health


---------66:00----------
if they start rejecting you and make you


---------66:02----------
feel sad and stuff like that


---------66:04----------
but at the end of the day like no it's


---------66:06----------
not


---------66:09----------
it's not like rejecting me or making me


---------66:11----------
feel feel sad i think


---------66:13----------
the painful part is more when they


---------66:15----------
express their emotions and i don't get


---------66:18----------
to express mine


---------66:20----------
i don't get to express my struggle yeah


---------66:23----------
so i think that's what i mean by


---------66:25----------
rejection


---------66:26----------
so like this whole this whole thing


---------66:28----------
between me and you


---------66:29----------
is a great example of the drama that you


---------66:32----------
pull into other people


---------66:33----------
so let's think about this right like we


---------66:34----------
rejected you


---------66:36----------
and then you manipulated us


---------66:39----------
and then like i sort of rejected you at


---------66:42----------
the beginning and then you were like can


---------66:43----------
i please speak


---------66:44----------
and i think that like we were able to


---------66:45----------
move hopefully able to move past that


---------66:48----------
you voiced your discomfort i voiced my


---------66:50----------
discomfort


---------66:51----------
we shared like hey this isn't exactly


---------66:53----------
what i wanted it's not exactly what i


---------66:54----------
wanted


---------66:55----------
let's see what we can make of it and we


---------66:57----------
can kind of move forward


---------67:00----------
but like this whole thing about like i i


---------67:02----------
don't when i say rejecting i don't mean


---------67:04----------
that they call you mean or anything like


---------67:06----------
like they're mean to you i think it's


---------67:07----------
just rejection


---------67:09----------
i'm saying it goes back to the original


---------67:11----------
thing that you said about your dad


---------67:12----------
which is that you're not allowed to be


---------67:14----------
sad which is what we hear you say right


---------67:17----------
now it's like when


---------67:18----------
people in in relationships that you have


---------67:20----------
when they don't allow you to be sad


---------67:22----------
that's what hurts you


---------67:26----------
right that's what the rejection is you


---------67:27----------
can't be yourself they don't treat you


---------67:29----------
unconditionally


---------67:31----------
and the healthy relationships are the


---------67:33----------
ones where they genuinely allow you to


---------67:35----------
be sad


---------67:38----------
and so i'm not saying this is you all


---------67:41----------
the way through this


---------67:42----------
is how some scars work we have like


---------67:44----------
certain


---------67:45----------
like maladaptive programming that


---------67:47----------
activates in particular situations


---------67:50----------
and doesn't activate in other situations


---------67:52----------
and what i hate about western psychiatry


---------67:54----------
is that some people would look at you


---------67:56----------
and say like oh this person is


---------67:58----------
sociopathic


---------67:59----------
and it's binary i don't think you're


---------68:00----------
sociopathic i think that


---------68:02----------
there are times that you have emotional


---------68:04----------
needs that you


---------68:06----------
engage in manipulative behaviors to get


---------68:08----------
those needs met and i think there's a


---------68:10----------
damn good reason why you've learned how


---------68:12----------
to do it that way


---------68:13----------
i think it's very forgivable right


---------68:16----------
because that's what you like like


---------68:17----------
literally like you said sticks and


---------68:18----------
stones may break my bones but if


---------68:20----------
if you reject me my intestines are going


---------68:22----------
to bleed


---------68:23----------
it's like holy [ __ ] what would you


---------68:25----------
expect that person to do


---------68:27----------
just sit around get rejected and like be


---------68:29----------
[ __ ] blood for like


---------68:31----------
15 years of their life people are going


---------68:34----------
to do what they need to to survive


---------68:40----------
and in your case like i think you've


---------68:42----------
just got to be really careful because i


---------68:44----------
think the more that


---------68:45----------
these dynamics take control of your life


---------68:48----------
the more problems you're going to run


---------68:50----------
into


---------68:51----------
if you really want to get healed i think


---------68:53----------
it's about sort of removing


---------68:55----------
this part from acting


---------68:59----------
in your relationships


---------69:02----------
and recognize that someone in chat said


---------69:05----------
like you got to take a leap of faith


---------69:07----------
right which you sort of did by coming


---------69:08----------
here and i think this is actually really


---------69:10----------
good like i would be


---------69:11----------
i'm glad that this is not turning out


---------69:13----------
how you need it to


---------69:15----------
because the real lesson that i'd like


---------69:16----------
you to learn is that it's okay if things


---------69:19----------
don't turn out


---------69:20----------
the way that i need them to i can


---------69:22----------
survive that


---------69:24----------
because if you can learn that then you


---------69:26----------
don't need to manipulate people anymore


---------69:28----------
and if you don't manipulate people you


---------69:29----------
can form an authentic


---------69:31----------
open relationship with someone where


---------69:33----------
they can listen to your problems and you


---------69:35----------
can listen to theirs and then


---------69:36----------
over time you have all this pent up


---------69:39----------
sadness


---------69:40----------
that your dad stopped listening to when


---------69:42----------
you were like six


---------69:44----------
that you've gotta get out with a lot of


---------69:46----------
people


---------69:47----------
or a therapist which i don't know if


---------69:48----------
you've seen the therapist but this is


---------69:49----------
exactly what therapy is for


---------69:56----------
thoughts questions


---------70:03----------
yeah so this this is not what i


---------70:06----------
wanted i think but this is what i needed


---------70:08----------
is what you're saying i think


---------70:10----------
that's my assessment i could be wrong


---------70:16----------
yeah i'm i'm just i think i'm way too


---------70:20----------
confused about


---------70:22----------
all of this that i don't know what i


---------70:23----------
need or wants so


---------70:25----------
yeah i'll just i'll just accept your


---------70:28----------
judgment on it i think okay so let me


---------70:31----------
just say for the record


---------70:32----------
it's being too confused and not knowing


---------70:35----------
what you need and you want that makes


---------70:36----------
you perfect and appropriate to come on


---------70:38----------
stream


---------70:42----------
right that's what we look for we're here


---------70:45----------
to help people who don't know what they


---------70:46----------
need and don't know what they want


---------70:49----------
and i wouldn't accept my judgment i


---------70:51----------
wouldn't accept it as a conclusion i'd


---------70:53----------
take it as a hypothesis because i could


---------70:55----------
[ __ ] be wrong i mean what do i know i


---------70:56----------
met you like an hour ago


---------70:58----------
right so what do i know so i'd say like


---------71:01----------
this is for you to take home


---------71:03----------
and look at your own toxic relationships


---------71:05----------
maybe we can talk about it a little bit


---------71:06----------
if you want to


---------71:08----------
like if you want to i'm happy to hear a


---------71:10----------
little bit about


---------71:11----------
your period of time being mute or what


---------71:14----------
you said in terms of toxic relationships


---------71:16----------
and we can see whether some of this


---------71:18----------
pattern


---------71:19----------
applies now that we've generated a


---------71:20----------
hypothesis


---------71:22----------
we can like look at something in your


---------71:23----------
life and see if it fits or if it doesn't


---------71:26----------
and that's the way that this work gets


---------71:28----------
done yeah


---------71:32----------
is that like an invitation to talk now


---------71:34----------
about one of those things


---------71:36----------
sort of do you want to what do you think


---------71:38----------
about that


---------71:40----------
yeah so if if you are okay for it i


---------71:43----------
would like to talk about


---------71:44----------
a friend of mine um


---------71:48----------
i started dating her like a few years


---------71:50----------
ago for


---------71:51----------
a couple of times it didn't work out it


---------71:53----------
was on both sides we just went


---------71:55----------
for friendship and she like the


---------71:57----------
friendship grew really fast as in


---------72:00----------
she trusted me a lot and i trusted her


---------72:02----------
but she


---------72:03----------
talked a lot about her issues and there


---------72:06----------
was a


---------72:06----------
huge part of me that was jealous for her


---------72:10----------
issues being smaller than mine and for


---------72:12----------
her still to be sort of happy even


---------72:14----------
though she was


---------72:16----------
voicing her problems or troubles


---------72:21----------
and i felt like really angry that


---------72:24----------
sometimes she like she was really she


---------72:27----------
was a really good listener and i feel


---------72:28----------
really trust


---------72:29----------
trusted by her but she would like she


---------72:32----------
would listen


---------72:33----------
and then a part of like she would listen


---------72:36----------
and there's a part of me that


---------72:37----------
felt hurt like there's a bit of sort of


---------72:40----------
pain inside of me and there


---------72:42----------
she sort of touches it gently but it


---------72:45----------
doesn't go away and that


---------72:46----------
that made me sort of frustrated or angry


---------72:50----------
and so basically what


---------72:53----------
happened was i got sort of angrier and i


---------72:56----------
told her


---------72:57----------
um i


---------73:01----------
i told her through text like this this


---------73:04----------
might come out of nowhere but


---------73:06----------
i'm getting angrier and angrier by the


---------73:08----------
weeks to you and it's not


---------73:10----------
personal but we should break our


---------73:12----------
friendship for a while i don't know


---------73:14----------
what's going on but


---------73:16----------
i don't want to hurt you i don't want to


---------73:17----------
do anything bad towards you but i feel


---------73:19----------
this way and


---------73:21----------
this is like yeah so sort of the


---------73:25----------
friendship ended for a couple of months


---------73:26----------
and


---------73:27----------
we met up again and then it was sort of


---------73:28----------
awkward


---------73:30----------
and ever since we sort of broke up the


---------73:33----------
friendship


---------73:35----------
why were you getting angry at her what


---------73:37----------
were you getting angry at


---------73:43----------
i don't know part of it was that


---------73:46----------
i'm jealous for people voicing their


---------73:50----------
struggles


---------73:52----------
and it's not that bad


---------73:55----------
part of it was jealousy for her own life


---------73:57----------
even though


---------73:58----------
i was happy for her being like having a


---------74:02----------
sort of good life and part of it was


---------74:06----------
frustration like the biggest part was


---------74:08----------
frustration that she was


---------74:11----------
she was a good listener and


---------74:14----------
like she she touched a part in me and


---------74:17----------
every time


---------74:17----------
she touched that part she


---------74:20----------
backed away again like you're not a


---------74:22----------
therapist for friends


---------74:24----------
or you're not like people can't


---------74:28----------
fix you in that way if people can't take


---------74:29----------
that out but i felt really like


---------74:32----------
peace for the love of god sort of cut me


---------74:34----------
open and take that part of pain


---------74:36----------
out of me and sort of do that for me


---------74:39----------
like


---------74:40----------
it it felt like desperation


---------74:43----------
and i don't know


---------74:46----------
in other situations i feel like some


---------74:49----------
people


---------74:50----------
feel that desperation that you


---------74:53----------
when the other person feels when you


---------74:56----------
sent that text to her what did you want


---------74:58----------
her to do


---------75:02----------
uh


---------75:08----------
well i was mostly sort of surprised by


---------75:11----------
how


---------75:12----------
angry i got so it was really like i


---------75:15----------
don't


---------75:15----------
i hope you sort of back off it wasn't


---------75:18----------
like i wanted


---------75:19----------
like i i feel like you are you're going


---------75:22----------
to like that i want her to


---------75:25----------
take my pain away anyway or something i


---------75:27----------
don't know what you're going to


---------75:29----------
i'm just wondering so like so remember


---------75:31----------
so there are a couple of features


---------75:34----------
of this pattern right so one is there's


---------75:36----------
some kind of a rejection anger


---------75:38----------
frustration


---------75:39----------
so i'm definitely getting all three of


---------75:40----------
those from this scenario


---------75:42----------
what i what i'm not hearing is like what


---------75:45----------
what you envisioned


---------75:46----------
from your relationship with her


---------75:50----------
right so you said a little bit of that


---------75:52----------
that she didn't give you what you


---------75:53----------
envisioned because you wanted her to go


---------75:55----------
deep


---------75:56----------
you wanted her to like and i think


---------75:58----------
there's a subtle rejection there because


---------76:01----------
instead of like she would


---------76:04----------
she was a good listener because you're


---------76:06----------
saying a lot of positive stuff about her


---------76:07----------
but you're getting angrier and angrier


---------76:09----------
so that tells me like there's some kind


---------76:10----------
of weird defensive positive [ __ ]


---------76:12----------
like what were you pissed about


---------76:14----------
spencer and i think that you judge


---------76:17----------
yourself for being angry


---------76:19----------
about this so just say it


---------76:22----------
what were you angry at


---------76:30----------
i don't know it was just


---------76:35----------
how did it feel when she was just gently


---------76:37----------
and then back away


---------76:41----------
frustrating what was frustrating about


---------76:46----------
it


---------76:51----------
it's yeah it's like


---------76:55----------
so i can deal with like it's easier to


---------77:00----------
only eats [ __ ] or only eats


---------77:04----------
sugar but when you give someone [ __ ] and


---------77:07----------
then [ __ ] and then


---------77:08----------
a pinch of sugar and then [ __ ] again


---------77:10----------
like that pinch of sugar is


---------77:12----------
is annoying like i annoying is the wrong


---------77:16----------
word but i'd rather like


---------77:18----------
not get a sweet taste for a little


---------77:20----------
second


---------77:22----------
and yeah


---------77:26----------
yeah so what i'm hearing about is that


---------77:27----------
she didn't care about you


---------77:29----------
enough


---------77:36----------
yeah but that's that's a weird judgment


---------77:39----------
like i did


---------77:39----------
i wouldn't expect anyone to take that


---------77:42----------
away from me


---------77:43----------
yeah the same thing yeah i had that need


---------77:46----------
yes spencer so you gotta stop


---------77:47----------
judging yourself for irrational and


---------77:50----------
shitty feelings


---------77:52----------
because you're not even you're like oh


---------77:54----------
no like there's no way that that's how i


---------77:55----------
feel so let me just pretend i don't feel


---------77:57----------
that way


---------77:58----------
and that's why your ass is bleeding


---------78:02----------
right because you have to like you have


---------78:04----------
to like let yourself feel these negative


---------78:06----------
things you have to acknowledge that


---------78:08----------
you're not


---------78:09----------
there are parts of you that are like


---------78:12----------
not good do i think you're a good person


---------78:16----------
yeah do i think you can be pretty


---------78:18----------
manipulative sometimes


---------78:19----------
yeah do i think the things that drive


---------78:21----------
you to be manipulative


---------78:23----------
or like saintly feelings absolutely not


---------78:27----------
i think there are little mean despicable


---------78:30----------
parts inside of you that you don't like


---------78:31----------
to accept


---------78:35----------
and i think those are the parts that you


---------78:36----------
have to like you have to let yourself


---------78:38----------
like you're like a


---------78:39----------
like there's a lot of bitterness inside


---------78:41----------
you haven't used that word at all


---------78:43----------
but boy are you better does ever feel


---------78:46----------
that way


---------78:47----------
like you've got this rot that you want


---------78:49----------
her to like reach your hands and just


---------78:51----------
take that ball of [ __ ]


---------78:53----------
just yank it right out of you like


---------78:55----------
that's what you want you want someone to


---------78:56----------
come in there and just like


---------78:57----------
take it out of you right like do like


---------78:59----------
surgery and there's like this ball of


---------79:02----------
like bitterness and nastiness


---------79:06----------
and she's like gentle and listens


---------79:10----------
and approaches you respectfully and


---------79:12----------
you're like [ __ ] that


---------79:14----------
right it's bizarre and then it's really


---------79:17----------
confusing for you because like i don't


---------79:18----------
understand this


---------79:19----------
like we're good friends like we tried


---------79:21----------
dating that didn't work out it seems


---------79:22----------
like you guys had a genuine connection


---------79:24----------
and then you noticed some weird-ass


---------79:26----------
feelings which is that like the more


---------79:27----------
gentle she is with you the more angry


---------79:29----------
you get at her


---------79:31----------
it's like what is going on there and i


---------79:34----------
think it comes back to like she's


---------79:36----------
rejecting you right she's not letting


---------79:38----------
you


---------79:39----------
be that whole way


---------79:42----------
she's not letting you


---------79:45----------
be completely sad


---------79:48----------
you know she's not it's just it's just


---------79:50----------
like your dad man because you're like


---------79:51----------
saying my dad really wasn't abusive he


---------79:53----------
just kind of gave me a light smack on


---------79:54----------
the head


---------79:55----------
it was gentle just like a little bit


---------79:59----------
right it's like not stark things and


---------80:00----------
that's how some scar works because


---------80:02----------
there's something that


---------80:03----------
like your mind if someone's like frankly


---------80:05----------
abusive i think you're like go [ __ ]


---------80:07----------
yourself and you move on with your life


---------80:09----------
you're good enough to do that it's these


---------80:11----------
people who are like gentle with you


---------80:14----------
these people who are like not willing to


---------80:16----------
like go


---------80:17----------
the depth that you want to go and i


---------80:19----------
think if you really look at that


---------80:21----------
relationship


---------80:21----------
spencer this is the really tricky thing


---------80:24----------
i'd wonder


---------80:25----------
whether part of what was holding her


---------80:28----------
back


---------80:28----------
was actually you


---------80:33----------
for sure right so then like


---------80:37----------
now we get into why you're


---------80:38----------
self-destructive because you hold her


---------80:40----------
back


---------80:41----------
and then you blame her for not jumping


---------80:44----------
forward


---------80:46----------
and so it all starts with you figuring


---------80:49----------
out


---------80:50----------
how do you influence other people in the


---------80:53----------
relationship


---------80:54----------
because you paint us into a [ __ ]


---------80:55----------
corner and then you get upset with us


---------80:58----------
for not giving you what you wanted


---------81:03----------
and so i think what you've got to start


---------81:04----------
doing is like like


---------81:06----------
stop you know i don't know what you did


---------81:08----------
but you said for sure so you seem


---------81:09----------
confident


---------81:11----------
and i think you know but i mean


---------81:14----------
desperation is something that people


---------81:16----------
sense i think


---------81:18----------
yeah and so were you not showing her


---------81:26----------
desperation


---------81:29----------
i was i think okay and what did she do


---------81:32----------
with it


---------81:35----------
did you manipulate her


---------81:39----------
no she rejected it and i felt angry and


---------81:41----------
i didn't manip


---------81:42----------
like i think that if i from that anger


---------81:46----------
point


---------81:46----------
was manipulative i would be the most


---------81:49----------
abusive


---------81:50----------
piece of [ __ ] that existed like i think


---------81:53----------
that


---------81:54----------
manipulation and anger is a bad


---------81:56----------
combination


---------81:58----------
that didn't indulge in anger


---------82:03----------
does that make sense yeah so i i think


---------82:06----------
so i think maybe you've gotta indulge a


---------82:09----------
little bit


---------82:10----------
okay so


---------82:17----------
i mean but i i think we're seeing that


---------82:19----------
same pattern because you're kind of


---------82:21----------
saying that like you know you showed her


---------82:23----------
the desperation and what did she do


---------82:30----------
rejected it is that how you feel


---------82:38----------
partly but i wasn't transparent


---------82:42----------
yeah so that's what i'm confused about


---------82:43----------
because now i can see why things are


---------82:45----------
confusing for you because they seem


---------82:46----------
confusing for me too


---------82:47----------
because you you say you show her your


---------82:49----------
desperation but you also say you weren't


---------82:51----------
transparent so like


---------82:52----------
which was it um


---------82:58----------
both yeah so so then like


---------83:01----------
so that makes sense so then like let's


---------83:03----------
just think about that right so if you're


---------83:05----------
not transparent and you show her a flash


---------83:07----------
of desperation


---------83:08----------
and you want her to dive in but you


---------83:10----------
haven't been transparent with her


---------83:12----------
you're like judging her for like an


---------83:14----------
unfair ask


---------83:18----------
because what i'm hearing is that what


---------83:19----------
i'm hearing from you is what was angry


---------83:21----------
was that you showed her she did not


---------83:24----------
she was listening and tried to help you


---------83:27----------
feel better


---------83:28----------
but like she gave you just a little bit


---------83:31----------
like she gave you a little bit of sugar


---------83:33----------
in your cup of [ __ ] and it wasn't enough


---------83:35----------
to sweeten it


---------83:37----------
and at the same time like how much of it


---------83:39----------
was she aware because you may have just


---------83:41----------
shown her


---------83:42----------
like just a tiny little layer of [ __ ]


---------83:43----------
and she was like okay so here's a little


---------83:45----------
bit of sugar


---------83:48----------
and so it's hard because people are


---------83:50----------
going to judge you and you've been


---------83:51----------
rejected when you show yourself to


---------83:52----------
people


---------83:53----------
hell i did it today right hopefully you


---------83:56----------
still don't feel that way


---------83:58----------
and so it's going to be like really hard


---------84:00----------
it requires courage dude


---------84:02----------
it requires courage and it requires like


---------84:05----------
letting other people make their choices


---------84:07----------
about whether they want to accept you or


---------84:09----------
not which is really really hard when you


---------84:11----------
don't feel like


---------84:13----------
you're you know worth much or other


---------84:16----------
people have made you feel like you're


---------84:17----------
not worth much


---------84:19----------
i don't like the phrasing that i use


---------84:20----------
there i was trying to find the right


---------84:21----------
word


---------84:23----------
it's hard to open yourself up to be


---------84:25----------
rejected by people when you've been


---------84:26----------
rejected by


---------84:27----------
really important people in your life


---------84:29----------
like your dad


---------84:32----------
and i think that it makes sense to me


---------84:33----------
that you know you've got what sounds


---------84:35----------
like some kind of psychological mutism


---------84:38----------
for like one year of your life that was


---------84:40----------
sort of like psychosomatic in nature


---------84:43----------
so there's something going on with your


---------84:44----------
your physical body and your mind that


---------84:46----------
we're kind of wrapped on


---------84:47----------
you know crohn's disease is not quite as


---------84:50----------
um psychologically influenced as ibs


---------84:55----------
um so that has this very strong uh you


---------84:57----------
know com


---------84:59----------
component but for you know for


---------85:00----------
definitely for crohn's disease i'd say


---------85:02----------
like you should go see a medical doctor


---------85:03----------
for that in addition to a therapist


---------85:05----------
so i have a lot of patients who have


---------85:06----------
crohn's um


---------85:09----------
and i think it's fine to work on the


---------85:10----------
psycho neuroimmunology stuff but i think


---------85:12----------
at the end of the day


---------85:14----------
you know spencer you have to let


---------85:15----------
yourself be rejected a little bit more


---------85:19----------
because when you let yourself do that is


---------85:21----------
when you'll


---------85:22----------
give people the opportunity to love you


---------85:24----------
unconditionally


---------85:27----------
right and then you get frustrated


---------85:29----------
because you don't give people like you


---------85:30----------
don't show people


---------85:31----------
everything and then they don't respond


---------85:33----------
the way that you want them to


---------85:36----------
which is like that's never gonna look


---------85:38----------
you're that's never gonna work


---------85:48----------
thoughts questions


---------85:51----------
yeah so


---------85:55----------
in my experience and i've been with a


---------85:58----------
lot of people with


---------85:59----------
crohn's disease and i'm really biased in


---------86:02----------
this and i don't know that much but


---------86:05----------
it seems that most people with crohn's


---------86:07----------
disease like it started from


---------86:09----------
a situation where they were in a really


---------86:12----------
stressful situation


---------86:14----------
really with suppressive like suppressive


---------86:17----------
emotions


---------86:18----------
and that sure ibs


---------86:22----------
is is also sort of like that but


---------86:26----------
i figured like i don't know


---------86:30----------
it's confusing and i think that we've


---------86:32----------
talked for a while and now i feel foggy


---------86:34----------
in my head


---------86:35----------
so okay so maybe enough for today i'm


---------86:38----------
gonna try to


---------86:40----------
read into the question that you wanted


---------86:42----------
to ask and i'll give you an answer so


---------86:44----------
here's the question that i heard


---------86:48----------
crohn's disease oftentimes manifests


---------86:50----------
during periods of high stress


---------86:53----------
did i get crohn's disease because i was


---------86:55----------
super stressed


---------86:56----------
is that your question yeah i mean


---------86:59----------
part of is of course like genetically


---------87:02----------
and it's just bad luck but it's also


---------87:05----------
like the


---------87:07----------
cases of crohn's disease have been


---------87:10----------
so much higher than years ago as far as


---------87:13----------
i know


---------87:14----------
that i feel like the


---------87:17----------
mental health epidemic also has a lot to


---------87:20----------
do like


---------87:21----------
like this this autoimmune disease


---------87:24----------
epidemic


---------87:24----------
as far as i know like i'm not i don't


---------87:26----------
know a lot about it but


---------87:28----------
as far as crohn's disease does i know a


---------87:30----------
little bit about it


---------87:32----------
but mental health seems to be so much


---------87:35----------
like


---------87:36----------
connected with it i don't know how to


---------87:38----------
say it yeah so here's what i'd say so


---------87:40----------
like if you think about something like


---------87:42----------
depression right so there's some genetic


---------87:45----------
you know influence on depression but


---------87:47----------
generally speaking


---------87:49----------
stress exposes our vulnerabilities and


---------87:52----------
exposes our weaknesses


---------87:54----------
right so if i take let's say like a


---------87:57----------
building


---------87:58----------
and then i subject the building to a


---------88:01----------
stress every


---------88:02----------
every building is going to crack in


---------88:04----------
different places


---------88:06----------
and so the way that i understand crohn's


---------88:08----------
disease is it stress related absolutely


---------88:10----------
it's just in some people the stress


---------88:13----------
cracks


---------88:14----------
in terms of your gi system like crohn's


---------88:16----------
disease


---------88:17----------
in other people it cracks like


---------88:19----------
depression


---------88:20----------
in other people it cracks like blood


---------88:22----------
pressure


---------88:24----------
and so the the fact still remains that


---------88:26----------
if you remove the stress


---------88:28----------
or you treat the stress then depression


---------88:30----------
will get better


---------88:31----------
blood pressure will get better and


---------88:32----------
crohn's disease will get better


---------88:34----------
and that's what evidence-based medicine


---------88:36----------
tells us


---------88:38----------
so i think that you drew the short straw


---------88:40----------
in terms of having some kind of like


---------88:42----------
predisposition to disease


---------88:46----------
and i'm a big fan of something called


---------88:48----------
the stress diathesis model of disease


---------88:51----------
which means that we have a vulnerability


---------88:53----------
plus a circumstance


---------88:55----------
is what leads to disease it's not like


---------88:58----------
you are destined to get the disease


---------89:00----------
and it's not like it's all stress it's


---------89:02----------
like environment plus


---------89:04----------
genetics is what leads to disease


---------89:08----------
and in your case you know just something


---------89:10----------
about the way that you are your genetics


---------89:12----------
make you prone to get crohn's


---------89:14----------
and i think that if you work on your


---------89:16----------
mental health and you work on your


---------89:17----------
stress your crohn's should get better


---------89:19----------
and that's like a


---------89:20----------
database statement it's not like a


---------89:22----------
specific diagnostic thing it's just if


---------89:24----------
you look at the data


---------89:25----------
on autoimmune and inflammatory diseases


---------89:28----------
things like mindfulness and other kinds


---------89:30----------
of stress reduction interventions


---------89:32----------
tend to lead to positive outcomes


---------89:37----------
so i'd say that you know definitely work


---------89:39----------
on your stress definitely work on this


---------89:40----------
stuff


---------89:42----------
um you know try to build healthy


---------89:44----------
relationships


---------89:46----------
try to let yourself be a little bit more


---------89:48----------
vulnerable


---------89:49----------
and learn how to tolerate a little bit


---------89:51----------
more rejection


---------89:52----------
and then you'll begin to see something


---------89:54----------
which i i think you really have to learn


---------89:56----------
which is that when people reject you


---------89:57----------
oftentimes it has nothing to do with you


---------90:01----------
it has a lot to do with them


---------90:06----------
right so like whether i reject you or


---------90:08----------
not doesn't have much to do with what


---------90:10----------
you do because you're going to do what


---------90:11----------
you're going to do


---------90:12----------
it's going to be like how do i choose to


---------90:14----------
respond so other human beings have


---------90:16----------
agency


---------90:16----------
and other human beings do a bad job from


---------90:18----------
time to time it doesn't mean that you're


---------90:20----------
a bad person


---------90:22----------
but sometimes it can feel that way when


---------90:23----------
we're a child and our dad you know


---------90:25----------
smacks us for crying


---------90:27----------
we can feel like we're a bad person


---------90:31----------
we don't think in that moment that my


---------90:32----------
dad isn't doing the right thing


---------90:34----------
right like you can look back on it now


---------90:35----------
and you can say my dad shouldn't have


---------90:36----------
done that but


---------90:37----------
in the moment when you're a child you


---------90:39----------
think you're the you know you think that


---------90:40----------
you made a mistake


---------90:43----------
you don't have the wherewithal to judge


---------90:44----------
people for their mistakes and so that's


---------90:46----------
another capacity that you need to learn


---------90:49----------
which is give people agency and then


---------90:51----------
judge them for it


---------90:56----------
anyway enough for today


---------91:02----------
okay so


---------91:06----------
final thoughts like one one final


---------91:08----------
thought yeah please


---------91:10----------
okay i just wanted to say sorry to moses


---------91:14----------
that's that's basically it


---------91:17----------
sorry but like it was it was nice though


---------91:21----------
and it felt bad yeah


---------91:24----------
so i i think that's it i'm glad you


---------91:26----------
apologized to moses because


---------91:28----------
he works really hard to try to


---------91:32----------
you know set up something and i'm glad


---------91:34----------
you apologized to him


---------91:38----------
okay well listen spencer good luck to


---------91:41----------
you seriously man


---------91:43----------
i don't think you're a bad person i


---------91:44----------
think you know just continue to learn


---------91:46----------
about yourself


---------91:47----------
try to be a little bit mindful of that


---------91:49----------
hunger that need whether you give into


---------91:51----------
it or you don't give in to it


---------91:53----------
be aware of it and what it pushes you to


---------91:55----------
do and the last thing that i'd say to


---------91:56----------
you is be careful about


---------91:58----------
its conclusions after you quote unquote


---------92:00----------
make a mistake


---------92:02----------
because even though you felt like this


---------92:03----------
was uncomfortable and that you made a


---------92:05----------
mistake by coming on or saying this or


---------92:07----------
whatever


---------92:07----------
i don't think this was a mistake i think


---------92:09----------
it's just gonna make you [ __ ]


---------92:10----------
uncomfortable


---------92:11----------
and that's actually the kind of growth


---------92:13----------
that you need is to learn


---------92:15----------
how to not satisfy that hunger and be


---------92:18----------
okay with it


---------92:21----------
okay yeah so absolutely


---------92:24----------
i think that those instances where i


---------92:27----------
made quote-unquote mistakes were the


---------92:29----------
things that


---------92:30----------
made me learn stuff but yep yeah


---------92:33----------
sometimes it's sort of


---------92:35----------
more comfortable or more sort of better


---------92:38----------
and other instances yeah absolutely


---------92:42----------
right so sometimes learning


---------92:44----------
unfortunately is not


---------92:45----------
easy oftentimes the most important


---------92:49----------
things we learn in life are the most


---------92:50----------
painful


---------92:51----------
which is how our brain is wired because


---------92:53----------
our hippocampus is right next to our


---------92:55----------
amygdala


---------92:56----------
so where we experience negative emotion


---------92:58----------
is right next to where we learn


---------93:00----------
and we learn from negative experiences


---------93:02----------
more powerfully than positive


---------93:04----------
experiences


---------93:07----------
okay which is you know anyway a survival


---------93:09----------
mechanism but thanks for coming on


---------93:10----------
spencer good luck to you


---------93:12----------
and um yeah try not to manipulate people


---------93:15----------
as best as possible


---------93:16----------
okay sure thank you to you and it's it's


---------93:19----------

---------93:20----------
