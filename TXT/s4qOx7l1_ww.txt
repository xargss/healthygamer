---------00:00----------
yeah so the ego arises is a protective


---------00:04----------
mechanism it's like the bouncer of your


---------00:05----------
mind so for example if I ask someone out


---------00:08----------
on a date and they turn me down


---------00:10----------
then my ego says oh they're not actually


---------00:12----------
that pretty I was doing them a favor


---------00:14----------
does that make sense that that people


---------00:16----------
will have those kinds of thoughts yeah


---------00:21----------
well i am i calling you loser fruit by


---------00:24----------
the way um yeah you can just call me


---------00:26----------
Kathleen Kathleen okay yeah


---------00:28----------
because sometimes I you know I truncate


---------00:30----------
when people have a compound name or use


---------00:32----------
like a first part of the name and it


---------00:35----------
yeah yeah thanks for coming on Kathleen


---------00:40----------
so help me understand a little bit about


---------00:41----------
what we're gonna be talking about today


---------00:42----------
and and how we can be helpful or


---------00:45----------
actually should I ask you to it actually


---------00:47----------
first let's introduce you yeah because


---------00:49----------
I've been told I should ask people to do


---------00:51----------
that because I'm eager to dive right in


---------00:52----------
but can you just tell us a little bit


---------00:54----------
about yourself and so you're a streamer


---------00:56----------
and yeah so and Kathleen loses fruit and


---------01:00----------
Australian streamer I used to live in a


---------01:02----------
gaming house called okay Cass and now I


---------01:06----------
just do YouTube and streaming okay


---------01:09----------
awesome cool yeah and is there something


---------01:11----------
in particular that you wanted to talk


---------01:13----------
about today um I think one of the main


---------01:17----------
things was panic attacks okay on stream


---------01:20----------
and oh my gos and how I guess being


---------01:25----------
opened with mental health and having an


---------01:28----------
audience you know and then they come to


---------01:30----------
you to you with their problems and how


---------01:32----------
like that's a lot wow so people come to


---------01:35----------
you with their problems I mean yeah I


---------01:38----------
mean it's like twitch chat like people


---------01:39----------
are very openness so okay okay I'm glad


---------01:43----------
they're sharing it could be a lot to


---------01:45----------
handle and then yeah I guess the last


---------01:48----------
thing was about um dealing with a few


---------01:50----------
people I think think I like gaslighting


---------01:52----------
me and I just don't know how to do that


---------01:54----------
well say okay that's scary yeah so what


---------02:04----------
would you what would you like to start


---------02:08----------
with like panic attacks or panic attacks


---------02:10----------
yeah yeah so help me understand what you


---------02:12----------
mean by a panic attack um sometimes you


---------02:16----------
get just super nervous and then


---------02:18----------
everything just stops functioning and I


---------02:21----------
just can't do anything for like about a


---------02:24----------
half an hour or something like that it's


---------02:26----------
just everything just gets really I guess


---------02:31----------
Larry and too much and overwhelming and


---------02:34----------
I just kind of just lay there sit there


---------02:36----------
and just kind of take it it sounds awful


---------02:40----------
yeah a very nervous person I think okay


---------02:44----------
are you feeling nervous right now


---------02:47----------
mmm-hmm yeah um yeah so let's just so I


---------02:51----------
want you to do me a favor


---------02:53----------
can you close your eyes for a second


---------02:54----------
yeah okay so like there's something like


---------02:57----------
the panic attack actually happening


---------02:58----------
right now right just nervousness so


---------03:03----------
what's the difference um the difference


---------03:06----------
is I guess I just I can't function when


---------03:11----------
I'm having the panic attack I get breath


---------03:13----------
is I can't breathe very well okay and


---------03:17----------
yeah you know kind of like wanted I type


---------03:20----------
thing yeah do you want to die or you


---------03:22----------
feel like you're gonna die and I say


---------03:24----------
it's um like feel like I'm going to die


---------03:26----------
yeah yeah but I yeah


---------03:28----------
have you seen some what about this like


---------03:30----------
a mental health professional hmm no it's


---------03:34----------
only happened to me like three times I'd


---------03:36----------
say in the past years sir Oh in the past


---------03:39----------
year oh that's not that much you say


---------03:42----------
last for about half an hour yeah but


---------03:44----------
okay sometimes I could feel them coming


---------03:46----------
on and then I just try to help myself


---------03:48----------
stop it oh you have stopped it I think I


---------03:54----------
have yeah okay that's pretty amazing how


---------03:56----------
do anything yet how do you do that I


---------03:59----------
don't I am focused on one thing and then


---------04:02----------
I just like a pen or something and look


---------04:04----------
at it and then it just yeah I hope it


---------04:06----------
doesn't happen yeah okay and so as you


---------04:11----------
when you start to feel it coming on what


---------04:13----------
do you feel um you know like the world's


---------04:19----------
coming in on me I guess okay just being


---------04:22----------
searched into like a tight space okay


---------04:25----------
yeah so like like there's not enough


---------04:28----------
space for you to exist and everything on


---------04:30----------
the outside is kind of pressing into you


---------04:33----------
I'm kind of like that but it's also very


---------04:35----------
much internally as well what do you mean


---------04:39----------
by that like the chest chest is like


---------04:41----------
there's something around the chest it's


---------04:43----------
just like grab hiding to it yeah okay is


---------04:47----------
there something in particular that


---------04:48----------
brings it on um I haven't really been


---------04:53----------
able to pinpoint that to be honest with


---------04:55----------
you um I don't know if it's just stress


---------04:59----------
so like something gets like there's too


---------05:04----------
much attention or something like that


---------05:05----------
that's something like that yeah yeah I


---------05:07----------
mean I guess if it's happened three


---------05:09----------
times in two years it's hard to kind of


---------05:11----------
pick out a pattern yeah okay you know it


---------05:15----------
sounds like you've had a couple of other


---------05:17----------
times that maybe it was gonna happen and


---------05:19----------
by concentrating on a specific object


---------05:21----------
you've been able to kind of keep it at


---------05:23----------
bay yeah and sometimes sometimes I think


---------05:27----------
it might have happened but I don't know


---------05:29----------
if it was as bad as the other time so I


---------05:30----------
don't know if that count okay and


---------05:32----------
doesn't happen it has it ever woken you


---------05:34----------
up from sleep no okay and are you


---------05:38----------
nervous about something when these these


---------05:40----------
panic attacks happen yes yeah yeah okay


---------05:45----------
is something in particular


---------05:49----------
hmm I guess I'm like not doing enough


---------05:54----------
and not being good enough this is the


---------05:56----------
main thing that really I think triggers


---------05:59----------
them so I'm just yeah I guess because


---------06:01----------
I've had it when playing games once too


---------06:04----------
you know it's just like not good enough


---------06:05----------
and yeah I think it's a lot of that a


---------06:07----------
lot of okay insecurities yeah it and so


---------06:11----------
when you say insecurities you mean you


---------06:13----------
you feel like you're not doing a good


---------06:15----------
enough job yeah I feel that a lot now


---------06:20----------
okay and what does a good enough job


---------06:23----------
look like how would you know if you were


---------06:25----------
doing a good enough job I'm gonna just


---------06:27----------
see the cough drop okay okay um I don't


---------06:30----------
I don't know um I guess when I see


---------06:32----------
everyone surrounding me and like that


---------06:35----------
they're doing good enough and I just I


---------06:37----------
don't know if I ever am yeah only if you


---------06:40----------
mean happy I guess lately it's how


---------06:44----------
well yeah you have been happy you said


---------06:47----------
like I really have a few times I've been


---------06:50----------
happy we like okay that was I was a good


---------06:52----------
stream that was a good video I really


---------06:55----------
had that thing a few songs when he lost


---------06:57----------
yeah put a lot of pressure on yourself


---------07:00----------
yeah for as long as I know yeah I'd say


---------07:11----------
yeah since you're a young kid yeah yeah


---------07:15----------
I gotta do the best best I can do you


---------07:21----------
have to do the best that you can or you


---------07:22----------
have to do the best there's a big


---------07:24----------
difference then oh no I don't have to do


---------07:26----------
the best but the best I can


---------07:28----------
yeah yeah because I know I've accepted a


---------07:32----------
long time ago that I know the best thing


---------07:33----------
good for you yeah and and so you feel


---------07:38----------
like you're you're not usually doing the


---------07:39----------
best that you can


---------07:41----------
yeah I feel like I am just I don't know


---------07:44----------
I guess when I see other people


---------07:47----------
extremely and I see myself dream you had


---------07:50----------
compared myself which I know I shouldn't


---------07:51----------
do but I can't help myself because I


---------07:53----------
like to draw inspiration from other


---------07:55----------
people like anyone would so I see my


---------07:57----------
friend who I lived in in that gaming


---------08:00----------
house which I just moved out of a week


---------08:01----------
ago um


---------08:02----------
Cray and I see him like he's so


---------08:05----------
energetic and loud and stream and I get


---------08:07----------
so jealous cuz I'm more like I'm more


---------08:09----------
very relaxed than that and I'm just like


---------08:13----------
I guess I'm like I found out that energy


---------08:16----------
I'm not providing enough I'm not as


---------08:18----------
funny as he is with that and I just I


---------08:20----------
just get that so I'm like what do I have


---------08:23----------
to offer


---------08:24----------
how can I be good and what do you have


---------08:27----------
to offer yeah that's that's a question I


---------08:40----------
mean


---------08:42----------
I'm prettier aquella duh keeping things


---------08:46----------
going along when I'm streaming with


---------08:48----------
friends and like asking them questions


---------08:50----------
and getting them like I think that's one


---------08:53----------
of the things I can offer ya it's like


---------08:56----------
okay kind of moving things along oh yeah


---------09:00----------
can I just think for a second yeah is


---------09:03----------
that gonna make you nervous if I just


---------09:05----------
sit here quietly for just a second no


---------09:07----------
okay


---------09:16----------
so your people people like watching you


---------09:22----------
right like people come and sometimes


---------09:24----------
they feel really really comfortable and


---------09:26----------
they will sometimes share things from


---------09:29----------
their personal life because they feel


---------09:30----------
supported or they feel like it's a safe


---------09:33----------
space for them to talk about their own


---------09:36----------
problems yep yeah what do you think


---------09:40----------
about that um I mean it's really cool I


---------09:45----------
love I have a really like open community


---------09:47----------
I feel and then yeah I've got a little


---------09:50----------
community at giving back and it's it's


---------09:53----------
nice to say that um yeah I guess


---------09:56----------
sometimes gets a bit too much when


---------09:59----------
people bring up particularly when I'm


---------10:00----------
trying to like you know I'm trying to


---------10:02----------
make stream I'm trying to like have this


---------10:04----------
like positive attitude I'm trying to do


---------10:06----------
something and yeah I guess people often


---------10:09----------
come to the stream bring up their


---------10:10----------
problem sort of thing because it's more


---------10:12----------
of it I guess quieter stream where you


---------10:14----------
would do it something like that yes


---------10:17----------
notice like very spammy type thing um


---------10:21----------
and you think that high energy streams


---------10:24----------
are better


---------10:26----------
um not necessarily I just feel like they


---------10:31----------
giving more I don't feel like people


---------10:35----------
like them more I guess yeah yeah do you


---------10:41----------
feel like you're light are you like yeah


---------10:46----------
mm-hmm I think I'm like them don't know


---------10:49----------
if I'm likeable no yeah I'm getting that


---------10:53----------
so what's the difference let's talk


---------10:55----------
about that for a second is that okay if


---------10:56----------
I asked you a few questions about that


---------10:58----------
yeah sure what's the difference between


---------11:00----------
being liked and being likeable and being


---------11:06----------
like - iam is just knowing that a few


---------11:09----------
people like you so you liked and


---------11:13----------
likeable is that you're easy to get


---------11:14----------
along with mm-hm I guess I'm not a bit


---------11:18----------
more standoffish not as like a wall not


---------11:21----------
for as friendly and some others okay do


---------11:26----------
you think


---------11:27----------
excuse me do you think that the people


---------11:29----------
who like you do you feel do you feel


---------11:33----------
like you're kind of like being how can I


---------11:39----------
say this do you feel like you're


---------11:41----------
sometimes scamming them or do you feel


---------11:42----------
like you're you're genuinely like


---------11:44----------
there's something within you that is


---------11:45----------
deserving of being liked I guess like


---------11:52----------
when it comes to like the internet and I


---------11:55----------
see people who say yeah I like what you


---------11:58----------
do and like you've helped me so much I


---------11:59----------
feel like you know I'm a bit scamming


---------12:01----------
them in a way I'm like but why you know


---------12:05----------
yes sir yeah it's very I mean up what if


---------12:08----------
I told you I feel exactly the same way


---------12:12----------
yeah it's like I just talked to people


---------12:17----------
on twitch sometimes and then twitch chat


---------12:20----------
says that it helps a lot and I'm like


---------12:21----------
I'm just talking to someone how does


---------12:24----------
that work


---------12:25----------
yeah I don't get it but it does and I


---------12:29----------
know little things have helped me too so


---------12:31----------
it doesn't even have to be a big thing


---------12:32----------
that someone's doing so I kind I


---------12:34----------
personally from the other side like


---------12:36----------
surely the small things do help um it's


---------12:40----------
hard to think that I could help yeah


---------12:42----------
yeah so where did you get the idea that


---------12:45----------
you can't really help people um I don't


---------12:50----------
think I can't really help people I just


---------12:53----------
don't know why people think I'm helpful


---------12:57----------
I guess so so it it's a little bit


---------13:01----------
confusing to you but you do do you do


---------13:04----------
think that you genuinely believe that


---------13:06----------
you can help people um well people have


---------13:10----------
said I've helped them there I believe


---------13:14----------
that yeah you you believe in their words


---------13:17----------
yes yeah so this is kind of this is kind


---------13:21----------
of weird can I tell you Kathleen what


---------13:23----------
I'm hearing


---------13:23----------
okay it's really hard to kind of tease


---------13:28----------
apart because it's very subtle


---------13:29----------
so I hear so this is what I see I see


---------13:33----------
someone who's actually really smart very


---------13:35----------
logical


---------13:37----------
and interprets data and you look at


---------13:40----------
other people and other people tell you


---------13:42----------
that they're there helped by you you


---------13:44----------
have viewers that really enjoy watching


---------13:46----------
what you do it sounds like you're pretty


---------13:49----------
open and it's like kind of like a more


---------13:50----------
chill stream where people feel really


---------13:51----------
comfortable it's not like the super high


---------13:53----------
energy like emote spamming kind of like


---------13:56----------
you know classic twitch it's like it's


---------13:59----------
like more chill people feel really it


---------14:01----------
sounds like they feel comfortable and


---------14:03----------
people tell you that that watching you


---------14:06----------
helps them and that you've affected them


---------14:08----------
in some way and you're a logical person


---------14:10----------
so you kind of intellectually believe


---------14:12----------
that right yeah what I'm getting from


---------14:17----------
you though is like some subtle sense


---------14:19----------
that like that's not really you like I'm


---------14:23----------
getting some some deeper sense of for


---------14:27----------
lack of a better word insecurities like


---------14:29----------
that you're not capable of helping


---------14:31----------
people even though you have evidence to


---------14:34----------
the contrary there's like a part of you


---------14:35----------
that doesn't believe that you can like


---------14:37----------
really make a big difference I mean yeah


---------14:42----------
I mean the grants Gail he'll know I


---------14:43----------
can't make a difference but I mean even


---------14:45----------
in the smaller thing yeah I don't I


---------14:48----------
don't see what I can do special to


---------14:52----------
provide that someone else couldn't


---------14:54----------
couldn't do better yeah so it's so


---------14:57----------
subtle


---------14:57----------
right cuz you kind of say that there's


---------14:59----------
nothing about me that's special mm-hmm


---------15:02----------
is that is there a part of you that


---------15:04----------
believes that mmm oh yeah and it


---------15:09----------
happened some stream all the time and I


---------15:10----------
kind of go in on myself and I I really


---------15:13----------
like think I'm like I there's nothing I


---------15:16----------
can say right now I'm I'm really not


---------15:18----------
entertaining her an interesting person


---------15:20----------
so um and then I just get worked up in


---------15:24----------
my own head and I'm kind of good quiet


---------15:25----------
mm-hm yeah I mean it sounds like you


---------15:29----------
I'm gonna just think for another second


---------15:32----------
so I'm trying to figure out where that


---------15:35----------
comes from because I just don't believe


---------15:36----------
that so I think that there's a part of


---------15:38----------
you so I think sometimes we feel


---------15:40----------
insecure about the person that we are


---------15:42----------
and we feel like we can't help other


---------15:44----------
people or that we're not special or that


---------15:47----------
we're kind of like imposters do you ever


---------15:48----------
feel like an impostor mmm yes sometimes


---------15:52----------
yeah


---------15:53----------
and so but somewhere along the way I


---------15:56----------
think I would guess that you learned to


---------16:00----------
like that belief doesn't come from


---------16:02----------
nowhere right the belief that like


---------16:05----------
you're not something special comes from


---------16:08----------
somewhere do you remember feeling that


---------16:11----------
way as a kid mm-hmm I mean yeah I guess


---------16:18----------
so I mean and there wasn't be no event


---------16:21----------
or anything I just felt that way I


---------16:24----------
suppose and I never really wanted to


---------16:27----------
feel special that to be fair yeah sure


---------16:30----------
yeah can you tell me a little bit about


---------16:33----------
what what growing up was like for you no


---------16:38----------
I had a great a great childhood single


---------16:41----------
mother raised me my older brother and


---------16:43----------
we're just kind of like I know just kind


---------16:46----------
of spent a lot of time like alone doing


---------16:48----------
my own things and ya know I had some


---------16:52----------
great friends and I was just always


---------16:53----------
really the quiet one who never said


---------16:55----------
anything um yeah I said him I felt like


---------17:00----------
I had anything to add or anything good


---------17:01----------
enough dad but yeah my childhood yeah


---------17:07----------
okay what was school like for you um


---------17:13----------
educationally it's easy it's fun


---------17:18----------
socially actually I had a really good


---------17:21----------
group of friends so okay yeah you felt


---------17:25----------
supported yeah do you feel like your


---------17:29----------
friends valued you as a person


---------17:31----------
yeah yeah and your what's your


---------17:34----------
relationship with your brother like oh


---------17:36----------
great okay yeah yeah this is subtle all


---------17:41----------
right I'm just gonna I'm gonna need a


---------17:45----------
second to think is that okay so I want


---------17:51----------
to come back to this you said that you


---------17:53----------
felt li you were always quiet because


---------17:55----------
you felt like you didn't have anything


---------17:58----------
that was worth saying or if I am said


---------18:03----------
anything it would be stupid yeah Oh


---------18:07----------
correct yeah do you remember actually


---------18:09----------
saying something stupid and like


---------18:11----------
learning that mm-hmm I mean all the time


---------18:16----------
yeah yeah not specifically but yeah okay


---------18:22----------
and what would happen when you would say


---------18:24----------
something stupid yeah I just feel really


---------18:27----------
embarrassed how did you know that you


---------18:29----------
said something stupid looks like I guess


---------18:34----------
when people laugh at you


---------18:36----------
well they say that's wrong yeah either


---------18:40----------
one did that happen a lot did people


---------18:42----------
laugh at you a lot when you spoke um not


---------18:46----------
only no no no but I was very fearful it


---------18:51----------
would happen cuz it didn't happen too


---------18:52----------
often


---------18:53----------
yeah okay so you were afraid of it


---------18:57----------
happening and you were really careful


---------18:58----------
about it yeah really careful about what


---------19:01----------
you said try to avoid sounding stupid


---------19:06----------
yeah okay and is it okay if we switch


---------19:14----------
gears for a second and you so you've


---------19:17----------
mentioned something about gas lighting


---------19:18----------
oh yeah yeah yeah there you tell me a


---------19:23----------
little bit about that yeah there's a few


---------19:26----------
people in my life that I you know I have


---------19:28----------
to be close to you um like work and them


---------19:35----------
seem to just


---------19:37----------
I'm wrong a lot or like disagree with me


---------19:42----------
a lot or they try to just make sure like


---------19:46----------
things look fine they're like


---------19:48----------
everything's fine everything's fine


---------19:51----------
when it's just not and it's okay to


---------19:53----------
admit it's not okay and circuit fixing


---------19:56----------
and so every time I bring up a problem I


---------19:59----------
mean just feel like I feel like a


---------20:00----------
villain like that student trying to poke


---------20:03----------
holes and you know things are trying to


---------20:06----------
bring down the mood and I I just want


---------20:08----------
things to be better and I just I guess


---------20:10----------
like after dealing with it for a year


---------20:11----------
I've just gotten really sick of being


---------20:14----------
treated like that you know every time I


---------20:17----------
have an opinion or I say something I


---------20:21----------
just it's always it always has to be


---------20:24----------
something else nice to be yeah so it


---------20:29----------
sounds like they're kind of ignoring


---------20:31----------
problems yeah do you feel like you're


---------20:35----------
the one person who's kind of pointing


---------20:37----------
out that things are not going well and


---------20:39----------
people are not taking you seriously um


---------20:41----------
no I think I'm not the only person I


---------20:44----------
think there's heaps of people I think


---------20:46----------
I've just been doing it the longest


---------20:47----------
I guess as yeah okay doing it and is


---------20:52----------
there a particular person that is not


---------20:55----------
listening to what you have to say oh


---------20:57----------
yeah yeah what's can you and if I don't


---------21:05----------
know like how public or private or drama


---------21:07----------
inducing this is so if there's something


---------21:09----------
you don't want to answer you know by all


---------21:10----------
means don't answer it yeah


---------21:14----------
I'm just really taken aback by is that


---------21:18----------
really hard for you to kind of point


---------21:20----------
that out to people um what's what's


---------21:24----------
wrong yeah like um no I've been I feel


---------21:30----------
like I'm pretty blunt person sometimes


---------21:33----------
too blunt sometimes rude I guess but um


---------21:38----------
I mean I get pretty worked up when I'm


---------21:40----------
doing it I get pretty nervous when I'm


---------21:41----------
doing it but I always feel like people


---------21:44----------
need to hear problems and I would like


---------21:47----------
someone to tell me like sure he is


---------21:50----------
something you could work on and and so


---------21:52----------
can you give me an example of what kind


---------21:54----------
of problem you're talking um not too


---------21:58----------
specifically but if I care there was


---------22:02----------
like a um there wasn't like an idea that


---------22:08----------
they thought and they would okay so


---------22:10----------
there was an idea that they had they


---------22:12----------
were using our names for it and they


---------22:13----------
thought it was some super detrimental to


---------22:17----------
them but I'm just telling them that


---------22:19----------
using our names is a great thing and


---------22:20----------
they kept being bashing me down for it


---------22:24----------
they're like no it's terrible it's like


---------22:25----------
things like that it's just they keep


---------22:29----------
saying no you're wrong and I know I'm


---------22:31----------
not wrong and it just annoys me that


---------22:35----------
yeah I have other people around me who


---------22:37----------
are just like no that's you you were


---------22:40----------
right but what's annoying about that um


---------22:44----------
it's it's just that it doesn't it's they


---------22:48----------
seem to want to do whatever is right to


---------22:51----------
them they seem to want to make


---------22:56----------
themselves look good and seem to it's


---------22:58----------
almost manipulate us into thinking that


---------23:00----------
we don't know what's right


---------23:03----------
yeah cuz I guess you don't sound like


---------23:05----------
you're being manipulated you sound like


---------23:08----------
you know what's right and what's wrong


---------23:09----------
sounds like you're dealing with someone


---------23:11----------
who's kind of an [ __ ] or narcissistic


---------23:13----------
I suppose you could say that yeah I


---------23:19----------
guess I guess so but it's just I still


---------23:21----------
have to work with these people so it's


---------23:23----------
just like how do I continue to work with


---------23:26----------
people who I don't really respect that


---------23:30----------
much and who don't seem to respect me


---------23:35----------
I'm confused by the gaslighting so what


---------23:39----------
you said to me just makes a lot of sense


---------23:41----------
so it sounds like you're in a situation


---------23:42----------
where you don't really respect someone


---------23:45----------
else's take on things and it sounds like


---------23:48----------
they don't respect your opinion on


---------23:49----------
things yeah and so so it sounds like I


---------23:56----------
mean my um my understanding a sliding is


---------24:01----------
its when someone sort of tricks you into


---------24:03----------
believing something that is like false


---------24:04----------
okay okay


---------24:06----------
is that what you meant like I mean kind


---------24:10----------
of because I'm going through my head I


---------24:12----------
keep pretending that they're good that


---------24:15----------
they that they're right I didn't think


---------24:19----------
that they're right but I'm like you know


---------24:21----------
what maybe they're right maybe they're


---------24:22----------
right there maybe that they are better


---------24:25----------
at that job than I've been like saying


---------24:29----------
like I I so I do kind of convince myself


---------24:31----------
that it is via the case so that we


---------24:38----------
should definitely talk about where did


---------24:41----------
you learn how to do that where did you


---------24:43----------
learn how to convince yourself that you


---------24:44----------
were wrong


---------24:46----------
it's not necessarily that I'm wrong but


---------24:49----------
like more like convinced myself that


---------24:51----------
that I don't know the full story and


---------24:53----------
then I don't know what it's like to be


---------24:56----------
them and they they might have something


---------25:01----------
that is valid that I don't know of so


---------25:03----------
that's yeah so it's just it's not that


---------25:08----------
you're wrong it's that there's there


---------25:09----------
could be more complexity this situation


---------25:11----------
yeah hmm and and you're bringing this up


---------25:24----------
because you'd like to better understand


---------25:26----------
how to be able to interact with them in


---------25:28----------
like a positive way yeah yeah okay I


---------25:33----------
said yeah it's my best interests to keep


---------25:38----------
around them in I know outside of like


---------25:41----------
business things they're good people


---------25:43----------
I like to believe that I don't I don't


---------25:45----------
know but yeah I guess okay on a business


---------25:53----------
level how do I keep yeah and and and


---------26:00----------
when when you when you okay okay I just


---------26:04----------
need to think for a second okay


---------26:18----------
so Kathleen here's what I find to be a


---------26:21----------
little bit confusing about trying to


---------26:24----------
understand your perspective mm-hmm so


---------26:27----------
sometimes when I'm talking to people


---------26:30----------
there's like something like


---------26:31----------
psychological that's that maybe is a


---------26:33----------
little bit of a distortion or is like is


---------26:36----------
something that is kind of like The


---------26:38----------
Smoking Gun like there's something going


---------26:40----------
on in their mind which is like actually


---------26:42----------
like problematic and usually I can sort


---------26:45----------
of sniff that out and try to help people


---------26:47----------
understand it and a lot of times people


---------26:48----------
come on the stream because I help them


---------26:50----------
understand kind of how their mind is


---------26:52----------
working so you're doing something that's


---------26:55----------
very interesting which is that you'll


---------26:56----------
start to say a statement and then all


---------26:59----------
I'll respond to you with kind of like an


---------27:02----------
amplified version so I'll kind of say


---------27:05----------
like okay like for example I said


---------27:07----------
something about okay so you're in a


---------27:10----------
conversation with someone and you have a


---------27:12----------
particular belief and they disagree with


---------27:13----------
you and then you do some kind of mental


---------27:16----------
gymnastics to bring yourself closer to


---------27:18----------
what they believe right does that make


---------27:22----------
sense yeah you kinda feel yeah exactly


---------27:29----------
exactly my point so then what I would do


---------27:31----------
is I will repeat something back to you


---------27:33----------
right so I'll say oh so like like also


---------27:36----------
like I did make a definitive statement


---------27:37----------
about who's right and who's wrong and


---------27:40----------
then what you do is is it doesn't seem


---------27:43----------
like I'm actually right about when I


---------27:45----------
make an amplified statement then what


---------27:47----------
you always do is you add like more


---------27:49----------
qualification in the middle like you're


---------27:50----------
adding I'm trying to be a little bit


---------27:52----------
black and white with you and you're


---------27:54----------
adding a lot of gray in the middle does


---------27:55----------
that make sense


---------27:56----------
mm-hmm yeah so so like even now just


---------28:00----------
when I said so I said you'll do some


---------28:02----------
because like literally you just told me


---------28:04----------
that you know if you disagree with


---------28:06----------
someone you'll think oh maybe they know


---------28:07----------
something I don't


---------28:08----------
or maybe I'm maybe they do know


---------28:11----------
something that I don't understand like


---------28:13----------
something happens in your mind where


---------28:14----------
like you have a belief and they have a


---------28:16----------
belief and then you like sort of move


---------28:18----------
into this grey zone which is actually


---------28:20----------
like closer to them


---------28:22----------
then then what you believe does that


---------28:24----------
make sense


---------28:25----------
yeah I don't think I move closer to what


---------28:28----------
they believe thing I'm pretty sure of my


---------28:32----------
own opinions of okay these particular


---------28:36----------
people so okay so yeah so and so when


---------28:40----------
you start to what is what is the result


---------28:42----------
of you thinking well maybe they know


---------28:44----------
something I don't um it just makes it


---------28:48----------
easier for me to talk to them to make


---------28:50----------
them not believe that they're trying to


---------28:53----------
manipulate me cuz that's what I think


---------28:55----------
they're doing so if I kind of pretend to


---------28:58----------
be them I'm just like maybe it says


---------28:59----------
something then they don't look so ya


---------29:04----------
mean no I guess yeah wait wait say that


---------29:07----------
again what why do you need it hmm


---------29:10----------
why do you tell yourself that why do you


---------29:14----------
do all that because it makes what easier


---------29:17----------
it makes it easier to talk to them how


---------29:20----------
does it make it easier to talk to them


---------29:21----------
um so I don't think that they're


---------29:26----------
manipulative people that I think that


---------29:28----------
it's just normal people with different


---------29:32----------
things going on right and why do you


---------29:34----------
think they're manipulative people


---------29:37----------
because they're always trying to push my


---------29:40----------
opinions down and just yeah trying to


---------29:45----------
take conflicting opinions even though


---------29:47----------
I'm even when I'm right even when I'm


---------29:50----------
wrong that's fine too but like I know


---------29:51----------
I've been right and they've done that


---------29:53----------
and they certainly made me feel very


---------29:55----------
small yeah so they make you feel small


---------29:58----------
yeah so when you start to okay hold on


---------30:03----------
let me just see if I can follow you here


---------30:05----------
okay so you share an opinion with them


---------30:07----------
they respond in a way that makes you


---------30:09----------
feel small and then you start to add


---------30:13----------
like more grey to the discussion you


---------30:16----------
start to put yourself in their shoes and


---------30:18----------
then if you put yourself in their shoes


---------30:20----------
and maybe they understand something that


---------30:22----------
you don't understand then


---------30:27----------
it's not like you're just wrong there's


---------30:30----------
like more to the equation and therefore


---------30:32----------
you feel less small um no I don't think


---------30:38----------
I feel less small I just ma I mean I


---------30:42----------
guess but like I am it's more like


---------30:45----------
thinking about what their their opinion


---------30:50----------
makes them easier to talk to you I'd say


---------30:52----------
makes them easier to talk to in what way


---------30:55----------
when you do that in your mind what


---------30:57----------
becomes easier how does it become easier


---------30:59----------
to interact with them um because I think


---------31:03----------
that they am actually logical people


---------31:06----------
because in my mind I'm like they're


---------31:08----------
logical people they had a reason to say


---------31:11----------
this the way they did they had a reason


---------31:14----------
to to make me feel go to you know say I


---------31:18----------
was wrong or and really like stick to it


---------31:21----------
um so


---------31:24----------
maybe it justifies them making you feel


---------31:29----------
small yeah yeah no that's a good way of


---------31:34----------
putting it yeah there it is okay sorry


---------31:37----------
it took me a little while to understand


---------31:39----------
so so it justifies have you ever been in


---------31:42----------
an abusive kind of relationship no no


---------31:47----------
okay I've had very healthy relationships


---------31:49----------
yeah because because now what I'm


---------31:54----------
hearing you do so just just hear me out


---------31:55----------
for a second okay so and prepare for the


---------31:58----------
shades of grey so it sounds to me like


---------32:01----------
you do some kind of thinking in your


---------32:04----------
head that justifies them making you feel


---------32:09----------
the way that you do yeah what do you


---------32:15----------
think about that hmm and I think it's


---------32:20----------
just how I cope dealing them with them


---------32:22----------
because I think it's probably the most


---------32:25----------
unhealthy relationship I have is with


---------32:27----------
these individuals okay yeah I completely


---------32:31----------
agree that that's the way that you cope


---------32:33----------
what do you think about that way of


---------32:35----------
coping I think um I mean it works if I


---------32:41----------
try to tell them you know things if I


---------32:45----------
try to work it out I don't know if they


---------32:46----------
would agree I feel like again it would


---------32:49----------
be swept under the rug and again I will


---------32:50----------
be told I'm wrong so I just don't see a


---------32:53----------
point in ever confronting it of how they


---------32:58----------
made me feel for the past like yeah yeah


---------33:02----------
yes sir


---------33:04----------
how would you describe this relationship


---------33:06----------
oh I completely mean it works at


---------33:08----------
something it works in what way does it


---------33:14----------
work let's talk about this for a second


---------33:15----------
actually um I just waxed helping me


---------33:22----------
helping me continue what I what I want


---------33:24----------
to do which incidentally involves them


---------33:27----------
so okay helps me continue that yeah I


---------33:30----------
agree so it sounds like it


---------33:34----------
it keeps the train moving on the tracks


---------33:37----------
yep


---------33:39----------
what is what does it cost you um I guess


---------33:47----------
I mean just the injury just the


---------33:51----------
interactions with them in general cost


---------33:52----------
me a little bit of time and then


---------33:55----------
headspace like sometimes it's all I can


---------33:58----------
think about and I hate that because I


---------33:59----------
don't want to think negatively of people


---------34:01----------
but you know I really do why don't you


---------34:03----------
want to think negatively of people it's


---------34:06----------
not fair to them really then oh they're


---------34:10----------
just people like me like real floored no


---------34:12----------
way he's so I don't want to be like


---------34:15----------
delving deep into hate or something I


---------34:18----------
dunno if that's healthy for me yeah I


---------34:23----------
think I this is gonna sound completely


---------34:26----------
crazy I think it is so so yeah I I think


---------34:31----------
I think you should let yourself feel


---------34:33----------
more anger so like you just said like


---------34:36----------
you just said that everyone has flaws


---------34:37----------
right and sometimes people make mistakes


---------34:41----------
and sometimes people say things that


---------34:43----------
make you feel like a small person yeah


---------34:46----------
and how do you feel towards them I mean


---------34:50----------
I I wanted you know just dry them yeah I


---------34:57----------
wanted


---------34:57----------
yeah I want to yell at them yeah but I


---------35:03----------
want to make them feel small yeah there


---------35:05----------
it is


---------35:06----------
okay now we're getting somewhere where


---------35:08----------
are you aware that you feel that way


---------35:11----------
yeah yeah no I've got a letter H in me


---------35:15----------
yeah absolutely you do


---------35:17----------
I think it's it's hiding and it's it's


---------35:20----------
confused the [ __ ] out of me because I


---------35:22----------
didn't understand why I was not able to


---------35:26----------
connect with what you were saying but I


---------35:28----------
think I finally understand I think


---------35:29----------
you're very very angry so like at first


---------35:32----------
I thought it was like some weird lack of


---------35:34----------
self-confidence that you know cuz you


---------35:38----------
use these words like gaslighting and you


---------35:39----------
feel manipulated but you're actually


---------35:43----------
you're not of yeah but I think it's I


---------35:47----------
think it's anger like are you angry with


---------35:50----------
these people yes and what do you do with


---------35:54----------
that anger that you feel i rant a little


---------36:00----------
bit and I or I just put my anger back


---------36:04----------
into my wick just like hot or I write


---------36:08----------
things down I remember like it sometimes


---------36:13----------
keep a diary and one time I just write


---------36:15----------
about how I hate this is one person and


---------36:18----------
I felt bad ever since I wrote it like a


---------36:20----------
soul out then yeah but it also sounds


---------36:26----------
like you judge yourself a lot for being


---------36:28----------
angry with them yeah that you do some


---------36:31----------
really weird mental gymnastics too like


---------36:33----------
I still don't quite understand this but


---------36:35----------
you do something weird because like it


---------36:38----------
so let me understand if this makes sense


---------36:42----------
or not okay so like there's something


---------36:43----------
going on where they say something that


---------36:45----------
makes you feel a certain way and then


---------36:47----------
you put yourself in like when someone


---------36:49----------
treats you like crap you put yourself in


---------36:52----------
their shoes and then you try to


---------36:55----------
understand them better and as you try to


---------36:58----------
understand the person who is hurtful to


---------37:00----------
you what does it do for you what happens


---------37:04----------
in your mind when you do that I know I


---------37:10----------
guess I could just continue on I I don't


---------37:13----------
have to think about them as much if I


---------37:16----------
just I don't hate them as much I can


---------37:18----------
just yeah so good what is this beautiful


---------37:21----------
what is this what is that this mood to


---------37:24----------
me that they're not as important


---------37:26----------
okay so you make them small in your mind


---------37:29----------
by understanding them yeah and then if


---------37:33----------
they're small then you're less hurt um I


---------37:38----------
just it's not less hit but I just think


---------37:40----------
about them less I guess overall that's


---------37:43----------
yeah okay do you feel comfortable with


---------37:53----------
being angry with them I'm just I've


---------37:59----------
gotten used to it so a little bit


---------38:03----------
comfortable yeah and so you've got like


---------38:06----------
some kind of volcano inside you right


---------38:09----------
yeah yeah how long is that volcano been


---------38:17----------
there every year I'd say yeah yeah cuz


---------38:24----------
you're not actually like I'm not


---------38:28----------
detecting a lack of confidence from you


---------38:32----------
okay do you feel like you're confident


---------38:35----------
in yourself touch it go I guess no never


---------38:41----------
be told that and never been told why


---------38:44----------
that's huh like and I've seen actually


---------38:47----------
now I have been told I've seen confident


---------38:48----------
confident it just doesn't make any sense


---------38:50----------
to me that people you don't feel


---------38:51----------
confident not overly no okay yeah so I'm


---------38:57----------
gonna ask you a question Kathleen


---------38:59----------
sometimes they're people and they're


---------39:01----------
wrong right and you're right and you're


---------39:06----------
pretty sure about that 100% yeah a


---------39:09----------
hundred percent not just pretty sure now


---------39:12----------
you're the one who's amplifying so here


---------39:14----------
I am sitting in the grey and I say


---------39:16----------
you're pretty right and then you're


---------39:19----------
saying no hundred percent so that's not


---------39:22----------
confidence what is that


---------39:24----------
okay maybe that's converted spit no it's


---------39:27----------
not you're right you're not confident


---------39:29----------
it's something else very subtle very


---------39:31----------
very you're just subtle subtle subtle


---------39:33----------
subtle subtle kathleen okay when you're


---------39:36----------
a hundred percent right and there are a


---------39:38----------
hundred percent wrong what is that


---------39:41----------
that's just it's arrogance and arrogance


---------39:49----------
how does that sound


---------39:50----------
uh I mean okay I guess I think what


---------39:57----------
makes it okay is that I'm not the only


---------39:59----------
one that I have other people let's say


---------40:03----------
your same thing yeah yeah so I think


---------40:06----------
together I think sometimes you're right


---------40:08----------
I'm not disputing that you're right this


---------40:10----------
is this is it I'm gonna just get another


---------40:13----------
second to think okay I'm arrogant okay


---------40:19----------
what do you think about that do you


---------40:22----------
think you're arrogant what once I said


---------40:23----------
it does it sound kind of weird it's oh


---------40:27----------
it sounds kind of weird but it's not


---------40:28----------
like it's not it's not so far from the


---------40:32----------
truth


---------40:32----------
I don't think oh yeah yeah it's subtle


---------40:37----------
cuz the thing is you're meek that's why


---------40:39----------
I think people don't perceive you as


---------40:41----------
arrogant because you're me you're like


---------40:44----------
quiet and you smile a lot and you speak


---------40:46----------
softly but I think deep down you are you


---------40:50----------
or really do not get like in your mind


---------40:54----------
there's like very clear people being


---------40:56----------
right and people being wrong


---------40:57----------
and you try really hard to try to


---------40:59----------
understand them but you're trying what


---------41:01----------
you're trying to do is disarm your own


---------41:03----------
arrogance in a weird way does that make


---------41:07----------
sense at all it kind of does yeah yeah


---------41:11----------
help me understand it when you say yeah


---------41:15----------
it kind of does what help me talk to I


---------41:18----------
mean I guess that


---------41:20----------
oh sorry I'm just really throwing back


---------41:22----------
about the arrogant thing I know I am too


---------41:24----------
I'm [ __ ] confused I mean I suppose I


---------41:32----------
thought I mean yes but Kathleen but


---------41:36----------
let's pause for a sec cause I just I


---------41:37----------
just could be wrong right I could be


---------41:39----------
wrong about that you may not be arrogant


---------41:47----------
so it sounded bad I I'm okay good but


---------41:53----------
does it resonate with you do you think


---------41:54----------
that that could be the case I don't know


---------42:01----------
I honestly don't know I've never thought


---------42:03----------
about it


---------42:04----------
I don't okay let me tell you what I


---------42:06----------
think is going on okay so I'm gonna tell


---------42:09----------
you about something called the Oh hum


---------42:11----------
god


---------42:11----------
the Omkar is the son script word for ego


---------42:14----------
and the ego is like a protective


---------42:17----------
mechanism okay so the ego arises when


---------42:21----------
you start to feel bad and makes you feel


---------42:25----------
better by pumping yourself up or putting


---------42:27----------
other people down and I think you have a


---------42:31----------
very very subtle ego and so the other


---------42:34----------
thing about a hum car is that generally


---------42:36----------
speaking the more build more confidence


---------42:40----------
you have the less egotistical you are


---------42:42----------
those are a lot of people think that


---------42:45----------
those are like similar they're actually


---------42:47----------
at the opposite ends of a spectrum okay


---------42:49----------
so just think about like if someone's


---------42:52----------
egotistical and you call them an idiot


---------42:55----------
how are they going to respond


---------42:58----------
defensively yeah and if someone's


---------43:01----------
confident you call them an idiot how are


---------43:03----------
they going to respond


---------43:04----------
probably just brush it off absolutely so


---------43:07----------
which one do you do when they make you


---------43:09----------
feel small how do you respond um I used


---------43:15----------
to like yell back at them always like


---------43:18----------
would you take them but and but now I


---------43:21----------
just more like keep to myself


---------43:23----------
and then just yell at them in my head


---------43:25----------
later yes very good right so I'm not


---------43:29----------
hearing any brushing off


---------43:31----------
Yeah right so this is what I mean so I


---------43:34----------
think you have a subtle ah-hum car which


---------43:35----------
is actually ego which is kind of like


---------43:37----------
arrogance because in here you're still


---------43:39----------
[ __ ] raging at them you so rage at


---------43:42----------
them like this and that didn't work it


---------43:45----------
didn't get what you wanted which was to


---------43:48----------
show them that you're right and they're


---------43:49----------
wrong right and so now you yell in here


---------43:54----------
and then you also do some kind of weird


---------43:55----------
mental gymnastics to like quiet all


---------43:58----------
those feelings to cope because you have


---------44:00----------
to work with these people you have to


---------44:01----------
wake up the next day and you have to be


---------44:02----------
a part of your life so you got to learn


---------44:03----------
how to manage your ego you've got to


---------44:07----------
learn how to manage your anger and you


---------44:09----------
also have to learn how to manage your


---------44:11----------
hurt right because that's the other


---------44:15----------
thing that's going on is that they make


---------44:16----------
you feel small yeah so the ego arises


---------44:21----------
it's a protective mechanism it's like


---------44:23----------
the bouncer of your mind so for example


---------44:25----------
if I ask someone out on a date and they


---------44:27----------
turn me down


---------44:28----------
then my ego says oh they're not actually


---------44:30----------
that pretty I was doing them a favor


---------44:33----------
does that make sense that that people


---------44:35----------
will have those kinds of thoughts yeah


---------44:37----------
do you see how those thoughts are like


---------44:38----------
egotistical and dumb yeah and also


---------44:41----------
completely natural yeah yeah so like so


---------44:45----------
the origin of ego is actually hurt so


---------44:49----------
like if you got hurt in some way I think


---------44:51----------
this thing arises within you and then


---------44:54----------
you kind of yell at them a little bit in


---------44:56----------
your head you convince yourself that


---------44:57----------
you're right and then you also try to do


---------44:59----------
this weird thing where like you change


---------45:03----------
the way that you think about them so


---------45:06----------
that you no longer have to feel hurt


---------45:09----------
mm yeah I guess so yeah


---------45:12----------
I mean I'm still hurt in a lot of ways


---------45:15----------
just a wish but windows resolve things


---------45:19----------
yeah I agree so now hold on a second


---------45:23----------
don't run away from this okay so let me


---------45:25----------
just look and you say I guess so I'm


---------45:26----------
gonna tunnel down is it are we doing


---------45:28----------
okay by the way is this okay


---------45:29----------
am I being nice to you am I being


---------45:32----------
hurtful or do I want you to so so when


---------45:36----------
they make you feel hurt and you put


---------45:38----------
yourself in their shoes what does that


---------45:41----------
do


---------45:42----------
let's understand what's going on in your


---------45:44----------
mind


---------45:45----------
when you try to understand them and you


---------45:47----------
like expand the horizon of their thought


---------45:50----------
process what does it do okay what does


---------45:58----------
it do to your feelings of being hurt I


---------46:01----------
mean it kind of protects myself how very


---------46:05----------
good how in that it doesn't make I don't


---------46:11----------
have an enemy I just like they just I


---------46:14----------
just keep them in my head I think


---------46:17----------
friends are what they should be and I


---------46:20----------
guess yeah so you see what your mind is


---------46:24----------
doing there is is protecting yourself by


---------46:27----------
understanding their viewpoint but the


---------46:30----------
goal here is still to protect yourself


---------46:32----------
from that hurt because you would rather


---------46:36----------
the more you can justify okay let me


---------46:44----------
just think about how to say this and you


---------46:47----------
Kathleen you gotta tell me if I'm just


---------46:48----------
like way wrong okay because I don't I


---------46:51----------
don't actually know what I'm talking


---------46:52----------
about so I'm relying on you to let me


---------46:54----------
know are we doing okay does this feel


---------46:56----------
like it's actually we're getting


---------46:57----------
somewhere


---------46:58----------
I feel like somewhere yeah okay


---------47:01----------
so yeah it's subtle it's very very


---------47:04----------
subtle so when someone does something to


---------47:10----------
hurt you or when you feel hurt by


---------47:14----------
someone they can have a good reason to


---------47:19----------
say something that is hurtful to you or


---------47:21----------
they can have not a good reason and if


---------47:25----------
they have a good reason to say something


---------47:27----------
hurtful or if they have a bad reason to


---------47:29----------
say something hurtful which one hurts


---------47:31----------
more bad reason I'd say actually very


---------47:40----------
good very very good this is heart very


---------47:44----------
good why it doesn't make sense to me


---------47:52----------
yeah because like like it's so much more


---------47:56----------
personal if they don't have a good


---------47:58----------
reason to be upset with you right like


---------48:01----------
it's just like raw hatred if like if you


---------48:04----------
forgot to pick someone up from the


---------48:06----------
airport and they're pissed at you that


---------48:07----------
sort of makes sense because you


---------48:08----------
understand that you screwed up but if


---------48:13----------
you showed up on time and they're still


---------48:14----------
pissed at you and yelling at you which


---------48:17----------
one is more hurtful like one way you


---------48:20----------
dude you show up in time yeah can you do


---------48:23----------
everything right so this is subtle but


---------48:25----------
like so I think you've got to be careful


---------48:27----------
because what you try to do when you try


---------48:30----------
to understand them you're moving them


---------48:32----------
from not having a good reason of being


---------48:35----------
angry with you into the camp of having a


---------48:38----------
good reason to be angry with you does


---------48:41----------
that make sense yeah do you agree that


---------48:44----------
you're doing that I mean yeah I guess I


---------48:49----------
mean that's what I'm basing that based


---------48:51----------
on what you've told me is that you try


---------48:52----------
to understand their viewpoint and oh


---------48:54----------
yeah like maybe they are right yeah


---------48:57----------
maybe they they do have a good reason to


---------48:59----------
make me feel this way


---------49:02----------
because yeah yeah don't yeah I kind of


---------49:05----------
committed myself of that a little bit


---------49:07----------
I'd still don't maybe I do have a good


---------49:09----------
reason so maybe no yes very good so so


---------49:12----------
now we're also now very good


---------49:14----------
Kathleen so now it's not that it's both


---------49:18----------
of these things happen in your mind at


---------49:20----------
the same time there's a part of you


---------49:22----------
which knows you're [ __ ] right and


---------49:25----------
knows they're wrong and then at the same


---------49:27----------
time there's this other part of your


---------49:29----------
mind that's doing this weird process do


---------49:32----------
you see that they're like completely


---------49:34----------
independent like you can believe that


---------49:37----------
they are have good reasons to say the


---------49:39----------
things that they do and also that


---------49:42----------
they're complete idiots like your mind


---------49:43----------
actually believes both of those at the


---------49:45----------
same time agree or disagree I can't read


---------49:50----------
your military angry angry yeah so so


---------49:53----------
that's okay like that's so the first


---------49:54----------
thing is I want you to just notice that


---------49:56----------
your mind actually has these parallel


---------49:58----------
processes it's like you're running more


---------50:00----------
than one program at the same time and


---------50:03----------
and it's protective and stuff like that


---------50:05----------
but I think I think that there's a part


---------50:07----------
of you and this is the really bizarre


---------50:09----------
thing is that deep down I think that you


---------50:11----------
can't handle someone being just me like


---------50:16----------
like there's something that's really


---------50:17----------
hurtful it's not just you anyone you


---------50:19----------
know you have to have a good reason for


---------50:21----------
someone to be angry with you and to


---------50:22----------
treat you like poorly like it's it's so


---------50:25----------
much more tolerable when someone has a


---------50:27----------
good reason to treat you like crap


---------50:30----------
yeah it is because otherwise the person


---------50:34----------
would be I guess a bad person and that


---------50:38----------
they've been doing this to make me feel


---------50:40----------
bad and then oh they just don't like me


---------50:43----------
well they just yeah so so that's where


---------50:47----------
we have to be really careful because


---------50:48----------
we're what do you think about that


---------50:53----------
sometimes I believe that I sometimes I


---------50:55----------
believe they are actually and not a nice


---------50:57----------
person and I don't want to because I've


---------51:01----------
known them for so long


---------51:01----------
but um so for this to come up more


---------51:04----------
recently it's just well in the last year


---------51:06----------
it's like yeah yeah so I think Kathleen


---------51:12----------
this is complicated I think your mind is


---------51:14----------
first of all awesome but also incredibly


---------51:19----------
incredibly subtle and I think you've


---------51:21----------
learned a lot of different ways to


---------51:23----------
manage a lot of different things that


---------51:25----------
your mind does in a lot of the ways that


---------51:27----------
you feel so you've learned some really


---------51:30----------
interesting techniques to manage your


---------51:32----------
anger you also learned a lot of


---------51:37----------
different ways to manage your lack of


---------51:39----------
confidence because something about this


---------51:42----------
makes it so that you can't brush them


---------51:44----------
off yeah right so like this this is the


---------51:48----------
really really subtle part which I could


---------51:50----------
be completely wrong about because it's


---------51:51----------
it's almost like I'm sniffing around the


---------51:53----------
edges but I think that there still is


---------51:55----------
something within you that if I had to


---------51:57----------
guess I'd say that something with it


---------52:00----------
someone in your life probably when you


---------52:03----------
were young actually treated you bad in


---------52:05----------
like a completely like not excusable way


---------52:10----------
like there was no reason for them to


---------52:12----------
treat you the way that they did and they


---------52:13----------
did and it sunk in really deep has that


---------52:17----------
ever happened to you where someone just


---------52:18----------
just treated you like crap does that


---------52:22----------
ring a bell


---------52:23----------
not that I can recall I'm not sure with


---------52:26----------
it I'm just like hiding it for myself


---------52:28----------
but like I no I don't think so


---------52:30----------
if you don't think so we're just gonna


---------52:31----------
trust you and I just could be wrong it's


---------52:34----------
just in my experience a lot of people


---------52:38----------
you know who deal with making


---------52:43----------
excuses for someone being mean to you is


---------52:45----------
something that sometimes happens from


---------52:48----------
abusive relationships does that make


---------52:50----------
sense yeah like making excuses for


---------52:53----------
someone who mistreats you and like


---------52:55----------
trying to put yourself in their shoes is


---------52:59----------
kind of like textbook abusive partner


---------53:01----------
kind of behavior yeah and so ah this


---------53:08----------
would be probably the first time which I


---------53:10----------
would have a relationship like this so


---------53:13----------
is this the first time you've done


---------53:14----------
something like this in your head where


---------53:16----------
you like someone's treating you poorly


---------53:17----------
and then you try to like really go out


---------53:19----------
of your way to understand their


---------53:20----------
viewpoint yeah okay and this has been


---------53:23----------
going on for a year yeah yeah bit longer


---------53:27----------
yeah okay so I think then this could


---------53:30----------
just be the way that you learned how to


---------53:31----------
cope in this relationship right so this


---------53:34----------
does sound okay so it doesn't have to be


---------53:37----------
something from your past I mean if it's


---------53:38----------
been going on from a year it can be this


---------53:40----------
you do you have any questions for me by


---------53:43----------
the way um I did but I've forgotten okay


---------53:48----------
is this like kind of too abstract or


---------53:50----------
cerebral are you like fault because I


---------53:52----------
feel like I'm barely understanding this


---------53:55----------
no it's it's it's good if you wanted to


---------53:59----------
move on that's fine too but it is it's


---------54:00----------
good for me to realize I guess the only


---------54:02----------
one thing is that I don't know I still


---------54:06----------
don't know how I'm supposed to deal with


---------54:09----------
am I supposed to let it just let it go


---------54:11----------
is that what I'm supposed to do yeah


---------54:13----------
eventually but that's hard that's hard


---------54:16----------
to learn how to do so let's talk


---------54:17----------
practicalities so in my day job I do


---------54:21----------
some corporate consulting and sometimes


---------54:24----------
in my corporate consulting I have to


---------54:25----------
talk to people and I try to like coach


---------54:28----------
them and help them understand like how


---------54:30----------
to deal with difficult individuals or


---------54:32----------
[ __ ] in the workplace so there are


---------54:35----------
two angles that we can take one is that


---------54:37----------
we can like try to understand like


---------54:39----------
what's going on in your head and we kind


---------54:41----------
of did that okay and I'll be a little


---------54:43----------
bit more concrete and hopefully helpful


---------54:45----------
as we kind of sum that up the other


---------54:48----------
thing we can do is just talk about


---------54:49----------
techniques to actually deal with this


---------54:50----------
person that's not usually what we do on


---------54:53----------
stream but if that would be helpful to


---------54:54----------
you I actually want to help you in some


---------54:55----------
way um I mean maybe it would so the


---------55:00----------
first thing is that when you have a


---------55:02----------
disagreement with them can you tell me


---------55:04----------
the sequence of events in terms of how


---------55:06----------
you talk to them um I guess I can be a


---------55:10----------
bit brash in how I talk to them so like


---------55:12----------
they would say like I think we should


---------55:15----------
use like I don't know it's just stupid


---------55:16----------
example like if like a yellow colored


---------55:19----------
shop you know they're like no but like a


---------55:20----------
orange one is obviously the better way


---------55:22----------
and more inclusive way to go and people


---------55:25----------
agree with me I'm like okay yeah that


---------55:27----------
seems smart and then they say no it's


---------55:31----------
not I really think that's my good idea


---------55:33----------
Mike that's fair and then they say no I


---------55:35----------
think maybe they've kind of really just


---------55:37----------
keep pushing their an idea constantly


---------55:40----------
like like where it well sometimes they


---------55:43----------
yell sometimes they just keep it well


---------55:46----------
it's a little bit yeah that's kind of


---------55:48----------
simply put okay so I think you're


---------55:50----------
dealing with someone who themselves has


---------55:52----------
a confidence problem what do you think


---------55:55----------
about that hmm now they seem pretty


---------55:58----------
freaking confident in themselves I


---------55:59----------
completely agree I totally they have a


---------56:01----------
confidence problem because what they


---------56:03----------
have is arrogance and not confidence


---------56:05----------
maybe right because they hand they can't


---------56:09----------
tolerate that someone else has an idea


---------56:11----------
that's better than theirs because the


---------56:13----------
confident person if you're saying like


---------56:14----------
let's use a yellow sharpie and everyone


---------56:16----------
else is like let's use an orange sharpie


---------56:17----------
you're like yeah let's just use an


---------56:20----------
orange sharpie it sounds like I was


---------56:21----------
wrong Beck does this person admit that


---------56:23----------
they're wrong no never


---------56:27----------
mm-hm yeah so if you're confident can


---------56:30----------
you admit you're wrong yes yes all the


---------56:34----------
time very easily all the time right so


---------56:36----------
now you're using amplified statements


---------56:38----------
and if this person never admits that


---------56:42----------
they're wrong either they're perfect or


---------56:44----------
what


---------56:46----------
yeah Aryan is absolutely right because


---------56:49----------
the arrogant person doesn't admit


---------56:51----------
they're wrong so I think first thing you


---------56:53----------
gotta understand is that you're dealing


---------56:54----------
with someone who's got a big ego which


---------56:56----------
I'm sure you figured out I'm sure you


---------56:58----------
okay and so do like you with me that our


---------57:01----------
confidence in ego or actually like on


---------57:03----------
opposite ends of the spectrum yeah yeah


---------57:06----------
so so I think the main thing here is


---------57:08----------
that you know anytime you disagree with


---------57:10----------
them you're gonna be running up against


---------57:12----------
their ego it's not about the ideas it


---------57:16----------
completely doesn't become about the


---------57:17----------
ideas and this can be really frustrating


---------57:19----------
for people like you who actually have


---------57:21----------
good reasons for believing the things


---------57:22----------
that you believe is that you try to


---------57:23----------
explain to them all of the reasons why


---------57:28----------
their idea is not as good as your idea


---------57:29----------
and what happens when you try to explain


---------57:31----------
things like that to them and it's no


---------57:35----------
mean like it greeted with a yeah I could


---------57:37----------
see that but I still think this way but


---------57:41----------
he'll still they'll still go out of


---------57:43----------
their way to you know do their own idea


---------57:46----------
to make sure it's executed in the way


---------57:47----------
they think okay they don't let go their


---------57:50----------
an idea yeah okay so yeah so I think


---------57:55----------
that what you really got to do is first


---------57:57----------
of all understand that you're dealing


---------57:58----------
with the ego and that has its own kind


---------58:00----------
of script so it's not about logic


---------58:02----------
anymore it's not about the value of your


---------58:04----------
ideas because this this person's mind is


---------58:07----------
just not receptive like he doesn't care


---------58:10----------
or they don't care what the merit of


---------58:13----------
your idea versus the merit of their idea


---------58:15----------
does that make sense to you like they


---------58:17----------
just don't examine the facts at all


---------58:19----------
they're just it's all about ego and it's


---------58:21----------
like my idea is better because this is


---------58:22----------
what I believe and other people are


---------58:25----------
wrong so I think if you try to convince


---------58:26----------
them with logic it's not going to work


---------58:28----------
so if you want to be more manipulative


---------58:30----------
you can be ego stroking which is not


---------58:33----------
something that I usually recommend but


---------58:36----------
you can appeal to their ego do you know


---------58:37----------
how to do that


---------58:39----------
mm-hmm not exactly and okay okay some


---------58:44----------
people just sort of had an instinctive


---------58:46----------
sense of it but I think the other thing


---------58:47----------
that you can try doing is try to ask


---------58:50----------
them what their opinion is and ask them


---------58:54----------
to explain it and then there's like this


---------58:56----------
is like a group decision-making thing


---------58:58----------
I'm a little bit confused by this yeah


---------59:00----------
okay and then you you so what you want


---------59:02----------
to do is instead of put forth your


---------59:04----------
opinion something you can try to ask


---------59:06----------
them for their opinion and then reflect


---------59:08----------
back what they say so like if they say I


---------59:11----------
think we should use a yellow sharpie


---------59:13----------
because yellow is the best color you can


---------59:15----------
say okay so it sounds like you think a


---------59:17----------
yellow Sharpie is the best way to go


---------59:18----------
because of this and this and then you


---------59:23----------
can ask other people what they believe


---------59:25----------
as well and then like you can say like


---------59:28----------
okay what do you think and someone will


---------59:29----------
say orange and what do you think and


---------59:30----------
someone will say orange or you can say


---------59:32----------
like okay well I was thinking in


---------59:34----------
addition to considering yellow we could


---------59:36----------
consider orange and here's why I think


---------59:38----------
orange would be better and then now this


---------59:40----------
is a tricky part because you have to


---------59:41----------
take control of the conversation so this


---------59:43----------
could be hard then when you've put forth


---------59:45----------
your idea then you start asking other


---------59:47----------
people and I'm assuming this is like a


---------59:49----------
group setting where everyone is talking


---------59:50----------
together or no yeah okay then you ask


---------59:54----------
other people then and there which one


---------59:57----------
they think is better and you kind of you


---------60:00----------
say okay like so you know we have two


---------60:02----------
options yellow or orange what do you


---------60:04----------
think we should do then you ask


---------60:05----------
open-ended questions and then you ask


---------60:07----------
the third person what do you think we


---------60:08----------
should do what do you think we should do


---------60:10----------
and then you turn back to this person


---------60:12----------
you say okay so you mentioned yellow


---------60:14----------
because of this this and these are those


---------60:16----------
all sound like good reasons to me at the


---------60:17----------
same time don't say but never say but


---------60:20----------
okay


---------60:21----------
yeah at the same time it sounds like


---------60:24----------
most of the group thinks that orange is


---------60:26----------
better or orange is should be the call


---------60:29----------
that we should go that for these what do


---------60:31----------
you think about that yeah and then


---------60:34----------
they're going to say okay yeah I hear


---------60:36----------
what everyone's saying but I still think


---------60:37----------
yellow is better and you could say okay


---------60:38----------
so I it sounds like you still are


---------60:41----------
convinced that yellow is better we're


---------60:42----------
gonna go with orange because that's what


---------60:44----------
the group thinks and then you just


---------60:45----------
period


---------60:47----------
can you do that does that work I could


---------60:50----------
try okay what cuz like you can't do that


---------60:54----------
if this person is your boss mmm no no


---------60:58----------
the bus yeah so like I think the main


---------61:00----------
thing there is that that you know like


---------61:05----------
you you really have to like control the


---------61:06----------
con this is like some subtle kind of


---------61:08----------
boardroom like dynamics kind of stuff


---------61:11----------
does that make sense like do you do you


---------61:13----------
see what I'm saying so you ask for their


---------61:15----------
opinion because the more that if you


---------61:17----------
give them a chance to speak and be heard


---------61:19----------
and be recognized


---------61:21----------
then you're gonna disarm the ego and


---------61:23----------
you'll get less resistance but if you


---------61:26----------
argue with them and you if you use


---------61:29----------
phrases like but then it's gonna like


---------61:32----------
make their ego bigger because they're


---------61:35----------
gonna fight and then they're not gonna


---------61:36----------
listen mm-hmm yeah do you feel like you


---------61:40----------
could do this okay I think I could yeah


---------61:44----------
what do you think about this I mean it


---------61:47----------
seems easy enough it's just I just wish


---------61:51----------
they weren't so disagreeable and so yeah


---------61:55----------
so so that so that to you learn how to


---------61:57----------
sit with that so now we're gonna talk


---------61:59----------
about you again okay so you wish they


---------62:01----------
weren't so disagreeable mmm that sounds


---------62:04----------
like kind of like an understatement to


---------62:06----------
me okay so it's fine for you to be


---------62:14----------
subtle and meek and understated to the


---------62:19----------
rest of the world but you should be


---------62:20----------
honest with yourself


---------62:22----------
yeah right so it's fine that you want to


---------62:24----------
present this meek exterior and all that


---------62:26----------
that's fine so I get that you're you


---------62:28----------
know your stream is chill and not a


---------62:31----------
whole lot of ocean but within yourself


---------62:33----------
you should be honest with yourself are


---------62:36----------
you honest with yourself


---------62:38----------
and most of the time I think I mm-hmm


---------62:42----------
good so I would just encourage you to


---------62:44----------
like continue to be honest with yourself


---------62:46----------
right and acknowledge the way that you


---------62:48----------
feel acknowledge the way that he makes


---------62:50----------
you feel and also if you want to do


---------62:52----------
something to disarm his point of view


---------62:53----------
just understand that it's like he's just


---------62:55----------
trying to make you feel small like


---------62:58----------
that's actually what he's trying to do


---------62:59----------
because the ego pumps itself up and puts


---------63:02----------
other people down because the smaller he


---------63:05----------
makes you feel the bigger he's gonna


---------63:08----------
feel and he's this big ball of like


---------63:10----------
jelly on the inside that is not


---------63:12----------
confident in himself so if he can make


---------63:14----------
other people feel small then he can make


---------63:16----------
himself feel big and then he feels like


---------63:18----------
a big boy get support as being hands on


---------63:21----------
and so just try to recognize that this


---------63:23----------
actually has nothing to do with you it


---------63:25----------
just has everything to do with him and


---------63:26----------
if you I'm sorry if I'm torpedoing


---------63:28----------
whatever your work relations are by


---------63:30----------
talking about all the stuff but um you


---------63:34----------
know I think my hope is that that'll


---------63:36----------
help you interact with him and also for


---------63:38----------
you to feel more confident in what you


---------63:40----------
believe you know which I I know you


---------63:42----------
already feel confident but you feel a


---------63:43----------
hundred percent right mm-hmm you okay


---------63:49----------
any thoughts or questions um no I think


---------63:53----------
that's a really good yeah


---------63:55----------
that's a really nice way to put it it's


---------63:58----------
nice to talk about it yeah do you feel


---------64:00----------
okay being arrogant um yeah a little bit


---------64:06----------
as long as I'm aware of it


---------64:08----------
I feel beautiful right I can do with


---------64:10----------
that yeah very good yeah I completely


---------64:13----------
agree so so Kathleen I think the main


---------64:15----------
thing here is just so we're not perfect


---------64:18----------
beings right like our minds are just


---------64:19----------
like this complete mess of different


---------64:22----------
like processes and you know personality


---------64:26----------
traits and experiences and stuff like


---------64:28----------
that in your case here's what I would


---------64:31----------
kind of sum up the first is that I still


---------64:34----------
don't really know if you if there's some


---------64:36----------
part of you that's like insecure deep


---------64:38----------
down like I get those kinds of vibes but


---------64:40----------
anytime I kind of dig in that direction


---------64:42----------
it sounds like there's really nothing


---------64:43----------
there so I'm still kind of confused by


---------64:45----------
that so I'm just gonna assume that I'm


---------64:48----------
wrong there and I'm not sniffing


---------64:49----------
anything that's that's legit


---------64:51----------
because you seem to me to be actually


---------64:54----------
quite self-assured and like kind of who


---------64:55----------
you are and stuff like that


---------64:57----------
I think I'm sorry maybe I just think I'm


---------65:01----------
more insecure than I am I don't know


---------65:04----------
sorry


---------65:05----------
just thinking about it just now I'm just


---------65:07----------
like maybe I just want to feel insecure


---------65:09----------
or something I don't know you know what


---------65:13----------
say more about that help me understand


---------65:16----------
him I guess like I I wanted to believe


---------65:20----------
I'm who insecure then I am mm-hm maybe


---------65:24----------
because I mean it's it's easier to to be


---------65:29----------
insecure and then not pursue the things


---------65:31----------
that you really want to do because of


---------65:33----------
those insecurities um then actually go


---------65:37----------
for what you want to do she's just my


---------65:40----------
fear we hadn't what do you think about


---------65:43----------
that what do you think about the words


---------65:44----------
that just came out of your mouth yeah


---------65:48----------
it's um yeah maybe I'm holding myself


---------65:52----------
back a little bit on things that I don't


---------65:53----------
actually believe in yeah what do you


---------65:58----------
mean by things you don't believe in


---------65:59----------
maybe I don't


---------66:01----------
maybe when I say I can't do things I am


---------66:04----------
wrong and I don't believe that at all


---------66:06----------
and I just like to tell myself that yes


---------66:10----------
very good why do you tell yourself that


---------66:12----------
so I stopped myself from going for


---------66:15----------
things and failing at things very good


---------66:17----------
yeah yeah how long have you been


---------66:19----------
avoidant a failure


---------66:23----------
long time yeah I family what say it's


---------66:29----------
gay yes see see how it said parallel


---------66:32----------
it's in parallel you see that there's a


---------66:35----------
part of you that is actually confident


---------66:37----------
because you recognize that you do fail


---------66:38----------
and that's what we call brushing it off


---------66:40----------
you see what you did there


---------66:42----------
like sometimes I screw up and that's ok


---------66:44----------
cool you're like you're okay with that


---------66:47----------
right you're okay with failure yeah yeah


---------66:51----------
like you kind of have to be yeah right


---------66:54----------
so you can kind of joke about it but


---------66:56----------
then there's this other part of you this


---------66:57----------
is why it's so weird it's like playing


---------66:58----------
it's like talking to like two different


---------67:00----------
people there's like this other thing


---------67:02----------
within you that is this weird kind of


---------67:04----------
insecurity which anytime I try to dig it


---------67:06----------
like disappears it's like I'm trying to


---------67:09----------
catch missed and like I just close my


---------67:11----------
fist and there's nothing there so it's


---------67:13----------
like bizarre but I I do think that you


---------67:15----------
are holding yourself back in some way I


---------67:17----------
think that I would agree with you that


---------67:19----------
you probably have this thing going on


---------67:20----------
where you have the comfort of not being


---------67:25----------
a failure if you really don't try yeah


---------67:29----------
right like if you don't really try it's


---------67:32----------
not really that you're a failure it's


---------67:33----------
just that you didn't try yeah yeah yeah


---------67:42----------
good and and so just notice that too


---------67:46----------
because that thing too it's it's not


---------67:48----------
that that part of you is stupid that


---------67:50----------
part of you is just insecure right it is


---------67:53----------
afraid of what's gonna happen if it


---------67:55----------
really puts itself to the test if you go


---------67:58----------
all out its afraid that it's gonna fall


---------68:01----------
short yep that sounds right yeah so what


---------68:08----------
do we do about that Kathleen ignore that


---------68:12----------
part no no no no ignoring it as what


---------68:17----------
you've been doing okay that's why you


---------68:19----------
didn't know it was there hmm you trained


---------68:22----------
yourself to not look at it just accept


---------68:25----------
it I guess and just spend how do you do


---------68:26----------
that


---------68:28----------
just become okay with the fact that it


---------68:30----------
might not work well that yeah I might


---------68:33----------
have been right that I shouldn't have


---------68:34----------
gone for it but that's okay


---------68:36----------
yeah so I want you to envision so like


---------68:39----------
how old were you when you first started


---------68:41----------
to stop trying because you were afraid


---------68:45----------
of failing um I never stopped trying


---------68:48----------
okay keep trying but like I always have


---------68:51----------
that look I hold back a little bit I


---------68:53----------
guess along the way yeah but I guess I'm


---------68:56----------
just a young age yeah yeah so so like


---------68:59----------
like give me give me a number like


---------69:01----------
envision yourself like when you were


---------69:03----------
when you started to hold back just a


---------69:05----------
little bit right like you're at school


---------69:07----------
and you know the answer but you don't


---------69:09----------
say it I do that look yeah I can tell


---------69:13----------
young primary school eight years old


---------69:16----------
good so I want you to imagine that eight


---------69:19----------
year old person right mmm imagine she's


---------69:22----------
your little sister and she tells you


---------69:24----------
that sometimes I know the answer in


---------69:26----------
school and I don't raise my hand and I


---------69:28----------
don't want to say it what would you say


---------69:29----------
to her


---------69:30----------
I'd say I'm just you don't have to do it


---------69:35----------
all the time but you can go for it once


---------69:37----------
in a while and beautiful it's perfect


---------69:41----------
brilliant like okay right it's not go


---------69:47----------
for it all the time it's like every once


---------69:49----------
in a while it's okay to try yeah like do


---------69:55----------
you guys the kid like I'm not the only


---------69:57----------
one that thought that was a perfect


---------69:58----------
answer right you guys yeah okay twitch


---------70:00----------
chat agrees yeah cuz cuz it's because


---------70:03----------
you don't want to be fake you don't want


---------70:04----------
to be like yeah go for it like you can


---------70:06----------
do it man that's not what you tell the


---------70:08----------
eight-year-old that's not what the


---------70:09----------
eight-year-old needs to hear the


---------70:10----------
eight-year-old needs here's what I'm


---------70:12----------
gonna tell you what I heard in it first


---------70:14----------
of all safety you're giving the


---------70:17----------
eight-year-old safety right you're not


---------70:19----------
pushing them into territory that they're


---------70:21----------
not ready to move into you're also


---------70:23----------
giving them encouragement


---------70:26----------
right and you're also giving them like


---------70:31----------
forgiveness for falling short and you're


---------70:33----------
doing it ahead of time you're saying


---------70:35----------
that you don't have to avoid failure and


---------70:38----------
therefore you can give it your all


---------70:40----------
because if you fail that's okay you can


---------70:42----------
do that every once in a while you can


---------70:44----------
give it a shot you can put your toes in


---------70:45----------
the water like it's such a perfect thing


---------70:50----------
to say that's what you tell yourself you


---------70:53----------
don't [ __ ] ignore it that's not good


---------70:55----------
you tell you something that what you


---------70:57----------
just just go back and watch the vaad and


---------70:59----------
like write it down on a piece of paper


---------71:01----------
and that's exactly what you tell


---------71:03----------
yourself we just said it's okay to go


---------71:05----------
for it it's okay to be a little bit


---------71:06----------
louder it's okay to be a little bit more


---------71:08----------
vocal it's okay to to go for it every


---------71:13----------
once in a while beautiful right so


---------71:17----------
that's if anyone is wondering if


---------71:19----------
anyone's watching if you want to


---------71:20----------
encourage an anxious person to like try


---------71:24----------
like that's what she just said is just


---------71:27----------
the perfect thing to say right you give


---------71:30----------
them safety you give them space you give


---------71:32----------
them they control it you're not pushing


---------71:35----------
them you're not like oh do it go do it


---------71:38----------
speak no it's none of that


---------71:40----------
it's calmness it's space it's a little


---------71:45----------
little pat on the back and a little


---------71:47----------
shove but just a tiny tiny tiny one


---------71:49----------
beautifully play okay I forgot what we


---------71:54----------
were talking about but I just got


---------71:55----------
enamored with what you just said so


---------71:57----------
anyway what were you talking about oh


---------71:58----------
yeah how your insecurity holds you back


---------72:00----------
and your fear of failure and you don't


---------72:02----------
try and all that kind of good stuff good


---------72:05----------
job by the way if you did you did you


---------72:07----------
understand that about yourself um not


---------72:10----------
not really no no I just assumed I was


---------72:14----------
insecure about things yeah


---------72:16----------
yeah but so that's the it's it's really


---------72:19----------
it's subtle right because I think you


---------72:21----------
have this insecurity but I actually


---------72:23----------
think deep down you're very confident in


---------72:25----------
fact you're your agreeableness is very


---------72:26----------
low there's a reef emitting called the


---------72:29----------
Big Five personality model it's a


---------72:32----------
personality okay it's like a system of


---------72:36----------
understanding personality traits and


---------72:38----------
you're very calm


---------72:40----------
but you're actually like you don't like


---------72:42----------
once you decide something it's like hard


---------72:45----------
to change your mind right yeah yeah like


---------72:48----------
everyone will think that you're playing


---------72:51----------
along and you agree with them but deep


---------72:53----------
down you're just gonna be like this is


---------72:54----------
all dumb I'm just gonna be quiet but


---------72:56----------
everyone is wrong kind of yes yeah yeah


---------73:00----------
yeah so so there's that there's that


---------73:02----------
kind of like deep set sort of I don't


---------73:05----------
mean this in a bad way but there's that


---------73:06----------
kind of deep set arrogance that's like


---------73:08----------
kind of low agreeableness and it's just


---------73:10----------
like you're just not gonna you're like


---------73:12----------
it's hard to convince you actually like


---------73:14----------
once you've made up your mind that's


---------73:15----------
that's the way I'd put it so that's what


---------73:16----------
agreeableness is it's like people's


---------73:18----------
willingness to change their mind and


---------73:19----------
you're not actually willing to change


---------73:20----------
your mind so you managed to do all these


---------73:22----------
other things to just manage your own


---------73:24----------
feelings and anger and all that kind of


---------73:26----------
stuff but I think that yeah so is there


---------73:32----------
something else that you wanted to talk


---------73:33----------
about are we kind of good um I think


---------73:37----------
that was um I think that was a lot of it


---------73:40----------
I guess yeah I think I was really


---------73:43----------
hopeful okay what was helpful about it


---------73:46----------
I'm glad you I'm glad it was helpful um


---------73:51----------
uh most of it ya know just dealing just


---------73:54----------
dealing with the way I see people I


---------73:57----------
guess it really does help me because I


---------74:00----------
don't really often yeah think about it


---------74:03----------
too much and just what I can do about it


---------74:07----------
I guess really really hope yeah me so I


---------74:10----------
hope it helps and and feel free to just


---------74:12----------
like shoot me a message if that doesn't


---------74:14----------
work well and you want to talk a little


---------74:16----------
bit more privately about details and


---------74:18----------
stuff I may be able to give you some


---------74:20----------
more concrete advice about how to


---------74:21----------
approach challenging people in the


---------74:23----------
workplace but you know it's it's


---------74:27----------
sometimes details can be helpful but I


---------74:30----------
do a lot of this stuff with like


---------74:31----------
investment banks and and people just


---------74:33----------
places where they're just people who are


---------74:35----------
really not very open minded or nice or


---------74:38----------
care about other people's feelings


---------74:41----------
but you know I I think so a couple of


---------74:44----------
other things that I would encourage you


---------74:46----------
to just think about Kathleen so the


---------74:48----------
first is that it's okay to be angry with


---------74:51----------
people


---------74:53----------
like would you describe yourself as an


---------74:55----------
angry person I mean I feel like I do


---------74:58----------
have a bit of rage in me yep yeah I


---------75:01----------
would say definitely I think it's just


---------75:03----------
buried pretty low and and you're you're


---------75:05----------
really good at putting on front so it's


---------75:07----------
it's really tested my ability to like


---------75:08----------
peek underneath today which has been fun


---------75:11----------
and and so I think it's okay to feel


---------75:13----------
those those feelings of anger and it


---------75:15----------
doesn't make you right or wrong just


---------75:17----------
acknowledge that you have them and and


---------75:19----------
and then the other thing is I'd say stop


---------75:21----------
doing some of these mental gymnastics


---------75:22----------
right so at the more that you feel the


---------75:25----------
things that you let your like the more


---------75:27----------
that you understand the way that you


---------75:28----------
feel about something and if someone


---------75:30----------
makes you feel small you know just just


---------75:32----------
acknowledge that that person is making


---------75:34----------
you feel that way but the cool thing and


---------75:36----------
how old are you now if you don't mind me


---------75:38----------
asking at 26 okay so like there's 26


---------75:41----------
year old Kathleen who's actually like a


---------75:42----------
complete badass right sure yeah yeah


---------75:46----------
yeah yeah yeah absolutely right see you


---------75:48----------
do have confidence and so just remember


---------75:50----------
that that 26 year old is actually there


---------75:53----------
too right there's the 8 year old and


---------75:54----------
there's the 26 year old they're both


---------75:57----------
there and the weird thing is like they


---------75:59----------
take turns driving your mind and it


---------76:02----------
could be like really really confusing so


---------76:04----------
just remember that there's actually a 26


---------76:06----------
year old who is like really awesome at


---------76:07----------
what they do who actually doesn't need


---------76:10----------
to be any better like you get that you


---------76:11----------
don't actually like need to be better on


---------76:13----------
stream right like people come for you


---------76:17----------
yeah but I could still beat bad out


---------76:19----------
there you can be a better but but you


---------76:21----------
don't need to be anyone else no no I


---------76:24----------
don't need it be anyone else no and do


---------76:26----------
you cut yourself some slack for not


---------76:28----------
being the best version of you every day


---------76:33----------
so that's the next thing okay so what do


---------76:37----------
you think about that I mean I had I cut


---------76:41----------
myself slack if I had that they always


---------76:43----------
say like be the best years like but I


---------76:45----------
wasn't today mm-hmm


---------76:47----------
yeah so this this this is gonna be a


---------76:50----------
whole other I'm I we're gonna have to if


---------76:53----------
you want to do a follow-up at some point


---------76:54----------
we'll dig into that but not to like look


---------76:57----------
so just think about this right so here's


---------76:58----------
the eight-year-old who's thinking those


---------77:00----------
thoughts and what is the twenty


---------77:01----------
six-year-old say to the eight-year-old


---------77:03----------
who's like no but I like I missed a


---------77:05----------
question on the test and then the 26


---------77:08----------
year old is like but but the


---------77:10----------
eight-year-olds like no I could have


---------77:11----------
studied harder and I could have gotten a


---------77:13----------
perfect score everyone tells me to be


---------77:16----------
the best version of myself and I'm not


---------77:17----------
being the best version of myself


---------77:19----------
what would I say to them yeah oh good


---------77:26----------
that there's always just another day


---------77:30----------
another task or anything and what does


---------77:33----------
the eight-year-old say in response to


---------77:35----------
them probably like but I'll be bad at


---------77:40----------
that one I'll say who might be the very


---------77:41----------
good yeah so that's not the right thing


---------77:43----------
to say


---------77:43----------
so you haven't figured out what to say


---------77:45----------
so like your last time so I think you


---------77:47----------
did a really good job of processing a


---------77:49----------
lot of what we talked about you came out


---------77:50----------
with something beautiful but what you


---------77:52----------
just said the eight-year-old is gonna


---------77:53----------
slap away yeah they're gonna be like


---------77:56----------
that works for other people but it


---------77:59----------
doesn't work for me right that's what


---------78:01----------
the it you know affects other people are


---------78:03----------
allowed to make mistakes I'm not allowed


---------78:05----------
to make mistakes you don't understand


---------78:06----------
who I am yeah yeah


---------78:10----------
it looks like lady you're crazy you're


---------78:14----------
26 what did you know I mean so that's


---------78:18----------
gonna be so we'll get to that but do you


---------78:20----------
see that you see it what you're new into


---------78:22----------
yourself like you hold yourself to an


---------78:24----------
impossible standard like at least tell


---------78:26----------
me you see that you don't have to do


---------78:28----------
anything with it


---------78:30----------
be yeah a little bit I guess


---------78:33----------
see you don't even see it yeah of course


---------78:37----------
of course you could be better yeah


---------78:39----------
other people hold themselves to


---------78:41----------
impossible standards you your standard


---------78:44----------
is not impossible right you can do it if


---------78:46----------
you work hard enough and if you were


---------78:48----------
better you could do it yeah yeah I think


---------78:53----------
maybe yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so I


---------78:55----------
don't think we're there yet that's okay


---------78:57----------
okay so we'll just just deal with the


---------79:00----------
rage deal with the you know the funny


---------79:02----------
thing about insecurity and and letting


---------79:05----------
yourself holding yourself back so that


---------79:07----------
you don't really have to be a complete


---------79:08----------
failure yeah right and and and get in


---------79:12----------
touch with the confident awesome 26 year


---------79:14----------
old and then we'll leave we'll leave the


---------79:17----------
part of you that can be perfect for


---------79:19----------
another day like the part of you that


---------79:21----------
has to be perfect I should say huh


---------79:25----------
perfect perfect overrated I don't have


---------79:28----------
to be yeah what do you have to be what


---------79:31----------
do you have to be what's the standard


---------79:32----------
you hold yourself to if not perfections


---------79:34----------
better yeah right so that's dangerous


---------79:38----------
because because what that also tells me


---------79:40----------
is that you're not good enough like


---------79:43----------
you're not sure yeah it's dangerous


---------79:46----------
being better the the endless pursuit of


---------79:49----------
being better is one of the most


---------79:50----------
dangerous things you can do to yourself


---------79:52----------
because it always means if you if you


---------79:55----------
can be better it means you're not good


---------79:56----------
enough and that's something that we have


---------79:58----------
to figure out how to get that out of you


---------80:00----------
what tear that out root step I thought


---------80:03----------
like everyone stripes like to improve


---------80:06----------
themselves soon yeah why do you think


---------80:07----------
the world is such an unhappy place


---------80:11----------
seriously yeah I work with a lot of very


---------80:16----------
successful people who always want to be


---------80:17----------
better and I try very hard to teach them


---------80:20----------
to be okay with the person that they are


---------80:23----------
right yeah but like then would they work


---------80:29----------
is hard and it's very good very good


---------80:32----------
right so a lot of people think that this


---------80:34----------
the desire to be better is the only way


---------80:37----------
to motivate yourself to do the best that


---------80:40----------
you can which happens to be untrue so


---------80:43----------
there is a different way right there's


---------80:46----------
different way dr. MA duty so this is


---------80:50----------
what I want you to do the next time you


---------80:52----------
stream it's not about whether you can be


---------80:55----------
better but you're gonna show up and


---------80:57----------
you're gonna do the best that you can


---------80:58----------
for the the people that are watching and


---------81:01----------
you're not gonna be perfect and could


---------81:04----------
you be better yeah but like it's about


---------81:06----------
them it's not about you so whether


---------81:08----------
you're better or not better has nothing


---------81:10----------
to do with I mean that's all in your


---------81:12----------
head that's all ego does that make sense


---------81:14----------
it's about that it's about being the


---------81:17----------
person that you need to be for the


---------81:18----------
people that are watching and you devote


---------81:21----------
yourself to that and you devote yourself


---------81:22----------
to them instead of yourself because so


---------81:25----------
far the the pursuit of being better is


---------81:27----------
about who myself I guess absolutely


---------81:33----------
right it's all about you so that needs


---------81:36----------
to change you can still put your best


---------81:38----------
foot forward and have it be about other


---------81:40----------
people yeah what do you think about that


---------81:46----------
hmm that's a little bit confusing for me


---------81:50----------
because it's yeah although it is for


---------81:52----------
myself like I just did this like amazing


---------81:54----------
if I put myself to it and I was like hey


---------81:56----------
I could do this amazing video I could be


---------81:59----------
this person who makes amazing videos and


---------82:01----------
makes this type thing and that was


---------82:04----------
really good for the audience to say I


---------82:05----------
much like so but notice what you're


---------82:08----------
doing so the the main thing that you're


---------82:10----------
talking about is you could be an amazing


---------82:12----------
person the audience comes after ya your


---------82:15----------
focus is on yourself that needs to


---------82:18----------
change if you want to put your best foot


---------82:20----------
forward and also forgive yourself for


---------82:22----------
being what you are you need to put the


---------82:25----------
audience first right so you can wake up


---------82:28----------
in the mall


---------82:29----------
standards h-how'd if i think that what


---------82:32----------
if i think they want the thing that's


---------82:33----------
really hard to do it impossible


---------82:35----------
so you can only make them you can only


---------82:38----------
give them what you can give them right


---------82:41----------
okay so if they have impossible


---------82:43----------
standards like they have impossible


---------82:44----------
standards but they don't yeah they


---------82:48----------
actually have very reasonable standards


---------82:50----------
I know this is absolutely insane but I


---------82:53----------
actually find twitch chat to be quite


---------82:54----------
reasonable and quite intelligent no they


---------82:57----------
are yeah but you can't tell them that


---------82:59----------
yeah I know that's go straight to their


---------83:02----------
head talk about it you go anyway so this


---------83:05----------
is all sneak preview stop just chew on


---------83:07----------
it a little bit but I think okay let's


---------83:09----------
try let's try a little bit of meditation


---------83:11----------
is that okay yeah okay I want you to


---------83:14----------
close your eyes okay so you could be


---------83:20----------
better right yes yeah I want you to just


---------83:23----------
feel that for a second is it thoughts is


---------83:28----------
it sensations what is it sensations


---------83:32----------
young yeah the the feeling of not being


---------83:34----------
good and often that you could be better


---------83:36----------
comes from where let's just talk about


---------83:39----------
it it's kind of weird mmm where do you


---------83:50----------

---------83:54----------

---------84:03----------

---------84:07----------

---------84:14----------

was tricky guys that was she is just


---------92:46----------
subtle subtle subtle like it's man she


---------92:49----------
really doesn't show a whole lot and it


---------92:53----------
was it was it was hard like I was like I

---------93:03----------
yeah it was but it was good it was good


---------93:07----------
I'm glad we got somewhere and you guys


---------93:09----------
see how she figured out that the whole


---------93:10----------
thing about how insecurity is protective


---------93:12----------
all all by yourself like at the end I


---------93:14----------
love it how it happens I love it it's


---------93:16----------
like you just kind of mess around with


---------93:17----------
the conscious and the subconscious a


---------93:19----------
little bit and then they're like oh by


---------93:22----------
the way um so that was good so it's


---------93:32----------
great it's great it's like you don't


---------93:33----------
mean I really don't do a whole lot I


---------93:35----------
don't know if you guys realize that but


---------93:37----------
like like people just discover so much


---------93:41----------
about themselves and you just have to


---------93:42----------
give them some time in some space to


---------93:44----------
like explore their mind and you will


---------93:46----------
figure out all kinds of cool stuff about


---------93:48----------
yourself and yeah it was challenging so


---------93:52----------

---------93:56----------
