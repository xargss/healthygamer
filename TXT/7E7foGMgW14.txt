---------00:00----------
so if we think about why we get addicted


---------00:02----------
to video games or substances


---------00:04----------
it's the inability to tolerate a


---------00:07----------
negative emotion


---------00:09----------
so sitting within a negative emotion is


---------00:11----------
the first step of every unwanted action


---------00:13----------
so reward it


---------00:15----------
so if you don't get out of bed because


---------00:17----------
it is very uncomfortable


---------00:18----------
very comfortable sitting with this


---------00:20----------
uncomfortable feeling should be your


---------00:21----------
first goal


---------00:22----------
tell yourself hey this is exactly what i


---------00:24----------
wanted i wanted to feel this


---------00:25----------
uncomfortable feeling so i can be proud


---------00:27----------
of myself that i did it


---------00:29----------
if you listen to this talk between lex


---------00:32----------
friedman and andrew huberman


---------00:34----------
talking about david goggins you can get


---------00:36----------
an idea of why this could help you


---------00:39----------
overcome the action blockage from those


---------00:42----------
negative emotions quick summary though i


---------00:44----------
don't know if it's 100


---------00:46----------
correct the idea is that when you have


---------00:48----------
this mental friction from the negative


---------00:50----------
emotion your body naturally wants to


---------00:52----------
stay still


---------00:53----------
run away from this threat by rewarding


---------00:56----------
yourself with sanding this emotion


---------00:58----------
the dopamine that is released helps to


---------01:00----------
turn down this mental friction


---------01:02----------
which will then ease up the way towards


---------01:04----------
action


---------01:05----------
yeah so i think that


---------01:08----------
there's some good stuff here


---------01:12----------
but there are some


---------01:13----------
[Music]


---------01:15----------
problems here too so i


---------01:18----------
completely agree that sitting with a


---------01:20----------
negative emotion


---------01:21----------
is a very important step towards moving


---------01:24----------
in the right direction


---------01:25----------
i think i know it sounds kind of weird


---------01:27----------
but like i think you guys have to be


---------01:29----------
careful about this too


---------01:32----------
like this is the challenge right is it's


---------01:33----------
hard to actually like


---------01:35----------
choose what you reward yourself with


---------01:38----------
right so if i were to say like


---------01:40----------
i should just reward myself for drinking


---------01:43----------
water instead of drinking soda


---------01:45----------
like that's not actually how dopamine


---------01:47----------
works


---------01:49----------
right like i can tell myself that this


---------01:51----------
like this this this is really tricky


---------01:53----------
because like i can tell myself like


---------01:56----------
tell yourself hey this is exactly what i


---------01:59----------
wanted


---------02:00----------
but this is not actually sitting with


---------02:02----------
something


---------02:04----------
because that's not actually


---------02:05----------
authentically how you feel


---------02:08----------
right so telling yourself something is


---------02:10----------
not actually being authentic


---------02:11----------
sure like it can be you can you can have


---------02:13----------
some amount of benefit from doing this


---------02:16----------
don't get me wrong there's just a couple


---------02:18----------
of things here which i think are sort of


---------02:19----------
nuanced


---------02:20----------
and it's the tell yourself part that i


---------02:22----------
think that


---------02:24----------
you have to be careful about because


---------02:26----------
telling yourself something won't


---------02:28----------
actually release a dopamine hit


---------02:30----------
right it's like like i remember many


---------02:33----------
years ago


---------02:34----------
i used to hate going to amusement parks


---------02:36----------
so i stopped going for like a decade and


---------02:38----------
then like


---------02:39----------
i i was you know once i got together


---------02:41----------
with my wife she really liked them


---------02:43----------
and so i was like oh like i'll just you


---------02:45----------
know like i'll just get over it


---------02:47----------
so i went on roller coasters found the


---------02:49----------
experience to be like


---------02:50----------
mind numbingly unpleasant like i just


---------02:53----------
don't enjoy being on a roller coaster


---------02:54----------
and i was like i'll get used to it i'll


---------02:56----------
get used to it i'll get used to it try


---------02:57----------
to enjoy it


---------02:58----------
so i use like all my yoga training to go


---------03:01----------
like back on the roller coaster again


---------03:03----------
and again and again and again so


---------03:06----------
conquered my fear


---------03:09----------
tried to enjoy it and then i sort of


---------03:11----------
realized like the more i used like the


---------03:13----------
yogic training i just sat down after my


---------03:15----------
like seventh roller coaster of the day


---------03:16----------
and i was like


---------03:17----------
you know what i just don't enjoy this


---------03:20----------
and i actually


---------03:20----------
don't need to enjoy it like i don't have


---------03:23----------
to convince myself


---------03:25----------
that this is fun so i think it's really


---------03:28----------
challenging when you guys set a standard


---------03:30----------
for yourself


---------03:31----------
to like use tell yourself that you enjoy


---------03:34----------
something


---------03:35----------
and then rely on like the dopamine hit


---------03:37----------
to motivate your action


---------03:40----------
because that may not work and then where


---------03:42----------
are you like do you just try yours to


---------03:44----------
tell yourself more like this reminds me


---------03:46----------
a little bit of like the power of


---------03:47----------
positive thinkers it's just to tell


---------03:49----------
yourself man just tell yourself tell


---------03:50----------
yourself that you enjoy this


---------03:52----------
tell yourself that this is good so i


---------03:53----------
think learning how to talk to yourself


---------03:54----------
in a healthy way is absolutely


---------03:56----------
wonderful don't get me wrong like it's


---------03:58----------
good to tell yourself nice compassionate


---------04:00----------
things


---------04:01----------
so telling yourself has a space noticing


---------04:04----------
your unwanted emotions and learning how


---------04:06----------
to sit with your unwanted emotions


---------04:08----------
is absolutely very very important


---------04:13----------
it's the translation of this that


---------04:14----------
sometimes i kind of disagree with


---------04:16----------
because in my experience the goal of


---------04:18----------
sitting with unwanted emotions is not


---------04:20----------
the first step


---------04:22----------
to right action it's the first step to


---------04:25----------
conquering wrong action so if we think


---------04:28----------
about


---------04:29----------
why we get addicted to video games or


---------04:31----------
substances


---------04:32----------
it's the inability to tolerate a


---------04:34----------
negative emotion


---------04:36----------
i feel ashamed of myself so let me go


---------04:38----------
play some dota and then i can forget


---------04:40----------
about the shame


---------04:42----------
i feel anxious in a social setting so


---------04:45----------
let me get


---------04:45----------
high first so that like i can enjoy


---------04:48----------
social feelings


---------04:50----------
i work with people who have marijuana


---------04:51----------
addiction and like the most


---------04:53----------
devastating and hardest marijuana


---------04:55----------
addiction to kick


---------04:57----------
is diagnosed this way and it is


---------05:00----------
when i smoke marijuana i feel the way


---------05:03----------
that other people look


---------05:05----------
i feel normal other people are living


---------05:08----------
normal lives


---------05:09----------
and i'm not living a normal life and if


---------05:11----------
i take marijuana i get


---------05:13----------
access for a few hours to a normal life


---------05:16----------
that is the hardest addiction to kick so


---------05:19----------
in my experience


---------05:21----------
should you learn how to sit with a


---------05:22----------
negative emotion absolutely


---------05:26----------
but be careful because when you start


---------05:28----------
telling yourself things


---------05:29----------
or forcing yourself to believe a


---------05:31----------
particular thing that's actually where i


---------05:33----------
think you go wrong


---------05:35----------
because what i what i try to help people


---------05:37----------
do is like sit with the negative emotion


---------05:39----------
absolutely


---------05:40----------
but don't let the negative emotion


---------05:42----------
control your behavior don't convince


---------05:44----------
yourself


---------05:44----------
otherwise actually accept that this i


---------05:47----------
absolutely sit with the negative emotion


---------05:49----------
but don't give in to it


---------05:50----------
right don't give in to the behavior that


---------05:53----------
follows the negative emotion


---------05:54----------
and that's when i say just don't give in


---------05:56----------
to it that's where the process of not


---------05:58----------
giving into it this is my problem with a


---------06:00----------
lot of the like


---------06:00----------
you know these like analyses is like no


---------06:02----------
one gives you a process


---------06:04----------
and they tell you the goal they say


---------06:06----------
notice your negative emotions tell


---------06:08----------
yourself this they don't like and it


---------06:09----------
sort of sounds like a process but like


---------06:11----------
what's the real process the real process


---------06:14----------
is going to be painful


---------06:15----------
that as you notice the negative emotion


---------06:18----------
that is actually going to mechanically


---------06:21----------
disable its energy a little bit and then


---------06:24----------
notice what happens when you give into


---------06:25----------
it and notice what happens when you


---------06:27----------
don't give in to it


---------06:28----------
which you are you happier to be


---------06:32----------
and noticing is just the first step


---------06:34----------
right like awareness precedes control


---------06:36----------
good diagnosis precedes good treatment


---------06:40----------
so you should absolutely notice your


---------06:42----------
unwanted actions i mean unwanted


---------06:44----------
emotions and learn how to sit with them


---------06:46----------
but the goal is not to transform them


---------06:48----------
into something that you enjoy


---------06:49----------
because you may not be able to do that


---------06:51----------
don't rely on that the goal is to not


---------06:53----------
let them control you you should be in


---------06:56----------
control of them


---------06:57----------
and your behaviors should not be


---------06:58----------
dictated by unwanted emotions


---------07:02----------
how do you not give in you start by


---------07:04----------
noticing and i know it sounds kind of


---------07:06----------
weird but we can


---------07:07----------
do this i'll give you guys like a


---------07:08----------
meditation practice like now okay


---------07:11----------
i want you guys to take a food that


---------07:14----------
you dislike and try eating it


---------07:18----------
but do it with a hundred percent


---------07:20----------
awareness don't watch anything


---------07:22----------
don't read anything don't listen to an


---------07:24----------
audiobook sit there with the food and


---------07:26----------
take one bite


---------07:28----------
of the food that you dislike it doesn't


---------07:30----------
have to be your least favorite fruit


---------07:31----------
just something you're not a big fan of


---------07:33----------
like try to be like relatively neutral


---------07:36----------
and just notice what happens to your


---------07:38----------
ability to eat it


---------07:40----------
as you eat it with full awareness does


---------07:42----------
it become easier to eat or harder


---------07:44----------
to eat it's kind of weird right so


---------07:47----------
someone says pineapple on pizza


---------07:48----------
the great divide right so if you guys we


---------07:51----------
could talk about privilege and


---------07:52----------
and you know socioeconomic stuff as much


---------07:54----------
as you guys want to


---------07:55----------
why we really want to get people upset


---------07:57----------
we'll talk about whether pineapple


---------07:58----------
belongs on pizza or not


---------08:01----------
okay just notice what happens


---------08:05----------
with your discomfort and then see how


---------08:08----------
the discomfort that you have full


---------08:10----------
observation of


---------08:12----------
affects your behavior down the road does


---------08:14----------
it make it easier to eat it or harder to


---------08:16----------
eat it


---------08:16----------
and that will be your answer
