---------00:28----------
but uh yeah ah it's always there's


---------00:30----------
always like a good reason to wake up


---------00:32----------
early it's always nice to have a reason


---------00:34----------
to wake up


---------00:35----------
yeah well i thank you very much for you


---------00:36----------
know inconveniencing yourself for our


---------00:38----------
sake


---------00:42----------
hmm


---------00:45----------
i've been uh meaning to come on here for


---------00:49----------
a while uh i know


---------00:52----------
i i guess you've talked to every single


---------00:54----------
other offline tv member huh


---------00:58----------
i actually don't know if i have or


---------00:59----------
haven't


---------01:01----------
uh pokey lily scarra


---------01:04----------
michael and yvonne


---------01:07----------
so yeah they've all been on so i'm here


---------01:10----------
to


---------01:11----------
help you finish your infinity gauntlet


---------01:14----------
oh wow okay well i mean do you feel


---------01:16----------
pressured to come on because other


---------01:18----------
people from otp have come on


---------01:20----------
uh no no um i mean people have tried


---------01:24----------
pressuring me


---------01:25----------
to go on but i just say no


---------01:28----------
okay uh so the reason why i came on


---------01:32----------
uh well people have been asking um


---------01:36----------
for a while now because i talk about


---------01:39----------
like a lot of my


---------01:41----------
thought process and people are always


---------01:42----------
like oh you should go on drk


---------01:44----------
but the response i've always given them


---------01:46----------
is like


---------01:48----------
i don't feel like it's necessary


---------01:52----------
and um because it's


---------01:55----------
content i also had to reconcile like


---------01:58----------
the fact that it's content but it's also


---------02:02----------
meant to be like beneficial or like


---------02:05----------
eye-opening experience for people to


---------02:08----------
listen in um


---------02:11----------
so i think your wife reached out to me


---------02:14----------
saying hey you guys have free private


---------02:16----------
sessions


---------02:19----------
um because i think people from your side


---------02:21----------
like not your wife but like people on


---------02:22----------
your team have


---------02:23----------
sent me like 10 emails like i could show


---------02:27----------
you the


---------02:27----------
uh twitter dm's not sure if yourself


---------02:29----------
it's just like 10 requests for me to


---------02:31----------
come on the show oh wow which i've


---------02:34----------
ignored


---------02:35----------
uh but uh i vote


---------02:38----------
i'm just not big on replying but i think


---------02:40----------
your wife reached out saying hey


---------02:42----------
we have some free private sessions just


---------02:45----------
for your own benefit


---------02:47----------
um which is also what made me


---------02:50----------
agree to go on when the private session


---------02:53----------
was offered i'm like oh they're nice


---------02:55----------
enough to offer private session where


---------02:57----------
there's no content to be made so that's


---------02:59----------
pretty chill of them


---------03:00----------
so yeah i will go on the public session


---------03:02----------
one okay


---------03:04----------
interesting um that's how i got here


---------03:07----------
well i'm i'm sorry that you know i


---------03:09----------
didn't uh


---------03:10----------
on behalf of my team for which i take


---------03:13----------
responsibility if they were pestering


---------03:15----------
you i'm i'm really sorry about that


---------03:16----------
no no no not at all not at all um thanks


---------03:19----------
for the feedback because i'll you know


---------03:20----------
we'll circle back because we


---------03:21----------
we haven't really heard that from anyone


---------03:23----------
else we we try to actually be


---------03:25----------
quite respectful of people not wanting


---------03:27----------
to come on


---------03:28----------
um i also am


---------03:31----------
you know it's kind of interesting about


---------03:33----------
70 of


---------03:34----------
the people that i've worked with like i


---------03:36----------
do for free


---------03:38----------
historically um and


---------03:41----------
i i'm i'm wondering whether yeah i'm


---------03:44----------
kind of surprised to hear you


---------03:46----------
say all that stuff but i'm kind of you


---------03:48----------
know if if if i was which is news to me


---------03:50----------
um offering to meet with you privately


---------03:53----------
for free why


---------03:54----------
how would that motivate you to come on


---------03:56----------
publicly if you didn't want to earlier


---------03:58----------
like that's weird um


---------04:00----------
because


---------04:04----------
it's a nice thing to do to offer like


---------04:07----------
private therapy sessions uh


---------04:11----------
because there's no gain essentially to


---------04:14----------
be had right


---------04:16----------
at least not an immediate obvious gain


---------04:19----------
um so


---------04:24----------
and i felt like


---------04:27----------
you know your wife was offering me uh uh


---------04:30----------
a favor and she didn't have to so


---------04:34----------
i like that um when people are nice yeah


---------04:38----------
and i like being nice back


---------04:44----------
what should i call you because i know


---------04:45----------
you as disguised toast i mean i've been


---------04:47----------
watching


---------04:48----------
like i started watching your hearthstone


---------04:49----------
streams many many years ago


---------04:52----------
probably like back when like i i also


---------04:55----------
remember i was watching you for a while


---------04:57----------
because i think you made it a lot of


---------04:58----------
like meme friendly content


---------05:01----------
right and if i remember the origin of


---------05:03----------
your name it's it's what the guy


---------05:04----------
says when you coin out defies bandit on


---------05:07----------
turn one


---------05:09----------
yeah wow you're an oh gee i am an


---------05:12----------
og like back when chillwind yeti was


---------05:14----------
actually a solid card


---------05:17----------
you know and then and so watched prior


---------05:20----------
to


---------05:21----------
um i i still remember actually like one


---------05:24----------
of the most memorable things was when


---------05:26----------
someone leaked your face


---------05:29----------
and i really loved your response video


---------05:31----------
to that


---------05:32----------
yeah um that was uh wow that was a long


---------05:35----------
time ago


---------05:36----------
yeah man and and i i still remember if i


---------05:39----------
remember the sentiment correctly you


---------05:40----------
were like this is for fun it's not like


---------05:42----------
i'm actually trying to hide


---------05:44----------
and like people are sort of taking it


---------05:45----------
too far and like it's fine like i don't


---------05:47----------
mind showing my face but


---------05:48----------
you know the whole point was to like


---------05:50----------
entertain people and it was


---------05:52----------
yeah i mean yeah like it's it's cooler


---------05:55----------
to have like


---------05:56----------
a gimmick like especially when you're


---------05:58----------
starting out as a streamer


---------06:00----------
and like sorry now it's it's always


---------06:02----------
awkward when you become a


---------06:04----------
content creator on the internet because


---------06:06----------
my biggest fear


---------06:07----------
was just like my friends finding out and


---------06:09----------
making fun of me because it's it's kind


---------06:11----------
of it's kind of like uh like being an


---------06:13----------
internet stream is one of those


---------06:16----------
big dreams kids have nowadays you know


---------06:18----------
they used to want to be a singer or an


---------06:20----------
actor but now it's like oh


---------06:21----------
i want to be a video game streamer so


---------06:25----------
uh yeah can i just jump in what should i


---------06:28----------
call you today


---------06:30----------
um you can call me toast


---------06:33----------
okay most people call me toast like


---------06:35----------
jeremy's more


---------06:36----------
intimate but i don't know anyone


---------06:39----------
like in my like friend group who calls


---------06:43----------
me jeremy


---------06:44----------
do you want people to call you jeremy no


---------06:47----------
no no okay


---------06:48----------
a weird meal at this point just because


---------06:50----------
i'm just so used to hearing toast


---------06:53----------
yeah um and and so i want to just


---------06:57----------
also take a step back for a second uh


---------06:59----------
toast and just


---------07:00----------
sort of let's think this through so you


---------07:02----------
know if we


---------07:03----------
offered if you you know we tried to do


---------07:06----------
you


---------07:07----------
a kindness and in return


---------07:10----------
you want to do a kindness to us i can


---------07:12----------
totally respect it it's a hundred


---------07:14----------
percent how i operate in my personal


---------07:15----------
life


---------07:16----------
and i also want to be a little bit


---------07:18----------
careful because


---------07:19----------
um you don't have to do us a kindness i


---------07:23----------
know it's kind of weird because we're


---------07:24----------
already streaming at this point


---------07:26----------
right but i i i think that like you know


---------07:29----------
i i don't want you to feel


---------07:31----------
um i mean i i sort of am getting the


---------07:33----------
feeling


---------07:34----------
or i'm interpreting that you're feeling


---------07:36----------
kind of like


---------07:39----------
almost a sense of like repayment like


---------07:42----------
you're


---------07:42----------
you're you're doing you know you're like


---------07:44----------
paying a debt by coming on stream


---------07:47----------
um which i think is going to be


---------07:48----------
interesting because i'm like really


---------07:49----------
curious whether that's a pattern that


---------07:51----------
exists elsewhere in your life


---------07:54----------
um right and then uh


---------07:57----------
but but i also want to be clear that


---------07:59----------
like i'm actually okay i know it's gonna


---------08:01----------
be weird and i know it's gonna be


---------08:02----------
anticlimactic but like


---------08:04----------
the only way that i can do this because


---------08:05----------
you're right that it's weird because


---------08:06----------
it's like content and helping people


---------08:08----------
that's sort of like a conflict of


---------08:10----------
interest if you think about it right


---------08:11----------
like what am i really here for


---------08:13----------
and so the only way that i can resolve


---------08:15----------
that conflict of interest is i actually


---------08:17----------
am not here to help the internet i'm


---------08:19----------
here to help the person that i talk to


---------08:20----------
it's the only way that i can do this


---------08:22----------
because otherwise it gets too confusing


---------08:25----------
um and by having that


---------08:26----------
is my north star it actually makes all


---------08:28----------
the decision making easy


---------08:30----------
and i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------08:31----------
like what that also means is like


---------08:33----------
if you're here because you feel like you


---------08:35----------
have to be here because we tried to do


---------08:37----------
you a solid


---------08:39----------
we could just stop and i'm totally fine


---------08:41----------
with that


---------08:43----------
i'm serious i don't know just imagine


---------08:46----------
the stream ending


---------08:47----------
instantly five minutes in um


---------08:50----------
but toast let's really think about that


---------08:52----------
for a second okay


---------08:54----------
because like like i want you to think


---------08:56----------
about like what what lesson does that


---------08:58----------
teach people


---------08:59----------
who are watching


---------09:03----------
well i think the world is definitely


---------09:07----------
better off if every nice


---------09:10----------
act was reciprocated with a nice act of


---------09:13----------
its own


---------09:14----------
uh but without obligation to do so


---------09:18----------
i think there is an expectation but not


---------09:20----------
an obligation if that makes sense like


---------09:23----------
i you know do my friends a lot


---------09:27----------
solid and sometimes rarely i would ask


---------09:30----------
for one back


---------09:32----------
but when i do ask for one back it's not


---------09:34----------
an obligation right because i didn't i


---------09:36----------
wasn't nice to you with the expectation


---------09:39----------
that you're nice to me back but if i


---------09:42----------
lend you twenty dollars on tuesday and


---------09:44----------
next friday


---------09:45----------
i ask for ten dollars like hey can i get


---------09:48----------
a loan ten dollars and you


---------09:50----------
pay for something and you say no


---------09:53----------
i would never like demand hey that's not


---------09:56----------
fair


---------09:57----------
i gave you 20 bucks last week but more


---------09:59----------
like in the back of my head i'm gonna


---------10:02----------
mentally note you know i did a solid


---------10:05----------
but they weren't able to


---------10:08----------
like do one back and i think that's just


---------10:12----------
human nature right i think


---------10:14----------
absolutely the majority of people yeah


---------10:17----------
so i know it sounds kind of weird toast


---------10:18----------
but i think sometimes


---------10:20----------
feelings of obligation get people to


---------10:22----------
make sacrifices


---------10:25----------
and i know it's weird but sometimes


---------10:26----------
those sacrifices i don't think are


---------10:28----------
actually healthy


---------10:32----------
right so like like we actually had a one


---------10:35----------
of our coaches


---------10:36----------
brought up an interesting case so


---------10:37----------
there's a client who's in a relationship


---------10:40----------
and you know i'm gonna kind of anonymize


---------10:42----------
it but like


---------10:44----------
and they're they they're in a


---------10:46----------
relationship where


---------10:47----------
their partner sometimes has trouble


---------10:51----------
and they feel obligated to help their


---------10:53----------
partner


---------10:54----------
even at significant cost to themself


---------10:58----------
and it's actually like not a healthy


---------10:59----------
situation because their partner is not


---------11:02----------
actually like taking care of themselves


---------11:04----------
so they are forced to take care of their


---------11:06----------
partner out of obligation


---------11:08----------
and every time they make that sacrifice


---------11:10----------
it's like they're


---------11:11----------
holding their partner up well like


---------11:13----------
sacrificing their own life


---------11:17----------
and and so you know i think acting out


---------11:19----------
of obligation


---------11:20----------
like i think it's an honorable way to


---------11:21----------
live you seem like an honorable dude


---------11:24----------
um i read your tweet longer or your twit


---------11:28----------
and so i i think it's really cool to see


---------11:30----------
like how you have an internal compass


---------11:31----------
that drives you forward


---------11:33----------
um and uh


---------11:36----------
but you know i think it's important to


---------11:38----------
kind of like at least notice this


---------11:39----------
pattern


---------11:40----------
at this point i don't think you're going


---------11:41----------
to leave but


---------11:44----------
but i i think it would be interesting


---------11:45----------
right because maybe you would be


---------11:46----------
signaling to people that like hey like


---------11:48----------
just because you feel obligated to do


---------11:50----------
something if it's not something what


---------11:51----------
you don't want to do like you don't have


---------11:52----------
to do it yeah


---------11:54----------
uh definitely like um the whole reason


---------11:58----------
why


---------11:58----------
i am on here is because like i don't


---------12:02----------
feel obligated to but um


---------12:06----------
it's just nice i guess to be able to do


---------12:09----------
it


---------12:10----------
um like when people badger me for


---------12:13----------
something it makes me not want to do it


---------12:14----------
more


---------12:16----------
and people have been asking me to go on


---------12:18----------
i mean that's the whole reason why i


---------12:19----------
haven't


---------12:20----------
come on sooner is because i just didn't


---------12:22----------
feel like it uh


---------12:24----------
people ask i don't really feel obligated


---------12:26----------
but


---------12:27----------
okay it's like until i feel like hey you


---------12:30----------
know


---------12:30----------
there's a good reason to and i'm not


---------12:33----------
sure if there's a good reason to right


---------12:34----------
now but


---------12:35----------
i was about to ask what's the good


---------12:36----------
reason


---------12:39----------
uh i think i mean a week ago those whole


---------12:43----------
that whole um


---------12:44----------
online drama stuff going on and coming


---------12:47----------
back to california


---------12:49----------
but other than that i've always felt


---------12:53----------
my life was good enough


---------12:56----------
like and did not have a reason to come


---------12:59----------
on


---------13:00----------
but i always do like talking about


---------13:03----------
streamer meta like what's it like being


---------13:06----------
a streamer


---------13:08----------
the stuff we think about like the money


---------13:11----------
we make


---------13:12----------
a lot of like i like doing like an


---------13:14----------
inside look


---------13:15----------
at a streamer's mindset


---------13:19----------
and i think uh the healthy gamer show


---------13:22----------
you know does something a very similar


---------13:24----------
way it's like an


---------13:25----------
inside look at them you know the


---------13:28----------
mental health of streamers in general so


---------13:32----------
i don't know we can talk about anything


---------13:33----------
really i like talking about spicy stuff


---------13:36----------
like


---------13:36----------
drama stuff it's you you said you do


---------13:39----------
like or you don't like


---------13:40----------
i do like um which is sometimes hard


---------13:44----------
because you know


---------13:46----------
we never want to leak names or like


---------13:49----------
implicate people but i do like talking


---------13:52----------
about like


---------13:52----------
sensitive topic like money or like


---------13:56----------
as sure you may learn like racism sexism


---------14:01----------
like sometimes social issues but i


---------14:04----------
actually don't like talking about those


---------14:06----------
too much because i don't really have an


---------14:07----------
opinion


---------14:08----------
like gun laws and abortion sometimes


---------14:11----------
bring it up just to like


---------14:14----------
meme and make people uncomfortable but


---------14:16----------
um


---------14:17----------
the other topics is just more


---------14:20----------
interesting yeah so toast you've always


---------14:23----------
struck me as a thinker


---------14:27----------
you know like i know you meme and i know


---------14:29----------
you make


---------14:30----------
fun content and i know you're an


---------14:32----------
entertainer


---------14:34----------
but i do get the sense that like behind


---------14:36----------
that is like actually a lot of thought


---------14:38----------
and i think your you know your face


---------14:40----------
reveal conversation


---------14:41----------
was a good example of that i still


---------14:43----------
remember uh


---------14:44----------
watching a youtube video where you went


---------14:46----------
over like how much streamers make and


---------14:48----------
you kind of talked about sponsorships


---------14:49----------
and things like that


---------14:50----------
um and and so you know i i think if you


---------14:54----------
enjoy


---------14:54----------
talking about things that are a little


---------14:56----------
bit at the edge of what's polite


---------14:59----------
i think that that's actually like really


---------15:01----------
fantastic i think a lot of what you're


---------15:03----------
sharing is like per align with like my


---------15:06----------
personal goals and


---------15:07----------
goals as an organization because i think


---------15:09----------
a lot of times


---------15:10----------
we don't talk about the bad stuff


---------15:14----------
right we don't always we're not we don't


---------15:16----------
always acknowledge like


---------15:17----------
some of these issues and that that's


---------15:19----------
part of the reason that they continue to


---------15:20----------
go on because they're never brought to


---------15:22----------
light


---------15:23----------
so i'd love to hear you know whatever


---------15:25----------
juiciness you want to talk about


---------15:27----------
i mean if you have any ideas about where


---------15:28----------
we could get started


---------15:30----------
um and then there are


---------15:33----------
one or two other thoughts that i have


---------15:35----------
unless you have a direction you'd like


---------15:37----------
to go


---------15:43----------
uh let's circle back to the conversation


---------15:46----------
of like um


---------15:48----------
helping friends and expectation


---------15:51----------
obligations


---------15:52----------
yeah uh it's uh


---------15:56----------
i have a lot of expectation


---------16:01----------
from my friends and people my social


---------16:04----------
circle


---------16:06----------
what is that you have a lot of


---------16:07----------
expectation from


---------16:09----------
or towards from them like they expect a


---------16:12----------
lot from you


---------16:14----------
and then i so i


---------16:17----------
try to provide my friends with


---------16:20----------
a lot of content and like help their


---------16:24----------
career


---------16:25----------
and like just whatever support they need


---------16:30----------
um putting them in situations where


---------16:34----------
like the talent can grow


---------16:38----------
and


---------16:41----------
uh i have this


---------16:44----------
i think one of my worries is like it's


---------16:47----------
like um


---------16:49----------
raising baby birds in a nest


---------16:53----------
and once they're ready to leave the nest


---------16:55----------
and letting them go


---------16:57----------
and hoping that they come back one day


---------17:00----------
and like visit and not forget you or


---------17:04----------
another analogy well streaming is like


---------17:06----------
running a marathon


---------17:08----------
and i don't mind slowing down


---------17:11----------
to help my friends who are lagging


---------17:13----------
behind or like tripping


---------17:16----------
but it always worries me that


---------17:19----------
once they get up and running like they


---------17:21----------
just full sprinted down


---------17:23----------
that like not look back not try and slow


---------17:26----------
down for anyone


---------17:28----------
um not sure if


---------17:31----------
i'm making sense but uh can i can i


---------17:34----------
repeat back what i heard sure


---------17:37----------
so what i'm kind of hearing is that you


---------17:40----------
may slow down to help people


---------17:42----------
up but then you're worried whether it's


---------17:45----------
accurate or


---------17:46----------
not that they may leave you behind that


---------17:48----------
maybe one day you'll stumble


---------17:50----------
and they're not going to look back yeah


---------17:54----------
yeah i'd say so


---------17:57----------
however like they won't they won't even


---------17:59----------
like slow down for


---------18:01----------
their friends not necessarily me because


---------18:03----------
i'm generally okay


---------18:05----------
by myself um like my career has always


---------18:08----------
been


---------18:09----------
like at the forefront but like


---------18:13----------
like if they had friends like they won't


---------18:16----------
even slow down for them


---------18:17----------
so it's just that the scene is


---------18:20----------
constantly about


---------18:21----------
the chase right like the numbers the


---------18:24----------
getting ahead being top dog it's just


---------18:27----------
the grind non-stop so


---------18:29----------
whenever i do see like kindness like


---------18:33----------
it speaks a lot to me


---------18:37----------
you try hard to be a kind person


---------18:41----------
yeah yeah try my best


---------18:46----------
what do you give up by doing that


---------18:49----------
nothing


---------18:50----------
really like i feel like people are


---------18:52----------
always saying like they have sacrifices


---------18:53----------
to make but


---------18:54----------
uh i feel like i never gave anything up


---------18:56----------
because


---------18:58----------
their talent was already there like


---------19:02----------
and their humor so


---------19:06----------
like i also just gained benefit just by


---------19:09----------
being around them like being in the good


---------19:12----------
content


---------19:14----------
that's happening so i don't feel like i


---------19:17----------
ever


---------19:18----------
give anything up i feel like i'm more


---------19:20----------
just


---------19:21----------
unlocking their potential that they've


---------19:24----------
always had


---------19:25----------
so it's not like oh i could have had a


---------19:28----------
bigger stream or i could have had a


---------19:29----------
bigger


---------19:30----------
presence if i didn't help them it's


---------19:32----------
never like that i


---------19:33----------
always i only benefit from


---------19:36----------
people's success so


---------19:40----------
it's just that small worry that uh


---------19:45----------
people are always seeking that next


---------19:47----------
level like all right what's gonna get me


---------19:50----------
more pure who's


---------19:51----------
bigger than me that can collab with now


---------19:53----------
that i'm bigger


---------19:55----------
so let me see if i'm kind of getting you


---------19:57----------
so on the one hand


---------20:00----------
you know it's kind of interesting


---------20:01----------
because you're sort of saying that like


---------20:03----------
okay there's the scene right and the


---------20:04----------
scene is the grind and growing and like


---------20:06----------
always like okay


---------20:08----------
can i collab with toast oh wow like


---------20:10----------
toast is collabing with me


---------20:12----------
and then like part of the nature of the


---------20:14----------
beast is like they're gonna grow


---------20:15----------
and then like they're gonna collab with


---------20:19----------
someone else


---------20:21----------
right because at some point we're gonna


---------20:24----------
reach


---------20:24----------
toast we're gonna pass toast


---------20:27----------
and there's toast back there but like


---------20:29----------
let's keep going up


---------20:31----------
and and your experience is that you


---------20:33----------
don't it's not like you sacrifice a


---------20:34----------
whole lot in supporting people that


---------20:36----------
sounds like you genuinely really do


---------20:38----------
enjoy helping people reach their full


---------20:41----------
potential


---------20:42----------
um that you also notice that there is


---------20:44----------
kind of like a benefit right because if


---------20:46----------
you find someone who is talented and you


---------20:48----------
unlock their potential


---------20:49----------
like you guys can create content


---------20:50----------
together that content is ultimately like


---------20:53----------
improved the more people you know if you


---------20:55----------
get multiple people


---------20:56----------
involved you can make more than what you


---------20:58----------
could make on your own


---------21:00----------
so i'm not hearing you making any kind


---------21:01----------
of like noble sacrifice like oh my god


---------21:05----------
i helped you so much yeah and i gave you


---------21:08----------
my kidney


---------21:11----------
yeah like the reason why i don't feel


---------21:14----------
like too bad about it because at the end


---------21:15----------
of the day it's like


---------21:17----------
they are just talented by themselves


---------21:20----------
they're just not


---------21:21----------
in the right situation sure like


---------21:24----------
sure in the right game or have the right


---------21:27----------
collab


---------21:28----------
partners so sure you sound like you're


---------21:30----------
very good at


---------21:31----------
kind of um enabling people


---------21:37----------
yes yeah yeah i would say


---------21:40----------
that's like one of my best talents is


---------21:44----------
not it's just recognizing good content


---------21:47----------
because i feel like


---------21:47----------
i myself is i'm pretty limited by


---------21:50----------
like what is possible because at the end


---------21:53----------
of the day like


---------21:54----------
i am like sarcastic my i have a


---------21:57----------
sarcastic persona


---------21:59----------
um and


---------22:03----------
my games that i'm good at are very like


---------22:05----------
thinking logical


---------22:06----------
like nerdy games and i always felt like


---------22:10----------
i have like a ceiling that is more


---------22:14----------
obvious than um


---------22:16----------
other people might have so i like seeing


---------22:18----------
like


---------22:19----------
how far other people can go sure


---------22:22----------
so where do you think that fear comes


---------22:24----------
from the fear of sort of being left


---------22:26----------
behind


---------22:33----------
[Music]


---------22:37----------
oh that k i don't know if you know this


---------22:40----------
about me but


---------22:41----------
when i talk about feelings i start


---------22:43----------
tearing up


---------22:45----------
it's not because i don't know why it's


---------22:47----------
not it's never because i'm sad because


---------22:49----------
i'm just talking about stuff


---------22:52----------
um but when i talk about things that are


---------22:54----------
a little more emotional in nature


---------22:57----------
like my tear duct just start like you


---------22:59----------
know start trying to


---------23:00----------
i think it's because like i don't talk


---------23:02----------
about emotions much


---------23:04----------
so my brain is thinking oh if he's


---------23:06----------
talking about emotion he must be


---------23:08----------
sad and he wants to cry so let's make


---------23:10----------
him cry


---------23:21----------
it's funny because it's so stupid and


---------23:23----------
you get my point across but i can't


---------23:25----------
because when i tried


---------23:28----------
so people have disappointed me


---------23:33----------
since i came to california when you're a


---------23:36----------
solo streamer it's like i'm going to the


---------23:40----------
top [ __ ] all of you


---------23:41----------
kind of deal like i i had drama with


---------23:44----------
like


---------23:45----------
quite a few hearthstone streamers when i


---------23:48----------
was coming up


---------23:49----------
just like looking back is just stupid


---------23:53----------
but


---------23:53----------
it's like an ego [ __ ] talk battle of


---------23:55----------
who's the best streamer kind of deal


---------23:57----------
like


---------24:00----------
stuff like that um but when you have


---------24:03----------
friends and you collab with people


---------24:06----------
and it gets really complicated and


---------24:10----------
my policy is i generally will just


---------24:14----------
support someone


---------24:15----------
especially my friends do and like


---------24:18----------
host them and like appear on their


---------24:21----------
streams and just like


---------24:23----------
genuinely want them to do well and to be


---------24:26----------
able to make a living off it


---------24:32----------
a lot of situations


---------24:35----------
have turned out fine but there are quite


---------24:38----------
a few situations that


---------24:40----------
you know if you have followed otv's


---------24:42----------
history


---------24:44----------
um has gone really bad


---------24:47----------
and we don't really interact with those


---------24:50----------
people anymore


---------24:51----------
and it's like it's happened quite a few


---------24:55----------
times


---------24:56----------
and it's people like


---------25:00----------
i trusted so


---------25:04----------
yeah so


---------25:09----------
how you holding up man i'm good i'm good


---------25:12----------
i just


---------25:13----------
i i know like these things i can talk


---------25:15----------
about


---------25:17----------
and like they're normal to talk about i


---------25:19----------
just need practice talking about it


---------25:22----------
um but you know it happened a few times


---------25:27----------
actually so it wasn't even like a


---------25:29----------
one-off thing okay


---------25:30----------
and that is like smaller versions of


---------25:32----------
that that gets settled


---------25:33----------
internally too as well okay


---------25:38----------
um can i ask so when i when i asked you


---------25:40----------
a question you got emotional do you know


---------25:42----------
what emotion you were feeling


---------25:48----------
ah


---------25:54----------
not sadness i think uh


---------25:57----------
it's just oh this is like


---------26:01----------
sensitive stuff yeah um


---------26:06----------
yeah i i got that impression too that


---------26:08----------
there's some


---------26:10----------
what i what i saw in you is like


---------26:12----------
remembering a hurt


---------26:17----------
yeah i don't know i don't feel that hurt


---------26:20----------
by it


---------26:21----------
honestly i i don't know if that's where


---------26:24----------
the fear comes from it's just like


---------26:26----------
an easy example to point to


---------26:29----------
and say you know the


---------26:32----------
there are people that i did believe in


---------26:34----------
that end up


---------26:37----------
doing not so great things


---------26:41----------
so is that like feeling betrayed


---------26:44----------
disappointed uh


---------26:47----------
i think disappointed mostly because they


---------26:50----------
don't usually


---------26:52----------
end up hurting me or they just end up


---------26:55----------
doing some something stupid that hurt


---------26:57----------
other people


---------26:59----------
what happens is hurt you


---------27:03----------
oh that one is more just anger and like


---------27:06----------
vindictive i'm a very petty person


---------27:10----------
and i remember the wrongs that had done


---------27:12----------
to me


---------27:14----------
uh there's not a lot of them


---------27:17----------
but i am the type to you kind of hold on


---------27:20----------
to grudges


---------27:23----------
um but i usually react with


---------27:30----------
anger or revenge


---------27:34----------
uh if i'm personally like upseted by


---------27:38----------
someone's action


---------27:40----------
will you let me know if i get close to


---------27:42----------
making an enemy of you


---------27:45----------
of course uh usually it's like really


---------27:48----------
let me know yeah so let me know where


---------27:51----------
that line is okay


---------27:55----------
i i do not want to wind up across


---------27:58----------
the other side of that border i wouldn't


---------28:01----------
say this really


---------28:02----------
i don't have any enemies right now


---------28:06----------
at most i just have people i don't like


---------28:08----------
interact with


---------28:10----------
so when someone says to me that i'm a


---------28:12----------
vindictive person who has no enemies


---------28:16----------
there's a part of me that wonders yeah


---------28:17----------
you have no enemies left


---------28:20----------
because they're all six feet under at


---------28:22----------
this point


---------28:25----------
i i like i like um


---------28:32----------
beating people like when i was streaming


---------28:35----------
tft when it first came out like i made


---------28:37----------
it a point to


---------28:38----------
stream over the time slot


---------28:42----------
of my competition so i think the first


---------28:46----------
month i was doing 12 hour streams


---------28:49----------
and they were like time so that i start


---------28:52----------
right before the first like


---------28:54----------
big tft streamer gets on and i end


---------28:58----------
right after the last big tft streamer


---------29:01----------
finishes for the day um


---------29:04----------
so like i really and my attitude that


---------29:07----------
time was just like i'm gonna


---------29:09----------
i'm gonna bury this guy and i don't


---------29:12----------
i don't really like have a problem with


---------29:14----------
them it's just the competition of being


---------29:16----------
a streamer


---------29:17----------
but like when i had to do back then was


---------29:19----------
like like you gotta stay in second place


---------29:21----------
and i'm gonna be first place and had the


---------29:23----------
viewers


---------29:24----------
um but now that you know i'm on facebook


---------29:28----------
and


---------29:29----------
i'm in my killing years


---------29:33----------
um it's a lot less antagonistic and more


---------29:36----------
just


---------29:37----------
hey you know you you your friends you


---------29:40----------
guys want to play some games let's you


---------29:41----------
know


---------29:42----------
you want yeah i can pop by your stream


---------29:44----------
and i think that's


---------29:45----------
one nice thing about being on facebook


---------29:48----------
is uh


---------29:49----------
i can just provide content to my friends


---------29:53----------
without thinking


---------29:54----------
oh you know well what about my stream


---------29:56----------
you know why are we having this stream


---------29:57----------
on my stream


---------29:59----------
so um yeah i'm


---------30:02----------
i'm at a pretty nice place right now in


---------30:06----------
terms of


---------30:08----------
providing content but that's kind of


---------30:10----------
what my attitude used to be


---------30:12----------
when it comes to like competition


---------30:16----------
so toast i'm gonna


---------30:19----------
can i just think for a second yeah


---------30:34----------
so there are a lot of different things


---------30:35----------
that are kind of popping in my mind i'm


---------30:37----------
not quite sure what has


---------30:40----------
significance so one is um


---------30:44----------
you know you mentioned that things were


---------30:45----------
a little bit uh


---------30:48----------
you know


---------30:51----------
unharmonious or not harmonious during


---------30:54----------
the early stages of hearthstone or maybe


---------30:56----------
when you were a hearthstone streamer


---------30:57----------
there was some kind of


---------30:58----------
conflict i think we talked a lot about


---------31:00----------
sort of this um


---------31:02----------
you know you describe it as a small fear


---------31:03----------
because you strike me as a pretty


---------31:05----------
resilient guy where like if you do have


---------31:07----------
issues or call them whatever you want to


---------31:09----------
you seem to be like pretty good at like


---------31:11----------
setting those aside kind of being able


---------31:12----------
to do your work


---------31:13----------
finding compassion sort of like not


---------31:15----------
feeling super burnt out


---------31:17----------
you seem to really be about you know


---------31:19----------
supporting other people


---------31:20----------
and that feels very genuine to me like i


---------31:23----------
don't think you're


---------31:24----------
you know trying to grow someone just so


---------31:27----------
you can farm people to collaborate with


---------31:29----------
it's sort of like you


---------31:30----------
recognize that this person is talented


---------31:31----------
and you recognize that by making content


---------31:33----------
with them


---------31:34----------
it sort of helps you grow helps them


---------31:35----------
grow all seems super genuine to me


---------31:38----------
um and there are a couple of things that


---------31:41----------
i'm not quite sure how to connect


---------31:43----------
um but one is sort of this idea that


---------31:45----------
like it's almost like


---------31:47----------
you know i'm gonna toss out a strong


---------31:48----------
word here which is like abandonment


---------31:51----------
but when i kind of think about the birds


---------31:53----------
in the nest it's like they're gonna


---------31:55----------
leave and they're never gonna come back


---------31:58----------
and that sounds a touch like like one


---------32:01----------
word


---------32:01----------
you know if we want to use a big word


---------32:04----------
like


---------32:04----------
maybe a little bit hyperbole maybe a


---------32:06----------
little bit extreme is like abandonment


---------32:09----------
um it sounds like sometimes people have


---------32:11----------
sort of like wronged you in the past and


---------32:13----------
and then there this is where i get kind


---------32:15----------
of confused about whether this is


---------32:17----------
related or not


---------32:18----------
um is there is this kind of idea of like


---------32:22----------
you kind of mentioned that you have a a


---------32:24----------
ceiling right


---------32:25----------
in the games that you play and that


---------32:28----------
you're kind of aware


---------32:29----------
of what your ceiling is and that's why


---------32:32----------
you gravitate towards games like


---------32:34----------
hearthstone or tft because you're never


---------32:35----------
going to have the reflexes of the


---------32:37----------
fortnite pros or this or that right like


---------32:39----------
you can


---------32:40----------
and even if we think about you know your


---------32:41----------
your hearthstone content like


---------32:43----------
um hopefully this doesn't let me know if


---------32:47----------
this evokes any kind of hurt but like


---------32:49----------
you're not known for being the best at


---------32:50----------
hearthstone like the reason that your


---------32:52----------
content was


---------32:53----------
great was because it was very


---------32:55----------
entertaining


---------32:57----------
and so i'm wondering whether there's a


---------32:59----------
correlation between sort of this idea


---------33:01----------
that i have a ceiling


---------33:03----------
the fact that other people will sort of


---------33:05----------
like leave you behind at some point


---------33:08----------
because there's only so fast that you


---------33:09----------
can run


---------33:12----------
um because if you kind of and then also


---------33:15----------
like on the flip side whether that like


---------33:17----------
kind of manifests is like


---------33:19----------
i'm abu number one [ __ ]


---------33:22----------
you know like striving to be number one


---------33:24----------
and i don't know if any of those things


---------33:25----------
are actually related i mean they can all


---------33:27----------
be independent


---------33:28----------
it's just those are the three things


---------33:30----------
that i'm kind of feeling are like


---------33:32----------
floating to the surface


---------33:34----------
[Music]


---------33:36----------
and and when it comes to being


---------33:37----------
vindictive being hurt


---------33:40----------
um you know there's a part of me that


---------33:41----------
almost wants to ask the question like


---------33:43----------
and i think the answer oddly enough is


---------33:45----------
yes but for a little while i thought it


---------33:46----------
was no like would you know what feeling


---------33:48----------
hurt felt like


---------33:52----------
i yeah yeah i think so


---------33:55----------
i think um i


---------34:00----------
don't like it when people violate


---------34:03----------
my trust like i tell you hey


---------34:08----------
x secret and i say don't tell anyone


---------34:11----------
and they end up telling someone like i


---------34:13----------
think that's the


---------34:14----------
biggest way to like


---------34:18----------
get on my bad side because


---------34:22----------
yeah so i think like i feel like there


---------34:24----------
are stronger words popping up here


---------34:25----------
because that sounds like betrayal to me


---------34:28----------
yeah and i'm very harsh with my friends


---------34:33----------
when they


---------34:34----------
do that yeah so so when it comes to and


---------34:37----------
then now we circle back to like


---------34:38----------
expectations


---------34:39----------
so i'm kind of thinking about okay toast


---------34:42----------
i know you're here i know


---------34:43----------
everyone including us wanted you here


---------34:46----------
and so like i know that everyone's being


---------34:48----------
satisfied but like my question is still


---------34:50----------
like how can we help you as a person


---------34:53----------
you know like is there something that


---------34:55----------
not that you need help because this also


---------34:57----------
like you kind of said earlier that life


---------34:58----------
is good enough


---------35:00----------
whereas like i don't think you the


---------35:02----------
people in fact i think we've created


---------35:03----------
this bias where like people come on here


---------35:05----------
because they've got some problem or some


---------35:07----------
issue or some difficulty


---------35:09----------
whereas like it's really my belief that


---------35:11----------
like you know you can always climb like


---------35:13----------
it doesn't you don't and everyone should


---------35:15----------
be trying to climb right like you can


---------35:17----------
always grow as a person


---------35:19----------
um what i'm kind of curious about is


---------35:22----------
whether


---------35:23----------
and i think if you want to if you feel


---------35:25----------
like any of this is


---------35:26----------
relevant or important to you um


---------35:29----------
i can lay out an argument of why i think


---------35:31----------
it may be worth exploring


---------35:33----------
but i'm just curious like what resonates


---------35:35----------
with you


---------36:06----------
nothing really pops


---------36:09----------
out like like i don't think i have any


---------36:13----------
problems


---------36:14----------
like emotionally i don't think so


---------36:19----------
so yeah


---------36:22----------
can i go ahead yup can i ask you um


---------36:27----------
how how are your romantic relationships


---------36:31----------
uh romantic relationships


---------36:38----------
i


---------36:42----------
i don't know um you're allowed to not


---------36:44----------
answer by the way if it's not something


---------36:45----------
you want to talk about


---------36:46----------
i've it's uh


---------36:50----------
and if you want me to explain why i'm


---------36:51----------
asking i'm happy to


---------36:54----------
uh i won't go into too much detail


---------36:58----------
that's one of the problems with being


---------37:00----------
like a public figure


---------37:02----------
talking about because i've had a public


---------37:05----------
relationship


---------37:06----------
and that one the amount of


---------37:10----------
backseaters and people commentating


---------37:13----------
on it is just really annoying


---------37:17----------
so since then i've


---------37:20----------
kept my romantic life relatively


---------37:24----------
private like i talked about bits here


---------37:26----------
and there


---------37:28----------
uh i kind of like not like


---------37:34----------
being in a committed relationship right


---------37:36----------
now because i think it's a lot of work


---------37:38----------
and can i toss something out


---------37:42----------
toast why ask so here's sometimes when i


---------37:46----------
work with people like you and i'm making


---------37:48----------
a lot of assumptions so i think like


---------37:49----------
maybe


---------37:50----------
what we need to do is just you know i'll


---------37:51----------
ask you some basic questions like about


---------37:53----------
your life and stuff but


---------37:54----------
here's here's i'm gonna i'm gonna take a


---------37:57----------
shot in the dark okay


---------37:58----------
it's gonna be like one of these like um


---------38:01----------
high risk high reward i'm making some


---------38:03----------
hearthstone deck where i have no cards


---------38:06----------
between that are one to five


---------38:07----------
mana they're all like they're all


---------38:10----------
legendaries that start at six


---------38:12----------
okay uh so so


---------38:15----------
the one in a hundred games where this


---------38:17----------
works out and i survived it turned sex


---------38:20----------
six it's it's gg wow freudian


---------38:23----------
um but so here's here's what i'm


---------38:25----------
concerned about is that i think you have


---------38:27----------
like i don't know how to put this but


---------38:28----------
you have a meta in your mind


---------38:30----------
you have like a set of rules right like


---------38:33----------
you operate you have a strong internal


---------38:34----------
code


---------38:35----------
you have there's like a whole system


---------38:38----------
that isn't really in the game


---------38:40----------
it's like like it's in your mind like


---------38:42----------
you have a strong set of internal rules


---------38:44----------
through which you operate by


---------38:47----------
and that like like other people may not


---------38:50----------
understand those rules right


---------38:51----------
it dictates how you stream it dictates


---------38:54----------
how you relate to other people it


---------38:55----------
dictates like it's kind of like this


---------38:57----------
honor system that you've got going on in


---------38:59----------
here


---------39:00----------
that sometimes it's kind of


---------39:01----------
disappointing because people outside of


---------39:03----------
you don't adhere to that honor system


---------39:06----------
the reason i ask about romantic


---------39:08----------
relationships is sometimes when you have


---------39:10----------
honorable vindictive people okay and


---------39:12----------
that


---------39:13----------
sorry if that's you know a bad way of


---------39:15----------
putting it


---------39:16----------
um but like you describe yourself as


---------39:18----------
penny and vindictive


---------39:20----------
but you're clearly like a good dude


---------39:22----------
right like


---------39:23----------
and and so like when you have that kind


---------39:25----------
of pattern


---------39:26----------
in your mind sometimes it creates a lot


---------39:29----------
of confusion


---------39:30----------
and trouble especially in romantic


---------39:32----------
relationships


---------39:33----------
because the person on the other side of


---------39:35----------
the table


---------39:36----------
you're like playing with this meta that


---------39:38----------
isn't apparent


---------39:40----------
on the game board because the meta is


---------39:42----------
not like you know


---------39:43----------
the game board is the game board but


---------39:44----------
it's like it's weird like i


---------39:46----------
like and you're coining out defias


---------39:49----------
bandits and it's like i thought we were


---------39:50----------
doing


---------39:51----------
no rush 20. you know like and and so


---------39:54----------
sometimes it can be confusing for other


---------39:56----------
people so i was just kind of wondering


---------39:58----------
you know that's why i ask about romantic


---------39:59----------
relationships because i wonder if


---------40:01----------
um you know to put it really like


---------40:03----------
specifically shot in the dark because we


---------40:05----------
haven't


---------40:05----------
asked you anything about them but you


---------40:08----------
know whether people


---------40:10----------
whether you feel like really let down by


---------40:14----------
expect


---------40:14----------
by someone not living up to expectations


---------40:17----------
and specifically whether that person


---------40:20----------
didn't realize at all that that


---------40:21----------
expectation was being placed upon them


---------40:24----------
[Music]


---------40:25----------
does that make sense


---------40:29----------
yeah that makes a lot of sense i think


---------40:30----------
it's just from my point of view these


---------40:33----------
expectations are


---------40:35----------
very obvious like very human


---------40:38----------
courtesy expectations


---------40:42----------
but i can also see like it doesn't apply


---------40:45----------
to everyone


---------40:46----------
it's just you know because i do have


---------40:49----------
like


---------40:50----------
a strong sense of like what's right and


---------40:52----------
what's wrong


---------40:54----------
that to me it seems very straightforward


---------40:57----------
very clear-cut yeah you're supposed to


---------40:58----------
behave like this you're supposed to act


---------41:00----------
like that


---------41:01----------
um one thing i've learned from uh


---------41:04----------
talking to


---------41:05----------
the ladies is that they're


---------41:09----------
i tend to be on a very logical


---------41:13----------
scale and they are


---------41:16----------
generally more emotional than i am um


---------41:21----------
because being right used to be like the


---------41:24----------
most important


---------41:24----------
thing for me uh not like that i had to


---------41:27----------
be right but like in an argument


---------41:30----------
if you're in an argument with someone


---------41:33----------
one of you should be right


---------41:34----------
you know there are some stuff like oh


---------41:37----------
should abortions be legal


---------41:39----------
like that's an argument where it's just


---------41:41----------
two guys arguing


---------41:42----------
like there's no a defined correct answer


---------41:46----------
but a lot of arguments like someone


---------41:49----------
being rude


---------41:50----------
i feel like there's a clear-cut right


---------41:52----------
person wrong person


---------41:55----------
and uh i had that attitude when it came


---------41:58----------
to relationship


---------41:59----------
it's like hey you know we were trying to


---------42:01----------
solve a problem and you snapped at me


---------42:03----------
and


---------42:04----------
now we're fighting so you kind of


---------42:09----------
like broke a rule right


---------42:12----------
um so i feel


---------42:16----------
more justified and entrenched


---------42:19----------
because you violated


---------42:23----------
you know what could have been a proper


---------42:26----------
way to communicate


---------42:28----------
now it's like name calling or like


---------42:32----------
being petty um


---------42:36----------
yeah so i'm i'm hearing a lot of what i


---------42:39----------
was


---------42:41----------
thinking may be going on which is that


---------42:43----------
but because i i think you say like you


---------42:44----------
know because in your mind they violated


---------42:46----------
a rule


---------42:48----------
but i know i'm sure that you know you're


---------42:51----------
logical and ha


---------42:52----------
in in here but the point is i think like


---------42:54----------
i know it's kind of bizarre but like


---------42:56----------
sometimes like you've got a meta up here


---------42:58----------
though


---------42:59----------
about how the game should be played


---------43:02----------
and and sometimes i see conflict because


---------43:05----------
the metas in the minds of the people


---------43:07----------
that you relate to


---------43:08----------
may not be the same as your meta does


---------43:09----------
that make sense


---------43:11----------
yeah yeah um makes sense people have


---------43:15----------
told me that


---------43:18----------
my way of thinking is not always correct


---------43:23----------
and that i should


---------43:26----------
be nicer or like be more accepting of


---------43:29----------
people's flaws but i think that's a big


---------43:32----------
i think we have enough of that in our


---------43:34----------
friend group


---------43:35----------
where we just accept people's


---------43:37----------
shortcomings and their flaws and they're


---------43:40----------
just like yeah well that's just who they


---------43:41----------
are


---------43:43----------
um so i tend to be more strict


---------43:46----------
on stuff like that where


---------43:49----------
you know if someone does something bad i


---------43:52----------
want to have a sit down with them like


---------43:54----------
i want to sit them down like in my room


---------43:58----------
and


---------43:58----------
explain to them like why what they did


---------44:01----------
wasn't okay


---------44:02----------
a little confrontational and


---------44:08----------
i like a tiny


---------44:11----------
like i like having friends and being


---------44:14----------
close to people


---------44:15----------
and like having people to rely on


---------44:18----------
but i'm also afraid that um


---------44:22----------
people get too familiar with you like


---------44:25----------
like people always say your best friends


---------44:27----------
are the one that gives you a lot of [ __ ]


---------44:29----------
kind of deal um


---------44:35----------
like respect is really important to me


---------44:38----------
and


---------44:42----------
i would love for my friends to like


---------44:45----------
like me and love me but it doesn't hurt


---------44:48----------
sometimes when there's a little bit of


---------44:50----------
fear as well


---------44:53----------
which now that i've said it out a lot of


---------44:54----------
people are going to be like


---------44:56----------
more aware of it but um can you help us


---------44:59----------
understand that


---------45:02----------
ah i i don't quite understand i i lost


---------45:06----------
you there


---------45:08----------
uh


---------45:12----------
have you have you have you seen game of


---------45:15----------
thrones


---------45:16----------
yeah yeah


---------45:19----------
you know people love daenerys targaryen


---------45:22----------
but some people are also afraid of her


---------45:25----------
but in both cases it makes them treat


---------45:28----------
that person with respect


---------45:35----------
yeah it makes a lot of sense so have you


---------45:37----------
been


---------45:43----------
i feel like a story would you know tell


---------45:45----------
a thousand words here but like


---------45:47----------
i'll just kind of ask have you been like


---------45:53----------
taken advantage of because of your


---------45:55----------
kindness


---------45:58----------
mmm no


---------46:02----------
no no no no i don't


---------46:06----------
think people


---------46:09----------
like i don't think i think i'm smart


---------46:12----------
enough


---------46:12----------
to know when someone's trying to take


---------46:14----------
advantage of me


---------46:16----------
um


---------46:22----------
yeah i don't think i've been taken


---------46:23----------
advantage of i think it's more just like


---------46:25----------
hey you know you seem cool you know i'll


---------46:29----------
work i'll play with you i'll you know


---------46:31----------
talk


---------46:32----------
about you you know on stream and like


---------46:35----------
try and boost your numbers just you know


---------46:39----------
be the best person you can and then they


---------46:41----------
go and do


---------46:42----------
some shady [ __ ] and


---------46:46----------
it really sucks when that happens what


---------46:49----------
sucks


---------46:52----------
it's like cause i don't know it just


---------46:55----------
looks


---------46:56----------
when people you believe and disappoint


---------46:58----------
you you know


---------46:59----------
not it's they never do anything to me


---------47:01----------
they just


---------47:02----------
do something objectively


---------47:06----------
shitty and um


---------47:10----------
or they just like


---------47:13----------
leave the nest and don't interact with


---------47:16----------
like


---------47:16----------
the people they used to interact with


---------47:18----------
anymore


---------47:22----------
how does that feel when they do that


---------47:25----------
it's like up just another one for the


---------47:29----------
history books


---------47:30----------
like it happens so often in my mind


---------47:34----------
that when it doesn't happen like it's


---------47:37----------
really surprising to me


---------47:41----------
like i have the expectations like


---------47:44----------
you're just gonna one day not


---------47:49----------
like gonna be around anymore


---------47:53----------
but maybe you'll surprise me how long


---------47:56----------
ago did you learn that lesson


---------47:58----------
that people just don't stick around


---------48:07----------
[Music]


---------48:10----------
i guess a year ago


---------48:27----------
when i was uh in elementary school i


---------48:29----------
remember


---------48:31----------
sharing a popcorn chicken with


---------48:35----------
this kid in class and


---------48:38----------
uh he just kind of like


---------48:42----------
acted as if ha i just got a free popcorn


---------48:46----------
chicken


---------48:46----------
off you when i want to share it with him


---------48:49----------
and when he had gum later


---------48:52----------
like and i had hey can i have a piece of


---------48:54----------
gum he's like huh no


---------48:57----------
kind of deal and now that


---------49:01----------
memory sticks out as like an example of


---------49:04----------
like when you help people


---------49:09----------
the expectation is like don't expect


---------49:11----------
them to like


---------49:13----------
return to favor like i'm surprised when


---------49:15----------
people


---------49:18----------
reciprocate kindness these days


---------49:22----------
i feel like that should be the norm like


---------49:25----------
should we help someone


---------49:26----------
but like these days when someone does


---------49:28----------
like show appreciation for me


---------49:31----------
it catches me off guard


---------49:34----------
yeah i think especially in the world


---------49:36----------
that you live in there's sort of


---------49:38----------
friendship


---------49:40----------
and then some of y'all are in the


---------49:41----------
business of friendship


---------49:44----------
you know where being friends is actually


---------49:46----------
not


---------49:47----------
it's like a business decision


---------49:52----------
and and i imagine that makes things


---------49:54----------
quite tough


---------49:56----------
but can i ask you can i ask you a little


---------49:58----------
bit more about like when you were


---------50:00----------
younger like prior to


---------50:02----------
because i it was kind of confusing


---------50:03----------
because you said i was like when did you


---------50:05----------
learn that lesson and you were like


---------50:06----------
about a year ago


---------50:08----------
and then you told me a story from


---------50:09----------
kindergarten with popcorn chicken


---------50:11----------
gum so you know i'm i'm kind of noticing


---------50:15----------
that


---------50:16----------
maybe you've been on the maybe you've


---------50:18----------
been burned i mean it sounds like you


---------50:20----------
got burned by it pretty early


---------50:22----------
sort of like doing good unto others and


---------50:27----------
others taking advantage of you


---------50:29----------
and not doing what was right justin


---------50:32----------
uh small i think i i just


---------50:36----------
place a lot of emphasis off being


---------50:38----------
considerate


---------50:39----------
sure um can you tell me a little bit


---------50:42----------
about where you grew up


---------50:44----------
uh okay i grew up uh


---------50:48----------
in malaysia so i was born in taiwan but


---------50:50----------
like when i was


---------50:52----------
less than one years old uh my family


---------50:55----------
moved to malaysia


---------50:56----------
and i grew up there for about 10 years


---------51:00----------
and i kept switching between an english


---------51:02----------
and a chinese school


---------51:04----------
so my chinese wasn't great and my


---------51:06----------
english wasn't


---------51:08----------
amazing and when i moved to canada


---------51:11----------
i had like the malaysian version of


---------51:14----------
english


---------51:15----------
which is you know heavily accented


---------51:18----------
and like uh the word three like i had


---------51:22----------
such a huge problem pronouncing it three


---------51:26----------
because i i would say tree


---------51:29----------
and it took like a long time


---------51:32----------
uh i had an immense fear of public


---------51:34----------
speaking like the worst ever


---------51:37----------
like i would just go up and just read


---------51:39----------
from a piece of paper and i know you're


---------51:40----------
not supposed to do that


---------51:42----------
because you're supposed to make eye


---------51:43----------
contact but i remember one presentation


---------51:45----------
i'm like [ __ ] i am not taking my eye


---------51:47----------
off


---------51:48----------
the piece of paper and looking at


---------51:50----------
people's reaction to my presentation


---------51:53----------
um


---------51:57----------
you know at that whole like asian


---------51:59----------
identity growing up


---------52:00----------
thing of like bringing


---------52:04----------
home-cooked meals but people the kids at


---------52:06----------
school having like a negative reaction


---------52:08----------
to the home-cooked meal


---------52:10----------
and my mom end up making like but lonely


---------52:12----------
ketchup sandwiches instead


---------52:15----------
because you know she doesn't want me to


---------52:18----------
feel like i'm standing out


---------52:20----------
uh i learned how to do oh


---------52:23----------
for the first year of high school grade


---------52:25----------
nine i didn't speak to anyone


---------52:27----------
like i went the entire year


---------52:30----------
without uh talking to anyone besides the


---------52:33----------
yes and no


---------52:34----------
that my teachers would ask me uh


---------52:37----------
i think in grade 11 i made an effort to


---------52:40----------
be social so i learned how to do magic


---------52:43----------
tricks


---------52:44----------
so that i could interact with people


---------52:47----------
and like entertain people because i like


---------52:49----------
being an entertainer


---------52:51----------
um i was gonna be a game designer


---------52:54----------
initially


---------52:55----------
because for me that's how i could become


---------52:58----------
an entertainer like


---------53:00----------
i couldn't be like a streamer or because


---------53:03----------
it wasn't really a thing back then or an


---------53:04----------
actor or singer


---------53:06----------
but i could design games that people


---------53:08----------
would enjoy since i played a lot of


---------53:09----------
games


---------53:11----------
but i picked up like magic tricks as a


---------53:14----------
way to


---------53:14----------
entertain people and


---------53:18----------
that slowly improved my ability to


---------53:22----------
perform in a public setting


---------53:26----------
um so yeah that kind of


---------53:30----------
set me down on the path of being a


---------53:32----------
entertainer


---------53:35----------
fascinating man i'm so happy you shared


---------53:37----------
that


---------53:38----------
i i don't know why but i i really just


---------53:42----------
really enjoyed hearing about your what


---------53:44----------
growing up was like for you even though


---------53:46----------
it sounds


---------53:46----------
pretty rough bro


---------53:50----------
no no i didn't feel rough i feel


---------53:55----------
i felt like like looking back it


---------53:58----------
might seem a little sad but when it was


---------54:00----------
in the moment it didn't


---------54:02----------
feel like it was that hard


---------54:05----------
i just it just felt like that this is


---------54:07----------
what life is you know


---------54:09----------
yeah um yeah


---------54:13----------
and you mentioned your you know your mom


---------54:16----------
was quite thoughtful about you know


---------54:18----------
feeding you trash to help you fit in


---------54:20----------
you know setting aside some of her own


---------54:23----------
values


---------54:24----------
um uh yeah she was just worried that the


---------54:28----------
kids would make comments


---------54:29----------
yeah and and how did she how did she get


---------54:32----------
worried about that was that because of


---------54:34----------
something you said do you remember


---------54:36----------
i thought maybe my sister said something


---------54:40----------
but um sisters older or younger


---------54:44----------
uh old i have an older sister and an


---------54:46----------
older brother


---------54:48----------
how much older uh my brother's seven


---------54:51----------
years


---------54:52----------
older and my sister is two years older


---------54:57----------
yeah their sister's getting married


---------55:00----------
and uh my brother just had a child so


---------55:04----------
they're growing up and i'm still


---------55:09----------
playing video games on the internet


---------55:12----------
i would assume that that was a joke


---------55:15----------
huh that you actually have no problem


---------55:19----------
playing games on the internet


---------55:21----------
oh yeah yeah yeah but it's crazy how


---------55:24----------
like


---------55:25----------
oh they're getting like how


---------55:28----------
how like we people from my high school


---------55:31----------
are


---------55:32----------
literally married and have children by


---------55:34----------
now but


---------55:36----------
like this industry we're in it's like


---------55:38----------
people are just


---------55:39----------
playing games playing games playing


---------55:40----------
games


---------55:44----------
i think it's cool uh i think i'm not


---------55:46----------
ready to vote just


---------55:48----------
yet and uh


---------55:52----------
it's just crazy that some people are the


---------55:54----------
same age but


---------55:55----------
so many different phases of their lives


---------55:57----------
like


---------55:59----------
like their kids are some kids are like


---------56:01----------
five years old by now


---------56:05----------
yeah yeah do the people and


---------56:08----------
do you stay in touch with anyone in high


---------56:10----------
school from high school


---------56:11----------
oh i stay in touch with nobody


---------56:16----------
not a single person um i do have two


---------56:19----------
friends that i should stay in touch with


---------56:22----------
because they were my best friends in


---------56:23----------
high school


---------56:24----------
but it's just been so long


---------56:27----------
i feel awkward uh


---------56:30----------
re-engaging so i'm just essentially


---------56:33----------
waiting


---------56:34----------
until i get married and one of them get


---------56:36----------
married to reach out again


---------56:38----------
it's like hey wanna come to my wedding


---------56:42----------
it sounds like you need an excuse to


---------56:44----------
re-engage with them


---------56:46----------
yeah yeah and can you tell me a little


---------56:50----------
bit about


---------56:50----------
uh your dad oh


---------56:53----------
my dad he worked most of his life um


---------56:59----------
in another country so doesn't


---------57:02----------
really grow up with one uh he works


---------57:05----------
really hard he's more of a traditional


---------57:09----------
kind of guy you know older


---------57:12----------
like more family values we must always


---------57:15----------
be together for chinese new year's


---------57:20----------
not that strict in terms of uh you know


---------57:23----------
just do what you want to do


---------57:25----------
but he nags a lot and complains a lot


---------57:29----------
which is always hard


---------57:33----------
but you know


---------57:37----------
not too much problems there


---------57:42----------
i i find myself wanting to ask um


---------57:45----------
what he nags about or what he complains


---------57:47----------
about but i'm also


---------57:49----------
wondering whether in the meta of your


---------57:51----------
mind it's not acceptable to talk about


---------57:53----------
things like


---------57:54----------
people in your family and negative


---------57:57----------
aspects of them on the internet


---------57:59----------
um


---------58:05----------
i don't mind talking about it a little


---------58:07----------
bit like i think everyone has like


---------58:09----------
family issue in it sure everyone like


---------58:12----------
just typical chinese dad stuff


---------58:15----------
um can you please tell us about


---------58:18----------
typical chinese dads uh


---------58:25----------
this is a good example


---------58:33----------
oh like uh when we were fishing


---------58:37----------
you would keep complaining how i didn't


---------58:40----------
have the right lure because i'm not


---------58:42----------
catching any fish


---------58:44----------
and like when other people on the pure


---------58:46----------
catching fish is like look at them they


---------58:48----------
have the right lure


---------58:49----------
this one's not the right one you got the


---------58:51----------
wrong one and then i started catching


---------58:54----------
fishes like 30 minutes later


---------58:57----------
and like the whole time i was thinking


---------58:58----------
like no i know what lyra they're using


---------59:01----------
i got the exact same one this is the


---------59:03----------
right one


---------59:05----------
but it's like


---------59:08----------
he just assumes like at least for my


---------59:11----------
point


---------59:11----------
he just assumes something was wrong so


---------59:14----------
like i did something wrong


---------59:15----------
and he's gonna complain about it but


---------59:18----------
yeah um it was just like


---------59:20----------
it's just the nature of fishing you know


---------59:22----------
i wasn't gonna catch one right away


---------59:24----------
but like stuff like that


---------59:27----------
where it's just like bro i just i'm here


---------59:30----------
to spend time with you to catch fish


---------59:32----------
with you and i have to keep listening


---------59:34----------
to how i got the wrong lure even though


---------59:37----------
i know it's the right one


---------59:39----------
yeah so it's a lot of stuff like that


---------59:43----------
it's it's got to be rough to i mean i i


---------59:45----------
know you're used to it and i know it's


---------59:46----------
typical


---------59:47----------
you know i i i'm indian so i i think


---------59:49----------
that there's


---------59:50----------
a lot of commonality between typical


---------59:52----------
like chinese dads and typical indian


---------59:55----------
dads


---------59:56----------
um at the same time i i've got to


---------59:59----------
imagine it's like frustrating to


---------60:02----------
be blamed for lack of skill when


---------60:06----------
it's rng yeah


---------60:09----------
yeah like i feel like i can't


---------60:13----------
be allowed to make mistakes because like


---------60:16----------
because like when you learn to do


---------60:18----------
something you're going to make a lot of


---------60:19----------
mistakes like


---------60:20----------
first time you learn to knit like or


---------60:22----------
ride a bike you're going to make a lot


---------60:23----------
of mistakes


---------60:24----------
but it's just a pain in the ass when


---------60:26----------
like your dad is


---------60:28----------
next to you like paying so much


---------60:30----------
attention so the second


---------60:32----------
you make a mistake he just says well


---------60:34----------
that's wrong


---------60:35----------
and you're thinking well obviously i


---------60:37----------
know what's wrong


---------60:38----------
but how am i gonna know what works and


---------60:41----------
what doesn't unless i'm actually


---------60:42----------
trying to learn um but i didn't


---------60:46----------
tell him any of that because i didn't


---------60:48----------
want to snap at him


---------60:51----------
and like he's at a pretty old age and


---------60:54----------
i'm at an age where i should be


---------60:57----------
accepting and understanding


---------61:00----------
and just saying oh that's just that


---------61:01----------
being dead but


---------61:04----------
it does make it difficult to spend time


---------61:06----------
with him sometimes


---------61:17----------
hmm i'm just thinking about whether


---------61:27----------
yeah thanks for sharing that i was just


---------61:28----------
trying to think about whether it's worth


---------61:30----------
talking about further or not


---------61:33----------
oh probably not


---------61:36----------
um that's family lifestyle it's just


---------61:40----------
like


---------61:41----------
it is what it is so it sounds like


---------61:44----------
you've learned a lot from your dad's


---------61:46----------
mistakes


---------61:48----------
um at the same time i'm wondering


---------61:50----------
whether


---------61:51----------
you've internalized any of that approach


---------61:53----------
in the way that you interact with other


---------61:55----------
people


---------61:56----------
uh someone brought it up to me and say


---------62:00----------
when i was complaining about my dad


---------62:01----------
they're like tell us that kind of sounds


---------62:03----------
like you


---------62:03----------
because you complain a lot about people


---------62:05----------
as well and


---------62:07----------
when they said i'm like yeah you're kind


---------62:09----------
of right


---------62:10----------
i do like because from my point of view


---------62:13----------
i it


---------62:14----------
would be similar to my dad where you


---------62:15----------
just want people


---------62:17----------
like do better like let's say they're


---------62:19----------
doing a golf swing and i'm


---------62:21----------
in the back saying oh you should adjust


---------62:23----------
five degrees here


---------62:25----------
but i just do it for everything like


---------62:27----------
when people are streaming


---------62:28----------
or like when they're playing valorant


---------62:30----------
and i was vaccinating them like


---------62:31----------
yeah you should take look to your left


---------62:33----------
here and like you know you should


---------62:35----------
go do this go to do that and


---------62:39----------
i can't see how i am


---------62:42----------
similar in that sense so since then i've


---------62:45----------
been a little more aware


---------62:47----------
at giving feedback because i know


---------62:51----------
some of my friends are more receptive to


---------62:53----------
it and some of


---------62:54----------
my friends are more like bro why can't


---------62:57----------
you just


---------62:57----------
just be happy for me man or like


---------63:01----------
if i if they get eighty percent on a


---------63:03----------
test and you're not focused on


---------63:06----------
well this is how you should have gotten


---------63:08----------
a ninety percent a hundred percent so


---------63:11----------
uh i think it did subconsciously


---------63:14----------
rub off of me on me and um


---------63:20----------
yeah like uh the whole thing about like


---------63:23----------
having respect i think as a result of


---------63:26----------
that


---------63:27----------
what do you mean becoming like my dad


---------63:31----------
when we eat dinner or lunch like the


---------63:34----------
rule is


---------63:34----------
nobody touches the food until


---------63:37----------
he does like a lot of asian


---------63:42----------
superstition kind of deal like tradition


---------63:45----------
like we always have to be there for


---------63:47----------
chinese new year


---------63:49----------
um i think played a role


---------63:53----------
and like how much respect you should


---------63:57----------
show


---------63:57----------
to your peers to the elders


---------64:00----------
very asian chinese stuff i guess


---------64:05----------
yeah so i i can definitely see the


---------64:07----------
cultural component so i'm gonna circle


---------64:09----------
back to romantic relationships for a


---------64:10----------
second


---------64:12----------
do you see this behavior as sort of


---------64:14----------
influencing your romantic relationships


---------64:28----------
well i don't think so


---------64:31----------
i mean i've only been in one real


---------64:33----------
relationship so


---------64:36----------
i am not an expert on it


---------64:39----------
um yeah


---------64:43----------
um


---------64:50----------
toast i'm not quite sure where to go so


---------64:53----------
so here's here's where you have any idea


---------64:57----------
what we should talk about today


---------64:59----------
uh


---------65:04----------
any good drama lately oh


---------65:09----------
well there was that whole drama i was


---------65:11----------
involved in last week but honestly


---------65:12----------
that's kind of over with


---------65:15----------
um


---------65:20----------
why are you interested why are you


---------65:21----------
looking for drama to talk about


---------65:25----------
i don't know it's more interesting


---------65:28----------
i guess uh i like talking about things


---------65:30----------
that people find interesting


---------65:34----------
yeah that's my concern


---------65:38----------
right so like like do you want to talk


---------65:40----------
are we here for people are we here for


---------65:42----------
you


---------65:44----------
uh


---------65:48----------
well i've said this before um a while


---------65:51----------
ago


---------65:52----------
is that my biggest worry with coming on


---------65:56----------
the show


---------65:57----------
is that like i'm really


---------66:01----------
smart when it comes to like pr


---------66:04----------
and marketing and i worry


---------66:07----------
that the things i say on the show is


---------66:11----------
designed to evoke some kind of


---------66:14----------
positive feelings towards me it's like


---------66:17----------
oh toast is so


---------66:19----------
genuine or toast is so vulnerable toast


---------66:22----------
is so


---------66:22----------
like whatever now that we had the


---------66:26----------
inside look into how his mind works we


---------66:28----------
see what a wonderful person he is


---------66:32----------
and um because i am


---------66:37----------
very capable of doing that


---------66:42----------
like when i got signed to facebook and i


---------66:45----------
donated like


---------66:46----------
the 20 000 budget to children


---------66:50----------
a children's hospital right


---------66:54----------
like did i do that because


---------66:59----------
i'm a benevolent person no i did it


---------67:02----------
because


---------67:05----------
i knew signing with facebook was going


---------67:08----------
to be unpopular


---------67:10----------
and this was a great opportunity to do


---------67:14----------
something nice


---------67:15----------
for sick children and also to get some


---------67:18----------
good pr


---------67:21----------
so toast here's what i'm feeling from


---------67:23----------
you


---------67:25----------
you're saying just enough


---------67:31----------
and and so i i don't know exactly like i


---------67:33----------
can imagine that there's some


---------67:34----------
there are a bunch of different


---------67:36----------
calculations or variables in your mind


---------67:38----------
right now to where like


---------67:40----------
i'm detecting some amount and i i don't


---------67:42----------
know i don't want to like


---------67:43----------
expose that or bully you because like i


---------67:46----------
want to respect


---------67:48----------
your emotional boundaries and your


---------67:50----------
privacy


---------67:51----------
but i also get the sense that it's like


---------67:53----------
just enough and i think like we're not


---------67:55----------
really talking about anything


---------67:59----------
or like we're talking about stuff but


---------68:01----------
we're not saying anything


---------68:05----------
and does that make sense


---------68:13----------
um kinda like i feel like


---------68:17----------
we would never talk about


---------68:20----------
anything that i didn't really want to


---------68:23----------
talk about maybe i should talk about but


---------68:28----------
yeah so i think that's what's going like


---------68:30----------
so i i think that like i i need to


---------68:32----------
understand from you


---------68:33----------
you know whether because because i try


---------68:36----------
to talk to people like what i want to


---------68:38----------
talk i want to talk to jeremy i don't


---------68:39----------
want to talk toast you know and and i


---------68:42----------
think what we're here is


---------68:43----------
is to do is to try like at least what


---------68:46----------
i'm here to do is to try to help you but


---------68:47----------
i think we can talk about like


---------68:49----------
if you feel more comfortable doing


---------68:50----------
societal commentary


---------68:52----------
if you feel more comfortable you know


---------68:54----------
having everyone get


---------68:56----------
emotionally engaged with drama


---------68:59----------
so that we don't have to like talk about


---------69:01----------
you like that's fine


---------69:02----------
like you're allowed to say i don't want


---------69:04----------
to talk about this but what i'm kind of


---------69:06----------
what i'm feeling from you is that you


---------69:08----------
know you're like sharing some stuff


---------69:10----------
about your family but like at the end of


---------69:11----------
the day like there are a thousand


---------69:13----------
questions here that i feel


---------69:14----------
unsafe asking because


---------69:18----------
i i think that you and i are like doing


---------69:19----------
a little bit of tango where we're like


---------69:22----------
skirting around a lot of stuff


---------69:26----------
and and so i think what we've got to do


---------69:28----------
is kind of take a step back how do you


---------69:29----------
feel right now if i say something like


---------69:30----------
that like


---------69:31----------
do you feel pinned down or attacked in


---------69:33----------
some way


---------69:34----------
uh i think it's pretty


---------69:37----------
accurate i just don't know like


---------69:42----------
at least consciously i don't know where


---------69:44----------
that wall is


---------69:46----------
like i think it'd be easier for you


---------69:49----------
to like press on something


---------69:53----------
and like if i try to like deflect or


---------69:56----------
like


---------69:56----------
minimize it or only give you a crumb


---------69:59----------
here we go


---------70:00----------
why is there a wall in the first place


---------70:04----------
uh because


---------70:08----------
we are in a public setting and there are


---------70:10----------
viewers


---------70:11----------
and not just viewers live here but like


---------70:16----------
people who can watch the vods and put it


---------70:18----------
up on youtube


---------70:20----------
that's a really good answer but i don't


---------70:23----------
think that you have a wall


---------70:24----------
just when you're streaming on the


---------70:26----------
internet


---------70:28----------
um


---------70:31----------
that's an answer that i can never argue


---------70:33----------
against because you're right


---------70:37----------
and i think you're hiding behind it


---------70:42----------
what walls do you have when no one is on


---------70:44----------
camera


---------70:47----------
when no one is on camera


---------70:50----------
uh i don't really talk much when


---------70:54----------
there's no camera on like i'm a


---------70:56----------
introvert


---------70:58----------
so i'm normally really quiet around my


---------71:01----------
friends


---------71:03----------
yeah good so that's a wall it's not just


---------71:07----------
because you're an introvert


---------71:09----------
right so like now we get to the crux of


---------71:11----------
the problem it's like


---------71:13----------
you can be toast but like i think the


---------71:16----------
problem here is that i'm not interested


---------71:18----------
in talking to toast i'm interested in


---------71:19----------
talking to jeremy


---------71:20----------
this is a conversation between two human


---------71:22----------
beings like at least for me


---------71:25----------
like that's the only way i can do this


---------71:27----------
like personally like i can't


---------71:29----------
you know like don't give us a show toast


---------71:34----------
i i mean


---------71:41----------
go ahead uh i feel like my


---------71:46----------
entire like life is just


---------71:50----------
being


---------71:53----------
and entertainer being like being on on


---------71:55----------
display like when i play even when i


---------71:57----------
play games with friends like


---------71:58----------
i would want someone to be streaming


---------72:00----------
it's like


---------72:03----------
uh it's really weird for me to play


---------72:05----------
games


---------72:07----------
and no one is streaming it it's really


---------72:10----------
weird for me


---------72:11----------
to do like anything without


---------72:14----------
it being content because my mind is just


---------72:17----------
constantly thinking


---------72:18----------
like um how do we turn this into like


---------72:21----------
entertainment for the masses


---------72:23----------
right why does your mind do that


---------72:28----------
uh i think people i


---------72:32----------
i like making people laugh


---------72:35----------
and i like entertaining people and why


---------72:38----------
do you like


---------72:43----------
i think it's because i didn't have


---------72:44----------
friends in high school


---------72:46----------
until i became like a magician and i


---------72:49----------
entertain people so i cannot associate


---------72:52----------
being entertaining


---------72:53----------
to a lot of my self-worth so


---------72:56----------
if you don't entertain us today what are


---------73:00----------
we gonna see


---------73:04----------
ah see that question seems so


---------73:09----------
strange to me like i have to entertain


---------73:12----------
people like this conversation


---------73:15----------
that's entertaining to people right like


---------73:18----------
that's why people are watching right now


---------73:20----------
it's because it's not entertaining in


---------73:22----------
this traditional sense of like


---------73:23----------
a blockbuster film but like it's


---------73:25----------
interesting


---------73:26----------
to observe right


---------73:30----------
yeah so sorry i was gonna toss out a


---------73:33----------
joke well


---------73:34----------
it is we are talking with this guy's


---------73:36----------
toast so if there's blockbuster level


---------73:38----------
entertainment


---------73:39----------
this is where you find it


---------73:44----------
so what what would we see if we if you


---------73:47----------
don't entertain us


---------73:52----------
more let's see if there's no camera


---------73:56----------
and we're talking one-on-one


---------74:00----------
and it's like a real therapy session


---------74:02----------
like completely private


---------74:04----------
how would i behave um


---------74:07----------
probably talk about my more selfish


---------74:09----------
tendencies


---------74:12----------
like i feel like i put enough bad stuff


---------74:15----------
out there so that


---------74:20----------
people realize that streamers


---------74:23----------
are human beings and have flaws and


---------74:25----------
selfish thoughts


---------74:27----------
like i feel like i put just enough out


---------74:30----------
there


---------74:30----------
that people go ah see ptosis


---------74:34----------
like you know he's got good stuff and


---------74:36----------
he's got bad stuff


---------74:39----------
but why is it important for other people


---------74:41----------
to not view you all is good


---------74:46----------
uh i think it makes me more


---------74:50----------
human and relatable and i i


---------74:53----------
i in hearthstone there are streamers who


---------74:57----------
brand themselves as super positive


---------75:01----------
but i hate them because so toast


---------75:04----------
they're really bad yep i'm gonna just


---------75:06----------
keep interrupting you okay


---------75:08----------
sorry about that okay tell me if i'm


---------75:10----------
coming up on the line of being your


---------75:11----------
enemy okay


---------75:13----------
why do you so you say it makes me dot


---------75:15----------
dot dot


---------75:17----------
i'm with you there but why do you have


---------75:20----------
to be made


---------75:21----------
into something


---------75:25----------
in the first place


---------75:30----------
right it's all a mask bro like even the


---------75:33----------
bad stuff


---------75:35----------
is like it's kind of like here i have a


---------75:37----------
a glass of


---------75:39----------
clear water let me put a drop of black


---------75:41----------
ink into it


---------75:42----------
because this looks too pure and like


---------75:45----------
what i'm getting from you is that like


---------75:46----------
like you see you kind of told us like


---------75:48----------
you're always an entertainer you don't


---------75:50----------
know how to not be an


---------75:51----------
entertainer but an entertainer is not


---------75:53----------
who you are it's how you've come to


---------75:55----------
relate to people


---------75:56----------
and what i'm curious about is like


---------75:58----------
what's going on with jeremy who's behind


---------75:59----------
the mask of toast


---------76:04----------
um


---------76:11----------
i know i haven't uh really thought


---------76:15----------
about myself


---------76:19----------
like as a person


---------76:20----------
[Music]


---------76:23----------
like all i care about is


---------76:29----------
making content really and just trying to


---------76:32----------
be a good friend


---------76:34----------
to people uh because


---------76:38----------
i don't think it's a bad thing to


---------76:41----------
base your happiness on


---------76:44----------
how much you help other people like your


---------76:47----------
friends


---------76:49----------
like like i get a lot of joy when i see


---------76:52----------
my friends succeed and like i see them


---------76:55----------
happy


---------76:57----------
uh that i don't really


---------77:01----------
like if you ask me what makes me happy


---------77:04----------
like besides


---------77:05----------
oh getting more viewers or getting more


---------77:06----------
money


---------77:09----------
um who tries to make you happy


---------77:17----------
a few of my friends


---------77:20----------
my close friends uh


---------77:23----------
here in california where they you know


---------77:27----------
try to like they always tell me i should


---------77:32----------
do things that make me happy and not


---------77:35----------
care too much about like helping my


---------77:39----------
friends


---------77:40----------
but whenever they make those suggestions


---------77:42----------
i like


---------77:44----------
i can't even think of something that i


---------77:45----------
would do for myself that would make me


---------77:47----------
happy


---------77:49----------
but i can think of like 100 things i can


---------77:51----------
do


---------77:52----------
for my friends to make them happy which


---------77:55----------
i feel like wouldn't here make me happy


---------77:58----------
i think there's a lot of value to


---------77:59----------
altruism but what would you say if if a


---------78:03----------
friend of


---------78:03----------
a friend came to you and said i don't


---------78:06----------
know how to make myself happy but i know


---------78:08----------
how to make everyone around me happy


---------78:19----------
i only think it's a problem when that


---------78:22----------
person was helping others


---------78:25----------
sacrifice their own happiness and their


---------78:27----------
own mental health to do so


---------78:30----------
um because there there is someone like


---------78:33----------
that in a friend


---------78:34----------
group and she is like constantly taking


---------78:37----------
on the problems of everyone like


---------78:39----------
if someone one of her girlfriends is


---------78:40----------
feeling sad


---------78:42----------
or like someone's going through drama


---------78:45----------
like she will


---------78:45----------
be the person to like listen to all of


---------78:47----------
that and i see the mental toll


---------78:50----------
it takes on them like


---------78:53----------
because it's so much sad and negative


---------78:55----------
energy


---------78:56----------
that they're taking in on behalf of


---------78:58----------
other people like


---------79:01----------
they they revolve their identity


---------79:05----------
around being like that supportive friend


---------79:10----------
and uh and what's your identity


---------79:14----------
i mean i i have a


---------79:17----------
a very distinct identity i feel like


---------79:20----------
of just you know


---------79:25----------
being reliable but also being having a


---------79:28----------
giant ego


---------79:30----------
do you have a giant ego


---------79:33----------
that's my persona i started


---------79:37----------
leaning into it when back when tyler1


---------79:40----------
and dr disrespect was being popular


---------79:44----------
because i would look at them and see


---------79:46----------
like how


---------79:47----------
much fans they would have and like


---------79:51----------
people you have a big ego


---------79:54----------
i do really


---------79:57----------
i think so i think my


---------80:00----------
ego matches like my success


---------80:06----------
um so i think your first answer i i put


---------80:10----------
more


---------80:12----------
seems right to me you have the persona


---------80:14----------
of having a big ego i think what i'm


---------80:18----------
hearing from you is like


---------80:19----------
i don't know it seems to me like toast


---------80:22----------
has dominated to jeremy like completely


---------80:26----------
like i think that you're a good dude i


---------80:28----------
think you're resilient i think you care


---------80:29----------
about your friends um i also hear that


---------80:32----------
what you figured out


---------80:34----------
is a formula that like oh if i make my


---------80:36----------
friends happy that in turn makes me feel


---------80:38----------
good about myself


---------80:40----------
but there's something weird going on


---------80:42----------
here man like there's something about


---------80:44----------
like you being an entertainer like all


---------80:46----------
the time and that's why i sort of ask


---------80:48----------
about like your romantic relationships


---------80:50----------
because like i think that


---------80:51----------
oftentimes because there's there's like


---------80:55----------
a certain degree of reciprocity


---------80:57----------
in romantic relationships there's a


---------80:58----------
certain degree of like authenticity


---------81:01----------
where i think like what i'm almost


---------81:04----------
hearing from you is like you're


---------81:05----------
signaling to like


---------81:08----------
it's so weird it's nuanced i don't even


---------81:11----------
know if i'm right here but like


---------81:12----------
something about you know showing a


---------81:13----------
little peop


---------81:14----------
like a little bit of the bad stuff makes


---------81:17----------
you come across as like a little bit


---------81:19----------
more authentic


---------81:21----------
but there there's this part there's this


---------81:23----------
part here where like i think


---------81:24----------
that you know if i had to just really


---------81:26----------
make a blind judgment here


---------81:28----------
and i think this is probably where i'm


---------81:29----------
going to be wrong because i think you're


---------81:32----------
pretty well constituted for lack of a


---------81:34----------
better term


---------81:35----------
i'd say like i'm worried that you're


---------81:37----------
afraid of what would happen


---------81:39----------
if you stop being an entertainer and i


---------81:41----------
think that the reason that you show


---------81:43----------
people bad stuff


---------81:44----------
is because you're testing the waters


---------81:46----------
you're seeing


---------81:48----------
daddy just crying okay can


---------81:52----------
can you please


---------81:57----------
yeah hold on one second now take as long


---------82:00----------
as you need


---------82:03----------
what happened hello chad


---------82:07----------
left alone in a room with this guy's


---------82:10----------
toast huh


---------82:13----------
no doctor to help you


---------82:16----------
oh crap he's coming back


---------82:20----------
man just when i was going for the throat


---------82:24----------
it's going for the otk um


---------82:28----------
but like the concern that i have toast


---------82:30----------
is that like


---------82:32----------
you know so it's interesting because you


---------82:33----------
you come across like so like


---------82:35----------
i'm i'm just gonna start from the top


---------82:36----------
okay and and like i may be completely


---------82:38----------
out of line here so just tell me to go


---------82:40----------
[ __ ] myself at any point


---------82:42----------
so you know like


---------82:46----------
you grew up in a world where you were


---------82:48----------
used to being a no one


---------82:51----------
where like you tried to be nice to other


---------82:53----------
people and they took advantage of your


---------82:54----------
kindness


---------82:56----------
you like grew up and like you moved to


---------82:57----------
canada where like you


---------82:59----------
even in malaysia like you never spoke


---------83:01----------
competently


---------83:02----------
you know it's either like you're not


---------83:04----------
good enough at chinese or not good


---------83:05----------
enough


---------83:06----------
at english and then you move to canada


---------83:07----------
and it like that must have been kind of


---------83:08----------
shocking and different


---------83:10----------
you know you started eating this these


---------83:12----------
bologna and ketchup sandwiches


---------83:15----------
and then you know one would think that


---------83:17----------
you were super sad


---------83:20----------
because you didn't talk to anyone for a


---------83:22----------
year


---------83:23----------
you had no friends and maybe even two


---------83:25----------
and then you started to learn magic when


---------83:26----------
you were in the 11th grade


---------83:28----------
and then you began to see that oh like


---------83:30----------
if i entertain people like


---------83:32----------
they'll like me right like the way to


---------83:36----------
make friends


---------83:36----------
is to like make other people happy


---------83:40----------
and so then like you know it's


---------83:42----------
interesting because


---------83:43----------
when you say oh like i really wasn't sad


---------83:46----------
i believe you i think that that was just


---------83:48----------
your experience it's sort of like


---------83:50----------
you know if i was born in the year 200


---------83:54----------
i'm never going to miss the internet


---------83:57----------
because i just didn't


---------83:58----------
realize it's a thing like i remember i i


---------84:01----------
went to


---------84:02----------
you know i used to go to india a lot and


---------84:03----------
visit like my ancestral village


---------84:06----------
and and there was a kid there that was


---------84:07----------
my age that was like


---------84:09----------
you know when you come here do you take


---------84:11----------
an airplane and i was like yes i take an


---------84:13----------
airplane


---------84:14----------
and then he was like why don't you how


---------84:16----------
do you not fall out of the airplane


---------84:18----------
and i just laughed right because here


---------84:20----------
this guy's never like he's like even a


---------84:22----------
car


---------84:22----------
is like a big deal like most of the time


---------84:24----------
it's carts that are being pulled by


---------84:26----------
bulls


---------84:28----------
and or buffalo and so like you know when


---------84:30----------
you're going pretty fast it's easy to


---------84:32----------
fall out of the cart and he's like if


---------84:33----------
you're going really fast like can't you


---------84:34----------
it's just


---------84:35----------
it was your experience and now what i'm


---------84:38----------
hearing is that you've you've become an


---------84:39----------
amazing person like you're clearly like


---------84:41----------
you're a good dude


---------84:42----------
you help people you get enjoyment out of


---------84:45----------
it i don't think you're a sociopath or


---------84:46----------
anything like that


---------84:48----------
but then i think that there's this weird


---------84:49----------
dilemma that you don't even know


---------84:51----------
exactly how to recognize and like


---------84:53----------
sometimes when you talk about emotions


---------84:54----------
it's like it gets pretty confusing


---------84:56----------
pretty quickly


---------84:57----------
because i think sometime some somewhere


---------84:59----------
along the way you learned how to turn


---------85:01----------
down the volume on your emotions and


---------85:03----------
like put on a show


---------85:05----------
you become toast and like when i asked


---------85:08----------
you at the beginning what do you want to


---------85:09----------
want me to call you you're like yeah i


---------85:11----------
feel


---------85:11----------
uncomfortable if people call me jeremy i


---------85:13----------
thought you said something like that


---------85:14----------
and it's like okay like that's fine


---------85:16----------
right but


---------85:18----------
so you've become toast and even then


---------85:21----------
when you think about like there are


---------85:22----------
people that you care about from high


---------85:24----------
school and you're


---------85:24----------
you need an excuse to reach out to them


---------85:26----------
and it's like why is that and


---------85:28----------
it's kind of weird like i understand it


---------85:31----------
i understand it 100


---------85:32----------
and i think it's it's because like


---------85:34----------
you're toast to the internet


---------85:36----------
toast is a cool guy toast is someone


---------85:38----------
that


---------85:39----------
everyone wants to be friends with toast


---------85:41----------
is legit


---------85:43----------
but with your friends you're jeremy


---------85:47----------
like jeremy is like a different kind of


---------85:49----------
guy


---------85:51----------
and so then we get into some of this


---------85:53----------
weird stuff like


---------85:54----------
when you're you know even


---------85:57----------
as you come on here like there are a lot


---------85:59----------
of like calculations going in your mind


---------86:01----------
like okay am i making content like what


---------86:02----------
are people expecting


---------86:04----------
how do i give people what they want


---------86:05----------
because that's just it's become


---------86:07----------
i was about to say second nature to you


---------86:09----------
but actually it's become first nature to


---------86:11----------
you


---------86:12----------
you're always thinking about content and


---------86:14----------
and stuff like that


---------86:16----------
and i have no intention to you know ask


---------86:18----------
you a thousand questions so that you


---------86:19----------
start crying on stream and [ __ ] like


---------86:21----------
we're not gonna do that


---------86:23----------
because i think you'll play that role


---------86:24----------
far too well


---------86:28----------
but i think that somewhere along the way


---------86:30----------
there's a part of you that's like


---------86:31----------
struggling a little bit to like


---------86:33----------
know whether is this person


---------86:37----------
gonna like toast or is this person just


---------86:39----------
here for toast


---------86:41----------
are they willing to accept like what's


---------86:43----------
underneath so i think you test people


---------86:45----------
i think the reason you're mean with


---------86:46----------
people is because you test them


---------86:50----------
and and you kind of like see how they'll


---------86:52----------
react


---------86:53----------
and oddly enough it's it's kind of like


---------86:55----------
the people i think that you'll feel


---------86:57----------
it this could get into weird patterns


---------86:59----------
where sometimes when you test people


---------87:01----------
it's actually like reassuring to you in


---------87:03----------
some way depending on how they respond


---------87:05----------
because it means they're willing to


---------87:06----------
accept the person who isn't doing magic


---------87:08----------
tricks


---------87:10----------
and then like the closer you get to them


---------87:12----------
the more of the authenticity you show


---------87:14----------
and it's interesting right because


---------87:15----------
you're a little bit risque i think


---------87:16----------
that's become a part of your persona


---------87:18----------
but i think it's a part of you too


---------87:19----------
because i don't know if you know what


---------87:21----------
you can


---------87:22----------
like what people can handle like how


---------87:24----------
much here's the question


---------87:26----------
how much of jeremy or toast can people


---------87:28----------
handle


---------87:30----------
because i guess in your mind you don't


---------87:32----------
think it's very much


---------87:38----------
i don't like getting too close to people


---------87:42----------
i respect not that


---------87:46----------
anyone close to means i don't respect


---------87:48----------
them but more just


---------87:50----------
i don't know that familiarity when you


---------87:52----------
become like


---------87:54----------
when someone's cool but you get to know


---------87:55----------
them really well


---------87:58----------
certainly they're not as cool


---------88:01----------
because you know them you know


---------88:04----------
like uh you know let's say you meet brad


---------88:07----------
pitt


---------88:08----------
and after you friends with him for like


---------88:10----------
three years


---------88:11----------
he's not brad pitt anymore he's just


---------88:14----------
your buddy brad


---------88:15----------
kind of deal um


---------88:19----------
getting i feel like the more people know


---------88:23----------
me


---------88:25----------
the less they


---------88:28----------
i'm afraid they'll find out something


---------88:29----------
that makes them respect me less or


---------88:31----------
something


---------88:34----------
um i'm not as impressive


---------88:37----------
so maybe it's better not to become too


---------88:39----------
close with


---------88:40----------
people what's wrong with you


---------88:43----------
not being impressive why do you need to


---------88:45----------
be impressive


---------88:47----------
i don't know everyone wants other people


---------88:49----------
to think well of them right


---------88:52----------
sure of course they do yeah


---------88:56----------
so but i i think you're kind of stuck


---------88:58----------
here toast


---------89:00----------
because who do they think well of


---------89:05----------
when you get respect from someone else


---------89:07----------
who are they respecting


---------89:10----------
toast or jeremy


---------89:14----------
i feel like i feel like they're the same


---------89:17----------
person at this point


---------89:19----------
okay right but then does toast let


---------89:22----------
people know who he is


---------89:27----------
[Music]


---------89:29----------
yeah yeah i don't know


---------89:34----------
like when you talk about jeremy and you


---------89:36----------
talk about tales


---------89:38----------
like in my mind they're the same person


---------89:43----------
okay at this point i don't know if


---------89:45----------
there's any separation


---------89:47----------
what why do you need an excuse to reach


---------89:50----------
out to your friends from high school


---------89:52----------
uh it's just like an email you received


---------89:56----------
like a month ago that you meant to reply


---------89:58----------
to but you didn't and now it's been


---------90:00----------
two years and you're looking at that


---------90:02----------
email you're like


---------90:04----------
god i really should reply huh but now


---------90:06----------
it's awkward since it's been so long i


---------90:08----------
don't want to reply out of nowhere so


---------90:10----------
i'm just gonna wait until i have a


---------90:11----------
reason to do so


---------90:13----------
because i feel like i should have


---------90:16----------
responded and the fact that didn't


---------90:18----------
makes me a bad friend and it's kind of


---------90:21----------
like i'm a little embarrassed


---------90:23----------
to go back and reply to that


---------90:26----------
email from two months ago out of nowhere


---------90:29----------
and


---------90:30----------
not like did they reach out to you and


---------90:32----------
you didn't respond


---------90:34----------
yeah it was uh they just said


---------90:37----------
you know happy new years hope you're


---------90:38----------
doing well


---------90:40----------
and that was like january 1st


---------90:44----------
yeah january 1st like 2020 so


---------90:48----------
like a year and five months ago okay


---------90:51----------
that turned out to be far more mundane


---------90:53----------
than i was expecting


---------90:54----------
that makes perfect sense man if it's


---------90:57----------
just it's been too long to respond like


---------90:59----------
that carries its own


---------91:00----------
that has nothing to do with toast and


---------91:02----------
jeremy and all that stuff that's just


---------91:04----------
like


---------91:04----------
you know you haven't responded to


---------91:06----------
someone for like 18 months so it's sort


---------91:08----------
of like


---------91:10----------
yeah like i i


---------91:13----------
i'd be happy to like see them again


---------91:16----------
but it's just it seems so foreign that


---------91:20----------
part of my life


---------91:22----------
like people i knew before i became a


---------91:25----------
content creator


---------91:30----------
what's your sense of why you've only had


---------91:32----------
one real romantic relationship


---------91:35----------
well i like to think


---------91:38----------
my best traits aren't


---------91:42----------
visible right away


---------91:46----------
also i'm really bad at talking to people


---------91:50----------
i feel like uh dating people


---------91:54----------
is a little bit of a numbers game like


---------91:55----------
the more people you meet


---------91:59----------
you're very good at talking to people


---------92:00----------
what are you talking about bro


---------92:03----------
but that's because you know me from when


---------92:06----------
i'm a content creator right


---------92:08----------
so there is a difference


---------92:11----------
uh well for the first


---------92:15----------
26 12 25 25 years of my life like i


---------92:18----------
wasn't a content creator


---------92:21----------
uh i just went to school and worked like


---------92:23----------
a computer programming job


---------92:26----------
and that's not very interesting in my


---------92:29----------
opinion


---------92:32----------
there was that's not a lot of girls in


---------92:34----------
my life


---------92:36----------
that i can even talk to not that i will


---------92:38----------
talk to them because i


---------92:39----------
have no game um but


---------92:44----------
one of the nice things about being


---------92:45----------
content creator is just


---------92:47----------
like people how i know i am


---------92:51----------
and like hold on sorry i gotta interrupt


---------92:55----------
how on earth do you not have game


---------93:00----------
uh well i i would never just talk to a


---------93:04----------
girl


---------93:05----------
you know like i used to


---------93:08----------
think not like an incel but


---------93:11----------
more like um i had this idea that


---------93:16----------
the more you have in common with the


---------93:17----------
girl


---------93:19----------
the higher chances of her liking you is


---------93:21----------
so like


---------93:22----------
i once found out that a girl i was into


---------93:24----------
like


---------93:25----------
tv show at the office and i'm like okay


---------93:29----------
so if i watch the office


---------93:31----------
and i have something to talk about with


---------93:33----------
her that's gonna up my odds um


---------93:36----------
it was this idea that affection equals


---------93:39----------
attraction


---------93:40----------
when they're very two two very separate


---------93:42----------
thing


---------93:43----------
um so


---------93:46----------
like my understanding of what is


---------93:49----------
attractive to a girl was


---------93:50----------
really off so are you telling me that


---------93:53----------
the reason that you're


---------93:54----------
not in a relationship right now is


---------93:56----------
because you don't know how


---------93:58----------
you have no game uh


---------94:02----------
that's the reason why i didn't have like


---------94:04----------
a relationship for the first 25 years


---------94:07----------
since becoming a content creator and a


---------94:09----------
mega chat


---------94:10----------
i have learned that uh


---------94:16----------
it's hard like


---------94:19----------
when it comes to what relationships


---------94:21----------
isn't it just


---------94:22----------
you're either gonna end up with them for


---------94:24----------
the rest of your life


---------94:26----------
or it's just a temporary thing


---------94:30----------
and you shouldn't get too attached


---------94:36----------
that's a question i'm curious why you


---------94:39----------
know is that


---------94:39----------
is that why you're not in a relationship


---------94:41----------
because


---------94:43----------
[Music]


---------94:45----------
yeah i i don't think i'm ready


---------94:48----------
to like go into a relationship


---------94:52----------
and then with the mindset that this like


---------94:54----------
i'm gonna make this work


---------94:56----------
and this is the expectation that we're


---------94:58----------
gonna be together


---------95:00----------
for the rest of our life because i feel


---------95:01----------
like that should


---------95:04----------
be like the mindset you have not


---------95:06----------
necessarily like this has to work out


---------95:08----------
but more like you should get into a


---------95:09----------
relationship


---------95:10----------
with the expectation that you know it's


---------95:13----------
gonna work out and you guys are gonna


---------95:14----------
get married


---------95:16----------
but so you're not you have game now


---------95:20----------
right i have


---------95:24----------
fame now and i have


---------95:27----------
like it's easier for me to believe that


---------95:31----------
toast you're you're doing something


---------95:33----------
slippery you're being slippery


---------95:35----------
so when i ask you what like because


---------95:37----------
here's the thing every now and then


---------95:39----------
you give me a really good answer


---------95:42----------
and it's one that makes a lot of sense


---------95:44----------
and one that i can't push back at at all


---------95:46----------
like if you're like oh like


---------95:48----------
i'm not ready for a relationship like


---------95:50----------
you know because like the relationships


---------95:52----------
are about commitment and like i'm just


---------95:53----------
not ready to commit and it's like bro


---------95:54----------
like you know if you're not ready for a


---------95:55----------
relationship makes perfect sense like


---------95:57----------
if that's really the reason like


---------95:59----------
absolutely makes perfect sense while


---------96:00----------
you're


---------96:01----------
not in a relationship but when i push


---------96:04----------
and i say is the reason you're not in a


---------96:08----------
relationship


---------96:08----------
right now because you're like not ready


---------96:10----------
for a commitment and you can say like


---------96:12----------
but then we get to this fame and game


---------96:14----------
stuff and like that's where like


---------96:16----------
someone doesn't smell right


---------96:19----------
it's like i think what we're hearing is


---------96:21----------
like the answer from


---------96:23----------
the mask right which is like it makes


---------96:26----------
perfect sense and i'm not saying it's


---------96:27----------
wrong but i think there's something else


---------96:29----------
like underneath


---------96:30----------
which is like what you have now is fame


---------96:33----------
so like who are they dating


---------96:37----------
[Music]


---------96:44----------
and so if at some point toast becomes


---------96:46----------
i'm just gonna keep going


---------96:48----------
okay so if at some point toast becomes


---------96:50----------
jeremy


---------96:52----------
what do they do


---------97:02----------
they leave the nest and never come back


---------97:07----------
mm-hmm right because then it it that at


---------97:10----------
that point it's like you know brad pitt


---------97:11----------
becomes your buddy brad


---------97:14----------
beautifully put and so like what i'm


---------97:16----------
when i and this this could be like


---------97:18----------
i may not be right here toast i'm really


---------97:20----------
not sure because like


---------97:21----------
i'm just gonna keep going though


---------97:24----------
because i i don't even know how much of


---------97:26----------
this is gonna resonate but like what i'm


---------97:28----------
kind of feeling from you is like


---------97:29----------
somewhere


---------97:30----------
in there there's like some general


---------97:32----------
reluctance


---------97:33----------
for you to let people because we've


---------97:35----------
heard this like we've heard like


---------97:36----------
snippets of it and maybe i'm


---------97:38----------
putting together a puzzle piece that's


---------97:39----------
not like you know a puzzle that's not


---------97:41----------
really there but it's like


---------97:43----------
like i think at some point you've got to


---------97:44----------
let people


---------97:46----------
get to know jeremy right you've got to


---------97:48----------
stop being the entertainer you've got to


---------97:49----------
like start because you have game


---------97:51----------
bro like you at like forget about the


---------97:53----------
fame you like a hundred percent have


---------97:56----------
game like you know you do


---------97:58----------
actually maybe you don't know but you've


---------98:00----------
got game like i


---------98:02----------
you know how to talk to people i'm a


---------98:03----------
[ __ ] sake dude you know how to talk to


---------98:05----------
people


---------98:07----------
maybe i'm wrong like maybe you don't


---------98:08----------
feel that way but like i think that


---------98:10----------
there's no way that the entertainer


---------98:12----------
skills don't translate like it's not


---------98:14----------
because you're right that like jeremy


---------98:16----------
and toast have become like blended like


---------98:17----------
you know how to like


---------98:19----------
you know how to bring the best out of


---------98:20----------
people's potential like you know


---------98:22----------
what also look at yourself in the mirror


---------98:25----------
sometime like you've got game bro


---------98:29----------
uh


---------98:32----------
one thing i will say it feels like it's


---------98:35----------
a little easier


---------98:36----------
in the scene because most gamers are


---------98:40----------
not that socially aware and


---------98:45----------
it's just because i've been a streamer


---------98:47----------
for so long that it


---------98:49----------
came eventually like being able to talk


---------98:53----------
to people


---------98:54----------
yeah um but now i feel a little more


---------98:58----------
comfortable but it's also it makes me


---------99:02----------
feel a lot better going to conversations


---------99:05----------
that people know who i am um


---------99:10----------
because it makes me more comfortable


---------99:13----------
uh not that i didn't know i'm a big deal


---------99:15----------
but more like


---------99:17----------
um they would


---------99:20----------
find me interesting to talk to


---------99:24----------
right so so this this is i i think maybe


---------99:27----------
hard


---------99:28----------
toast but like why do you think they


---------99:31----------
wouldn't find you interesting to talk to


---------99:33----------
anyway


---------99:36----------
they don't really stand out like


---------99:40----------
if you take away you know


---------99:44----------
the fact that i am a streamer like what


---------99:47----------
you


---------99:48----------
what you end up with is what you can


---------99:50----------
find anywhere right


---------99:52----------
like uh some form of higher education


---------99:56----------
uh into like slightly sarcastic


---------100:00----------
personality


---------100:01----------
a little above average iq but


---------100:05----------
not very productive goes on reddit a lot


---------100:11----------
um


---------100:15----------
and not a lot of experience with women i


---------100:17----------
feel like uh


---------100:20----------
stuff like that like people like that


---------100:22----------
are


---------100:23----------
so common sounds perfect


---------100:27----------
i'm serious because like sure those are


---------100:30----------
some of your attributes but that's not


---------100:32----------
actually who you are


---------100:34----------
you're engaging intelligent funny


---------100:38----------
kind yeah but people


---------100:42----------
don't see that right how can they


---------100:45----------
when you don't let them


---------100:48----------
having people don't have a reason to


---------100:50----------
even try to find out


---------100:52----------
right why put in effort like i don't put


---------100:54----------
an effort with someone who


---------100:56----------
might be like hiddenly entertaining or


---------100:59----------
like talented like i only put an effort


---------101:01----------
once i see bits and pieces of it


---------101:05----------
right so


---------101:08----------
why not just go get to know someone who


---------101:12----------
is interesting versus like who might be


---------101:15----------
interesting


---------101:16----------
a fair point right so but i i think that


---------101:19----------
this is where


---------101:21----------
i imagine we're gonna land i hope we


---------101:24----------
land somewhere in the middle because


---------101:25----------
you're right that like if someone is


---------101:27----------
an introvert who doesn't talk to anyone


---------101:29----------
like i don't know why i would go and try


---------101:31----------
to get to know them really well for the


---------101:32----------
option of like


---------101:34----------
you know becoming you know falling in


---------101:36----------
love and spending the rest of our lives


---------101:38----------
together


---------101:39----------
on the flip side at the other end of the


---------101:40----------
spectrum is toast that everyone knows


---------101:42----------
everything about


---------101:43----------
and all the work has been done and they


---------101:45----------
feel like they know who you are and then


---------101:46----------
you're kind of trapped in the middle


---------101:48----------
because


---------101:49----------
if you lean too heavily on toast


---------101:51----------
eventually they're gonna get to know


---------101:53----------
jeremy


---------101:54----------
and then brad pitt becomes your buddy


---------101:56----------
brad beautiful by the way


---------102:00----------
right and then at the other end of the


---------102:02----------
spectrum is like the ninth grader who


---------102:04----------
who no one will speak to who and i know


---------102:07----------
this is where


---------102:08----------
now like things get real a little bit


---------102:09----------
tricky because


---------102:11----------
was that person worth knowing


---------102:28----------
um no i don't think so


---------102:31----------
i think


---------102:35----------
i think in this world society


---------102:40----------
oh i think just in this at least in this


---------102:43----------
scene the streaming scene is like


---------102:45----------
sink or swim kind of deal like if we


---------102:48----------
constantly think about like


---------102:50----------
what someone could be um


---------102:56----------
it's really hard because you can you can


---------102:59----------
help so much people right there are so


---------103:01----------
much


---------103:02----------
small streamers who are struggling out


---------103:06----------
there who


---------103:06----------
you know are just looking for that


---------103:08----------
chance but


---------103:12----------
my my like way of thinking when it comes


---------103:15----------
to stuff like this is like


---------103:16----------
bro it's up to you to make yourself


---------103:19----------
interesting and


---------103:20----------
like it's up to you to entice people to


---------103:22----------
want to get to know you better right


---------103:26----------
like you might be interesting underneath


---------103:28----------
all that and


---------103:31----------
you know have a lot of potential in you


---------103:33----------
but people


---------103:35----------
shouldn't have to


---------103:39----------
go like finding out right


---------103:45----------
yeah so that's kind of it's in i think


---------103:47----------
it makes a lot of sense but like i also


---------103:49----------
think it's weird to hear you say that


---------103:51----------
because there are a lot of people out


---------103:52----------
there with a lot of potential whereas


---------103:53----------
like what are you good at toast


---------103:58----------
[Music]


---------104:00----------
you're good at bringing people's


---------104:01----------
potential out


---------104:04----------
yeah i would say so which sounds to me


---------104:07----------
like a little


---------104:08----------
like now i get confused because i'm with


---------104:10----------
you like so i think ever


---------104:12----------
in a sense everything you're saying


---------104:13----------
makes sense that if you want to make it


---------104:15----------
as a streamer


---------104:16----------
and if you want to like i think this is


---------104:18----------
true like if you want to find a good


---------104:19----------
partner


---------104:20----------
you gotta advertise like they're not


---------104:23----------
gonna come


---------104:24----------
you know like dig underneath layers and


---------104:27----------
layers of stuff but i


---------104:28----------
i think that there's like you're kind of


---------104:30----------
like i'm feeling you i'm feeling that


---------104:32----------
this conversation keeps bouncing between


---------104:33----------
two extremes


---------104:34----------
which is one is like you know there's a


---------104:36----------
part of you that's toast and you should


---------104:38----------
abso


---------104:38----------
absolutely advertise your good qualities


---------104:40----------
and like that's a piece of it


---------104:42----------
but i think there's this other weird


---------104:43----------
thing where like underneath toast and


---------104:45----------
the reason you like being toast is


---------104:46----------
because


---------104:47----------
you know i'm just gonna put it out there


---------104:48----------
this is a no-brainer like fundamentally


---------104:50----------
somewhere down there i think you feel a


---------104:51----------
little bit unlovable


---------104:54----------
right like you feel like there's like a


---------104:56----------
like a touch of the ugliness in there


---------104:58----------
and like we hear it manifest in weird


---------105:01----------
ways like i have fame but i don't have


---------105:02----------
game bro you have tons of game


---------105:04----------
like i hate to break it to you because i


---------105:06----------
i think you can't it's not just your


---------105:08----------
fame it's like


---------105:09----------
it's the things that made you famous


---------105:11----------
which you have


---------105:12----------
right it's it's that part that it's your


---------105:16----------
ability to make other people laugh it's


---------105:17----------
your ability to like notice things in


---------105:19----------
the world around you and be a little bit


---------105:21----------
sarcastic


---------105:22----------
like your persona is a part of who you


---------105:24----------
are


---------105:27----------
but i think like underneath like there's


---------105:29----------
still the ninth grader


---------105:31----------
and so when it goes back to high school


---------105:32----------
it's like you become successful you


---------105:34----------
become someone that everyone wants to be


---------105:36----------
friends with


---------105:37----------
apparently you become someone that we dm


---------105:39----------
once a month asking you to come on


---------105:41----------
stream because you're hot [ __ ]


---------105:46----------
and so i think you end up like testing


---------105:48----------
people to see like what if i'm not toast


---------105:50----------
like what if i


---------105:51----------
don't act what if i don't entertain like


---------105:53----------
what will you think about me then


---------105:56----------
and it's been you've been doing it for


---------105:57----------
so long that like the two have gotten


---------105:59----------
tangled up and all you are is toast


---------106:03----------
but i think that there's you know when


---------106:04----------
you talk about the wall like i think the


---------106:06----------
reason the wall is there is because


---------106:08----------
you're afraid of what's on the other


---------106:09----------
side


---------106:11----------
which is someone that's not worth


---------106:12----------
knowing and then we get stuck


---------106:15----------
because that will always be true


---------106:19----------
until you let the wall down you let


---------106:22----------
someone see what's on the other side and


---------106:24----------
they're like


---------106:24----------
yeah that guy's cool


---------106:28----------
and the reason i keep on hammering on a


---------106:29----------
romantic relationship is because i think


---------106:31----------
that


---------106:32----------
you're not gonna it's gonna be hard to


---------106:34----------
succeed in a romantic relationship until


---------106:36----------
you do that


---------106:37----------
because i don't know that you can be an


---------106:38----------
entertainer like 24 7 for


---------106:40----------
your likes like significant other


---------106:50----------
oh the solution is to just be


---------106:53----------
entertaining all the time from the


---------106:55----------
sounds of it


---------106:57----------
like i i guess that's the way i think


---------106:59----------
like i understand


---------107:01----------
why it's it's not the solution bro it's


---------107:02----------
the problem


---------107:04----------
because do you see what you're doing to


---------107:06----------
yourself


---------107:08----------
elevating myself by constantly pushing


---------107:10----------
myself forward


---------107:12----------
so yeah i mean you're you're you're


---------107:14----------
trapping yourself by going to higher and


---------107:16----------
higher elevations


---------107:18----------
it's like you're like a cat that climbs


---------107:20----------
up the tree and doesn't know how to get


---------107:21----------
down like the solution is not for you to


---------107:23----------
be entertaining


---------107:24----------
100 of the time


---------107:27----------
it's the opposite


---------107:31----------
how does that sound to you


---------107:37----------
i would rather just


---------107:40----------
figure out a way to be even more


---------107:42----------
entertaining honestly


---------107:44----------
um


---------107:47----------
toast yeah go keep going sorry


---------107:51----------
it's just like you know i started off as


---------107:53----------
a


---------107:55----------
someone who just posts infographics on


---------107:57----------
reddit right and then i became a


---------107:58----------
hearthstone youtuber


---------108:00----------
and then a hearthstone streamer and then


---------108:02----------
a tft stream ready to


---------108:03----------
move to california and like became like


---------108:07----------
not just a hearthstone gamer but like a


---------108:09----------
content creator that


---------108:11----------
collabs with other content creators and


---------108:13----------
then


---------108:14----------
you know offline tv and among us blowing


---------108:17----------
up and now


---------108:18----------
like being friends with like even


---------108:22----------
like people who i i look up to or like


---------108:25----------
content i used to watch right it's just


---------108:29----------
like this career it's just a constant


---------108:33----------
sense of like you know let's let's keep


---------108:36----------
going let's keep going like i wanna


---------108:38----------
work in hollywood i wanna write a script


---------108:41----------
i wanna like meet taylor swift kind of


---------108:44----------
do i wanna be friends with taylor some


---------108:45----------
kind of deal


---------108:47----------
but there's a sense of just


---------108:50----------
constantly elevating yourself right


---------108:53----------
and because we see streamers become


---------108:55----------
irrelevant very often


---------108:58----------
um they might have 10 000 viewers one


---------109:00----------
day and like


---------109:01----------
next year the game dies or


---------109:04----------
you know they take a break and become


---------109:06----------
irrelevant


---------109:08----------
and


---------109:12----------
yeah it's just constantly


---------109:16----------
pushing yourself to raise yourself up


---------109:21----------
that sounds exhausting


---------109:26----------
yeah but you know in terms of job


---------109:30----------
like it's a it's a pretty good gig you


---------109:32----------
know


---------109:36----------
what are you hearing me say


---------109:40----------
you said it sounded exhausting yeah but


---------109:42----------
in general like


---------109:43----------
do you get the sense i feel like i'm


---------109:45----------
trying to present something to you and i


---------109:47----------
i don't think we're on the same page


---------109:51----------
what do you think what what are you


---------109:53----------
hearing me


---------109:55----------
when when i try to understand you what


---------109:58----------
are you


---------109:58----------
hearing like what's your impression of


---------110:00----------
what i think


---------110:01----------
is going on with you


---------110:04----------
uh impression is that


---------110:09----------
i revolve a lot of my identity


---------110:13----------
and self-worth and being like


---------110:17----------
an entertainer and like you said it's


---------110:20----------
exhausting or it's like


---------110:23----------
people


---------110:26----------
like constantly having to like


---------110:30----------
push and


---------110:33----------
like being entertained 24 7.


---------110:37----------
like you it's definitely meant to be


---------110:39----------
taken as not a great thing right


---------110:42----------
as a tiring thing to do over and over


---------110:45----------
again


---------110:47----------
uh but is is that it


---------110:51----------
um it just feels feels like uh like the


---------110:54----------
scene is


---------110:55----------
it's very doggy dog kind of deal


---------110:59----------
and that's kind of what i like about it


---------111:02----------
as well


---------111:05----------
so yeah i think that's that's a good


---------111:09----------
summary what what are you


---------111:10----------
what are you hearing i'm at what am i


---------111:13----------
advocating that you do


---------111:19----------
not revolve my self-worth around like


---------111:26----------
like i should do things i don't know


---------111:29----------
people


---------111:30----------
like should i learn to do things that's


---------111:32----------
not content should i pick


---------111:34----------
up a hobby for myself for my like


---------111:37----------
own mental health but what if my


---------111:40----------
own mental health is just like my hobby


---------111:44----------
is being an


---------111:45----------
entertainer right okay so i'm gonna ask


---------111:47----------
you one more question toast


---------111:50----------
you can dodge as many questions as you


---------111:52----------
want to please be


---------111:53----------
completely honest with this one no


---------111:55----------
dodging allowed okay


---------111:56----------
on a scale of one to ten of stupidity


---------112:00----------
ten being this is the stupidest


---------112:02----------
idea that's ever been conceived in the


---------112:03----------
world and one is this is


---------112:05----------
absolutely brilliant what do you think


---------112:08----------
about the plan that i'm advocating for


---------112:10----------
you


---------112:11----------
is it just the dumbest [ __ ] [ __ ]


---------112:13----------
you've ever heard of


---------112:14----------
or is it absolutely brilliant uh-huh


---------112:19----------
no what's this plan specifically


---------112:22----------
to try to be less of an entertainer to


---------112:25----------
try to show


---------112:27----------
which one which number was the dumb one


---------112:30----------
10 is a dumb one


---------112:32----------
then it's 10. okay


---------112:36----------
good uh like yeah i mean my


---------112:39----------
my career is based on


---------112:42----------
being entertaining i completely


---------112:46----------
yeah it'd be crazy to not


---------112:49----------
think about content all the time and i


---------112:51----------
like it's like i also enjoy


---------112:53----------
doing it it was something like oh god i


---------112:56----------
hate doing content or like i can't think


---------112:58----------
about that stuff right now


---------112:59----------
that makes sense but like the idea of


---------113:02----------
getting more people to like me


---------113:05----------
is really appealing to me like on social


---------113:08----------
media like what post


---------113:09----------
would people want um


---------113:14----------
i agree like great


---------113:18----------
why is it sometimes i try and force


---------113:20----------
thing sorry why do you


---------113:21----------
why do you want to be bigger


---------113:26----------
i believe


---------113:29----------
i was i am destined to have a big impact


---------113:32----------
on the world


---------113:33----------
it's like main character syndrome i have


---------113:36----------
that


---------113:37----------
like there's no way i've been put on


---------113:40----------
this earth


---------113:41----------
to just be a regular person


---------113:46----------
um i'm here to have an


---------113:50----------
impact like a big impact


---------113:53----------
and you know it might be on my desk bed


---------113:56----------
that i realized ah


---------113:57----------
turns out i was just slightly above


---------114:00----------
average but


---------114:02----------
like even now my expectation is that in


---------114:05----------
10


---------114:06----------
years i would have done


---------114:09----------
or 10 or 20 years that i would have done


---------114:11----------
something that


---------114:14----------
leaves a huge impact on the world and i


---------114:17----------
think


---------114:17----------
at this rate it might be something in


---------114:19----------
the entertainment scene


---------114:21----------
um maybe in 20 years that streaming


---------114:24----------
you know it's like you got you got music


---------114:27----------
and then you have movies


---------114:29----------
and tv and streaming is like right


---------114:31----------
alongside


---------114:32----------
of it and like


---------114:35----------
people will remember me as


---------114:38----------
i know a walt disney of streaming or


---------114:42----------
steven spielberg or streaming


---------114:45----------
um i it could end up being something


---------114:48----------
else like i don't know maybe i start


---------114:49----------
caring about


---------114:50----------
world hunger or something but


---------114:54----------
um that's why i want to get bigger


---------114:58----------
all the time it's like i'm fulfilling


---------115:03----------
my colon called destiny


---------115:08----------
beautiful love it


---------115:12----------
how do you feel about sharing that


---------115:15----------
uh you think you overstepped a little


---------115:18----------
bit showed a little bit of what's


---------115:19----------
underneath the mask


---------115:21----------
well i've talked about this a little bit


---------115:23----------
this also feeds into my whole ego


---------115:25----------
persona which is why i'm okay with it


---------115:28----------
and a lot of people say like everyone's


---------115:31----------
the main character


---------115:32----------
in their own story right but i have


---------115:35----------
met people who are just content with


---------115:38----------
life


---------115:39----------
in terms of like you know being an


---------115:41----------
accountant


---------115:42----------
starting a family and that's what the


---------115:44----------
majority of people


---------115:46----------
end up doing um


---------115:49----------
but i feel like there's that subset of


---------115:53----------
people who i'm gonna be


---------115:54----------
a famous hollywood star and then move to


---------115:56----------
california things don't work out


---------115:58----------
i i just have this expectation that


---------116:00----------
things will always work out


---------116:02----------
for me because it's


---------116:05----------
meant to work out for me right


---------116:12----------
so toast i actually owe you an apology


---------116:17----------
why because i think i was trying to lead


---------116:20----------
you somewhere


---------116:22----------
and i think that was a mistake


---------116:25----------
so i i'm still pretty confident that i'm


---------116:27----------
right about most of what i said i just


---------116:29----------
don't think it's like


---------116:32----------
i don't think it matters right now oh


---------116:35----------
well what did you


---------116:38----------
learn from uh what i said just


---------116:42----------
now so you want to make an impact right


---------116:46----------
yeah like what is the nature of the


---------116:48----------
impact that you're looking for


---------116:53----------
to leave a legacy to be remembered


---------116:59----------
to be noticed


---------117:03----------
right and what i see that is is like


---------117:05----------
you're never gonna be the ninth grader


---------117:07----------
who doesn't talk to anyone


---------117:08----------
ever again and you're gonna rise so high


---------117:13----------
that no one will ever be able to leave


---------117:15----------
you behind


---------117:17----------
where you are the ceiling you determine


---------117:19----------
the ceiling you are the measure against


---------117:21----------
which other people


---------117:22----------
aim to be


---------117:26----------
you know like that's when you'll be


---------117:28----------
secure


---------117:31----------
like when you're absolutely on top is


---------117:33----------
when you don't have to worry about


---------117:34----------
being left behind like


---------117:38----------
and so i i see what drives you i think


---------117:40----------
it's great that it drives you i think


---------117:42----------
it's actually very


---------117:43----------
adaptive i think it's going to cause you


---------117:46----------
a lot of suffering


---------117:48----------
years from now but i think that maybe


---------117:52----------
that's what we need to have another


---------117:53----------
conversation


---------117:54----------
if if if so this is what i'll leave with


---------117:56----------
you leave you with okay


---------117:58----------
i think it's great that you're driven to


---------118:00----------
be the best


---------118:01----------
to be this wonderful thing and i think


---------118:03----------
it's like my head is so far up my ass in


---------118:05----------
terms of


---------118:06----------
thinking that you should it's really a


---------118:08----------
mistake on my part like i was


---------118:10----------
applying my own value system to you how


---------118:12----------
old are you now toast


---------118:13----------
if you don't uh 29. okay so i'm like


---------118:16----------
a decade older than you are i'm married


---------118:18----------
i have kids and all that kind of stuff


---------118:19----------
so like my


---------118:20----------
position is is different from yours


---------118:23----------
um for what it's worth i felt the same


---------118:25----------
way that you did many many years ago


---------118:28----------
um so i i'd say that really like my


---------118:31----------
my the mistake that i made is i was


---------118:33----------
trying to have a conversation with you


---------118:34----------
that was like


---------118:35----------
potentially a decade too early maybe


---------118:37----------
it'll never be there maybe actually


---------118:39----------
you'll


---------118:39----------
you know you'll end up in a completely


---------118:40----------
different place and the conversation


---------118:42----------
will never be appropriate


---------118:44----------
but i'm still hearing i think the


---------118:47----------
mistake that i made is that i i get the


---------118:49----------
sense that


---------118:50----------
i mean i think i'm i'm pretty confident


---------118:53----------
that your drive to succeed


---------118:54----------
comes from a sense of inadequacy


---------119:00----------
what do you think about that


---------119:03----------
uh i can agree with that um


---------119:07----------
i find myself when it comes to like


---------119:09----------
relationships and dating


---------119:12----------
i tend to gravitate towards girls


---------119:16----------
that are


---------119:21----------
having problems with their lives or like


---------119:24----------
needs to be


---------119:25----------
fixed in some way or just like yep


---------119:29----------
that i can be of use besides just like


---------119:33----------
being smart or being funny or being


---------119:35----------
carried but like actual


---------119:37----------
direct use like you can demonstrate your


---------119:41----------
value in the relationship you can bring


---------119:44----------
yes right demonstrating value is very


---------119:47----------
important


---------119:47----------
right and like why does someone need to


---------119:50----------
demonstrate


---------119:51----------
value toast that


---------119:54----------
i mean that's just how humans work right


---------119:58----------
like if you're gonna date someone you


---------119:59----------
gotta demonstrate


---------120:02----------
value so that nope they are worth it to


---------120:06----------
you


---------120:06----------
that's not how humans work so that that


---------120:11----------
that is how humor is what like in a


---------120:13----------
relationship like


---------120:14----------
i mean value can be so many different


---------120:17----------
things right if they make you laugh


---------120:18----------
you know that's value if they're


---------120:21----------
physically


---------120:22----------
fit you know and you're attracted that


---------120:24----------
that's value so there's a key


---------120:26----------
there's a key word there which is


---------120:27----------
demonstrate


---------120:30----------
demonstrate is about showing


---------120:33----------
so i think the crazy thing here and this


---------120:35----------
is where like i'm going to bark up this


---------120:36----------
tree as long as i want to is never going


---------120:37----------
to get anywhere


---------120:38----------
which is like you bring value to the


---------120:40----------
relationship without fixing someone's


---------120:42----------
problems


---------120:43----------
like that's the fundamental disagreement


---------120:45----------
that you and i have


---------120:49----------
what do you think about that


---------120:52----------
right because like like this is this is


---------120:53----------
how this works it's like why do you


---------120:55----------
gravitate because


---------120:56----------
you're like halfway there it's just like


---------120:58----------
why do you gravitate towards people


---------121:00----------
who you can fix it's because so you can


---------121:02----------
like demonstrate your value white is


---------121:03----------
demonstrating your value like why is


---------121:05----------
that important to you because


---------121:07----------
it solves an anxiety that you're not


---------121:09----------
bringing value


---------121:11----------
because if you can show them and you can


---------121:13----------
show yourself


---------121:14----------
hey look what i bring to this


---------121:16----------
relationship


---------121:18----------
then it's like everything's fine does


---------121:21----------
that make sense


---------121:23----------
it's like very like psychologically


---------121:25----------
appeasing


---------121:27----------
to bring value to a relationship


---------121:31----------
there's proof there's evidence


---------121:34----------
what do you think about that


---------121:38----------
[Music]


---------121:48----------
i just don't think my


---------121:51----------
best traits are visible


---------121:55----------
by like just north day-to-day


---------122:00----------
being able to like be an entertainer and


---------122:03----------
like


---------122:04----------
of actual use like solving people's


---------122:06----------
problems


---------122:08----------
it's more believable for me when someone


---------122:11----------
is attracted to that exactly


---------122:16----------
well said right but but now now there's


---------122:19----------
an important word there and i i'm


---------122:21----------
maybe i should just stop at this point


---------122:23----------
like let me know like does this do you


---------122:24----------
think we're making it


---------122:25----------
like is this worth our time or am i just


---------122:28----------
are we just ships passing in the night


---------122:31----------
and like this is an unproductive


---------122:33----------
conversation what are you thinking i


---------122:34----------
need an honest answer from you bro


---------122:36----------
i think we're on the same page in terms


---------122:39----------
of like


---------122:43----------
like why my way of thinking isn't that


---------122:47----------
it's a little


---------122:52----------
like i should believe in myself that you


---------122:54----------
know me as a person


---------122:57----------
is enough and like people would want to


---------123:00----------
get into relationships with me with just


---------123:03----------
being myself


---------123:06----------
but


---------123:12----------
but


---------123:14----------
just makes me feel better man like if uh


---------123:18----------
if it just makes me feel a little more


---------123:21----------
confident a little


---------123:22----------
less insecure because i i know


---------123:25----------
that the bad thing about the way i think


---------123:27----------
when it comes to like fixing people


---------123:28----------
is eventually i'm gonna run out things


---------123:30----------
to fix right


---------123:32----------
like let's say i found this girl and i


---------123:35----------
fixed her up


---------123:36----------
and she's an amazing woman but one day


---------123:40----------
she's i if i'm doing my job correctly


---------123:43----------
she's gonna be fixed and there's nothing


---------123:46----------
gonna like there's no problem for me to


---------123:48----------
solve and that's when i start then


---------123:50----------
what no what is she gonna do when you


---------123:52----------
fix her


---------123:54----------
well


---------123:58----------
maybe peace out or you know


---------124:02----------
leave the nest because


---------124:06----------
she doesn't need you anymore because


---------124:09----------
the foundation of your relationship


---------124:12----------
was you being of value to her and if the


---------124:15----------
only thing that you bring to her is


---------124:17----------
value


---------124:17----------
and you're done with that then she


---------124:19----------
doesn't need you anymore


---------124:22----------
oh maybe in the time we were together


---------124:25----------
she


---------124:26----------
liked what she saw and would stay


---------124:30----------
yeah so i just gotta rope him in first


---------124:32----------
with uh


---------124:34----------
got him helpful gotta have the right


---------124:36----------
lure on the hook


---------124:39----------
yeah and then you know


---------124:43----------
then i can demonstrate like


---------124:48----------
jeremy in a way


---------124:52----------
what do you think about that


---------124:55----------
seems perfect and perfectly fine


---------125:00----------
what's the i mean the downside is oh she


---------125:02----------
leaves


---------125:03----------
and i don't think i'm that


---------125:07----------
bullish or naive to help someone


---------125:12----------
who is only interested in like


---------125:15----------
their their own selves or like selfish


---------125:19----------
nature i think


---------125:20----------
i'm really good at finding people that


---------125:24----------
are good people and i think so i'm


---------125:28----------
helping them


---------125:29----------
that they already passed a lot of like


---------125:32----------
my internal check mark i think so too


---------125:37----------
but i i do think it's important toast to


---------125:40----------
like


---------125:41----------
recognize that at some point you're


---------125:44----------
gonna have to make that transition


---------125:46----------
and to recognize that that transition


---------125:49----------
where you show her who jeremy is and


---------125:51----------
maybe she'll stick around


---------125:52----------
she doesn't need you anymore


---------125:56----------
like that's going to be terrifying for


---------126:00----------
you


---------126:12----------
or is it not am i wrong there


---------126:20----------
you seem skeptical i'm confident which


---------126:23----------
means that i think we just


---------126:24----------
we're on the same page there maybe we've


---------126:26----------
split


---------126:28----------
um maybe i used too strong of a word


---------126:33----------
maybe no more or reluctant


---------126:37----------
uh i think if i was like that was a girl


---------126:41----------
he would be the kind of girl to not just


---------126:46----------
leave


---------126:47----------
after she's fixed up


---------126:52----------
but this is the problem man how do you


---------126:54----------
know whether she's that kind of girl or


---------126:56----------
not


---------126:58----------
ah


---------127:03----------
i mean this is all on top of my


---------127:06----------
we i know we didn't really talk about


---------127:08----------
this file so don't like being committed


---------127:10----------
in a relationship right now either so


---------127:14----------
i don't think it's just me not finding


---------127:17----------
the right girl


---------127:18----------
as well i think it's just


---------127:24----------
i feel like when i'm dating someone it's


---------127:26----------
essentially


---------127:27----------
committing the rest of my life with them


---------127:33----------
that does sound to me to be a little bit


---------127:34----------
different but but


---------127:36----------
i mean if if you want me to toast


---------127:38----------
because you know this is i'm a


---------127:39----------
psychiatrist i don't know if you do this


---------127:41----------
but if you knew this but


---------127:42----------
as psychiatrists sometimes we can always


---------127:44----------
find a way to prove ourselves right


---------127:48----------
it's one of the flaws of our profession


---------127:49----------
and it's one that i'm afraid i could be


---------127:51----------
falling into which is why i need your


---------127:53----------
you know i need you to tell me but i can


---------127:56----------
twist that


---------127:56----------
into exactly what we're talking about


---------127:58----------
now too if you want me to


---------128:00----------
i'm gonna give it a quick shot uh


---------128:03----------
no i i just think


---------128:06----------
the problem isn't the the girl


---------128:10----------
here i agree


---------128:13----------
what do you think the problem is the


---------128:17----------
bigger problem is just i


---------128:22----------
like it's either life or like death


---------128:25----------
do us a part or it's just one-time fling


---------128:30----------
right yep so so why why are you afraid


---------128:33----------
to go down the death to us part route


---------128:40----------
i don't know and this is a long time


---------128:43----------
since


---------128:44----------
it's a long time


---------128:48----------
i i breakups are hard


---------128:52----------
breakups are really hard


---------128:56----------
and i don't like the idea of going


---------129:00----------
through a breakup


---------129:03----------
like it's normal for relationships to


---------129:04----------
not work out


---------129:06----------
but man i i feel really bad having to


---------129:08----------
break up with someone


---------129:10----------
to a point where i just rather not


---------129:16----------
be what's so hard about breakups


---------129:25----------
i mean you care about this person a lot


---------129:28----------
right


---------129:29----------
but you also can't


---------129:33----------
like you you're gonna if you guys are


---------129:36----------
breaking up you reach the point where


---------129:42----------
it's better for you guys to not be with


---------129:44----------
each other


---------129:46----------
and like all that time you shared with


---------129:48----------
each other


---------129:49----------
like to just become


---------129:52----------
essentially strangers after like


---------129:56----------
so long


---------130:00----------
that's that's uh i hate hurting people's


---------130:04----------
feelings


---------130:06----------
and it's easier to just not be in a


---------130:09----------
relationship


---------130:10----------
this way one's feelings get hurt right


---------130:18----------
yeah sounds very logical yeah


---------130:22----------
why why does anyone ever engage in a


---------130:24----------
relationship then


---------130:36----------
makes them happy


---------130:40----------
would a relationship make you happy


---------130:44----------
ah


---------130:48----------
i think until i'm okay


---------130:51----------
with the idea of like breakup being a


---------130:54----------
possibility


---------130:56----------
i don't think a relationship will make


---------130:58----------
me happy because


---------130:59----------
it's always going to be in the back of


---------131:01----------
my head like


---------131:03----------
i'll toast hope you're in for the long


---------131:06----------
haul because you're going to be with


---------131:07----------
this person until


---------131:08----------
you die or i hope you're ready to break


---------131:11----------
someone's heart


---------131:12----------
and make them cry and like


---------131:16----------
being in a relationship with that in the


---------131:17----------
back of your mind the whole time


---------131:20----------
gives me a lot of anxiety and like


---------131:23----------
makes me feel like a fraud when i'm with


---------131:25----------
the person like


---------131:26----------
oh god she doesn't know that i'm gonna


---------131:28----------
have to break up with her eventually


---------131:35----------
yeah makes sense


---------131:39----------
it sounds like you're trying to protect


---------131:40----------
people


---------131:43----------
yeah is that weird to say


---------131:48----------
no no


---------131:54----------
i think because of my like whole


---------131:58----------
i gotta climb i gotta climb i'm afraid


---------132:01----------
that i'm applying that to my romantic


---------132:03----------
life as well


---------132:04----------
it's like oh this girl is like


---------132:08----------
this this this and this but what if


---------132:10----------
another girl comes along that's like


---------132:12----------
even upgrade better in every single way


---------132:16----------
and i used to feel like that more


---------132:18----------
strongly but these days


---------132:20----------
i realize um you know everyone is very


---------132:23----------
different in their own way


---------132:24----------
and honestly like time spent with


---------132:27----------
someone is worth something right


---------132:30----------
like the memories you've built the


---------132:32----------
hardship in dior


---------132:35----------
i used to have this attitude that


---------132:39----------
there exists perfect relationships out


---------132:42----------
there


---------132:44----------
but like realistically


---------132:50----------
for every human being in the world


---------132:52----------
there's like


---------132:54----------
thousands of people that they can end up


---------132:56----------
marrying and like


---------132:58----------
living the rest of their lives out with


---------133:00----------
right


---------133:05----------
there's no one right person and it's


---------133:07----------
crazy to think about


---------133:09----------
in my opinion that we have this one life


---------133:12----------
and let's say there's multiple timelines


---------133:15----------
like in this timeline


---------133:16----------
i married woman a and i'm happy


---------133:19----------
and i die of old age with her and


---------133:22----------
there's another timeline


---------133:24----------
like and i met woman b first and i can


---------133:27----------
marry her as well


---------133:28----------
and i dialed with her like like marriage


---------133:32----------
even though it's meant to seem like such


---------133:34----------
an important


---------133:36----------
final choice


---------133:39----------
it there's no right answer it could be


---------133:43----------
not any woman but there is like


---------133:47----------
multiple possibilities


---------133:50----------
and that's scary because it's easy when


---------133:51----------
there's a right choice


---------133:54----------
but one is like oh yeah you can end up


---------133:55----------
with her girl died together


---------133:58----------
i came out with her and grow old and die


---------134:00----------
together


---------134:01----------
there's no right answer and


---------134:06----------
that is a little scary to me


---------134:10----------
because i kind of grew up with the whole


---------134:12----------
like


---------134:13----------
fairytale romantic outcome but i'm


---------134:16----------
learning that you know there are some


---------134:19----------
people in life you're going to be more


---------134:20----------
compatible with


---------134:21----------
and there are multiple partners that


---------134:24----------
are suited for you to spend the rest of


---------134:28----------
your life with


---------134:31----------
makes a lot of sense man yeah


---------134:35----------
i can imagine how that can be kind of


---------134:36----------
like


---------134:38----------
bewildering right because if there isn't


---------134:41----------
a right answer


---------134:42----------
then how do you know who to pick


---------134:53----------
can i think for a second yeah sure


---------134:57----------
how you feeling right now uh


---------135:00----------
good okay good i feel like we talked


---------135:04----------
about relationships a lot


---------135:06----------
uh which does make me just a tiny bit


---------135:10----------
uncomfortable


---------135:12----------
more because i know every like my


---------135:14----------
[ __ ]


---------135:15----------
friends and family are watching


---------135:19----------
and they would


---------135:23----------
you know people love talking and


---------135:25----------
gossiping and


---------135:29----------
uh


---------135:33----------
i know i feel like relationships to one


---------135:36----------
thing


---------135:37----------
i try to keep quiet about


---------135:40----------
not for me but for the


---------135:43----------
people it might affect sure


---------135:46----------
i i think you've mentioned several times


---------135:48----------
i think it's it's you made clear to me


---------135:50----------
that from a value standpoint


---------135:52----------
you are you're very protective of the


---------135:55----------
people that you care about


---------135:57----------
and that you're actually okay like you


---------135:59----------
know being attacked personally or like


---------136:01----------
being made fun of but when it comes to


---------136:02----------
the people that you care about


---------136:04----------
it's like the no no zone yeah


---------136:07----------
because everyone had different about i


---------136:09----------
can set my own boundaries but


---------136:10----------
yeah i would never want to serve for


---------136:14----------
someone else


---------136:15----------
so i know that the topic is


---------136:16----------
relationships what's your understanding


---------136:19----------
of why i keep on asking because i'm the


---------136:20----------
one who's driving the relationship


---------136:21----------
conversation right that's me in the


---------136:23----------
driver's seat


---------136:26----------
why do you think i'm driving there


---------136:30----------
ah


---------136:33----------
is it because i it's the one thing i


---------136:36----------
don't want to talk


---------136:38----------
sorry um like i'm hiding something there


---------136:44----------
like


---------136:46----------
there's something there yep that's


---------136:48----------
that's why good


---------136:50----------
that's exactly right so so can i explain


---------136:52----------
what i think is there


---------136:54----------
so i think like the the challenge is


---------136:56----------
going to be that you have too many right


---------136:58----------
answers if we talk about


---------137:00----------
anything else


---------137:05----------
does that make sense yes


---------137:09----------
so it's going to be too easy to pull me


---------137:12----------
into an intellectual conversation about


---------137:15----------
what's good to do and what's bad to do


---------137:18----------
so i think relationships is like where


---------137:21----------
like there's a lot of stuff


---------137:23----------
like you know here that i think that


---------137:27----------
you can't quite make as much of an


---------137:29----------
abstract argument about


---------137:32----------
so when i when i ask you about


---------137:34----------
relationships i don't know if you notice


---------137:35----------
but i'm not asking anything about anyone


---------137:37----------
that you've been in a relationship with


---------137:40----------
like i get that you have that boundary


---------137:43----------
i'm you know i'm asking about you


---------137:46----------
in the relationship how you approach


---------137:48----------
relationships how you think about


---------137:50----------
relationships what you're afraid of


---------137:52----------
and i think the reason is because with


---------137:55----------
the relationship


---------137:56----------
is like the thing that brings the


---------137:59----------
tension between jeremy


---------138:01----------
and toast kind of like front and center


---------138:03----------
for me like


---------138:04----------
out of everything we've talked about


---------138:06----------
because i think you can be like a noble


---------138:08----------
friend and you're


---------138:09----------
in your like platonic relationships


---------138:13----------
i can be i think you probably are a


---------138:15----------
wonderful sibling and a wonderful son


---------138:19----------
um i i think that you do right by a lot


---------138:22----------
of people because you care about a lot


---------138:24----------
of people


---------138:26----------
i think relationships is the one thing


---------138:28----------
where like


---------138:30----------
things are gonna start to feel a little


---------138:31----------
bit more contradictory it's also


---------138:33----------
challenging because as a streamer


---------138:35----------
friendship is so complicated already


---------138:39----------
right because there's like are we


---------138:40----------
friends because we like each other


---------138:42----------
or are we friends because we collab and


---------138:44----------
we make good content together like why


---------138:46----------
is this person hanging out with me


---------138:48----------
it all gets tangled together right


---------138:49----------
because this is a professional


---------138:50----------
relationship is it a


---------138:52----------
platonic relationship like it's all


---------138:55----------
tangled


---------138:57----------
but what i'm hearing from you toast is


---------139:00----------
is oddly enough even though you disagree


---------139:03----------
with me i'm i'm kind of


---------139:05----------
finding that no actually you don't just


---------139:06----------
i think we're as you mentioned i think


---------139:08----------
we're actually kind of on the same page


---------139:10----------
i think you've got to continue to climb


---------139:13----------
but the the concern that i have is at


---------139:15----------
some point i think if you want to be


---------139:17----------
in a healthy romantic relationship


---------139:20----------
and yeah i mean you know these things


---------139:21----------
dude like you're the one who's giving me


---------139:23----------
the ammo because you're like i try to


---------139:24----------
date people who are busted in some way


---------139:26----------
so that i can try to fix them and then


---------139:27----------
like


---------139:28----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but i


---------139:30----------
think everyone can actually identify


---------139:31----------
with that and why do you try to fix them


---------139:33----------
it's because it makes you feel good


---------139:35----------
right like they know what you're


---------139:37----------
bringing to the table so that you don't


---------139:39----------
have to worry about being


---------139:40----------
and sorry if this is out of line but you


---------139:43----------
don't have to worry about being 9th


---------139:44----------
grade jeremy


---------139:46----------
because you can you feel more


---------139:48----------
comfortable with like them knowing toast


---------139:50----------
because then you don't have to be 9th


---------139:51----------
grade jeremy


---------139:54----------
and you want to rise to the top of your


---------139:56----------
field because if you're at the top of


---------139:57----------
your field you certainly ate 9th grade


---------139:58----------
jeremy


---------140:00----------
so i hear i see a theme which i don't


---------140:03----------
know if it's right or wrong it's really


---------140:04----------
for you to think about you got to tell


---------140:06----------
me like


---------140:07----------
that's right or that's wrong


---------140:11----------
because i think you do bring a lot of


---------140:12----------
value to people i think you're a very


---------140:14----------
good entertainer


---------140:15----------
and i'm a little bit afraid that it's


---------140:18----------
going to be hard for you to show


---------140:20----------
someone if someone knows your fame


---------140:24----------
it's going to be hard for them to like


---------140:26----------
you even told us right like you're


---------140:27----------
you're kind of like


---------140:29----------
brad pitt and your buddy brad


---------140:32----------
and making that transition is going to


---------140:34----------
be hard and there are all these


---------140:35----------
different things that like


---------140:36----------
the theme that i see here is that you're


---------140:38----------
trying to move away from 9th grade


---------140:39----------
jeremy in as many ways as possible


---------140:42----------
either you date someone who you can fix


---------140:44----------
or you demonstrate your value


---------140:47----------
because the idea that you have intrinsic


---------140:49----------
value is like kind of confusing


---------140:51----------
and i know that intellectually you


---------140:53----------
understand that concept


---------140:55----------
but let's be clear having intrinsic


---------140:58----------
value does not make you a successful


---------141:00----------
streamer


---------141:00----------
having extra intrinsic value makes you a


---------141:02----------
successful streamer


---------141:04----------
and so you have a world that reinforces


---------141:08----------
this principle which is


---------141:09----------
absolutely true and at the end of the


---------141:12----------
day


---------141:13----------
life is good enough so what are we even


---------141:16----------
talking about here which i get


---------141:17----------
completely because i i here i am pushing


---------141:20----------
you to change something that you don't


---------141:22----------
think is not only broke


---------141:23----------
it's not broken it's amazing it's the


---------141:26----------
reason for your success and here's


---------141:28----------
[ __ ]


---------141:29----------
this guy telling you to like be


---------141:30----------
different like show people what's


---------141:32----------
underneath the mask like


---------141:33----------
show people that that you can be 9th


---------141:35----------
grade jeremy you're like how [ __ ]


---------141:36----------
dumb is that


---------141:39----------
the whole reason that i am where i am is


---------141:41----------
because i moved away from ninth grade


---------141:43----------
jeremy and i became someone else


---------141:45----------
i learned how to be entertaining i


---------141:47----------
learned how to be useful to the people


---------141:48----------
around me


---------141:49----------
instead of someone who sits alone in the


---------141:51----------
cafeteria and doesn't talk to a soul i


---------141:54----------
don't want to be that person


---------141:56----------
and you're right like your success is


---------142:00----------
because you aren't


---------142:01----------
ninth grade jeremy you're disguised


---------142:02----------
toast


---------142:05----------
right like your toast that's who you are


---------142:06----------
you bring value you protect people


---------142:08----------
you collaborate with people you bring


---------142:10----------
you you bring people to their full


---------142:12----------
potential


---------142:14----------
and you're going to make your mark on


---------142:15----------
the world you're going to start


---------142:16----------
streaming before the first tft streamer


---------142:18----------
starts


---------142:18----------
you're going to stop streaming after the


---------142:19----------
last tft streamer restarts


---------142:22----------
no way to get left behind if you're at


---------142:24----------
the front of the pack


---------142:28----------
uh i like having power


---------142:31----------
and authority because i trust myself


---------142:36----------
to use it responsibly


---------142:42----------
when it's other people at the helm


---------142:46----------
like if certain people have like power


---------142:49----------
or like authority over others


---------142:52----------
i feel like it's not always used


---------142:57----------
fairly like this


---------143:00----------
injustice and what other people


---------143:04----------
do and


---------143:07----------
i trust myself the most that given a


---------143:10----------
leadership role


---------143:11----------
or like a power dynamic that i would


---------143:15----------
always make the right choice for


---------143:17----------
everyone


---------143:19----------
um i have this


---------143:22----------
big sense of


---------143:28----------
righteousness or like justice


---------143:32----------
in my like in my world


---------143:35----------
like i hate like i hate it when people


---------143:38----------
are rude or bullies like


---------143:43----------
i get really triggered by it and that's


---------143:46----------
also one of the reason why i push myself


---------143:48----------
a lot because


---------143:51----------
people are selfish and they're prone to


---------143:54----------
doing stupid


---------143:55----------
selfish things that put themselves


---------143:58----------
it's like that marathon again right when


---------144:01----------
i'm


---------144:01----------
leading the pack it's easy for me to


---------144:04----------
look back


---------144:05----------
and like see where everyone elevate


---------144:07----------
other people bring them forward yeah


---------144:10----------
yeah but i've seen what it's like for


---------144:14----------
others to be like ahead of a pack


---------144:18----------
like you have the power but not use it


---------144:20----------
for others


---------144:22----------
and i don't like it when that happens so


---------144:28----------
i like that's why i


---------144:31----------
feel like i need to be constantly bigger


---------144:36----------
and also you know again i don't want


---------144:38----------
them leaving the nest as well


---------144:43----------
do you actually mean that or was that a


---------144:44----------
joke


---------144:46----------
uh i i do feel a little


---------144:50----------
i do feel negative feelings


---------144:54----------
like what is sadness or like resentment


---------144:57----------
when


---------144:59----------
someone just completely


---------145:03----------
up and leaves not like disappear


---------145:07----------
but more just like hey i'm gonna


---------145:09----------
associate with those guys now


---------145:10----------
you know like adios


---------145:14----------
adios kind of deal i'm gonna go play


---------145:16----------
with those guys because


---------145:18----------
uh that's my crew now you know i get


---------145:21----------
more viewers with them or i


---------145:22----------
get more attention with them but


---------145:26----------
i i know it's normal to want that but


---------145:30----------
it does feel like empty nest syndrome


---------145:32----------
where i just


---------145:34----------
you know at the very least i wish they


---------145:39----------
but come visit every now and then


---------145:42----------
instead of just making it feel like they


---------145:45----------
forgot about us


---------145:47----------
not just me specifically but like i mean


---------145:49----------
it does affect me but


---------145:51----------
like if they came back to the nest and


---------145:53----------
still like played with


---------145:55----------
like other friends or people they used


---------145:57----------
to play with like that's


---------146:00----------
fine but when they completely up and


---------146:02----------
just


---------146:05----------
only focus on their own thing and like


---------146:09----------
branch out i do feel


---------146:13----------
sad i feel sad i guess yeah


---------146:17----------
okay so yeah yeah


---------146:20----------
for what it's worth toast i i think it


---------146:22----------
makes sense that you trust yourself


---------146:25----------
you know i i i think you seem like a


---------146:27----------
good dude


---------146:28----------
i can understand why you trust yourself


---------146:31----------
i think it's kind of tricky though


---------146:33----------
because


---------146:34----------
the more that you the more you're forced


---------146:37----------
to trust yourself the harder it is to


---------146:38----------
trust other people


---------146:41----------
and what i'm kind of hearing even is as


---------146:43----------
you kind of talk about


---------146:45----------
empty nest syndrome is it's like it's


---------146:46----------
like sort of a


---------146:48----------
you know you talk about sadness i i'm


---------146:50----------
feeling


---------146:52----------
a lack of fairness a lack of reciprocity


---------146:56----------
a certain not just sadness like


---------147:01----------
if my dog passes away like that's sad


---------147:04----------
like there's a certain like not quite


---------147:06----------
maliciousness but like


---------147:08----------
maybe even obliviousness or lack of


---------147:11----------
compassion or consideration


---------147:13----------
that feels very unfair to me about what


---------147:15----------
you're describing


---------147:29----------
yes okay um


---------147:33----------
can i can i toss one last uh


---------147:37----------
um


---------147:42----------
can i test one last provocative thing


---------147:44----------
your way


---------147:47----------
so i could also imagine given what we


---------147:49----------
just talked about that you trust in


---------147:51----------
yourself and it's hard to trust other


---------147:52----------
people because


---------147:54----------
people have like you know taking


---------147:57----------
advantage of your kindness


---------147:58----------
and they've left you hanging fair


---------148:03----------
yeah yeah yeah i can imagine that it


---------148:06----------
would be hard


---------148:07----------
to want to be in a committed


---------148:08----------
relationship because like that's kind of


---------148:10----------
the situation where like if you're going


---------148:12----------
all in and someone leaves the nest then


---------148:17----------
because like that's when they're not


---------148:19----------
supposed to leave right like that's the


---------148:20----------
whole point of a committed relationship


---------148:22----------
it's like a promise


---------148:23----------
and and when i just kind of put myself


---------148:25----------
in your shoes for a second


---------148:26----------
like i kind of think about what would


---------148:28----------
hurt the most


---------148:30----------
is it's if i go all in and they say they


---------148:33----------
go all in


---------148:35----------
and then they don't go all in


---------148:39----------
and that like i don't think i would want


---------148:40----------
to open myself up to that


---------148:42----------
possibility of hurt


---------148:46----------
um


---------148:47----------
[Music]


---------148:50----------
i feel like in all the dating


---------148:54----------
i've done you know in the last four or


---------148:57----------
five years i've always


---------148:58----------
been the one with one foot out the door


---------149:04----------
and i don't know why like


---------149:12----------
what do you think


---------149:18----------
i think when you have one foot out the


---------149:20----------
door you minimize


---------149:22----------
the hurt like oh you can't get upset at


---------149:26----------
me because i said it wasn't serious


---------149:28----------
candy or like


---------149:34----------
i just feel


---------149:39----------
bad like i feel like i'm lying to a girl


---------149:42----------
when i start dating them


---------149:46----------
because i feel like the girls are always


---------149:47----------
going in with like


---------149:50----------
strong commitment with the expectations


---------149:53----------
that we're gonna get married


---------149:56----------
and when i enter like dating a


---------149:59----------
relationship


---------150:00----------
it's always very that's


---------150:04----------
probably not gonna work out


---------150:07----------
and i always feel like some anxiety


---------150:11----------
like oh i have this knowledge that it


---------150:13----------
won't work out but she doesn't know


---------150:15----------
so i'm misleading her


---------150:18----------
and i should just break up with her


---------150:21----------
right now


---------150:26----------
so i i feel like we could dig into this


---------150:28----------
more i'm sort of


---------150:30----------
i want to be a little bit cognizant of


---------150:31----------
time so let me ask you like wonder


---------150:33----------
because i it's too juicy


---------150:35----------
toast too much of an entertainer


---------150:39----------
you know why do you think you have one


---------150:40----------
foot out the door


---------150:44----------
right because i get what you're saying


---------150:45----------
that like


---------150:47----------
you know it's sort of unfair to them


---------150:49----------
because you have one foot out the door


---------150:51----------
when things start and you try to be


---------150:53----------
transparent with them


---------150:54----------
but damn it you're such a mega chad they


---------150:56----------
fall in love with you anyway


---------151:00----------
but why don't you let me put it this way


---------151:03----------
so let me try to reframe a little bit


---------151:05----------
like is it that you have one foot out


---------151:07----------
the door or you only put one foot in the


---------151:09----------
door


---------151:13----------
[Music]


---------151:25----------
maybe it's the second one i don't feel


---------151:27----------
like i've ever


---------151:30----------
went into a relationship


---------151:33----------
with really high hopes


---------151:38----------
and maybe i shouldn't have gotten into


---------151:41----------
those relationships in the first place


---------151:45----------
so what keeps you from having high hopes


---------151:50----------
i don't know i i keep


---------151:54----------
like like sometimes i wish i would come


---------151:57----------
across a girl


---------151:58----------
that makes me feel like bam


---------152:03----------
i am ready for marriage kind of deal


---------152:07----------
um i don't know if a girl


---------152:11----------
like that exists because i've


---------152:14----------
met a lot of you know amazing


---------152:18----------
you know girls or talented but


---------152:27----------
would you let yourself fall in love


---------152:32----------
ah


---------152:37----------
i don't think so i think


---------152:44----------
i think i need to be


---------152:47----------
okay with the relationship


---------152:50----------
not working out because if i'm not okay


---------152:54----------
with that if i enter a relationship


---------152:57----------
like that anxiety eats me up because i


---------152:59----------
have tried like


---------153:01----------
dating and being in a relationship with


---------153:04----------
someone and like


---------153:06----------
i just remember like one weekend like


---------153:08----------
that it's in the


---------153:10----------
back of my head just like oh god what if


---------153:13----------
we break out what if we break our


---------153:14----------
freak out and it made me like not want


---------153:17----------
to be


---------153:18----------
that made me check out from the


---------153:19----------
relationship like almost like


---------153:21----------
in the self-sabotaging way of just like


---------153:24----------
okay


---------153:24----------
let's just get it over with then and


---------153:27----------
um i feel like i would feel like that


---------153:31----------
no matter who it is and that i need to


---------153:37----------
somehow be okay with the idea that


---------153:40----------
it's normal in a relationship for people


---------153:42----------
to break up things don't always work out


---------153:45----------
sure but yeah i mean i think that would


---------153:48----------
be wonderful


---------153:49----------
we could wave a magic wand and have you


---------153:51----------
be okay with it


---------153:54----------
but i think the real question is why


---------153:57----------
aren't you okay with it to begin with


---------154:01----------
i don't want to hurt people's feelings


---------154:03----------
that's rude


---------154:06----------
um


---------154:10----------
like why do that to someone you care


---------154:12----------
about right


---------154:14----------
like even if i we don't end up together


---------154:16----------
like if i'm dating them it's because


---------154:18----------
i care about them a lot


---------154:22----------
but where do you get the idea that


---------154:24----------
things are going to end poorly right


---------154:25----------
because there's that thought in your


---------154:26----------
head that you're just going to end up


---------154:28----------
hurting her


---------154:29----------
this is kind of interesting because it's


---------154:31----------
sort of like this weird trap where like


---------154:34----------
the more you like her the more you care


---------154:35----------
about her


---------154:37----------
you have this thought that oh my god


---------154:38----------
we're going to break up i don't want to


---------154:39----------
hurt her and the more you pull back


---------154:43----------
well if we're not breaking up we're


---------154:44----------
spending the rest of our life together


---------154:46----------
right


---------154:47----------
that's pretty scary what's scary about


---------154:50----------
that


---------154:53----------
i don't know like things change so fast


---------154:57----------
like as a person


---------154:58----------
as well like


---------155:01----------
like last year this time i didn't i


---------155:04----------
wasn't even playing among us


---------155:07----------
and now i've played the wrongness and


---------155:10----------
it's


---------155:10----------
already ended and it was in the span of


---------155:13----------
what nine months


---------155:19----------
i i don't know what the future


---------155:22----------
will hold you know


---------155:26----------
like when when i think about divorces


---------155:29----------
honestly it's comforting


---------155:30----------
because at the end of the day people get


---------155:31----------
divorces all the time right


---------155:34----------
and i should be okay with breakup people


---------155:36----------
break up all the time people get


---------155:37----------
divorced


---------155:38----------
that's why there's divorce lawyers it's


---------155:40----------
so common


---------155:41----------
that there's a law specialization


---------155:45----------
dedicated to divorces


---------155:48----------
um


---------155:52----------
but


---------156:01----------
i think i would want to know that i am


---------156:04----------
going to marry this person before i


---------156:06----------
start dating them


---------156:08----------
which is almost impossible because you


---------156:09----------
kind of make that decision once you're


---------156:11----------
in a relationship with them


---------156:14----------
i think it's a very good insight


---------156:17----------
what would it mean if you knew ahead of


---------156:19----------
time that you were marrying someone


---------156:22----------
what would that do for your mind


---------156:26----------
i think it'd be a lot more comforting


---------156:29----------
and


---------156:31----------
wash away my anxiety


---------156:34----------
i wish yeah like what would it wash away


---------156:40----------
like the idea that i'll be hurting


---------156:42----------
someone


---------156:43----------
[Music]


---------156:44----------
like i'm okay


---------156:47----------
with the idea of spending the rest of my


---------156:49----------
life with someone like that part isn't


---------156:51----------
scary


---------156:52----------
the part that's scary is like it not


---------156:55----------
working out


---------156:56----------
and you have to have the conversation of


---------156:59----------
a divorce or a breakup


---------157:03----------
yeah so i i see that's where i think it


---------157:05----------
makes a lot of sense


---------157:06----------
toast i think i'm gonna once again


---------157:09----------
kind of like i think there's a tricky


---------157:12----------
thing right because when you've got one


---------157:13----------
foot out the door


---------157:14----------
part of the reason sometimes the reason


---------157:16----------
that people have one foot out the door


---------157:18----------
is so that they're not left in the room


---------157:20----------
when the other person leaves


---------157:24----------
and i'm i don't know if it's like bias


---------157:27----------
on my part but i'm hearing like this


---------157:29----------
theme of like uncertainty like among us


---------157:31----------
was everything nine months ago and like


---------157:32----------
i can't count on it


---------157:34----------
being there now


---------157:38----------
and and i i think it's tricky because


---------157:40----------
like there's something else that i'm


---------157:41----------
translating in my mind which is that you


---------157:43----------
care about other people and you don't


---------157:44----------
care about yourself


---------157:47----------
so like there it is again where it's


---------157:48----------
sort of like oh like you know my friends


---------157:50----------
come first other people come first i


---------157:51----------
don't want to hurt this person but like


---------157:53----------
what


---------157:53----------
what i think it's hard because what


---------157:56----------
about them hurting you


---------158:05----------
and i think this is why like you know i


---------158:07----------
asked you earlier would you let yourself


---------158:09----------
fall in love with someone and you said


---------158:11----------
no and that makes perfect sense to me


---------158:15----------
because as long as you're not in love


---------158:18----------
like they're not going to leave you


---------158:20----------
behind you're not going to leave the


---------158:22----------
nest one day


---------158:23----------
when you talk about a fear of commitment


---------158:25----------
i think it's i think it's weird


---------158:27----------
it's not that you're wrong here i think


---------158:29----------
it's just i'm sensing more than what


---------158:31----------
you're saying


---------158:32----------
which is that i think you genuinely are


---------158:34----------
like a really good person


---------158:35----------
and you try really hard to like protect


---------158:38----------
your friends


---------158:39----------
and care about people that you love but


---------158:41----------
i think like sometimes it's kind of hard


---------158:43----------
because


---------158:44----------
i don't think you let yourself feel the


---------158:47----------
same way about them that they do


---------158:48----------
that they feel about you because you are


---------158:50----------
a giga chad


---------158:52----------
and so they do fall in love and then


---------158:54----------
when you break up with them


---------158:56----------
because you've had one foot out the door


---------158:58----------
the whole time and they get confused


---------158:59----------
because they love you so much but they


---------159:01----------
can feel you pulling away


---------159:02----------
and then you feel bad because you can


---------159:05----------
see it happening and you can see


---------159:06----------
yourself


---------159:07----------
not being able to love them back and


---------159:08----------
then you like leave and then they feel


---------159:10----------
hurt


---------159:11----------
and then you're like oh my god it's


---------159:12----------
going to happen again because i can't


---------159:13----------
let myself love and you're damn right


---------159:15----------
it's going to happen again


---------159:17----------
until you let yourself fall in love bro


---------159:21----------
and that's going to be scary because if


---------159:23----------
you fall in love maybe you're going to


---------159:24----------
be in the room you're going to be


---------159:26----------
decorating you're going to be organizing


---------159:28----------
yourself


---------159:28----------
shelves and one day you're going to come


---------159:30----------
home and there's going to be no one


---------159:31----------
there


---------159:33----------
honestly i thought about this it's like


---------159:36----------
i


---------159:37----------
wish i sometimes secretly wish


---------159:40----------
i was in that position


---------159:43----------
after of being the one who's being hurt


---------159:48----------
i i think i would much rather


---------159:55----------
have a girl break up with me than me


---------159:58----------
breaking up with a girl because if the


---------160:00----------
girl broke up with me


---------160:02----------
and i'm sad about it that means


---------160:08----------
that means that you know


---------160:11----------
at least i cared a lot right


---------160:15----------
and it also means i didn't have to be


---------160:18----------
the one


---------160:21----------
you like be the one hurting someone else


---------160:25----------
yeah you're the one who's suffering


---------160:28----------
you're the one who's alone yeah because


---------160:32----------
are you are you good at being alone


---------160:34----------
toast


---------160:35----------
yeah i love being alone well not


---------160:38----------
not like love love but uh


---------160:42----------
there is some sense of comfort in being


---------160:44----------
alone


---------160:45----------
every night has there been a period of


---------160:48----------
your


---------160:48----------
life where you felt very alone but


---------160:52----------
even in a weird way sad but not sad


---------160:57----------
mmm like sadness feels normal


---------161:05----------
[Music]


---------161:14----------
um


---------161:18----------
i don't think so not like


---------161:22----------
sad sad but


---------161:26----------
more just irrelevant


---------161:29----------
yeah sounds like ninth grade jeremy


---------161:38----------
so i i know you're comfortable being


---------161:40----------
that like aside a relevant


---------161:42----------
you know is now i feel like i'm really


---------161:43----------
pushing you to accept what i'm saying so


---------161:45----------
that's a mistake but


---------161:47----------
i just love it if you think about it i


---------161:49----------
think like irrelevant is such a good


---------161:51----------
word


---------161:52----------
oh man it says so much right it's so so


---------161:55----------
much about your ambitions your legacy


---------161:58----------
the mark that you want to make on the


---------161:59----------
world


---------162:02----------
and i think this is where like i know


---------162:04----------
it's like i'm barking up the wrong tree


---------162:06----------
here but


---------162:08----------
i don't think you need to do anything


---------162:09----------
else to be relevant


---------162:11----------
toast and i know that's a good


---------162:15----------
perplexing to you so that's fine we can


---------162:16----------
just kind of agree to disagree there but


---------162:20----------
i think what you've accomplished in this


---------162:22----------
life is enough


---------162:25----------
i think you've had a very powerful


---------162:26----------
impact on a lot of individuals


---------162:31----------
and you'll say that too but you won't


---------162:34----------
accept it if i say it to you


---------162:38----------
uh


---------162:41----------
i feel like i haven't had the impact i


---------162:44----------
want


---------162:45----------
because the gaming scene is so small


---------162:48----------
like


---------162:48----------
it's true so it's it's growing but and


---------162:52----------
i i want to be at the forefront of


---------162:55----------
it um but


---------162:59----------
i am not satisfied with what i've done


---------163:04----------
yeah so i i i support you a hundred


---------163:06----------
percent in wanting to do more


---------163:08----------
if you feel like your work on this earth


---------163:12----------
is not complete yet and that you have


---------163:14----------
like something


---------163:15----------
more that you need to offer the world


---------163:18----------
then by all means go for it


---------163:20----------
like seriously i i support you 100


---------163:25----------
i sometimes worry that


---------163:31----------
that can come at the cost of yourself


---------163:36----------
and i know you're willing to pay that


---------163:38----------
price i know that helping other people


---------163:40----------
get brings you a lot of fulfillment so i


---------163:42----------
don't get the sense that you're like


---------163:43----------
sacrificing every day oh my god it's so


---------163:45----------
hard to be me


---------163:48----------
you know like you enjoy life like it's


---------163:50----------
good so i'm not saying it that way but


---------163:52----------
you know i think there's something to be


---------163:54----------
said of of


---------163:59----------
there's accomplishing something and


---------164:02----------
making the world a better place


---------164:04----------
is a wonderful thing and


---------164:07----------
that doesn't that's not the only thing


---------164:09----------
that makes you relevant


---------164:11----------
and that's where i think we diverge


---------164:14----------
which is fine


---------164:15----------
you know i'm okay with that


---------164:18----------
you okay with that um


---------164:22----------
yeah um i think it's just a streamer


---------164:27----------
mindset


---------164:27----------
like i know like everyone has


---------164:32----------
intrinsic self-worth but


---------164:36----------
i just happen to like


---------164:40----------
thrive in their industry that is


---------164:44----------
very


---------164:48----------
numbers based


---------164:51----------
and uh yeah so here's here's what i'd


---------164:55----------
kind of leave you with


---------164:56----------
um you know if you have additional


---------164:58----------
questions or anything let me know


---------165:02----------
i'd say that if at some point you decide


---------165:04----------
that you want to better understand


---------165:09----------
if you want to learn why you have one


---------165:11----------
foot in


---------165:12----------
the door and one foot out the door if


---------165:15----------
you want to work through some of those


---------165:16----------
anxieties that you have at the beginning


---------165:18----------
of the relationship i think that's


---------165:19----------
something that


---------165:23----------
can be done i i don't know exactly what


---------165:25----------
the follow-up is there i'm i'm not


---------165:26----------
saying you


---------165:28----------
i can do it for you i'm not saying that


---------165:30----------
you have to do it with me you can


---------165:31----------
definitely do with anyone you can do it


---------165:32----------
by yourself


---------165:33----------
you can do it with a friend but that's


---------165:35----------
the one thing that i can get behind you


---------165:37----------
in terms of like you not having


---------165:39----------
fulfilled your destiny yet and that


---------165:40----------
you're destined for something greater


---------165:42----------
100


---------165:42----------
i'm with you so be bigger do more


---------165:47----------
go outside of gaming i think it's like i


---------165:50----------
think you've got to do that i think it's


---------165:51----------
you're gifted and i don't know that


---------165:54----------
anyone else can


---------165:55----------
do what you're supposed to do


---------165:59----------
and at the same time if you're having


---------166:01----------
trouble in your romantic relationships


---------166:03----------
if you find yourself crossing 30 and


---------166:06----------
wondering maybe you do want to settle


---------166:07----------
down


---------166:09----------
and you find yourself like recognizing


---------166:11----------
that you're looking for short-term


---------166:13----------
things but that there's a part of you


---------166:14----------
that may want longer-term things


---------166:17----------
now you've got to be careful because


---------166:18----------
there's a part of your mind that is


---------166:20----------
going to tell you


---------166:21----------
that short-term things are better than


---------166:23----------
long-term things


---------166:26----------
and if i had to give you one piece of


---------166:28----------
advice toast it would be


---------166:30----------
be careful about what's better for you


---------166:32----------
and what you want


---------166:34----------
and be careful about your mind


---------166:35----------
convincing you


---------166:37----------
that's that what is better for you is


---------166:40----------
what you want


---------166:43----------
because those are actually two different


---------166:44----------
things


---------166:47----------
and as long as you believe as long as


---------166:50----------
you do what's better for you


---------166:51----------
i don't think i think it's going to be


---------166:53----------
really hard for you to fall in love


---------166:56----------
because love isn't better for you it's


---------166:57----------
[ __ ] dumb


---------167:00----------
it's foolish and it's dangerous and it's


---------167:02----------
risky and it can hurt you


---------167:04----------
and it can hurt them


---------167:08----------
but you know sometimes you got to make


---------167:09----------
that deck that's all legendaries because


---------167:13----------
it's not about making the best deck like


---------167:15----------
[ __ ] the meta


---------167:16----------
that's about the memes


---------167:25----------
maybe maybe one day if i feel like


---------167:31----------
with like mental health and stuff


---------167:34----------
just like coming on the show


---------167:40----------
like these conversation helped nudge me


---------167:42----------
in the right direction


---------167:44----------
but at the end of the day the subject


---------167:48----------
needs to you know they gotta


---------167:51----------
want to like fix something about


---------167:54----------
themselves so like


---------167:55----------
change their way of thinking right yep


---------167:59----------
so i apologized once for pushing you


---------168:02----------
because i felt like i was leading


---------168:03----------
instead of following i'm happy to do it


---------168:04----------
again i think you're right


---------168:07----------
i don't think you want to what i'm


---------168:10----------
saying is that if one day you change


---------168:11----------
your mind


---------168:14----------
you know and you're looking for some


---------168:16----------
kind of support


---------168:18----------
shoot me a dm just gotta send me a


---------168:21----------
message i'm ready to love dr k


---------168:26----------
uh yeah give it a give it a couple more


---------168:30----------
years


---------168:31----------
like i said once you cross 30 let me


---------168:33----------
know if you change your mind


---------168:36----------
because i don't think there's anything


---------168:37----------
wrong with what you're doing now for the


---------168:39----------
record


---------168:39----------
i think it's just if you decide that you


---------168:41----------
want to do things differently that can


---------168:43----------
have another conversation about it


---------168:46----------
and i apologize for imposing my own


---------168:48----------
value system it it took me a little


---------168:49----------
while to figure out where you were


---------168:51----------
where you are and that maybe where i


---------168:55----------
want you to be is like that's where i


---------168:56----------
want you to be but it's not where you


---------168:58----------
are and it's not where you want to be


---------168:59----------
which is like my mistake so i'm sorry


---------169:00----------
for that


---------169:01----------
no no worries yeah i think uh


---------169:06----------
i'm very stubborn like i am


---------169:10----------
very confident in the way i think


---------169:14----------
sometimes to a fault like to a point of


---------169:16----------
stubbornness


---------169:18----------
and uh


---------169:24----------
yeah oh probably it usually takes me


---------169:27----------
like


---------169:28----------
a while to slowly like


---------169:31----------
think about it from other angles


---------169:34----------
um but like conversation like this is


---------169:37----------
really helpful because it makes me think


---------169:39----------
you know let's maybe think about it from


---------169:41----------
another angle


---------169:42----------
just even as a thought experimentation


---------169:45----------
so yeah


---------169:50----------
think about love and relationships


---------169:54----------
a little more yeah one last thing is


---------169:56----------
think about do you have one foot out the


---------169:58----------
door or do you only ever put one foot in


---------170:01----------
i think you're right i do just put one


---------170:05----------
foot in


---------170:06----------
yeah so it it


---------170:10----------
all right so why won't you put put both


---------170:12----------
feet in


---------170:14----------
uh just think about it


---------170:19----------
too risky not to me but to the other


---------170:22----------
person


---------170:27----------
yeah i mean this anyway maybe we can


---------170:29----------
because then i i just


---------170:31----------
like i i want to wrap this up but it's


---------170:34----------
just


---------170:34----------
too juicy yeah you know you're baiting


---------170:38----------
me into playing a twisting nether before


---------170:39----------
you like


---------170:40----------
do something else it's like that's what


---------170:42----------
i feel like it's like


---------170:44----------
i'm gonna spend all my entire turn eight


---------170:46----------
mana to just wipe your board and it's


---------170:48----------
like


---------170:49----------
so juicy


---------170:57----------
this was a good talk yeah man


---------171:01----------
thank you very much um i you know i i


---------171:04----------
hope that this ends up okay for you you


---------171:06----------
know if you have any kind of negative


---------171:07----------
fallout or anything like that please let


---------171:09----------
us know


---------171:10----------
um so far knock on wood hasn't happened


---------171:12----------
yet but


---------171:14----------
you know sometimes people reveal things


---------171:16----------
people will troll them things like that


---------171:18----------
we'd love to help you clean up a mess


---------171:19----------
that we created


---------171:22----------
um and i'm sorry that i didn't quite


---------171:25----------
listen to you as well as i i could have


---------171:28----------
i don't know i i felt like you did fine


---------171:31----------
like


---------171:32----------
i think um part of like it's because


---------171:34----------
it's hard to


---------171:35----------
just like talk to a person and have like


---------171:39----------
to try and figure out certain things off


---------171:42----------
what you see online


---------171:43----------
so um i mean it didn't feel like you


---------171:47----------
said anything that


---------171:49----------
warrants any kind of uh second guesses


---------171:52----------
or apologies


---------171:53----------
i felt really comfortable okay


---------171:55----------
[Music]


---------171:57----------
yeah it was uh good times i like


---------172:00----------
i like talking about


---------172:03----------
dreamer life no so


---------172:07----------
i mean it doesn't have to be like a dr k


---------172:09----------
session


---------172:10----------
like if you ever want to just


---------172:13----------
have me come on and talk about like the


---------172:16----------
mindset of a streamer


---------172:17----------
or whatever so i'm always very open to


---------172:21----------
it


---------172:22----------
sure sure i'm hearing it you i'm hearing


---------172:25----------
you say you're open to it


---------172:27----------
but i'm confused about whether there's


---------172:29----------
an invitation there


---------172:31----------
or not uh i mean


---------172:35----------
i'm really lazy so


---------172:37----------
[Music]


---------172:38----------
i don't normally reach out but like if


---------172:40----------
you have


---------172:42----------
because i don't know what other like


---------172:45----------
segments you do


---------172:46----------
but if you ever do a segment that needs


---------172:50----------
a streaming expert or uh


---------172:55----------
anything that you think i would be a


---------172:57----------
good fit for


---------172:58----------
then yes i would be happy to come on and


---------173:02----------
give my two cents if you even want that


---------173:04----------
not that i'm inviting myself to


---------173:07----------
spread my ingeniosity around


---------173:12----------
i feel like this is another one foot in


---------173:14----------
the door one foot out the door kind of


---------173:15----------
thing


---------173:17----------
i just don't know what else you have


---------173:18----------
going on no so but but here's


---------173:20----------
here's i i i'm honestly toast i'm just


---------173:23----------
confused


---------173:24----------
so like do you think that we there's an


---------173:26----------
important conversation that needs to be


---------173:28----------
because i'm i'm i'm getting signals from


---------173:30----------
you but the words don't seem to be


---------173:31----------
matching up


---------173:32----------
so are what i'm hearing from you is that


---------173:34----------
there are a lot of important things


---------173:35----------
about being a streamer which need to be


---------173:37----------
talked about


---------173:41----------
is that correct yeah yes like


---------173:45----------
streamer problems like when some


---------173:47----------
streamers complain about oh yeah


---------173:49----------
i read a bad comment in chat and make me


---------173:52----------
really sad


---------173:52----------
i see them get like blackboard because


---------173:54----------
it's like bro you're making money


---------173:56----------
playing video games why are you


---------173:58----------
focusing on one negative comment when


---------173:59----------
there's so much positive comments


---------174:01----------
and like it just conditioned these


---------174:03----------
streamers to oh god better not complain


---------174:05----------
about anything then


---------174:07----------
um i like uh talking about those


---------174:11----------
stuff okay because my friends go through


---------174:14----------
it


---------174:14----------
and okay sure yeah okay i i


---------174:18----------
i understand now thank you for thank you


---------174:20----------

---------174:22----------
and and i i'm also hearing you also


---------174:24----------
there's another message that i'm hearing


---------174:26----------
in that


---------174:27----------
is that this isn't going to be a


---------174:28----------
conversation between dr k and jeremy


---------174:30----------
this is going to be a conversation


---------174:32----------
between


---------174:32----------
two streamers about mental health


---------174:35----------
related stuff


---------174:37----------
yeah yeah right it's a it's like


---------174:38----------
commentary about the industry as opposed


---------174:41----------
to a personal conversation


---------174:43----------

---------174:46----------
of the things i want to talk about


---------174:48----------
