---------00:15----------
we talked a little bit about how


---------00:17----------
relationships that are formed through


---------00:19----------
the internet are actually really


---------00:22----------
authentic and I think that that's an a


---------00:24----------
really amazing thing but it also shapes


---------00:27----------
what gamers become comfortable with


---------00:30----------
since they're used to being kind of seen


---------00:33----------
for themselves and not judged based on


---------00:35----------
their appearance or how much money they


---------00:37----------
have or the color of their skin when


---------00:39----------
they do move out into the real world


---------00:41----------
they start to get exposed based on those


---------00:44----------
qualities and they can feel like they


---------00:46----------
get judged very easily and that can


---------00:49----------
become really problematic so a lot of


---------00:52----------
times when people you know when people


---------00:54----------
don't have a lot of friends online they


---------00:56----------
get used to kind of moving into a into a


---------00:59----------
public area and being kind of


---------01:01----------
scrutinized by other people and you kind


---------01:04----------
of get used to that scrutinize ation and


---------01:06----------
that judgment I think what happens with


---------01:09----------
gamers is since they spend so much time


---------01:10----------
online that scrutiny starts to become


---------01:13----------
really uncomfortable for them and they


---------01:15----------
start to lose confidence in who they are


---------01:17----------
as a person and I know that I mean we've


---------01:20----------
talked a little bit earlier but I know


---------01:21----------
that a lot of you guys have trouble


---------01:23----------
moving with confidence in the real world


---------01:25----------
whereas you feel so much more


---------01:27----------
comfortable and so much more confident


---------01:30----------
when you're behind a computer screen and


---------01:31----------
so the more time you spend behind a


---------01:34----------
computer screen the less confident you


---------01:37----------
become in the real world and that can


---------01:39----------
really cause problems for relationships


---------01:41----------
especially romantic relationships and


---------01:44----------
one of the biggest problems that gamers


---------01:46----------
have with romantic relationships is that


---------01:48----------
they're they're gamers tend to give in


---------01:51----------
order to get and I'll explain what I


---------01:53----------
mean by that


---------01:54----------
so let's say that you're you're a gamer


---------01:56----------
and you know you spend a lot of time


---------01:57----------
online and then you're also a college


---------01:59----------
student and you meet a girl and you


---------02:01----------
think she's cute and you like her but


---------02:03----------
since you kind of don't have confidence


---------02:06----------
you sort of feel like oh you know you're


---------02:08----------
not as attractive as some of the other


---------02:10----------
dudes in the college or you don't have


---------02:13----------
quite as much money or you don't dress


---------02:15----------
as nice and so you kind of see these


---------02:17----------
deficiencies in yourself and you're


---------02:19----------
attracted to this girl so what do you do


---------02:22----------
as a gamer you end up trying to level


---------02:25----------
that playing field in your mind when


---------02:27----------
you're dealing with the girl you tend to


---------02:29----------
think


---------02:29----------
oh I I mean she's not gonna if I ask her


---------02:32----------
out she's gonna say no so what I need to


---------02:34----------
do is I need to get her to like me more


---------02:36----------
so that when I ask her out she's gonna


---------02:38----------
say yes so then what happens is a gamer


---------02:41----------
usually starts out sort of being


---------02:43----------
friendly right he doesn't ask her out at


---------02:45----------
the beginning but you start hanging out


---------02:47----------
with her and then you start doing stuff


---------02:50----------
for her like if she needs a ride because


---------02:52----------
it's raining or something like that you


---------02:54----------
give her a ride when she has trouble


---------02:58----------
like studying for things you tutor her


---------03:00----------
you buy her meals you start to be like


---------03:02----------
her this really nice guy and you start


---------03:05----------
to do things because you don't feel


---------03:06----------
confident enough to ask her out you


---------03:08----------
start to do things for her and all the


---------03:11----------
while in your mind this is towards this


---------03:13----------
goal of getting her to like you and so


---------03:16----------
you're investing all of this stuff into


---------03:18----------
this relationship with the hope that


---------03:20----------
you're gonna get something out of it and


---------03:22----------
so the help that you give her the kind


---------03:25----------
of kindness that you show her has this


---------03:27----------
ulterior motive and if you guys are


---------03:29----------
really honest with yourselves you'll see


---------03:31----------
that that's the case of getting


---------03:32----------
something back and what happens then she


---------03:36----------
ends up dating someone else and then you


---------03:38----------
resent that guy right and then she calls


---------03:40----------
you up one night and she's like oh like


---------03:41----------
the guy that I'm dating he's such an



---------03:44----------
and then you listen to her talk about


---------03:46----------
her boyfriend problems and then this


---------03:48----------
thought pops up in your mind well all of


---------03:51----------
those things that are wrong with him are


---------03:53----------
right with me I wouldn't treat you like


---------03:55----------
that I treat you like gold I'd respect


---------03:58----------
you and you start to think that how can


---------04:00----------
she not see that I'm the perfect person


---------04:02----------
because I do all of this stuff for her


---------04:05----------
and her boyfriend doesn't and so


---------04:08----------
then what happens is at some point all


---------04:11----------
of this stuff that you've invested in


---------04:12----------
the relationship and everything that


---------04:14----------
that you kind of put into this


---------04:15----------
relationship all of the sacrifices


---------04:17----------
you've made for her we're kind of


---------04:20----------
building up building up building up and


---------04:21----------
then you want something in return and


---------04:23----------
then what happens is is you ask her out


---------04:26----------
right you finally like you reach this


---------04:28----------
point where you can't take it anymore


---------04:30----------
and you ask her out and then what does


---------04:31----------
she do she says no I think of you like a


---------04:34----------
friend right that's the line I think of


---------04:36----------
you like a friend and this pisses gamers


---------04:38----------
off to no end it pisses the out of


---------04:40----------
you right because like you've been


---------04:42----------
friends


---------04:43----------
and you guys hate that and why is that


---------04:46----------
so resentful it's because you never


---------04:48----------
wanted to be friends owned and you


---------04:50----------
invested so much into this relationship


---------04:52----------
because you would you were afraid that


---------04:54----------
she was gonna turn you down at the


---------04:55----------
beginning and then you invest all of


---------04:57----------
this time in this effort in this money


---------04:59----------
into getting her to like you and then


---------05:01----------
she rejects you and that rejection is so


---------05:04----------
much more painful because you've


---------05:06----------
invested so much you spent the last year


---------05:08----------
of your life taking care of this girl


---------05:10----------
and then she turns you down and then


---------05:12----------
that makes you really really angry hurts


---------05:15----------
your self-confidence causes a lot of


---------05:17----------
gamers to be really resentful towards


---------05:19----------
women and causes a lot of the toxicity


---------05:21----------
that we see online in that toxicity that


---------05:24----------
hatred of women comes from a sense of


---------05:27----------
betrayal and a sense of regret in a


---------05:29----------
sense of like an investment that you've


---------05:30----------
lost and so that's really really toxic


---------05:34----------
and really dangerous and the worst thing


---------05:36----------
about that is after this happens to you


---------05:39----------
one time you feel less confident in


---------05:43----------
yourself and it becomes harder to ask


---------05:45----------
out the next girl so then what happens


---------05:47----------
is you repeat the whole pattern because


---------05:50----------
whereas before you know she had a 20%


---------05:52----------
chance of saying yes if you asked her


---------05:54----------
out now the next girl has a 10% chance


---------05:56----------
because you've already been rejected


---------05:58----------
once and not only were you rejected you


---------06:00----------
were rejected after you did so much for


---------06:03----------
that girl so the second time around


---------06:05----------
you're like okay now I have to do even


---------06:07----------
more to get her to like me and so the


---------06:09----------
second time around gamers invest even


---------06:11----------
more and what you guys do is then you


---------06:13----------
know you buy her flowers for Valentine's


---------06:15----------
Day as a friend and when she gets dumped


---------06:17----------
by her boyfriend and stood up you're


---------06:19----------
there you're the knight in shining armor


---------06:21----------
and you do everything for her and so you


---------06:23----------
invest and invest and invest in this


---------06:25----------
relationship but you're investing in it


---------06:28----------
with sort of the idea of her being your


---------06:30----------
girlfriend but you never make that clear


---------06:33----------
to her and so she kind of thinks of you


---------06:35----------
as a friend because you actually don't


---------06:37----------
ask her out at the beginning right


---------06:38----------
you're just like this nice guy and you


---------06:40----------
want her to see your value and so that's


---------06:42----------
really dangerous because you have to be


---------06:44----------
careful about whether you're someone who


---------06:47----------
gives to get and if you're giving to get


---------06:49----------
something in return


---------06:51----------
chances are that's gonna end poorly and


---------06:53----------
you're gonna resent that person for it


---------06:55----------
because in a sense they don't know


---------06:57----------
what you're doing right they just think


---------06:58----------
that you're a nice guy and that doesn't


---------07:01----------
entitle you to anything but it makes you


---------07:03----------
feel entitled because in your mind it's


---------07:05----------
an investment and you're looking at for


---------07:07----------
a return if you're doing something out


---------07:10----------
of the kindness of your heart that's


---------07:11----------
fine but if you're really doing


---------07:13----------
something out of kind the kindness of


---------07:14----------
your heart you shouldn't be expecting


---------07:16----------
something in return so one of the most


---------07:19----------
dangerous patterns that gamers can fall


---------07:21----------
into is this pattern of giving to get


---------07:24----------
and take a look at your interactions


---------07:26----------
with women and see if that's actually


---------07:28----------
what you do why are you so nice to them


---------07:31----------
to begin with why do you buy them dinner


---------07:33----------
and buy them gifts and spend so much


---------07:34----------
time like finding this perfect piece of


---------07:37----------
jewelry for a female friend of yours


---------07:38----------
it's because you've got feelings for her


---------07:40----------
if you've got feelings for her why don't


---------07:42----------
you ask her out it's because you're


---------07:44----------
terrified she's gonna say no and since


---------07:47----------
you're terrified you invest all this


---------07:49----------
stuff but that just leads to regret and


---------07:51----------
it turns into hatred and over time the


---------07:54----------
more that this happens and I've seen


---------07:56----------
this happen with a lot of you guys


---------07:57----------
several times each time it happens it


---------07:59----------
gets a little bit worse and a little bit


---------08:01----------
worse and a little bit worse and then


---------08:04----------
it's just really catastrophic so one of


---------08:06----------
the things that you guys have to


---------08:07----------
understand about relationships is be


---------08:09----------
honest with yourself about with a way


---------08:11----------
that you feel towards another person and


---------08:13----------
be honest with them and do it from the


---------08:16----------
get-go if they're gonna reject you they


---------08:17----------
may reject you and that's okay but the


---------08:20----------
chances that you know you invest


---------08:21----------
something and then magically they're


---------08:23----------
gonna wake up one day and love you are


---------08:24----------
actually really small and I know it's


---------08:27----------
painful to think about but see if you


---------08:29----------
fall into this pattern are you someone


---------08:32----------
who gives to get and if you are does


---------08:34----------
that have to do with confidence and if


---------08:37----------
it does have to do with confidence the


---------08:38----------
solution is not to give more the


---------08:41----------
solution is to work on your confidence


---------08:42----------
and a little bit later we'll talk about


---------08:44----------
how to do that
