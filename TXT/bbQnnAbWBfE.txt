loneliness and sort of meet other people


---------00:34----------
one thing to know about


---------00:35----------
group coaching is it's not really about

---------00:38----------
forming really authentic bonds with


---------00:41----------

issues with um work through your

---------01:00----------
no worries man so and what am i calling


---------01:03----------
you


---------01:04----------
uh you can call me nicholas or nick


---------01:06----------
whatever you prefer


---------01:08----------
okay so nicholas


---------01:12----------
um and so tell


---------01:15----------
so we're talking about loneliness today


---------01:18----------
um yeah well mostly uh emotional


---------01:20----------
loneliness not like a physical point


---------01:23----------
of view okay so let's start there what's


---------01:26----------
the difference between physical


---------01:27----------
loneliness and emotional loneliness


---------01:30----------
um well to me it's um


---------01:33----------
well you can have friends physically and


---------01:35----------
hang out with them but you can still not


---------01:37----------
feel the


---------01:37----------
connection always so then you


---------01:40----------
emotionally feel lonely because you


---------01:41----------
don't have anyone to maybe


---------01:43----------
talk to and really lit up with if that


---------01:46----------
makes sense to you


---------01:47----------
so yeah okay you get emotionally


---------01:49----------
isolated at that point


---------01:51----------
is what i feel like okay so can you tell


---------01:53----------
us what that feels like


---------01:56----------
um to me it feels a lot like


---------02:00----------
uh well you feel lonely of course you


---------02:03----------
feel like


---------02:03----------
you can't rely on anyone and you don't


---------02:06----------
really feel understood


---------02:08----------
on a lot of points as a person so you


---------02:11----------
feel


---------02:12----------
lonely and like you can't be understood


---------02:15----------
yes that's part of it um it's a lot to


---------02:18----------
do with the fact that


---------02:20----------
you don't yeah it's mainly just like


---------02:23----------
being understood by people on a on an


---------02:24----------
emotional level like on a deeper level


---------02:27----------
i guess you could say so so you it's it


---------02:30----------
sounds like you actually have kind of


---------02:32----------
people around you you have friends but


---------02:33----------
you feel misunderstood


---------02:36----------
definitely i don't i don't feel like um


---------02:39----------
like really really close with an


---------02:42----------
exception of like a few people


---------02:43----------
but i have a lot of friends that i don't


---------02:45----------
have like an actual connection with


---------02:47----------
if that makes sense okay so it's like i


---------02:50----------
don't feel like i can


---------02:51----------
rely on a lot of them on a deeper level


---------02:55----------
okay but it sounds like you do have a


---------02:57----------
few people that you sort of


---------02:58----------
rely on or can rely on on a deeper level


---------03:02----------
yeah more or less i don't really i don't


---------03:04----------
really talk to them


---------03:05----------
on a deeper level level a lot um


---------03:09----------
a lot of it is me myself in my own room


---------03:13----------
feeling myself being lonely if that


---------03:15----------
makes sense


---------03:16----------
um and then um to kind of explain it


---------03:19----------
better it has like two parts of it


---------03:21----------
it has the part where i feel like i


---------03:23----------
can't connect with a lot of people but i


---------03:25----------
also have like


---------03:26----------
i don't wanna call it anxiety but i


---------03:28----------
wanna i'm like scared right


---------03:30----------
so i'm scared of being alone later in


---------03:32----------
life or being like


---------03:34----------
forever alone if that makes sense


---------03:38----------
so it's like those sure combinations so


---------03:40----------
so


---------03:41----------
you're scared of being alone and what's


---------03:43----------
the second piece


---------03:46----------
um no the first piece is that i'm


---------03:48----------
currently feeling like


---------03:49----------
emotionally alone um which i tried to


---------03:52----------
explain earlier


---------03:53----------
yeah and then the second piece is kind


---------03:54----------
of me being scared for the future


---------03:57----------
that i won't have people uh to be with


---------03:59----------
both like plasonically and romantically


---------04:02----------
okay um have you been in a romantic


---------04:05----------
relationship before


---------04:07----------
yep that's been around four years ago


---------04:11----------
okay and do you mind if i ask how old


---------04:13----------
you are


---------04:14----------
yeah i'm 20. you're 20. okay yeah


---------04:20----------
and how long have you been feeling


---------04:21----------
emotionally lonely


---------04:25----------
for around three years maybe


---------04:29----------
okay and do you remember what you felt


---------04:33----------
like in your late teens like what


---------04:34----------
what changed um


---------04:38----------
well now it's something i have accepted


---------04:40----------
it's like a part of me now so it's not


---------04:41----------
something


---------04:42----------
i'm bothering to bother too much by um


---------04:45----------
but you've accepted that you're gonna be


---------04:47----------
lonely


---------04:48----------
no i'm accepted it's the feeling i have


---------04:50----------
uh okay so like you know yeah yeah


---------04:53----------
so basically during high school i


---------04:56----------
uh i was bought bothered a lot by the


---------04:59----------
fact that i felt lonely and that


---------05:01----------
my peers seemed way more popular than me


---------05:03----------
in all aspects


---------05:05----------
um which gave me insecurities and then


---------05:08----------
i went to a therapist like school


---------05:11----------
therapist


---------05:13----------
and she kind of changed my outlook and


---------05:15----------
stuff by saying it's all about the


---------05:16----------
attitude when you go to like parties etc


---------05:18----------
right


---------05:20----------
um so she tried to instill in me that


---------05:23----------
if you come in with a good attitude


---------05:25----------
compared to the bad one


---------05:26----------
you'll have more success in finding


---------05:28----------
friends and so on


---------05:29----------
um which you know did work in finding


---------05:32----------
friends but it doesn't really work for


---------05:33----------
me


---------05:34----------
on an emotional level if that makes


---------05:36----------
sense sure so


---------05:38----------
feeling it yeah interesting


---------05:43----------
can i think for a second nicholas sure


---------05:50----------
okay give me just another second okay


---------05:54----------
yeah no worries it's a good thing let me


---------05:57----------
ask you something did your feeling of


---------05:58----------
emotional loneliness get worse


---------06:00----------
the better you got at changing your


---------06:04----------
attitude


---------06:06----------
the um what i call anxiety or whatever


---------06:09----------
it is


---------06:10----------
got worse so whenever i had um


---------06:13----------
an episode of feeling extra lonely and


---------06:14----------
started spiraling in my thoughts


---------06:16----------
that would get worse a lot worse


---------06:18----------
basically what would get a lot worse


---------06:21----------
um the amount of times i would


---------06:25----------
feel like the feelings and the thoughts


---------06:27----------
would come up uh came more often than it


---------06:29----------
would


---------06:29----------
like be there for longer like the


---------06:31----------
episode and so that


---------06:33----------
that happened more the more you learn to


---------06:36----------
change your attitude in social


---------06:38----------
situations


---------06:39----------
yeah definitely okay so let's let's just


---------06:43----------
notice that for a second because that


---------06:44----------
sounds


---------06:45----------
i mean it makes perfect sense to me but


---------06:47----------
it sounds strange


---------06:49----------
right so like here you're seeing a


---------06:50----------
therapist and your therapist is telling


---------06:52----------
you hey if you're like


---------06:53----------
insecure about going to parties what you


---------06:55----------
can do is change your attitude


---------06:58----------
and then you can like learn to be like


---------07:01----------
more friendly and more positive


---------07:03----------
and as you become more friendly and


---------07:05----------
positive you'll be able to make more


---------07:07----------
friends


---------07:08----------
and you'll be able to go to parties is


---------07:10----------
that a fair


---------07:14----------
no i would say the way she wanted me to


---------07:16----------
think about it


---------07:18----------
is that if you change so um she had to


---------07:21----------
think about self


---------07:22----------
fulfilling prophecies right so if i came


---------07:24----------
in there thinking


---------07:25----------
oh um nobody would like me or nobody


---------07:27----------
cares about me or whatever


---------07:29----------
she would say that would you know rub


---------07:31----------
off to people


---------07:32----------
compared to if i came and being like hey


---------07:34----------
let's meet new people let's make friends


---------07:36----------
so she was saying she was basically


---------07:38----------
saying if i went to the party with a


---------07:39----------
more positive


---------07:40----------
attitude um i wouldn't feel


---------07:44----------
uh as judged or whatever you could call


---------07:47----------
it


---------07:49----------
okay and and that worked


---------07:53----------
yes well while it did uh i got more


---------07:56----------
friends


---------07:57----------
i was more confident although i am more


---------07:59----------
confident confident about going to


---------08:00----------
parties


---------08:02----------
but i also feel more disconnected


---------08:05----------
okay right so let's so this is going to


---------08:08----------
sound kind of strange


---------08:10----------
let me ask you nicholas what do you


---------08:11----------
think is how do you understand that do


---------08:13----------
you have any ideas as to what's going on


---------08:17----------
um kind of i mean to me


---------08:20----------
i think it's because most of the


---------08:22----------
relationships are kind of superficial


---------08:25----------
um and why are they superficial


---------08:28----------
what makes them


---------08:31----------
i'll say it's due to the fact that we're


---------08:34----------
only connected by


---------08:35----------
other friends and we don't actually like


---------08:38----------
hang out


---------08:39----------
and meet and interact you know what i


---------08:41----------
mean so we only


---------08:44----------
hang out superficially whenever there's


---------08:46----------
a reason to do it


---------08:48----------
we don't really support each other like


---------08:50----------
with feelings and whatnot because we


---------08:51----------
don't talk about it


---------08:52----------
that much at least um


---------08:56----------
so i feel like that's the main thing


---------08:57----------
because we don't really like support


---------08:58----------
each other


---------08:59----------
in that fact what keeps you from talking


---------09:02----------
about your feelings


---------09:04----------
um i have a strong feeling of


---------09:06----------
independence


---------09:07----------
and not really relying on each other or


---------09:09----------
other people


---------09:12----------
i would say anyways okay so i'm going to


---------09:16----------
talk about a theme for today


---------09:17----------
right it's how the solutions are the


---------09:21----------
problems


---------09:22----------
that's our theme for today sure


---------09:26----------
um so i'm going to try to explain this


---------09:30----------
concept for a second and then we're


---------09:31----------
going to see if how much of it applies


---------09:33----------
and how much of it doesn't


---------09:36----------
okay okay


---------09:39----------
so


---------09:42----------
if we think about people who have


---------09:44----------
problems in their relationships


---------09:46----------
they tend to hold on to old solutions


---------09:49----------
that


---------09:50----------
used to work so one of my uh


---------09:53----------
teachers once told me that the process


---------09:55----------
of growing up


---------09:56----------
is about getting rid of what works which


---------09:59----------
is kind of a weird way to think about it


---------10:02----------
but like let's say i'm a two-year-old


---------10:03----------
kid and i don't get what i want and then


---------10:05----------
i start crying and then maybe i'll get


---------10:07----------
what i want


---------10:09----------
right so like like two-year-olds have


---------10:11----------
certain ways to make their needs known


---------10:13----------
and get what they


---------10:14----------
are looking for and get their needs met


---------10:17----------
as we grow older ideally a two-year-old


---------10:20----------
will like


---------10:21----------
abandon some of those things because


---------10:24----------
even though it used to work it's sort of


---------10:26----------
not working anymore


---------10:28----------
but even like a 13 year old who throws a


---------10:30----------
temper tantrum


---------10:31----------
depending on the circumstances that they


---------10:32----------
grow up in will actually get that


---------10:35----------
their needs met through a temper tantrum


---------10:37----------
and they're also


---------10:38----------
20 year olds 30 year olds 40 year olds


---------10:41----------
for whom like


---------10:42----------
throwing temper tantrums is a way to get


---------10:44----------
their needs met


---------10:47----------
and if they end up like let's say you're


---------10:49----------
25 years old and you're used to throwing


---------10:52----------
temper tantrums because your parents


---------10:53----------
sort of tolerated that kind of thing


---------10:55----------
and then you start engaging in a


---------10:57----------
romantic relationship and you start


---------10:59----------
throwing temper tantrums


---------11:01----------
and depending on who you're dating


---------11:03----------
they'll either tolerate that


---------11:06----------
or they'll break up with you and when a


---------11:08----------
lot of people break up with you


---------11:11----------
that becomes sort of a relationship


---------11:12----------
problem right like it's there's some


---------11:14----------
problem that you have with relationships


---------11:16----------
and what i find time and again is that


---------11:18----------
first of all i start with the assumption


---------11:19----------
that like people aren't stupid


---------11:21----------
i also start with the assumption that


---------11:23----------
people aren't like broken in some way


---------11:25----------
i think for the most part most people


---------11:27----------
out there like have


---------11:29----------
brains and bodies and minds that are


---------11:31----------
functioning the best way that they know


---------11:33----------
now right if you think about like you


---------11:36----------
know your body like


---------11:37----------
most people's hands work pretty well


---------11:39----------
most people's eyes work pretty well this


---------11:40----------
is a really crazy thing most people's


---------11:42----------
minds work pretty well they do exactly


---------11:44----------
what they're designed to do


---------11:46----------
but they do know do the best that they


---------11:47----------
know how


---------11:49----------
so what i'm noticing any questions about


---------11:51----------
that


---------11:53----------
no that makes sense okay so it's kind of


---------11:55----------
weird right because you went to this


---------11:56----------
therapist


---------11:57----------
and your therapist like taught you this


---------11:59----------
like positive mental attitude strategy


---------12:02----------
and what we're hearing is actually a lot


---------12:04----------
of success we're hearing that you were


---------12:06----------
able to go to parties


---------12:07----------
that you were able to make friends that


---------12:09----------
you changed your attitude and you feel


---------12:12----------
confident and comfortable


---------12:13----------
interacting with other people whereas in


---------12:15----------
high school you didn't really feel that


---------12:16----------
way so that's a success


---------12:18----------
right right yeah and at the same time


---------12:21----------
i asked you kind of a weird question


---------12:23----------
because if this is a success


---------12:25----------
i asked you the question have you found


---------12:27----------
that


---------12:28----------
the better you got at this the more


---------12:30----------
emotionally isolated you feel


---------12:33----------
and your answer was what um yeah


---------12:36----------
correct so like let's try to think about


---------12:39----------
how does that happen


---------12:40----------
like what's going on there so


---------12:43----------
my sense is that this worked for you but


---------12:46----------
what you learned how to do


---------12:48----------
was like put on a certain kind of


---------12:52----------
clothing


---------12:53----------
like you put on this mental clothing of


---------12:55----------
like i'm gonna have a positive mental


---------12:57----------
attitude


---------12:58----------
and then you started to be someone that


---------13:00----------
you're not exactly


---------13:02----------
like you started to take parts of


---------13:03----------
yourself like you had these insecurities


---------13:05----------
right and then what you did is you like


---------13:07----------
buried those insecurities underneath


---------13:10----------
this like positive mental attitude


---------13:12----------
and as a result the most connected that


---------13:16----------
someone can get to you


---------13:17----------
is halfway because the most they ever


---------13:20----------
see


---------13:21----------
is like the positive part and then what


---------13:24----------
you're here what i'm hearing from you is


---------13:25----------
that like you you


---------13:26----------
you don't have a deeper emotional


---------13:28----------
connection with people


---------13:29----------
and that's sort of because like i think


---------13:31----------
you approach it from sort of a


---------13:33----------
hey let's like hang out and like let's


---------13:34----------
meet people and let's have a good time


---------13:37----------
and so you project that side of yourself


---------13:39----------
which is a good side and people kind of


---------13:41----------
like that and they're like hey like


---------13:42----------
nicholas is a pretty cool guy


---------13:44----------
but it never gets to something serious


---------13:46----------
because all the serious stuff has been


---------13:47----------
kind of pushed away what do you think


---------13:50----------
i can definitely agree with that um


---------13:52----------
mainly to do with all of my good friends


---------13:54----------
that i do rely on every now and then are


---------13:56----------
from you know before high school mainly


---------13:59----------
so you know back from when i was 14 and


---------14:02----------
10 and under


---------14:03----------
stuff like that so so yeah so let's


---------14:06----------
think about


---------14:06----------
who did they get to know um


---------14:10----------
well yeah definitely the more uh


---------14:12----------
connected or like


---------14:13----------
true part of myself i guess you could


---------14:15----------
call it i just know actual true part of


---------14:17----------
oneself but you know


---------14:19----------
why not what does that mean well um


---------14:22----------
i just have to think that you always


---------14:23----------
project one side of you to everyone


---------14:25----------
you don't always reject like the whole


---------14:28----------
side of yourself


---------14:29----------
no matter who you're with i feel like


---------14:33----------
just um because you know like when when


---------14:35----------
as you talked about the mastering when


---------14:37----------
you go to


---------14:38----------
like a sports club or whatever you put


---------14:40----------
on one side of yourself when you go to a


---------14:41----------
class you put on another site so on and


---------14:42----------
so forth


---------14:44----------
um so i feel like with


---------14:47----------
my older friends they definitely got to


---------14:49----------
know me better


---------14:50----------
on a more all-around standpoint but


---------14:54----------
i don't think there's anyone that like


---------14:56----------
really


---------14:58----------
you know know that for me not even


---------15:00----------
myself


---------15:01----------
so do you want them to know the for you


---------15:05----------
um no why not i don't think so


---------15:09----------
because i think there's some things i


---------15:11----------
want to keep private for myself


---------15:14----------
um just for the fact that there's some


---------15:16----------
things i feel like that


---------15:18----------
that shouldn't be shared to other people


---------15:21----------
um it doesn't have to be anything


---------15:23----------
sensitive just um


---------15:25----------
it could be hobbies it could be


---------15:29----------
um just your alone time in general


---------15:30----------
honestly it could be your own those


---------15:32----------
secrets or


---------15:33----------
promises to yourself but i think it


---------15:36----------
depends from person to person mean so i


---------15:40----------
totally get that things are


---------15:41----------
personal right i'm still a little bit


---------15:45----------
curious about


---------15:46----------
it seems like you feel like they


---------15:48----------
shouldn't be shared


---------15:52----------
no i'm not saying that necessarily it's


---------15:55----------
just my


---------15:55----------
um i'm just saying me personally would


---------15:58----------
rather


---------15:59----------
not share everything something someone


---------16:01----------
just wants to keep


---------16:02----------
yeah and are there things that you want


---------16:06----------
to share but you haven't been able to


---------16:10----------
definitely yeah um like now like the


---------16:12----------
emotional and


---------16:13----------
and every time i felt depressed like in


---------16:15----------
previous times in high school


---------16:17----------
uh i couldn't for example always talk to


---------16:19----------
my parents because i wasn't comfortable


---------16:21----------
with it


---------16:22----------
um stuff like that you know so you


---------16:24----------
weren't comfortable with it what does


---------16:25----------
that mean


---------16:27----------
um the reason why i wasn't comfortable


---------16:29----------
with it


---------16:30----------
is due to my mother being very uh


---------16:34----------
like she blames herself a lot for a lot


---------16:36----------
of things so i felt like if i told her


---------16:38----------
she would


---------16:39----------
be upset about it um so that's the


---------16:42----------
reason


---------16:42----------
and also just the fact that i wasn't


---------16:44----------
comfortable sharing things about myself


---------16:46----------
in general at that point in time


---------16:48----------
i was very like isolated so


---------16:53----------
so nicholas those two combinations what


---------16:56----------
are you afraid is going to happen if


---------16:58----------
people see who you are


---------17:01----------
um i'm afraid that people will leave


---------17:05----------
like for good physically and emotionally


---------17:09----------
does that happen to you before yes


---------17:12----------
a long time ago though i was


---------17:16----------
14 i believe where i had like a lot of


---------17:19----------
friends that were just


---------17:20----------
from my knowledge randomly leave without


---------17:22----------
any actual reason


---------17:25----------
and what's can you tell us about that


---------17:29----------
um so i had a combination of online


---------17:32----------
friends and real-life friends


---------17:34----------
that sometimes would just like cut me


---------17:36----------
off and


---------17:37----------
just stop talking from that point um


---------17:40----------
which seemed to me at that point that we


---------17:42----------
were in good terms


---------17:43----------
so it didn't really make sense to me um


---------17:46----------
so that's where like


---------17:48----------
basically a lot of it stems from i think


---------17:51----------
i think so too


---------17:52----------
yeah so i feel like a lot of it at least


---------17:55----------
afterwards at that point


---------17:57----------
which i do know is that i i shrugged


---------17:59----------
myself in


---------18:00----------
and didn't trust a lot of people um and


---------18:03----------
then they kind of


---------18:03----------
kind of came over and started trusting


---------18:05----------
people again and talking to people but i


---------18:07----------
never really


---------18:09----------
you know fully opened myself up anymore


---------18:11----------
afterwards i think you started talking


---------18:13----------
to people again i don't think you


---------18:14----------
started trusting people


---------18:16----------
right what can you tell us


---------18:20----------
uh can you tell us a story about when


---------18:21----------
you were 14 like give us an example


---------18:23----------
like help me understand what that what


---------18:25----------
happened


---------18:27----------
um it's it's kind of hard to


---------18:32----------
i mean not to talk about but to explain


---------18:34----------
um


---------18:36----------
basically so i had a few friends that i


---------18:38----------
talked to almost every day


---------18:40----------
um and i don't know there's not much to


---------18:43----------
talk about


---------18:44----------
except for the fact that i was just


---------18:45----------
caught off completely one day


---------18:47----------
from all of them or one of them no it's


---------18:50----------
just a few of them like a few of my


---------18:51----------
friends


---------18:53----------
over a period of time i think it's


---------18:55----------
around like half a year


---------18:56----------
just like disappeared um and they didn't


---------18:59----------
really know each other so i'm not sure


---------19:00----------
how


---------19:00----------
like it happened but just um some


---------19:04----------
important people left me


---------19:05----------
like after each other basically and


---------19:09----------
how did they how did they cut you off


---------19:11----------
like like how did that happen


---------19:14----------
like that you know they uh blocked me on


---------19:16----------
social media they didn't reply to


---------19:18----------
messages they stopped


---------19:19----------
hanging out with me in that sense


---------19:22----------
interesting so these are real life


---------19:24----------
friends let's like just about just


---------19:27----------
both both a real life person and a few


---------19:29----------
online yeah


---------19:30----------
can we just pick one and kind of go


---------19:32----------
through the sequence of events


---------19:36----------
um sure i'm trying to feel like uh


---------19:39----------
i'm trying to find if there's any theme


---------19:42----------
um


---------19:43----------
so what happens is that huh nicholas i i


---------19:46----------
don't want a theme and i don't want a


---------19:48----------
conclusion


---------19:49----------
i want as raw of a data as you can


---------19:52----------
provide


---------19:53----------
so as unfiltered as you can give me like


---------19:55----------
tell me you know think about like just


---------19:57----------
like pick one person and then you kind


---------19:58----------
of said they blocked you on social media


---------20:00----------
and stuff like that so


---------20:01----------
were these people that you knew at


---------20:02----------
school


---------20:05----------
um no mostly online friends some of them


---------20:07----------
are my later on though


---------20:08----------
but mostly only friends so that i came


---------20:10----------
to know online friends and like how did


---------20:12----------
you know them online did you guys play


---------20:13----------
games together like what was the deal


---------20:16----------
some of them i played games with uh and


---------20:18----------
others i just met on this


---------20:20----------
uh social media app called meow chat


---------20:22----------
which is not you know available anymore


---------20:24----------
okay um server shutdown or something i'm


---------20:27----------
not sure about anyways


---------20:28----------
it's like basically an app like discord


---------20:30----------
but you can meet random random people


---------20:32----------
okay um some of them i happened later


---------20:35----------
one of them became my girlfriend


---------20:36----------
afterwards um not my current girlfriend


---------20:39----------
but like


---------20:40----------
at the time um


---------20:43----------
and yeah so we i talked to them there


---------20:46----------
and then a lot of them


---------20:47----------
they didn't know each other a lot of


---------20:48----------
them started cutting me off after like


---------20:50----------
half a year i think it was


---------20:52----------
a half a year year's time um


---------20:56----------
and one of them also


---------20:59----------
like basically one of them states that


---------21:01----------
they couldn't use the phone


---------21:02----------
and then i found out they had the phone


---------21:03----------
later on to you know chat on


---------21:06----------
and then you know i was blocked later


---------21:09----------
how did you find that out


---------21:12----------
they had an alternate account


---------21:15----------
and how did you feel when you found out


---------21:19----------
they were lying to you


---------21:21----------
i felt betrayed to put it simple pretty


---------21:24----------
much yeah


---------21:26----------
what do you mean by betrayed um like


---------21:29----------
they


---------21:30----------
they betrayed my trust basically and


---------21:33----------
uh the friendship we had at the time how


---------21:36----------
did they betray it


---------21:38----------
um well like you said lying to me uh


---------21:42----------
by trying to get out of the relationship


---------21:45----------
we had like


---------21:46----------
the friendship um without an actual


---------21:49----------
reason without telling me why or what's


---------21:51----------
going on or anything like no


---------21:52----------
communication whatsoever


---------21:54----------
um so i think that is what kind of


---------21:58----------
struck me so i'm i'm envisioning that


---------22:02----------
you sort of


---------22:03----------
started to be afraid that there's


---------22:05----------
something wrong with you


---------22:07----------
right yeah i guess you could say that


---------22:09----------
that is um


---------22:11----------
sorry go ahead um no um one of the


---------22:15----------
themes i have when i


---------22:16----------
when i get these episodes of feeling uh


---------22:18----------
lonely and


---------22:19----------
afraid is that i feel like something's


---------22:21----------
wrong with me but i quite can't


---------22:23----------
uh figure out what it is does that make


---------22:25----------
sense where does your mind


---------22:27----------
go yeah go ahead um it goes in a spiral


---------22:30----------
but it usually goes


---------22:32----------
towards the direction where i feel like


---------22:34----------
i don't deserve a lot of friends


---------22:35----------
and relationships is where it tends to


---------22:38----------
go towards


---------22:46----------
can i think for a second sure


---------23:02----------
do you have a sense of of why it is that


---------23:05----------
let's assume for a moment that that's


---------23:07----------
true that you don't deserve a lot of


---------23:09----------
friends


---------23:10----------
what do you think it is that makes you


---------23:11----------
not deserve a lot of friends


---------23:14----------
um that's what i never can't figure out


---------23:18----------
um so that's why i call it like an


---------23:21----------
anxiety even though it's not


---------23:23----------
you know diagnosed because none of the


---------23:25----------
thoughts that get makes sense


---------23:27----------
whatsoever like there's no logic in them


---------23:30----------
okay so i i i just spiraled towards it


---------23:34----------
and i can't figure out why that would be


---------23:38----------
the case


---------23:39----------
i'm just looking at trends in the fact


---------23:42----------
that you know


---------23:44----------
my friends seem to be more popular and i


---------23:46----------
lost friends and stuff like that if that


---------23:48----------
makes sense


---------23:49----------
so i want to ask you something nicholas


---------23:51----------
or i'm going to make an observation


---------23:53----------
actually sure so i want you to notice


---------23:55----------
that a lot of times


---------23:56----------
when we have a feeling our mind tries to


---------24:00----------
come up with


---------24:01----------
reasons which is what it's supposed to


---------24:03----------
do


---------24:04----------
so let's say that i'm walking barefoot


---------24:07----------
and i feel something poke my foot


---------24:10----------
so what do i do i i notice that


---------24:12----------
sensation i have a feeling of stepping


---------24:14----------
on something


---------24:15----------
sharp and then i lift up my foot and i


---------24:17----------
look at my foot


---------24:19----------
and i look at the ground does that make


---------24:21----------
sense


---------24:22----------
i look for a reason why


---------24:25----------
i feel a certain way


---------24:29----------
does that make sense that makes a lot of


---------24:30----------
sense yeah so like let's say i'm in a


---------24:32----------
relationship


---------24:33----------
and i have a feeling that my partner is


---------24:36----------
cheating on me


---------24:37----------
then what i do is i go look for reasons


---------24:39----------
i start checking their phone


---------24:41----------
i start texting them i start asking


---------24:44----------
around


---------24:44----------
i look for a reason to explain a feeling


---------24:50----------
and what i'm hearing from you is that


---------24:52----------
you have a fee


---------24:53----------
and you have a feeling but you haven't


---------24:55----------
been able to find a reason


---------24:58----------
definitely yeah and you're still looking


---------25:00----------
for ways


---------25:02----------
yes what do you think about that


---------25:06----------
um that is


---------25:10----------
i don't know i i can't collect my


---------25:12----------
thoughts on exactly that


---------25:14----------
i feel anything if anything i feel


---------25:16----------
scared um yep


---------25:19----------
so i think the more you look for a


---------25:21----------
reason


---------25:22----------
and the more you're unable to find one


---------25:24----------
what does that do to your fear


---------25:27----------
uh accelerates it i would say absolutely


---------25:30----------
right


---------25:31----------
because you're like oh my god there's


---------25:32----------
something wrong and i can't find it


---------25:34----------
and it's big and it's bad and i'm


---------25:36----------
looking and i'm looking and i'm looking


---------25:38----------
and i can't find it and if i can't find


---------25:40----------
it i can't fix it


---------25:43----------
and if i can't fix it i'm going to be


---------25:46----------
alone


---------25:47----------
because whatever it is is going to pop


---------25:49----------
up again and it's going to drive people


---------25:51----------
away


---------25:52----------
yes that would be the case okay


---------26:01----------
do you think that kind of encapsulates


---------26:03----------
how you feel


---------26:06----------
uh yeah actually i would say it is um


---------26:10----------
yeah because that would count both


---------26:12----------
platonically and momentarily


---------26:13----------
yeah okay


---------26:17----------
so i want to talk to you for a second


---------26:18----------
about something called psychosis


---------26:20----------
okay and i realize this is kind of weird


---------26:22----------
i'm not trying to judge you


---------26:24----------
yeah have you heard this term psychosis


---------26:28----------
i have but i'm not quite sure of the


---------26:30----------
definition of it okay


---------26:32----------
so like do you know what the word


---------26:33----------
paranoia means


---------26:35----------
yeah okay so i i don't think you're


---------26:38----------
psychotic i don't think you're paranoid


---------26:39----------
or anything like that


---------26:40----------
the the reason i'm bringing it up is


---------26:42----------
because sometimes if we want to try to


---------26:44----------
understand how something works


---------26:46----------
we have to look at


---------26:50----------
a malfunction of that object


---------26:53----------
so for example if i'm trying to figure


---------26:55----------
out what a tire does


---------26:57----------
on a car if i


---------27:00----------
slash the tire and let the air out then


---------27:02----------
i quickly figure out oh


---------27:04----------
this is the function of the tire does


---------27:05----------
that make sense


---------27:07----------
if we break like some piece like if i


---------27:09----------
unplug my mouse like if i don't know


---------27:11----------
what controls my computer and then i


---------27:14----------
unplug my mouse i can quickly figure out


---------27:16----------
okay the keyboard controls this and the


---------27:17----------
mouse controls this does that make sense


---------27:19----------
so we can discover the function


---------27:21----------
of something by looking at a case of


---------27:24----------
malfunction


---------27:25----------
with me yeah so i want to use psychosis


---------27:29----------
to illustrate


---------27:30----------
a general principle of the mind that


---------27:32----------
applies to everyone


---------27:34----------
but when we look at psychosis we'll kind


---------27:36----------
of see how that function of the mind


---------27:38----------
works because we'll look at like


---------27:40----------
a version that's kind of busted so


---------27:43----------
sometimes people


---------27:44----------
have um paranoia and it's sort of like


---------27:48----------
an


---------27:49----------
it's like a illness or like it's it's a


---------27:52----------
malfunction of paranoia


---------27:54----------
so what happens is that you know


---------27:55----------
sometimes people with psychosis they'll


---------27:57----------
wake up one day and they feel like


---------27:58----------
they're being watched


---------28:00----------
they have a feeling i'm being watched in


---------28:03----------
the same way that you have a feeling


---------28:04----------
that something is wrong with you


---------28:05----------
you just wake up one day and you're like


---------28:07----------
i've got i'm a feeling i have a feeling


---------28:09----------
that something's being watched


---------28:10----------
so then what happens is their logical


---------28:12----------
mind starts to try to figure things out


---------28:14----------
like okay where like who's watching me


---------28:16----------
and they look around and they're like oh


---------28:18----------
well i have like these two webcams here


---------28:20----------
and so like that must be what's watching


---------28:22----------
me so what they do is they unplug their


---------28:25----------
webcams


---------28:25----------
and they like feel better for a day and


---------28:27----------
then they wake up the next day and


---------28:29----------
they're like okay i feel like i'm being


---------28:30----------
watched


---------28:31----------
like i took care of the webcams like


---------28:34----------
what else is going on oh must be someone


---------28:36----------
maybe someone's looking at me through


---------28:37----------
the windows so then what they do is they


---------28:40----------
like they


---------28:41----------
close up all the windows and then


---------28:44----------
they're like feel better for a day and


---------28:45----------
the next day they wake up and they're


---------28:46----------
like i feel like i'm being watched


---------28:48----------
and they're like not really sure what's


---------28:50----------
going on so then they walk down the


---------28:51----------
street


---------28:52----------
and sure enough there's someone looking


---------28:53----------
at them they're walking down the street


---------28:56----------
and there's someone walking the other


---------28:58----------
way and like that person's kind of


---------29:00----------
watching


---------29:02----------
and then they go and they're they drive


---------29:04----------
around and they see like their


---------29:05----------
cars like they make a right turn and


---------29:07----------
someone else makes a right turn


---------29:09----------
and they're like oh my god maybe i'm


---------29:10----------
being followed


---------29:13----------
and this goes on for a while and then


---------29:14----------
like they they try to figure out okay


---------29:16----------
where is this feeling coming from who's


---------29:17----------
watching me


---------29:19----------
and then eventually like they start to


---------29:21----------
construct like really bizarre theories


---------29:23----------
so they start to think that like


---------29:24----------
it must be the government or the mafia


---------29:27----------
because they think


---------29:28----------
who has the resources to be constantly


---------29:31----------
watching me


---------29:32----------
and the best answer that they can come


---------29:34----------
up with is like a powerful organization


---------29:38----------
but what i want to point out is like


---------29:41----------
you know which comes first the thought


---------29:42----------
or the feeling


---------29:45----------
the feeling and the thought is always


---------29:48----------
looking for an answer does that make


---------29:50----------
sense


---------29:52----------
yeah and so the the really interesting


---------29:55----------
thing is that's the way our mind is


---------29:56----------
wired though because like when we step


---------29:58----------
on something we have a feeling and then


---------30:01----------
our mind has evolved to be like hey


---------30:03----------
let's try to figure out where this


---------30:04----------
feeling comes from


---------30:07----------
like that's what our mind does it's like


---------30:09----------
it tries to explain


---------30:10----------
our feelings because our feelings tend


---------30:13----------
to be like


---------30:14----------
you know intuitive like warning signs or


---------30:17----------
like i mean there's a lot of


---------30:19----------
important stuff in feelings if i walk


---------30:21----------
into a room


---------30:22----------
and i make eye contact with someone and


---------30:24----------
then i have butterflies in my stomach


---------30:25----------
and i start to feel sweaty


---------30:27----------
and i start giggling like an idiot like


---------30:29----------
those feelings are telling me something


---------30:32----------
right so feelings are a really important


---------30:33----------
source of information


---------30:35----------
and then my mind tries to like piece


---------30:37----------
together what's going on with the


---------30:39----------
feeling


---------30:42----------
any questions so far no that makes sense


---------30:46----------
what makes sense about it um


---------30:50----------
the fact that we are you know we've


---------30:52----------
evolved to perceive stuff


---------30:53----------
and then make sense of it right so we're


---------30:55----------
using our senses yeah that makes a lot


---------30:56----------
of sense to me yeah yeah


---------30:58----------
but the thing is that feelings come


---------30:59----------
first


---------31:01----------
definitely right and and so like you


---------31:03----------
know you can walk into


---------31:05----------
um you know you can walk into your house


---------31:07----------
late at night and then like you get this


---------31:09----------
feeling that maybe you're in danger and


---------31:11----------
all the lights are off


---------31:12----------
and like that feeling comes from


---------31:14----------
somewhere and then you try to reassure


---------31:15----------
it you turn on the lights you look


---------31:16----------
around whatever


---------31:18----------
so in your case i think what could be


---------31:20----------
going on


---------31:21----------
is that you have a feeling that


---------31:23----------
something in you is busted


---------31:26----------
and that's not an inaccurate feeling


---------31:28----------
because


---------31:30----------
how else do you explain these people


---------31:33----------
ghosting you like there must be


---------31:35----------
something wrong right


---------31:37----------
but i i think what started to happen is


---------31:39----------
that feeling


---------31:40----------
has started to grow so much and develop


---------31:43----------
a life of its own


---------31:44----------
that your mind is doing all these


---------31:46----------
compensatory mechanisms it's like


---------31:48----------
starting to think about this and think


---------31:49----------
about this and think about this


---------31:51----------
and you can never find the answer for


---------31:53----------
what's wrong with you because i don't


---------31:54----------
think there's anything wrong with you


---------31:56----------
i think the reason that you feel like


---------31:58----------
something is wrong with you is because


---------32:00----------
people did treated you in a way that


---------32:02----------
made you feel


---------32:03----------
not valued yeah


---------32:06----------
but the thing is that feeling doesn't


---------32:09----------
come from the outside it comes from


---------32:11----------
their actions towards you


---------32:16----------
does that make sense sure yeah so like


---------32:18----------
let me give you just another example


---------32:20----------
so let's say i have abuse of parents if


---------32:23----------
my parents treat me like [ __ ] i'm gonna


---------32:25----------
go through life


---------32:26----------
feeling like i'm worth nothing


---------32:30----------
it doesn't actually mean i'm worth


---------32:31----------
nothing it just means that


---------32:33----------
the way that my parents treated me made


---------32:35----------
me feel like i'm worth nothing


---------32:38----------
and then as i go through life with that


---------32:40----------
feeling i'm gonna come up with all kinds


---------32:42----------
of compensatory mechanisms or solutions


---------32:44----------
to deal with it like i need to ask


---------32:47----------
people all the time like i have to ask


---------32:50----------
them like if i'm dating someone i have


---------32:51----------
to ask them every single day


---------32:52----------
do you love me true


---------32:55----------
because i need to hear it from them


---------32:56----------
because i don't believe it about myself


---------32:58----------
so i need reassurance do you love it


---------33:02----------
do you really love me do you really


---------33:04----------
really really


---------33:06----------
are you gonna leave me promise you me


---------33:08----------
promise me you'll never leave promise me


---------33:10----------
because i don't have faith or confidence


---------33:12----------
that this person wouldn't want to leave


---------33:14----------
me


---------33:15----------
and so your mind comes up with all these


---------33:16----------
things to try to account for it but at


---------33:18----------
the end of the day like


---------33:19----------
where does that person's lack of


---------33:21----------
confidence come from


---------33:24----------
well that would come from themselves


---------33:26----------
absolutely


---------33:27----------
right yeah do you think this applies to


---------33:31----------
your situation


---------33:35----------
yeah i would say yeah


---------33:42----------
i would say in a different way but it


---------33:43----------
applies more to the fact that i


---------33:45----------
um keep telling myself that i'm gonna be


---------33:48----------
lonely whenever you know


---------33:50----------
these thoughts come up and i just um i


---------33:52----------
can't stop that feeling of thought


---------33:54----------
from coming and then in that sense as


---------33:57----------
you said earlier i take the logic to the


---------33:59----------
fact that that might be something wrong


---------34:00----------
with me even though it's not an actual


---------34:02----------
fact


---------34:03----------
um so i think in that way it would apply


---------34:06----------
but you know yeah so


---------34:10----------
now we get to an interesting great point


---------34:12----------
so let me ask you


---------34:13----------
when you feel like you're gonna be


---------34:15----------
lonely what do you


---------34:17----------
try to do with that feeling


---------34:20----------
um whenever that happens i don't really


---------34:23----------
do


---------34:23----------
much about it i tend to isolate myself


---------34:27----------
and just be in my fields for the next


---------34:30----------
two hours three hours


---------34:31----------
and then after that i just kind of get


---------34:34----------
numb if that makes sense


---------34:35----------
okay that doesn't make sense so i think


---------34:37----------
you you kind of get like


---------34:39----------
mentally exhausted from the feeling yeah


---------34:42----------
i would say that yeah yep


---------34:43----------
right so like sounds like an overload


---------34:45----------
yep overload and then it's like


---------34:47----------
you know it's like a you know what a


---------34:49----------
blue screen of death is a bsod


---------34:52----------
um no okay so it's like when your


---------34:54----------
computer crashes


---------34:56----------
your ram overloads or something and it


---------34:57----------
just restarts


---------34:59----------
right yeah so like that's that i'm


---------35:01----------
hearing that happen with you


---------35:02----------
so let's think a little bit about do you


---------35:05----------
have any idea about how to move forward


---------35:07----------
from here


---------35:10----------
um i feel like it's a lot to do with um


---------35:13----------
accepting myself but i'm not sure how to


---------35:16----------
do that


---------35:17----------
right so that's the problem because it's


---------35:18----------
like everyone's like


---------35:20----------
accept yourself nicholas for who you are


---------35:23----------
and then you will be free and then


---------35:25----------
you're like how the [ __ ] do i do that


---------35:28----------
yeah you know it makes no sense from


---------35:30----------
it's basically like telling depressed


---------35:31----------
people not to be depressed you know


---------35:33----------
like no it's actually the opposite


---------35:36----------
that's why that's why they have trouble


---------35:38----------
with it because it's not telling them to


---------35:39----------
not be depressed it's telling them to be


---------35:42----------
depressed


---------35:44----------
not quite sure what you mean so


---------35:46----------
accepting yourself


---------35:47----------
is not if so if there's someone who's


---------35:49----------
depressed and we tell them to accept


---------35:51----------
themselves


---------35:52----------
are we telling them to be depressed or


---------35:54----------
not be depressed


---------35:55----------
no that's not what i meant i mean like


---------35:58----------
when you tell depressed people not to be


---------36:00----------
depressed


---------36:01----------
oh right yeah yeah yeah okay it's like


---------36:04----------
you can tell them just


---------36:05----------
just don't be depressed it doesn't work


---------36:07----------
and i can tell you


---------36:08----------
just accept yourself and you're like i


---------36:10----------
have no [ __ ] idea how to do that


---------36:12----------
excellent yeah okay so let me tell you


---------36:14----------
what accepting yourself looks like


---------36:18----------
give me a second okay sure


---------36:25----------
okay so when you meet someone


---------36:28----------
you show them a mask right


---------36:32----------
why do you show them a mask um


---------36:36----------
to be liked by that person i would say


---------36:39----------
be accepted by the person


---------36:41----------
yeah so so see this is this is the


---------36:43----------
problem right so your solution is the


---------36:44----------
problem


---------36:46----------
to be liked by them to be accepted by


---------36:48----------
them and when they accept you


---------36:53----------
you [ __ ] yourself because they're not


---------36:55----------
actually accepting you


---------36:56----------
who are they accepting well yeah my


---------36:59----------
husk basically yep yeah and so all of


---------37:02----------
your interactions


---------37:04----------
reinforce the idea that the only thing


---------37:07----------
about me that is


---------37:08----------
that is worth loving is my mask


---------37:12----------
yeah and so like the more people that


---------37:15----------
accept your mask


---------37:17----------
what happens to your emotional


---------37:18----------
loneliness


---------37:20----------
well it would get worse absolutely the


---------37:23----------
solution


---------37:24----------
is the problem so now let me ask you a


---------37:27----------
question


---------37:28----------
nicholas sure how do we change that


---------37:31----------
cycle


---------37:34----------
well in that case um it would be


---------37:36----------
stopping


---------37:37----------
like stopping yourself from putting a


---------37:39----------
mask on which


---------37:41----------
would that's easier said than done but


---------37:43----------
absolutely


---------37:44----------
yeah but go ahead


---------37:48----------
oh i was i was going to say basically um


---------37:51----------
not to enable yourself going that way


---------37:53----------
and try to


---------37:55----------
you know be yourself around more people


---------37:58----------
yeah so but we've made so that's very


---------38:01----------
different right because telling the


---------38:02----------
depressed person to not


---------38:04----------
be depressed in that case the person


---------38:06----------
doesn't


---------38:07----------
know how to do it they literally don't


---------38:08----------
know how to do it


---------38:10----------
but now we've come to a different


---------38:12----------
problem you know how to do it


---------38:14----------
it's just really hard yeah does that


---------38:17----------
make sense


---------38:18----------
like there's apples and oranges yeah


---------38:20----------
yeah


---------38:21----------
definitely okay right so like like now i


---------38:23----------
know this is gonna sound weird but this


---------38:25----------
is how you accept yourself


---------38:26----------
when you show yourself to other people


---------38:30----------
you have to that's you have to accept


---------38:32----------
yourself in that process


---------38:33----------
does that make sense you can't show


---------38:35----------
yourself to someone without


---------38:37----------
accepting who you are yeah


---------38:40----------
i can see that right so like i know it


---------38:43----------
sounds weird but that's how you do it


---------38:45----------
so what what that means practically is i


---------38:47----------
i think that like


---------38:48----------
there are going to be times where you


---------38:50----------
interact with other people where there's


---------38:51----------
going to be a part of you that says


---------38:55----------
you're going to have a thought or you're


---------38:56----------
going to want to do something or say


---------38:58----------
something


---------38:58----------
and there's going to be a part of you


---------39:00----------
that says nicholas don't do that


---------39:02----------
because if you say that they'll run away


---------39:05----------
you know which part i'm talking about um


---------39:09----------
well that would be the suppressed part


---------39:11----------
of me or like my actual


---------39:12----------
but i encourage you to look at your yeah


---------39:16----------
go ahead


---------39:17----------
yeah no um i'm not sure how to phrase it


---------39:20----------
uh


---------39:21----------
it would be the part over the my expect


---------39:25----------
expectations of others inside of me or


---------39:27----------
sure


---------39:28----------
sure yeah my point is i'm not sure i was


---------39:30----------
afraid the


---------39:31----------
mask has a cognitive component right so


---------39:35----------
when we call a mask you're not actually


---------39:36----------
putting on a mask what the mask is


---------39:39----------
is it's a set of thoughts that dictate


---------39:42----------
your behaviors


---------39:45----------
sure does that make sense so the thing


---------39:48----------
that if you want to accept yourself


---------39:49----------
what you have to do is notice those


---------39:51----------
thoughts that are telling you to not say


---------39:53----------
something


---------39:54----------
and then choose the other thing and


---------39:57----------
they're gonna say like so you have a


---------39:58----------
girlfriend now it sounds like


---------40:00----------
no no no no no okay um so


---------40:04----------
so you know like are there certain


---------40:06----------
things that we've talked about today


---------40:08----------
which you thought would be relevant but


---------40:12----------
you haven't shared because you're afraid


---------40:14----------
of judgment


---------40:16----------
um hold on i'm trying to think about it


---------40:20----------
um only thing


---------40:25----------
no no not really okay


---------40:28----------
yeah no just going okay can i um you


---------40:30----------
gotta


---------40:31----------
let me know if this is going overboard


---------40:33----------
okay but i'm just gonna ask you a


---------40:35----------
question


---------40:36----------
can we talk about why you don't have a


---------40:37----------
girlfriend


---------40:39----------
sure okay now my hope in talking about


---------40:42----------
why you don't have a girlfriend is that


---------40:43----------
you're going to have certain thoughts


---------40:45----------
about yourself


---------40:46----------
that the mask is going to want to cover


---------40:49----------
or certain feelings about yourself


---------40:51----------
right do you think that that's the case


---------40:53----------
if we talk about why you don't have a


---------40:55----------
girlfriend


---------40:57----------
i think it could be the case but not to


---------40:59----------
the extent you might think


---------41:01----------
okay so then give me something else


---------41:05----------
um the thing about this is that i've had


---------41:08----------
it for a while


---------41:09----------
so i've kind of come to accept it as a


---------41:11----------
part of me if that makes sense


---------41:12----------
that i just do it you know yep i


---------41:14----------
understand so that's why i want


---------41:16----------
something that's like


---------41:17----------
you know so let me put it this way you


---------41:19----------
know you said earlier that there are


---------41:20----------
some things that you


---------41:21----------
don't want to share with people because


---------41:24----------
they're private


---------41:25----------
so like let's pick one of those topics


---------41:28----------
and talk about it


---------41:30----------
um well this was one of the topics it's


---------41:33----------
not that i'm


---------41:34----------
honestly it's not because i'm afraid to


---------41:35----------
talk about it i just don't do it um


---------41:38----------
for the fact that i don't want to bother


---------41:39----------
people with it okay so what's something


---------41:41----------
that you don't want to bother us with


---------41:44----------
yeah well yeah this was one of them the


---------41:47----------
second


---------41:48----------
would be um my insecurity in


---------41:52----------
myself sometimes in my like the way i


---------41:54----------
approach people


---------41:56----------
which i feel like is a huge factor as to


---------41:58----------
why i don't have a girlfriend as well


---------41:59----------
um also my um


---------42:03----------
well what was i going to say also the


---------42:05----------
fact that i get depressed not diagnosed


---------42:07----------
which is like a huge


---------42:08----------
huge difference but everyone gets


---------42:10----------
depressed every now and then


---------42:11----------
which happens quite a bit um and all of


---------42:13----------
that kind of contributes to me you know


---------42:16----------
feeling it down a lot and i isolate


---------42:17----------
myself


---------42:18----------
um and then you know i just end up


---------42:21----------
getting those overlaps that talk to you


---------42:22----------
about nicholas i want you to show us an


---------42:24----------
ugly part of you


---------42:27----------
i want to see another i'm not sure how


---------42:28----------
to show that though i'm not sure what


---------42:30----------
like


---------42:31----------
what's that when you say that um


---------42:35----------
i don't know it's hard for me to do like


---------42:37----------
uh


---------42:38----------
when you say it i don't know what to


---------42:40----------
show you know


---------42:41----------
nothing really comes up if that makes


---------42:43----------
sense okay


---------42:45----------
so that's kind of interesting right so


---------42:47----------
that that leads to one of two


---------42:48----------
when i ask you to i want to see the


---------42:50----------
ugliest thing you've got


---------42:52----------
and that if you can't come up with


---------42:54----------
something what are the reasons that you


---------42:56----------
may not be able to come up with it


---------42:59----------
um could be the mask as you talked about


---------43:03----------
uh but um the other thing i'm not sure


---------43:06----------
about honestly


---------43:07----------
okay so one is that you've gotten so


---------43:10----------
used to suppressing it


---------43:11----------
that you don't even know how to find it


---------43:13----------
anymore i have another


---------43:15----------
wild wild idea what if you have nothing


---------43:19----------
ugly within you


---------43:20----------
and all you really have much like the


---------43:22----------
paranoid person


---------43:24----------
is a feeling that you're ugly and that


---------43:27----------
despite you look first what's ugly


---------43:29----------
within you you can't find anything


---------43:32----------
maybe what you just have is the feeling


---------43:34----------
of ugliness


---------43:36----------
yeah i could agree to yeah i could agree


---------43:40----------
um again as i mentioned at the start


---------43:43----------
uh whenever i feel this loneliness i


---------43:45----------
don't know why um and i think that's


---------43:47----------
connected with this because i can't


---------43:50----------
figure out any proper reason for me to


---------43:52----------
not


---------43:53----------
be lonely but it happens in a way yep


---------43:55----------
you know so


---------43:56----------
so i have a crazy idea it's just a


---------43:59----------
feeling


---------44:01----------
right it's not a truth there's nothing


---------44:04----------
broken


---------44:04----------
you're not ugly because i'm i'm telling


---------44:07----------
you man if you are ugly like that's cool


---------44:09----------
show us so that we can either accept you


---------44:12----------
or reject you


---------44:15----------
right and and


---------44:18----------
so i think this is also where acceptance


---------44:20----------
comes in i think you have to give


---------44:22----------
people the if you want so


---------44:26----------
nicholas this all comes down to your


---------44:28----------
sense of value


---------44:30----------
somewhere along the way you started to


---------44:32----------
believe


---------44:33----------
that you weren't worth very much


---------44:36----------
that people treated you poorly because


---------44:38----------
you weren't worth treating well


---------44:41----------
and like that's why you put on the mask


---------44:43----------
because people can't see the ugliness on


---------44:45----------
the inside


---------44:46----------
so you have to put on a mask because


---------44:48----------
what's down there is fundamentally ugly


---------44:50----------
and then you you say this a lot so like


---------44:53----------
you don't deserve a lot of friends


---------44:55----------
i don't want to bother people if we


---------44:57----------
think about those two statements what


---------44:59----------
that mean is that like


---------45:00----------
you're inconvenient like you're not


---------45:02----------
worth it


---------45:03----------
like you're not worth inconveniencing


---------45:05----------
someone else's day


---------45:07----------
it all comes down to value yeah now


---------45:10----------
here's the really tricky thing


---------45:11----------
as long as you keep a mask on your sense


---------45:14----------
of value will never


---------45:15----------
increase because the more you wear the


---------45:18----------
mask the more what they judge is the


---------45:20----------
mask and they don't judge you


---------45:21----------
and then you end up emotionally lonely


---------45:23----------
because you never get to connect with


---------45:26----------
someone


---------45:26----------
because all they connect with is a false


---------45:29----------
face that you put


---------45:31----------
yeah so the way that you connect with


---------45:34----------
people is by showing people now that's


---------45:37----------
hard


---------45:37----------
because i don't know that it's a


---------45:39----------
particular thing and maybe we can find


---------45:40----------
it maybe we can


---------45:42----------
but even if we can't find it what i


---------45:43----------
think you need is courage


---------45:45----------
because you have to you have to let them


---------45:47----------
look underneath the mask


---------45:48----------
and take the risk


---------45:52----------
of being hurt again


---------45:55----------
yeah but the only the only way that


---------45:59----------
you're gonna start


---------46:00----------
to have faith in yourself and the only


---------46:01----------
way you're gonna realize that you're not


---------46:03----------
ugly on the inside


---------46:05----------
is when you take off the mask you go


---------46:07----------
outside and then like people treat you


---------46:08----------
normally


---------46:10----------
and then the day that you start doing


---------46:12----------
that your life is going to be entirely


---------46:14----------
different because it's like holy [ __ ]


---------46:17----------
i'm actually a pretty cool guy people


---------46:20----------
actually like me they see me they know


---------46:21----------
me


---------46:23----------
and like maybe the reason that those 14


---------46:26----------
year olds blocked me is because they're


---------46:27----------
[ __ ] 14 and it's meow chat and the


---------46:29----------
internet is a weird place


---------46:31----------
maybe there's nothing fundamentally


---------46:33----------
wrong with me but you can't know that


---------46:36----------
unless you give people a chance


---------46:39----------
to reject you


---------46:42----------
right now the problem is that you're


---------46:44----------
never you're never putting anything on


---------46:46----------
the table like you're never


---------46:48----------
you're not giving people a chance to


---------46:49----------
know you that's why you're lonely yeah


---------46:57----------
i think um the hard part of it is to


---------47:00----------
to locate when exactly you put on the


---------47:03----------
mask


---------47:04----------
and then you know uh rejecting it or


---------47:06----------
putting it off


---------47:07----------
sure i'm not quite sure because yeah


---------47:10----------
because right now i've not really


---------47:11----------
thought about


---------47:12----------
putting the mask on more than what i


---------47:14----------
explained to you earlier


---------47:15----------
that the fact that everyone puts masks


---------47:17----------
on depending on the situation right


---------47:19----------
but i've never thought about it the way


---------47:21----------
you just put it um


---------47:22----------
so i don't think i know how when it's


---------47:26----------
there okay if that makes sense sure so


---------47:29----------
nicholas let me ask you


---------47:30----------
do you have a mask on right now possibly


---------47:33----------
i'm not i'm not entirely aware of it but


---------47:36----------
i think i do


---------47:36----------
yeah okay so what does that tell me


---------47:42----------
um that's something i can't


---------47:45----------
quite locate okay um yeah how does it


---------47:48----------
feel


---------47:49----------
how does it feel when i ask you these


---------47:51----------
questions and you can't answer them


---------47:54----------
uncomfortable and confusing good


---------47:57----------
perfect we're getting underneath the


---------47:59----------
mask


---------48:00----------
what feels uncomfortable about it tell


---------48:02----------
me about that discomfort


---------48:05----------
um i think the discomfort comes from the


---------48:07----------
fact that i can't answer


---------48:10----------
good so when you can't answer a question


---------48:12----------
that dr k is asking you how does that


---------48:14----------
make you feel


---------48:16----------
well yeah uncomfortable okay honestly it


---------48:18----------
makes me uncomfortable yeah


---------48:19----------
okay so there's what's uncomfortable


---------48:22----------
about it


---------48:24----------
it's uncomfortable about it because i


---------48:25----------
don't know why like the


---------48:27----------
the thing that i like because i don't


---------48:29----------
know it makes me uncomfortable because i


---------48:31----------
thought that


---------48:32----------
i kind of more or less knew why i had it


---------48:35----------
but this makes me a little bit


---------48:37----------
uncomfortable because i can't figure out


---------48:38----------
now


---------48:40----------
so how does how does someone who can't


---------48:42----------
figure something out


---------48:43----------
when they're being asked feel


---------48:47----------
uh well unknowledgeable or


---------48:51----------
stupid sometimes there we go so when you


---------48:54----------
say uncomfortable


---------48:55----------
do you mean stupid


---------48:58----------
um not entirely when i mean


---------49:00----------
uncomfortable it's just when i think


---------49:02----------
back


---------49:03----------
to all the times i've interacted with


---------49:05----------
people when i i don't know when i've had


---------49:07----------
the mask on then


---------49:08----------
yeah but i'm talking about right now


---------49:10----------
okay so so


---------49:11----------
you don't know when you've had the mask


---------49:12----------
on so i'm guessing so generally speaking


---------49:14----------
when i ask people questions


---------49:17----------
and they're not able to answer them and


---------49:18----------
they use the word uncomfortable what i


---------49:20----------
imagine they mean is that they feel dumb


---------49:22----------
because they don't have the answers


---------49:24----------
no that's not quite where i feel what do


---------49:27----------
you feel it's just


---------49:28----------
uh i want to say i mean i guess you


---------49:31----------
could call it stupid but not quite


---------49:33----------
uh is i feel more um surprised


---------49:37----------
in like in a bad way kind of like when


---------49:39----------
you get a shock right


---------49:41----------
um for the fact that i haven't known


---------49:43----------
about this because i


---------49:44----------
i feel like i know myself quite well um


---------49:47----------
but apparently i don't it doesn't make


---------49:49----------
sense yeah so so


---------49:51----------
so you feel like you should have figured


---------49:53----------
this out


---------49:54----------
yeah yeah i guess you could say that


---------49:56----------
yeah so now that's interesting


---------49:58----------
so i think like that too comes from your


---------49:59----------
sense of value


---------50:01----------
right so instead of just feeling stupid


---------50:03----------
oh this is gonna be hard nicholas okay


---------50:05----------
but i i wanna i want you guys to really


---------50:07----------
like pay attention to this


---------50:08----------
instead of just feeling stupid he's


---------50:11----------
blaming himself for


---------50:13----------
not figuring it out already and


---------50:16----------
that comes from the idea that you're


---------50:18----------
fundamentally you're not


---------50:19----------
worth it right like oh god this is so


---------50:21----------
hard i hope you guys understand this


---------50:23----------
because i can't explain it better


---------50:24----------
like the person who doesn't value


---------50:27----------
themselves


---------50:28----------
blames themselves for not knowing


---------50:32----------
something


---------50:32----------
when they learn something new


---------50:35----------
do you guys get that like you guys see


---------50:37----------
how that's his just it's his


---------50:38----------
like instead of just feeling dumb like


---------50:40----------
anyone else


---------50:42----------
he feels worthless because he couldn't


---------50:44----------
figure it out


---------50:45----------
he should have figured it out long ago


---------50:46----------
look at how dumb i am like look at how


---------50:48----------
worthless i am


---------50:49----------
other people would have been able to


---------50:50----------
figure it out but i can't figure it out


---------50:52----------
you guys see that it's all it's all like


---------50:56----------
spiraling out of this sense of lack of


---------50:59----------
work does that make sense to you


---------51:00----------
nicholas


---------51:01----------
that makes sense you're like blaming


---------51:03----------
yourself for not having figured this out


---------51:05----------
is that fair yeah it's not no it's not


---------51:08----------
fair it's not fair yeah but


---------51:10----------
yeah is it accurate i wouldn't say it's


---------51:11----------
fair it's accurate yeah yeah


---------51:13----------
right so but do you see how like i'm


---------51:15----------
just asking you a question and then what


---------51:16----------
your mind is doing is you're saying


---------51:17----------
oh i can't believe that i didn't notice


---------51:19----------
this before


---------51:21----------
like how dumb am i that that that is the


---------51:23----------
um feeling of australia


---------51:25----------
yeah right so like that too is a feeling


---------51:27----------
of value it's about a feeling of your


---------51:30----------
identity as a person it's not like i'm


---------51:33----------
dumb because i have low iq it's like i


---------51:35----------
should have figured this out like you're


---------51:37----------
beating yourself


---------51:37----------
up right so now i'm going to ask you a


---------51:41----------
different question nicholas here you are


---------51:43----------
being an idiot in front of us and


---------51:46----------
revealing


---------51:46----------
all of the things that you should have


---------51:48----------
figured out on your own


---------51:49----------
and how do you feel


---------51:52----------
um i feel nervous honestly and


---------51:57----------
i feel um


---------52:01----------
i feel like i should have done this a


---------52:02----------
long time ago with friends honestly


---------52:04----------
that's that's the two main feelings okay


---------52:07----------
so


---------52:07----------
so let's there it is again okay so now


---------52:10----------
i'm gonna ask you i should have done


---------52:12----------
this a long time ago with friends


---------52:14----------
tell me about that um


---------52:18----------
if i if i feel like if i've done it with


---------52:20----------
friends before


---------52:22----------
maybe the problem wouldn't have been as


---------52:24----------
profound as


---------52:25----------
as it is and so who's whose fault is it


---------52:29----------
that the problem is this bad


---------52:32----------
in that sense i would say it would have


---------52:34----------
been my own fault there you go you see


---------52:35----------
how your mind does that


---------52:37----------
your mind jumps to blame you


---------52:41----------
no matter like however i twist and turn


---------52:43----------
oh it's like oh


---------52:44----------
i should like you see do you really get


---------52:46----------
what i'm saying here


---------52:48----------
yeah i can see now what you mean i think


---------52:50----------
i do that quite a lot


---------52:51----------
yeah your mind jumps to this idea that


---------52:54----------
it's your fault


---------52:55----------
and why is it your fault because your


---------52:57----------
sense of value for yourself is low


---------53:00----------
it can't be someone else's fault


---------53:01----------
nicholas


---------53:03----------
when they stopped when they blocked you


---------53:04----------
whose fault wasn't nick


---------53:07----------
my fault there it is yeah yeah i see


---------53:11----------
i see


---------53:15----------
what do you see tell me


---------53:18----------
i see why um you know these feelings


---------53:21----------
kind of come up now


---------53:22----------
if i'm constantly putting myself under


---------53:24----------
the bus basically


---------53:25----------
exactly yeah you know that makes sense


---------53:29----------
right makes a lot of sense yeah it's


---------53:31----------
weird man but so here's the thing


---------53:33----------
i hope that you have some some kind of


---------53:36----------
hope at this point


---------53:37----------
because i certainly have hope for you


---------53:40----------
sure


---------53:40----------
yeah i mean i don't feel so here's the


---------53:42----------
thing i don't feel hopeless


---------53:44----------
um yeah because i felt progress and then


---------53:47----------
i've you know kind of like taken two


---------53:48----------
steps forward and then one back kind of


---------53:50----------
back and forth um what really gets me is


---------53:54----------
when i have


---------53:55----------
you know um those episodes of overload


---------53:58----------
because that then it kind of affects me


---------54:00----------
for like days at a time


---------54:02----------
but i feel like yeah so like


---------54:05----------
um let's say i get it and then i'm


---------54:07----------
feeling


---------54:08----------
lonely and anxious for like three hours


---------54:10----------
maybe


---------54:11----------
um and then i then i will feel numb for


---------54:14----------
like two days three days


---------54:15----------
okay and that's that's what really like


---------54:18----------
makes me feel lonely after that point


---------54:20----------
now what i'm not like everything else


---------54:22----------
you say still counts but this is what


---------54:23----------
like really hits me that's what i was


---------54:24----------
hoping to


---------54:25----------
kind of talk about yeah so i i know this


---------54:28----------
is going to sound maybe a little bit


---------54:29----------
disappointing nicholas but


---------54:31----------
i don't think you can do so much about


---------54:33----------
those overload states


---------54:35----------
right now sure i think the overload


---------54:38----------
states will get better


---------54:40----------
over time the more that you notice


---------54:43----------
and accept that there is a part of you


---------54:46----------
that is going to twist and turn and


---------54:48----------
blame yourself


---------54:50----------
and my guess is that if you tunnel into


---------54:52----------
those overloaded states or


---------54:54----------
right right before you get overloaded if


---------54:56----------
you tunnel down into what you're


---------54:58----------
thinking


---------55:00----------
somehow it's a thought that stems from


---------55:04----------
your sense that like you messed up in


---------55:06----------
some way


---------55:07----------
or that you're not a good person


---------55:10----------
i could agree it's like a frenzy of like


---------55:13----------
thoughts about oh i messed this up or i


---------55:14----------
should have done this or like


---------55:16----------
you know this person like i could have


---------55:18----------
done this better and and


---------55:20----------
like it's something about you not and in


---------55:22----------
all of those


---------55:23----------
shoulds that you tell yourself those are


---------55:25----------
not acceptance


---------55:26----------
because like even then like if you say


---------55:28----------
oh i should have done this with friends


---------55:29----------
like you can't accept that like


---------55:32----------
it's okay to not have done it with


---------55:34----------
friends like you're doing it now


---------55:36----------
like it like do you see how should and


---------55:38----------
acceptance or opposite


---------55:40----------
ends of the spectrum like this pen is


---------55:42----------
black


---------55:43----------
it should be blue like that's not


---------55:45----------
accepting that the pen is black


---------55:47----------
it's just two opposite ends and


---------55:50----------
and so the cool thing is that i think


---------55:51----------
that you you will get better but


---------55:55----------
the the solution to the overload


---------55:58----------
episodes


---------55:58----------
is not to fix the episode it's to slowly


---------56:02----------
chip away at the fuel for the episode


---------56:06----------
right right so and and the more that you


---------56:10----------
look at like how your mind makes it your


---------56:13----------
fault


---------56:14----------
is your mind making it your fault here


---------56:16----------
when you're listening to me is it doing


---------56:18----------
something


---------56:19----------
no i'm just i'm just listening okay i'm


---------56:22----------
thinking about when i have the episodes


---------56:24----------
that um usually something triggers it


---------56:26----------
right so


---------56:27----------
i've done something but it's just that


---------56:28----------
way i feel like i was in the wrong yep


---------56:30----------
there it is okay


---------56:34----------
yeah right you could tell me more but do


---------56:36----------
you see you see how like what triggers


---------56:37----------
the episode is the idea that you've done


---------56:39----------
something wrong and what's [ __ ] up is


---------56:41----------
you probably didn't even do anything


---------56:42----------
wrong


---------56:43----------
and so what i'm saying is if you want to


---------56:44----------
conquer the episode so i want everyone


---------56:46----------
to understand this


---------56:48----------
people come to me and they say how do i


---------56:50----------
put out the fire my house is burning


---------56:51----------
down every week it burns down


---------56:53----------
and what i say is don't try to put out


---------56:55----------
the fire put out the match


---------56:58----------
put out the match that gets you started


---------57:03----------
and like because people look at this and


---------57:04----------
it's kind of bizarre but like


---------57:06----------
it's way easier to put out a match than


---------57:08----------
it is to put out the fire once it


---------57:10----------
started


---------57:10----------
and so once you get into that overload


---------57:13----------
mode it's going to take a lot of effort


---------57:15----------
a lot of work to kind of wrap that in


---------57:17----------
but what i'm telling you and this is


---------57:18----------
when when i think about


---------57:20----------
you know when i've helped people who


---------57:21----------
have like panic attacks and stuff to the


---------57:23----------
point where they're like off of


---------57:24----------
medication


---------57:25----------
they're basically i mean they're not


---------57:27----------
really cured but in psychiatry we don't


---------57:28----------
cure anyone


---------57:29----------
we have something called sustained


---------57:31----------
remission which means that


---------57:33----------
they don't have any symptoms for a long


---------57:35----------
period of time but we don't cure anyone


---------57:37----------
because we don't we can't do that fine


---------57:40----------
so when i see


---------57:41----------
patients with sustained remission the


---------57:43----------
way that i get there is i


---------57:44----------
i get them to put out the match you go


---------57:47----------
to the root of it


---------57:48----------
and you pull out the root and all of the


---------57:50----------
subsequent behaviors


---------57:51----------
will come crumbling down


---------57:55----------
so would you say um would you say the


---------57:58----------
way to find the match would just to be


---------58:00----------
recognized in it


---------58:01----------
when it happens absolutely because you


---------58:04----------
said


---------58:05----------
it gets triggered by what nicholas


---------58:08----------
um by me blaming myself basically there


---------58:11----------
it is


---------58:12----------
yeah so the


---------58:15----------
the hard part at that point i would say


---------58:17----------
is just to


---------58:19----------
to stop the thoughts from rolling in


---------58:20----------
nope you can't stop them nope


---------58:22----------
that's not acceptance right see that's


---------58:24----------
what you try to do


---------58:26----------
i would bet money i would bet money that


---------58:28----------
you fight against them


---------58:29----------
you fight against them with every fiber


---------58:31----------
of your being


---------58:33----------
and the more you fight them the more


---------58:35----------
they grow


---------58:37----------
that's right right so i want you to


---------58:40----------
imagine this


---------58:41----------
i want you guys to think about your


---------58:42----------
thoughts like water


---------58:45----------
and the harder you hit it like if i if i


---------58:48----------
jump off of a hundred foot diving


---------58:50----------
board and i make myself flat and i smack


---------58:53----------
into water it's hard like concrete


---------58:56----------
the harder i push against it the harder


---------58:58----------
it pushes back


---------58:59----------
if i'm in a bathtub or if i'm in the


---------59:02----------
let's say a bathtub


---------59:03----------
if i'm in the bathtub and there are too


---------59:04----------
many waves in the bathtub


---------59:07----------
and i push against the waves what


---------59:08----------
happens


---------59:11----------
when they push back absolutely and so


---------59:14----------
that's what you do


---------59:15----------
when those thoughts come what do you do


---------59:16----------
nicholas


---------59:18----------
i push back and then what they what do


---------59:20----------
they do


---------59:22----------
well they push back harder then what do


---------59:23----------
you do yeah


---------59:25----------
push back yeah back and forth you know


---------59:27----------
and then you hit


---------59:28----------
overload right you see that it's an


---------59:31----------
escalating cycle until you're like


---------59:34----------
you're tired of pushing back


---------59:36----------
you're physically exhausted you just lay


---------59:38----------
back they hammer you for a while and


---------59:40----------
then they stop


---------59:42----------
and then you crawl out of the tub and


---------59:43----------
you're numb for two or three days


---------59:44----------
because you're exhausted from all this


---------59:46----------
cognitive activity


---------59:48----------
so acceptance is laying back at the very


---------59:51----------
beginning


---------59:53----------
okay stopping the cycle so when they


---------59:56----------
hammer you


---------59:56----------
you just notice it and say oh here it is


---------59:59----------
again


---------60:00----------
here's my old friend here's 14 year old


---------60:03----------
nicholas


---------60:04----------
who's paranoid that the world doesn't


---------60:06----------
like him


---------60:09----------
because that nicholas is still 14 it's


---------60:12----------
not the person that you are today


---------60:15----------
with your cool hair and your beard


---------60:19----------
yeah right there's four there's 14 year


---------60:21----------
old nicholas who's not confident


---------60:23----------
who's insecure


---------60:26----------
and sometimes he's afraid and he comes


---------60:29----------
and he says


---------60:30----------
nick i'm i'm afraid that people aren't


---------60:32----------
gonna like me and then you're like [ __ ]


---------60:34----------
you


---------60:35----------
everyone likes you you piece of [ __ ] why


---------60:37----------
are you complaining


---------60:40----------
and then he grows he gets stronger every


---------60:42----------
time you push him away


---------60:44----------
he gets stronger


---------60:47----------
so when those spirals start see that


---------60:50----------
within yourself see that there's like


---------60:52----------
this part of you that's like oh my god


---------60:53----------
these people don't like me


---------60:54----------
i screwed something up and instead of


---------60:58----------
saying no no no you didn't screw


---------60:59----------
anything up you're great bro


---------61:01----------
you're awesome because that's actually


---------61:03----------
what the abuse of 14 year old nicholas


---------61:05----------
looks like


---------61:06----------
that's the positive [ __ ] mental


---------61:07----------
attitude that your therapist taught


---------61:09----------
right it's telling you like no man like


---------61:11----------
you're awesome like everyone likes you


---------61:13----------
you have no reason to feel that way


---------61:15----------
i know it sounds bizarre but that


---------61:17----------
positivity is abusive


---------61:20----------
it's the weirdest thing in the world


---------61:24----------
so you would say it's basically enabling


---------61:26----------
yourself absolutely


---------61:28----------
and that's what we hear from you right


---------61:30----------
we hear that everything you do makes it


---------61:31----------
worse


---------61:33----------
let's just stop doing this that's


---------61:36----------
definitely true right yeah


---------61:38----------
and it started with this positive mental


---------61:39----------
attitude stuff because the positive


---------61:41----------
mental attitude was useful for a time it


---------61:43----------
worked for a time


---------61:44----------
right it helped you make friends and


---------61:46----------
stuff but now you're finding like okay i


---------61:47----------
can't make authentic friends


---------61:50----------
definitely and so i i think that there


---------61:52----------
are times where you interact with other


---------61:54----------
people where


---------61:55----------
you want to say something that's


---------61:56----------
authentic and then your mind tells you


---------61:58----------
you're going to screw it up if you tell


---------62:00----------
them


---------62:02----------
yeah and then you don't speak


---------62:05----------
and instead what you need to do is speak


---------62:08----------
and here's the wild thing


---------62:10----------
i'm not going to tell you you won't


---------62:12----------
screw it up


---------62:14----------
the way to overcome this is by screwing


---------62:16----------
it up


---------62:17----------
over and over and over again because


---------62:19----------
you're not going to screw it up all the


---------62:20----------
time


---------62:20----------
you're going to screw it up sometimes


---------62:21----------
and you're not going to screw it up


---------62:22----------
other times


---------62:23----------
and that's when you're going to find


---------62:24----------
like the middle road of like who you are


---------62:26----------
that you're not perfect because that's


---------62:28----------
what you try to be by the way i don't


---------62:30----------
know if you noticed


---------62:32----------
sure like the more you try to be perfect


---------62:35----------
the more that comes from the idea that


---------62:37----------
you don't have inherent value


---------62:40----------
like the less and the more insecure you


---------62:43----------
are in yourself as a person the harder


---------62:45----------
you try to be perfect and instead what


---------62:48----------
you need to be is just be who you are


---------62:50----------
which is like a 20 year old guy who's


---------62:51----------
like got some problems with


---------62:52----------
self-confidence but it's also like kind


---------62:54----------
of friendly and charismatic and knows


---------62:55----------
how to talk to people


---------62:57----------
sure be that yeah


---------63:01----------
be the guy who like pisses some people


---------63:03----------
off and


---------63:04----------
befriends others


---------63:09----------
yeah yeah i can agree the thing


---------63:14----------
it's hard though right it's absolutely


---------63:16----------
hard to not push back


---------63:19----------
yeah that's the that's the main thing


---------63:20----------
yep um


---------63:22----------
so now nicholas we're gonna test you you


---------63:25----------
ready for a test


---------63:27----------
sure okay if i tell you to push back


---------63:33----------
and you can't push back


---------63:36----------
how do you think about yourself


---------63:40----------
uh wait um can you rephrase that yeah so


---------63:42----------
you say it's hard


---------63:44----------
so let's say you try and you fail


---------63:48----------
how do you think about yourself after


---------63:50----------
you fail


---------63:52----------
i would feel disappointed normally


---------63:55----------
yep right and then you would say to


---------63:58----------
yourself i should be able to do it


---------64:01----------
yep correct and there it is again


---------64:05----------
do you see it same thing yeah


---------64:08----------
yeah yeah yeah i see what you mean right


---------64:12----------
yeah so so the next time yep


---------64:15----------
so the next time you try and it's hard


---------64:19----------
and you fail what are you gonna tell


---------64:20----------
yourself instead


---------64:23----------
that's okay absolutely yeah


---------64:27----------
and what is it okay it's okay to fail


---------64:30----------
yes yeah definitely okay it's okay to


---------64:33----------
not be perfect


---------64:34----------
yep and and what do we call that by the


---------64:37----------
way


---------64:39----------
acceptance there you go yeah


---------64:42----------
that's how you accept yourself you see


---------64:45----------
you figured it out


---------64:48----------
yeah now i just have to put it into


---------64:50----------
practice


---------64:51----------
you know what and and what happens when


---------64:53----------
you try and you fail


---------64:56----------
then i should be okay with it and accept


---------64:59----------
it


---------65:00----------
yeah right because even then when you


---------65:02----------
say now i need to put it into practice


---------65:04----------
what you're doing


---------65:05----------
is your your d devaluing the success


---------65:09----------
of understanding you just had


---------65:12----------
okay that's interesting


---------65:15----------
because i didn't notice that yep because


---------65:17----------
you don't because it's there man it's


---------65:19----------
there in your programming right because


---------65:22----------
when you say now i need to put it into


---------65:23----------
practice what that says is nicolas isn't


---------65:25----------
good enough


---------65:28----------
okay that's interesting


---------65:31----------
yeah that's interesting because i i


---------65:33----------
would say i saw it differently but


---------65:36----------
yeah when i said it firstly it was more


---------65:40----------
like a hopeful statement


---------65:41----------
sure but i can see what you mean by it


---------65:43----------
yeah yeah yep


---------65:44----------
and i'm not i'm not disputing so i think


---------65:46----------
the other tricky thing is that i think


---------65:48----------
hope can be within this thing


---------65:51----------
right i i think you can because if


---------65:52----------
you're different you can hope


---------65:54----------
right it's it's subtle but you're like


---------65:57----------
if i was a different person if i behaved


---------65:59----------
like i should


---------66:00----------
i'm hopeful for the future


---------66:03----------
okay if i dot dot dot then i can hope


---------66:07----------
but the still subtle thing there is that


---------66:08----------
nicholas you don't need to do anything


---------66:10----------
man you're perfect just the way that you


---------66:11----------
are


---------66:15----------
yeah perfection and imperfection is what


---------66:17----------
you mean like yep


---------66:18----------
there you go yeah yeah okay gotcha


---------66:20----------
gotcha yeah


---------66:21----------
there you go yeah yeah


---------66:24----------
yeah that's how it meant


---------66:28----------
yes that's good that's progress


---------66:32----------
because let me explain something to you


---------66:34----------
when you say that's hard man


---------66:36----------
there's no should there there's no hope


---------66:40----------
that is a statement of acceptance okay


---------66:44----------
right that is a statement that says i


---------66:47----------
don't know if i can do it


---------66:51----------
it's not beating yourself for up for not


---------66:52----------
being able to do it it's not saying that


---------66:54----------
you should be able to do it


---------66:55----------
it's saying you know what man that's


---------66:58----------
hard


---------67:00----------
that's acceptance yeah


---------67:05----------
yeah i can see i see yeah that's true


---------67:08----------
i'm trying to wrap my uh mind around


---------67:09----------
yeah sorry it's it's kind of


---------67:11----------
it's getting abstract but nicholas


---------67:14----------
really i


---------67:14----------
i think it's like there are a couple of


---------67:16----------
core things where i really think if you


---------67:17----------
can kind of


---------67:18----------
really get a handle on them and learn


---------67:19----------
how to see them


---------67:21----------
and learn how to say that's hard


---------67:25----------
right like so like there's 14 year old


---------67:27----------
nicholas and there's 20 year old


---------67:28----------
nicholas and when 14 year old nicholas


---------67:30----------
comes to 20 year old nicholas and he


---------67:31----------
says


---------67:32----------
hey my friends bro blocked me on meow


---------67:34----------
chat


---------67:35----------
and then when nicholas says hey man


---------67:37----------
that's rough that's hard


---------67:39----------
that's got to be tough that's acceptance


---------67:42----------
right


---------67:43----------
it's not telling him hey you're a piece


---------67:45----------
of [ __ ] it's also not telling him that


---------67:47----------
you're a wonderful person you didn't do


---------67:48----------
anything wrong maybe you did


---------67:50----------
either way you can accept that it's hard


---------67:52----------
that it's tough


---------67:53----------
and it doesn't have to mean anything


---------67:55----------
more beyond that


---------67:58----------
okay questions yeah


---------68:03----------
i'm trying to think of some


---------68:07----------
right so what would you do um


---------68:10----------
i guess i guess this kind of answer i'm


---------68:12----------
trying to unfold it a bit more


---------68:14----------
sure so what we do when some someone um


---------68:17----------
does something about the mean


---------68:19----------
but you can't figure out the reasoning


---------68:21----------
point


---------68:22----------
in this case being uh so i used to live


---------68:25----------
in spain


---------68:27----------
um in spain what happened i went to a


---------68:29----------
party


---------68:30----------
and at the party someone um literally


---------68:32----------
punished me like without any reason


---------68:34----------
i figured out the reason they say being


---------68:36----------
that she was trying to get some money


---------68:38----------
off of someone


---------68:39----------
um you know by doing some


---------68:42----------
work she would say i don't know if i can


---------68:45----------
stay on stream


---------68:47----------
i don't know if you can't either i mean


---------68:48----------
there's against tournaments


---------68:51----------
yeah um it was you know some illegal


---------68:53----------
kind of what she's trying to do with


---------68:54----------
someone


---------68:55----------
okay um and she felt like kind of


---------68:57----------
blocked that off so she punched me


---------68:59----------
um but i i didn't know that until later


---------69:01----------
so i beat myself up for that because i


---------69:02----------
couldn't figure out


---------69:03----------
why i was punched right um


---------69:07----------
so in that sense why would you what


---------69:09----------
would you do like because


---------69:12----------
i'm not sure how you would accept that


---------69:14----------
thing


---------69:15----------
as except for just that that you know


---------69:18----------
except that someone punched you without


---------69:20----------
reasoning


---------69:22----------
how would you not overthink it is what


---------69:24----------
i'm trying to say because i


---------69:25----------
instantly you know tried to as we've


---------69:28----------
you know talked about tried to find a


---------69:30----------
reason for it yep


---------69:32----------
so i think because that's a great


---------69:33----------
example man because that example shows


---------69:37----------
and i say this with love how [ __ ] up


---------69:40----------
your reasoning is


---------69:41----------
because when you're at a party and you


---------69:44----------
get randomly punched by someone


---------69:46----------
if your mind somehow does some


---------69:49----------
gymnastics to make it your fault


---------69:52----------
when you don't even know who this person


---------69:53----------
is and she just walks up to you and


---------69:55----------
punches you


---------69:57----------
like do you see how that's just


---------70:00----------
absolutely ridiculous like the reason


---------70:02----------
she punched you is because she's an


---------70:03----------
[ __ ]


---------70:04----------
that's the reason right has nothing to


---------70:06----------
do with you


---------70:08----------
definitely but i'm trying to figure out


---------70:10----------
like how would you


---------70:12----------
because i feel like most people would


---------70:15----------
think about that it's an extreme right


---------70:16----------
absolutely such a random thing that


---------70:18----------
would


---------70:18----------
occur so how would you stop yourself and


---------70:22----------
well not stop yourself but how would you


---------70:23----------
not beat yourself up from it is what i'm


---------70:25----------
trying to ask


---------70:26----------
okay so i mean i think oddly enough


---------70:30----------
i know this sounds bizarre nicholas i


---------70:31----------
don't think most people would beat


---------70:32----------
themselves up after getting punched


---------70:34----------
punched randomly in the face sure enough


---------70:36----------
okay sure


---------70:37----------
okay but i i think but that doesn't help


---------70:40----------
you because you beat yourself up


---------70:41----------
and that should just give us an idea for


---------70:43----------
how strong that complex is in your mind


---------70:46----------
so here's a here's an answer for you so


---------70:48----------
i want you and this is going to sound


---------70:50----------
kind of weird but maybe it'll help


---------70:51----------
because it's sort of a long shot


---------70:53----------
so i want you to think about karma karma


---------70:56----------
what's your understanding of karma


---------70:59----------
um i have the understanding that karma


---------71:03----------
is necessarily good or bad but it's a


---------71:04----------
bunch of


---------71:05----------
energy that kind of determines where you


---------71:07----------
go in the next life


---------71:08----------
okay if i'm just correct yep so i'm


---------71:10----------
going to tell you a story


---------71:12----------
so you've heard of this guy buddha


---------71:15----------
buddha yeah siddharth okay


---------71:19----------
so buddha gets enlight okay and then he


---------71:22----------
like he's like teaching people


---------71:25----------
and so he's got a bunch of disciples and


---------71:27----------
he's like sort of famous at this point


---------71:29----------
and one day someone comes up to him so


---------71:32----------
he's like teaching and now he like gives


---------71:33----------
a lecture and after the lecture


---------71:34----------
you know he's got his disciples that are


---------71:36----------
there and then someone comes up and


---------71:38----------
sometimes people will come up and ask


---------71:39----------
him questions


---------71:41----------
and so someone comes up to him and and


---------71:44----------
he says hey do you remember me and


---------71:45----------
buddha says


---------71:46----------
no i don't he says well you tried to


---------71:48----------
teach me how to meditate 15 years ago


---------71:50----------
and it didn't work


---------71:51----------
and then the dude spits and put this


---------71:52----------
face


---------71:54----------
he's like [ __ ] you and then his


---------71:56----------
disciples get pissed they're like this


---------71:57----------
guy's like he's disrespecting the master


---------71:59----------
like


---------72:00----------
let's beat his ass and then brother's


---------72:01----------
like no no calm down chill


---------72:04----------
and he's like just let him go so the


---------72:06----------
dude like spits in his face and he like


---------72:07----------
walks away


---------72:08----------
he's like expecting something to happen


---------72:10----------
maybe walks away and they're like how


---------72:12----------
can you let this guy disrespect you like


---------72:13----------
that and with this like that's just a


---------72:14----------
karma that he has to wipe away


---------72:16----------
so he has like some amount of resentment


---------72:18----------
i may have wronged him


---------72:20----------
he's fit in my face and now we're done


---------72:22----------
he's gone he's gonna go live his life


---------72:23----------
i'm gonna go live mine


---------72:25----------
it's just sort of like it just gets


---------72:26----------
wiped away


---------72:28----------
just because i'm enlightened doesn't


---------72:29----------
mean that i've become free of all of my


---------72:32----------
past karmas


---------72:33----------
it's just a debt that i had to pay okay


---------72:37----------
so i don't know if this is going to help


---------72:38----------
you or not


---------72:40----------
but i would say that you know if you're


---------72:42----------
trying to think about


---------72:44----------
why bad things happen to you and you're


---------72:46----------
looking for an


---------72:47----------
alternate solution besides


---------72:50----------
i'm an idiot and it's my fault and i


---------72:53----------
lack value


---------72:55----------
i would toss out garma for you to think


---------72:57----------
about


---------72:58----------
now you have to decide for yourself


---------72:59----------
whether like after studying it and


---------73:01----------
thinking about it it's a good alternate


---------73:03----------
solution


---------73:05----------
but in my mind you know all causes have


---------73:08----------
effects


---------73:08----------
and all effects have causes


---------73:12----------
so one way to think about it is like


---------73:15----------
you're looking for you know the cause to


---------73:18----------
the effect of her punching you whereas


---------73:20----------
like that cause may not


---------73:22----------
come from you and in fact her punching


---------73:24----------
you may not be in effect it could be a


---------73:26----------
cause


---------73:27----------
she could be opening up a new karma


---------73:29----------
where like you had the opportunity to


---------73:31----------
punch her back


---------73:33----------
right anyway it gets complicated but i i


---------73:35----------
mean the simplest answer i can give you


---------73:37----------
is like just understand that


---------73:39----------
some of the [ __ ] that happens to you in


---------73:40----------
life is like you could say


---------73:43----------
you don't want to think about karma you


---------73:45----------
could just say hey man [ __ ] happens


---------73:46----------
some people say that right some people


---------73:48----------
say that the world is a random place and


---------73:51----------
sometimes just random bad things happen


---------73:52----------
to good people like which is a


---------73:54----------
completely reasonable


---------73:56----------
hypothesis on the other hand some people


---------73:59----------
say that everything is determined and


---------74:01----------
orderly and like it's because god wants


---------74:03----------
it to happen and stuff like that


---------74:04----------
i think that's completely fine


---------74:05----------
hypothesis too in the middle i think


---------74:08----------
there's just the simple principle of


---------74:10----------
cause and effect which is karma which is


---------74:11----------
that like


---------74:12----------
things happen like all things have


---------74:14----------
causes and all causes have offense


---------74:17----------
and that doesn't mean that you're the


---------74:19----------
creator of the universe and sometimes


---------74:21----------
people are going to be [ __ ] to you


---------74:22----------
because that's just


---------74:25----------
you know why is one person born in the


---------74:27----------
united states whereas another person is


---------74:28----------
born in zimbabwe whereas another person


---------74:30----------
is born


---------74:31----------
in australia you can say it's randomness


---------74:33----------
you can say it's karma


---------74:34----------
but in your case i'd say just think


---------74:36----------
about like you know are you the center


---------74:38----------
of all things that happened to you


---------74:42----------
um in my world technically yes you know


---------74:45----------
because you


---------74:46----------
yeah you perceive everything right so


---------74:48----------
that's something that i would encourage


---------74:50----------
you to think about right so i don't


---------74:51----------
doubt that you perceive it


---------74:53----------
and you may even arrive at a logical


---------74:56----------
truth that you are the center of all


---------74:57----------
things that happened to you but i'd


---------74:58----------
encourage you to think about it


---------75:01----------
and be like is it my fault if i'm


---------75:03----------
walking down the street and someone


---------75:04----------
you know spills their drink on me


---------75:09----------
did i do something wrong and i'm not


---------75:11----------
sure


---------75:13----------
i need you i think you need to give your


---------75:16----------
life


---------75:19----------
actors besides yourself


---------75:23----------
yeah i could agree yeah right because


---------75:25----------
sometimes when people block you it's


---------75:27----------
because


---------75:28----------
they're envious not because you did


---------75:30----------
something wrong


---------75:31----------
but because they're envious all kinds of


---------75:34----------
reasons people block other people


---------75:38----------
sure yeah i mean it's not the fact that


---------75:40----------
that they blocked me it's more like the


---------75:42----------
way that


---------75:42----------
they just you know cut off the


---------75:44----------
relationship sure


---------75:45----------
you know is it yeah because people get


---------75:48----------
locked all the time


---------75:49----------
but it's more like there yeah yeah and


---------75:52----------
so once again there are lots of reasons


---------75:54----------
that could happen i think the problem is


---------75:55----------
that your mind


---------75:57----------
jumps to one and the more that you


---------75:59----------
notice


---------76:00----------
okay here my mind is blaming me again


---------76:02----------
and even in that scenario if you notice


---------76:04----------
that your mind is blaming you for being


---------76:06----------
punched by a random person at a party


---------76:09----------
then just be like whoa that's kind of


---------76:11----------
weird like there it is again


---------76:13----------
blaming me for being punched by a random


---------76:15----------
person


---------76:18----------
sure yeah and i know that's something


---------76:22----------
not going i was gonna say like i i don't


---------76:25----------
even think you need to do much more than


---------76:26----------
that


---------76:27----------
if you can just notice that that's the


---------76:29----------
part of the mind i i kid you not


---------76:31----------
it it starts to get better i know it's


---------76:33----------
bizarre


---------76:36----------
well yeah it's definitely worth a try


---------76:38----------
something you know


---------76:39----------
yeah 100 yeah that's a wild man


---------76:44----------
that she just punched what do you mean


---------76:46----------
yeah no i was there


---------76:48----------
so we were sitting um like in a circle


---------76:51----------
and i was talking to my friend he was


---------76:52----------
sitting across me and she was sitting in


---------76:53----------
the middle


---------76:54----------
and then um to put a friend she thought


---------76:56----------
that was blocking her because she was


---------76:58----------
trying to


---------76:58----------
charge him for it and then she punched


---------77:00----------
me um


---------77:02----------
and then we left but i i didn't find


---------77:04----------
that out on so like a few days later


---------77:06----------
so sounds like you helped your friend


---------77:09----------
out


---------77:10----------
yeah i mean he also just found it out


---------77:13----------
later


---------77:14----------
so you know but it it is what it is


---------77:17----------
um yeah that's


---------77:21----------
wild story man yeah i mean that's um one


---------77:25----------
of the good things to do when you travel


---------77:26----------
around right


---------77:27----------
you get to experience them i said that's


---------77:29----------
one of the good things about traveling


---------77:31----------
is that yes experience wild stories yeah


---------77:34----------
yeah


---------77:36----------
other questions um no i don't think so


---------77:40----------
okay so we've got a choice then nicholas


---------77:42----------
i feel like we've covered uh


---------77:44----------
like you know we've kind of gotten to


---------77:45----------
like an important conclusion


---------77:47----------
if you want to open up something else we


---------77:49----------
can or we can kind of switch to


---------77:51----------
meditation what do you think


---------77:54----------
uh i don't really have anything to open


---------77:57----------
okay


---------77:58----------
yeah um the one thought that you'd made


---------78:02----------
one statement which i don't think we had


---------78:03----------
really addressed one was that


---------78:05----------
independence leads to like a lack of


---------78:09----------
disclosing or sharing with other people


---------78:11----------
like you said something about


---------78:12----------
being independent and that's why you


---------78:14----------
don't want to share


---------78:16----------
yeah i have this feeling um of


---------78:18----------
self-reliance right so i want to be


---------78:21----------
very independent in pretty much


---------78:23----------
everything i do


---------78:25----------
which is also you know with contracting


---------78:28----------
with my own feelings and stuff like that


---------78:29----------
so i usually don't


---------78:30----------
tend to to reach out to people on this i


---------78:33----------
know


---------78:34----------
for sure i can't do it myself um


---------78:37----------
which is kind of contradicting with you


---------78:39----------
know this whole thing because you know


---------78:41----------
but that's how it is practically not


---------78:44----------
necessarily


---------78:45----------
i i don't i don't think it's


---------78:46----------
contradictory at all i think that


---------78:48----------
if you if you have low value in yourself


---------78:53----------
you can strive for independence because


---------78:55----------
if you can do it all by yourself


---------78:57----------
then you don't have to worry about it


---------78:59----------
sort of negates the low value


---------79:01----------
it negates being you know relying on


---------79:03----------
other people i think it makes a lot of


---------79:05----------
sense but i


---------79:06----------
okay um so let's talk about meditation


---------79:11----------
sure have you had experience with


---------79:13----------
meditation


---------79:15----------
uh a little bit because um i used to


---------79:17----------
meditate


---------79:18----------
like before going to bed just like


---------79:20----------
sitting down and relaxing


---------79:22----------
for a bit but not like too much


---------79:25----------
okay so i just


---------79:29----------
i did like five minutes just sitting


---------79:31----------
closing my eyes and listening


---------79:32----------
that's it like some minutes


---------79:36----------
okay let me think about what to do


---------79:40----------
sure i have a meditation technique for


---------79:43----------
you but it's a little bit


---------79:45----------
advanced so it could be hard


---------79:49----------
um but i i wanted to do something a


---------79:51----------
little bit different


---------79:53----------
okay let me just think about how to


---------79:57----------
explain it okay


---------80:00----------
okay so i want to teach you something


---------80:03----------
nicholas that


---------80:04----------
involves understanding


---------80:08----------
your relationship to the outside world


---------80:12----------
okay okay so if we think about like this


---------80:15----------
punching example


---------80:17----------
something in the outside world happens


---------80:20----------
and you


---------80:21----------
somehow think it has something to do


---------80:22----------
with you


---------80:25----------
does that make sense like i know it


---------80:26----------
sounds really bizarre


---------80:28----------
but like as human beings we assume that


---------80:31----------
we


---------80:31----------
interact with the world in a particular


---------80:33----------
way that we're responsible for some


---------80:35----------
things


---------80:36----------
right so in a weird way it's almost like


---------80:38----------
we believe subconsciously that we


---------80:41----------
control


---------80:41----------
the world i know it sounds weird but


---------80:44----------
like let me give you an example let's


---------80:45----------
say that i apply for a job


---------80:47----------
or i ask a girl out and i get rejected


---------80:51----------
i blame myself it's my fault that i


---------80:54----------
didn't get the job


---------80:55----------
i should have studied harder i should


---------80:56----------
have done a better internship i should


---------80:58----------
have wrote a bigger personal statement


---------81:00----------
whatever


---------81:01----------
and we don't really acknowledge that the


---------81:04----------
outside world has all kinds of reasons


---------81:07----------
for treating us the way that it does


---------81:09----------
which have nothing to do with us


---------81:10----------
like maybe the reason that i didn't get


---------81:12----------
the job is because


---------81:14----------
you know it was a job maybe the company


---------81:16----------
is actually going out of business


---------81:18----------
and then they interviewed people and


---------81:20----------
then like never hired it


---------81:22----------
right but that's not the way that we


---------81:23----------
think about it we always assume that we


---------81:25----------
are responsible for the things that


---------81:27----------
happen to us


---------81:29----------
does that make sense yeah so


---------81:32----------
i know it sounds weird but i want to


---------81:34----------
teach you a way where you can start


---------81:37----------
discovering what the actual relationship


---------81:40----------
between you and the outside world is


---------81:44----------
where does nicholas end in the outside


---------81:46----------
world begin


---------81:48----------
okay okay i know it sounds weird yeah so


---------81:52----------
let's give it a try um the the practice


---------81:54----------
is actually quite simple


---------81:56----------
but it's hard okay so what i i have to


---------81:59----------
figure out how am i


---------82:00----------
i need music


---------82:05----------
okay so um what i want you to do


---------82:08----------
is tune into the stream


---------82:12----------
okay so you can hear the background


---------82:14----------
music


---------82:16----------
can you hear the music yeah i hear the


---------82:18----------
music


---------82:19----------
okay so this is what i want you to do so


---------82:21----------
i want all you guys to close your eyes


---------82:25----------
and listen to the music so hear the


---------82:29----------
notes


---------82:29----------
in the music


---------82:38----------
[Music]


---------82:41----------
can you hear the music nicholas yeah i


---------82:44----------
hear you


---------82:45----------
okay so when you listen to my words


---------82:49----------
or the music


---------82:52----------
i don't know how to put this but your


---------82:54----------
attention is


---------82:55----------
focused on my words right it's focused


---------82:58----------
on something outside


---------83:00----------
does that make sense yeah so you're


---------83:03----------
listening to the notes of the music


---------83:06----------
sure okay so now what i want you to do


---------83:12----------
is put your attention on your ears


---------83:17----------
and put your attention not physically on


---------83:18----------
your ears but


---------83:20----------
on the sense of hearing okay


---------83:24----------
so don't listen to the notes pay


---------83:27----------
attention to


---------83:28----------
you hearing them so it used to be that


---------83:31----------
your attention was on the notes


---------83:34----------
now your attention is on you hearing the


---------83:36----------
notes


---------83:40----------
can you do that i


---------83:44----------
think so yeah try


---------83:49----------
[Music]


---------84:00----------
um


---------84:02----------
[Music]


---------84:06----------
[Applause]


---------84:12----------
now you may find that your attention


---------84:15----------
goes back


---------84:16----------
to the notes after a few moments


---------84:18----------
[Applause]


---------84:21----------
does that happen a little bit


---------84:24----------
okay and then when it moves back to the


---------84:26----------
notes shift it back


---------84:28----------
to the hearing of the notes so put all


---------84:31----------
your attention


---------84:32----------
on your hearing as opposed to the music


---------84:35----------
[Music]


---------84:42----------
okay


---------84:50----------
how long can you hold on to the hearing


---------84:52----------
instead of the notes


---------84:55----------
i think maybe um half a minute to 45


---------84:58----------
seconds at a time


---------84:59----------
okay before going back


---------85:02----------
[Music]


---------85:04----------
okay so just we're gonna practice for


---------85:08----------
about another minute okay


---------85:10----------
okay


---------85:15----------
[Music]


---------85:25----------
[Music]


---------85:38----------
me


---------85:52----------
[Music]


---------85:56----------
once again your attention may go to the


---------85:59----------
sound of my voice or the notes


---------86:02----------
hear me speaking and then move back


---------86:05----------
to the hearing


---------86:09----------
so as i continue to talk do your best


---------86:12----------
not to pay attention to my words but


---------86:15----------
listen or pay attention to your


---------86:19----------
hearing of the words without paying


---------86:21----------
attention to the words


---------86:23----------
[Music]


---------86:26----------
it can be difficult


---------86:28----------
[Music]


---------86:33----------
now go ahead and come back okay


---------86:37----------
[Music]


---------86:40----------
can you go back to camera sure


---------86:48----------
okay okay


---------86:51----------
so now what i'm going to ask you to do


---------86:54----------
is look at me sure


---------86:58----------
so see my face so we're going to do it


---------87:00----------
same thing but this time we're going to


---------87:01----------
use our eyes


---------87:03----------
okay so look at my face


---------87:07----------
and so see it right you can look at the


---------87:09----------
background


---------87:10----------
you can put your attention on anything


---------87:13----------
on your screen


---------87:15----------
or actually yeah or you can look at


---------87:17----------
something in your room it doesn't really


---------87:18----------
matter


---------87:19----------
okay then what i want you to do is put


---------87:22----------
your attention to the looking


---------87:25----------
instead of looking at something having


---------87:27----------
your attention


---------87:29----------
on the objects that your eyes see have


---------87:32----------
your attention be


---------87:33----------
on the looking itself


---------87:38----------
so it'll almost feel it feels to me like


---------87:41----------
zooming out


---------87:43----------
and then like a blurry version kind of


---------87:45----------
yeah it's not quite blurry vision but


---------87:47----------
then you're doing it right right so just


---------87:49----------
pay attention to the seeing itself as


---------87:51----------
opposed to the object of seeing


---------87:59----------
and you can look at something like an


---------88:01----------
object in your room


---------88:03----------
or the screen


---------88:06----------
and then focus on the object like let


---------88:08----------
your eyes look at the object and really


---------88:10----------
see the object and then


---------88:12----------
let your attention pull back and see the


---------88:15----------
seeing itself


---------88:32----------
we'll go for about a minute


---------89:23----------
okay


---------89:26----------
okay


---------89:32----------
thoughts questions do you want to share


---------89:34----------
what that was like for you


---------89:37----------
i felt um i felt like sort of calmness


---------89:41----------
because i


---------89:42----------
i didn't feel like i was thinking about


---------89:43----------
stuff you know yeah so


---------89:45----------
i just felt uh observing


---------89:48----------
i guess you could call it just like


---------89:50----------
seeing


---------89:51----------
yeah did that make sense where you're


---------89:54----------
seeing the seeing itself


---------89:56----------
as opposed to seeing an object yeah


---------89:59----------
definitely okay i i feel like that's


---------90:02----------
doable


---------90:04----------
okay so so i i don't know how else to


---------90:07----------
put this but


---------90:09----------
so here's the cool thing about this


---------90:10----------
practice okay


---------90:15----------
when we see an object it is outside of


---------90:19----------
us right like so let's say here's me


---------90:20----------
here's the object if i'm looking at it


---------90:25----------
then the object is out here and


---------90:26----------
therefore me and the object are separate


---------90:29----------
does that make sense yeah


---------90:32----------
so like i'm over here seeing is over


---------90:35----------
here


---------90:36----------
the object is over here


---------90:39----------
when you look at the seeing what happens


---------90:43----------
is the seeing


---------90:43----------
moves from you to the outside


---------90:48----------
yeah and then you're looking at the


---------90:50----------
seeing itself


---------90:52----------
so there's almost a piece of you


---------90:55----------
there's a piece of who you think you are


---------90:58----------
that you shift outside of yourself by


---------91:02----------
looking at the scene


---------91:04----------
because then the seeing is out there and


---------91:05----------
you're looking at it and then you're


---------91:07----------
over here


---------91:10----------
does that make sense yeah yeah yeah as


---------91:12----------
you said


---------91:13----------
it kind of feels like um zooming out for


---------91:16----------
me it's more like


---------91:17----------
a bit of a blurriness i guess you could


---------91:19----------
say um


---------91:22----------
but it definitely feels like you're not


---------91:24----------
like focusing on one thing


---------91:26----------
yeah except for like you know so so


---------91:30----------
so this is tricky right so after the


---------91:33----------
zooming out


---------91:34----------
there is actually the focusing on the


---------91:37----------
thing that is doing the zooming out


---------91:40----------
right right it's noticing


---------91:44----------
the seeing itself which has the effect


---------91:46----------
on the object side of zooming out


---------91:48----------
but what i really want you to focus on


---------91:49----------
is the act of seeing


---------91:53----------
yeah i got you yeah okay that that is


---------91:56----------
um no yeah go on no go go for it


---------92:00----------
i was just gonna say that is i mean it's


---------92:02----------
doable but i don't


---------92:03----------
i can't do it for like long periods good


---------92:05----------
yeah it's very hard


---------92:07----------
so here's the crate i know this is gonna


---------92:08----------
sound wild


---------92:10----------
but your problem nicholas is that you


---------92:13----------
confuse


---------92:14----------
what's in here with what's in the


---------92:15----------
outside world


---------92:17----------
this person ghosted me that's not on the


---------92:19----------
outside


---------92:20----------
that's on the inside this woman punched


---------92:23----------
me


---------92:23----------
that's not on the outside that's on the


---------92:25----------
inside and that's the [ __ ] up thing


---------92:27----------
that we've showed you today


---------92:29----------
and so literally if you do this practice


---------92:32----------
you will learn


---------92:33----------
how to like like get control over what


---------92:36----------
is on the inside and what is on the


---------92:38----------
outside


---------92:39----------
instead of misattributing everything you


---------92:41----------
will begin to see


---------92:43----------
on a very fundamental level what you


---------92:46----------
are and what the outside list and what


---------92:48----------
you control


---------92:49----------
and what you can't control this all


---------92:52----------
comes down to


---------92:53----------
earlier you toss out this tiny tiny quip


---------92:56----------
where i don't know what to show people


---------92:58----------
because i don't know who i am


---------93:01----------
don't you yeah and this will be a


---------93:04----------
practice where you can learn


---------93:06----------
are you seeing are you the object that


---------93:09----------
you see


---------93:09----------
are you the seeing itself or are you


---------93:12----------
something else


---------93:14----------
and if you continue to do this i really


---------93:15----------
think it'll help you along with the


---------93:17----------
noticing and acceptance and all that


---------93:19----------
other craft we talked about


---------93:21----------
it's like literally a cognitive training


---------93:23----------
skill to like


---------93:24----------
do something different with your mind


---------93:26----------
you can practice it


---------93:27----------
and then when it comes to dealing with


---------93:29----------
your your view of like your


---------93:30----------
confidence in yourself or your value as


---------93:32----------
a person you'll have done a bunch of


---------93:34----------
push-ups so when it comes time


---------93:36----------
to actually use your mind it'll like


---------93:38----------
work way better it'll make everything


---------93:40----------
way easier for you


---------93:42----------
does that make sense well yeah yeah that


---------93:44----------
makes sense


---------93:46----------
okay cool man any last thoughts or


---------93:49----------
questions


---------93:50----------
