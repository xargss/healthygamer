---------00:00----------
okay the entropic brain a theory of


---------00:03----------
conscious states informed by


---------00:04----------
neuroimaging research with psychedelic


---------00:06----------
drugs


---------00:08----------
this this paper chat seriously is just


---------00:11----------
whack okay this is like


---------00:15----------
fascinating i'm going to try to


---------00:16----------
summarize it for you okay so entropy is


---------00:18----------
a dimensionless


---------00:19----------
quantity that is used for measuring


---------00:22----------
uncertainty


---------00:23----------
about the state of a system but it can


---------00:25----------
also imply


---------00:26----------
physical qualities where high energy


---------00:28----------
entropy is synonymous with high disorder


---------00:31----------
entropy is applied here in the context


---------00:33----------
of states of consciousness and their


---------00:34----------
associated neurodynamics


---------00:37----------
so what this is kind of talking about


---------00:40----------
is that when we think about our


---------00:42----------
consciousness okay this this


---------00:44----------
this paper is fascinating okay when we


---------00:47----------
think about our consciousness


---------00:49----------
or a sense of self it's a low entropy


---------00:52----------
state


---------00:53----------
i am this okay like dr k


---------00:57----------
is this you are this you are


---------01:00----------
successful you're a failure you're


---------01:02----------
awesome you suck


---------01:03----------
whatever but you are something that's


---------01:06----------
your identity so what this


---------01:07----------
this paper talks about is that like when


---------01:09----------
you use psychedelics


---------01:12----------
there you create a state of high entropy


---------01:15----------
of the self so the self becomes like


---------01:18----------
disorganized and diffuse


---------01:21----------
and so when people talk about like you


---------01:23----------
know being connected to other people and


---------01:26----------
that their sense of self kind of breaks


---------01:28----------
down and they realize they're like


---------01:29----------
connected with the universe


---------01:30----------
it's like a high entropic state of


---------01:32----------
consciousness


---------01:34----------
it's whack man like the research on this


---------01:36----------
stuff is just so fascinating so when


---------01:38----------
someone's talking about ego death


---------01:39----------
absolutely right so


---------01:40----------
in moksha or enlightenment ego death


---------01:43----------
happens


---------01:45----------
and so like you are no longer you but


---------01:47----------
you are like one with the universe


---------01:49----------
and we can say those words but it


---------01:51----------
doesn't make any sense until you


---------01:53----------
experience it in a state of


---------01:54----------
consciousness


---------01:55----------
and the neuroscience behind the stuff is


---------01:57----------
fascinating once again


---------01:59----------
don't do drugs chat i'm serious because


---------02:02----------
i don't know if you guys get this but


---------02:04----------
shattering your sense of self can


---------02:06----------
sometimes leave you traumatized


---------02:08----------
so don't do that like really like the


---------02:10----------
point of showing you guys these papers


---------02:12----------
is to


---------02:13----------
demonstrate this is not something to


---------02:14----------
play around with okay so someone's


---------02:16----------
asking what about microdosing


---------02:17----------
okay look so let's just talk about this


---------02:20----------
for a second okay


---------02:22----------
so there are a lot of fads within the


---------02:24----------
substance use community


---------02:27----------
and like as a scientist and medical


---------02:30----------
professional


---------02:31----------
the short answer is we don't know


---------02:34----------
right we don't know what micro dosing


---------02:36----------
does to you we don't know what micro


---------02:37----------
dusting doesn't


---------02:38----------
do to you we just don't know right so


---------02:41----------
like i know that a lot of people like


---------02:42----------
just think


---------02:43----------
think about this for a second right if


---------02:44----------
you guys are like pro micro dosing


---------02:46----------
is that safe how do you know


---------02:50----------
oh like people are doing it now


---------02:54----------
really does that make something safe if


---------02:57----------
people are


---------02:58----------
doing it now like i don't think so man


---------03:01----------
so i know that like a lot of people


---------03:02----------
think that stuff is okay but it just


---------03:04----------
depends on what threshold you want to


---------03:06----------
use when you like stick something in


---------03:08----------
your body


---------03:08----------
repeatedly for a long period of time


---------03:13----------
i don't know like what are the long-term


---------03:14----------
effects of microdosing no one knows


---------03:16----------
because i think micro microdosing is


---------03:17----------
relatively new


---------03:18----------
what is microdosing going to do to your


---------03:20----------
brain a year from now 10 years from now


---------03:24----------
we don't know so i would strongly


---------03:27----------
strongly encourage all when it comes to


---------03:29----------
using substances and stuff like that to


---------03:31----------
do so


---------03:32----------
under the guidance of a medical


---------03:33----------
professional and i don't say that just


---------03:35----------
because it's like


---------03:36----------
medical professional monopoly right it's


---------03:38----------
like there's a reason for that man


---------03:41----------
because the people who's for whom micro


---------03:43----------
dosing


---------03:44----------
ends up going bad are the ones that


---------03:47----------
i end up seeing in the emergency room


---------03:50----------
and i have a bias there too because


---------03:52----------
all the people for whom microdosing does


---------03:54----------
well never wind up in the emergency room


---------03:58----------
so what i see is like the worst cases so


---------04:00----------
there's like a bias both ways i'm not


---------04:02----------
disagreeing with that i'm not saying i'm


---------04:04----------
objectively correct what i'm saying is


---------04:05----------
that if you look at


---------04:06----------
science science will study this stuff


---------04:11----------
and look at like


---------04:12----------
15 000 people who microdose and then


---------04:15----------
we'll say


---------04:15----------
oh here's what appears to float to the


---------04:18----------
surface


---------04:18----------
so i would say like trust in science and


---------04:21----------
trust in medicine


---------04:22----------
right but what happens to them who knows


---------04:23----------
do they have a higher risk of anxiety do


---------04:25----------
they have a higher risk of depression


---------04:27----------
do they have a higher risk of being


---------04:29----------
promoted like we just don't know


---------04:31----------
right and this is what happens people


---------04:32----------
just discover something and it


---------04:34----------
makes them feel good right your brain


---------04:37----------
absolutely loves it


---------04:39----------
which is why everyone's doing it so it


---------04:41----------
can't be bad


---------04:43----------
right kind of like when


---------04:46----------
cocaine was in coca-cola tastes


---------04:49----------
delicious


---------04:50----------
gives you energy there are no downsides


---------04:53----------
let's do it


---------04:55----------
right gotta be careful chat there's a


---------04:58----------
reason why like medicine is a thing


---------05:00----------
and science is a thing okay be careful


---------05:03----------
so


---------05:03----------
i'd steer clear of drugs chat really
