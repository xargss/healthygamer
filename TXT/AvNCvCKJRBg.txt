sometimes we'll give people an


---------01:52----------
opportunity to set that boundary i know


---------01:54----------
that you know we didn't have that chance


---------01:55----------
so


---------01:55----------
i just want to tell you if there's


---------01:57----------
anything that you feel uncomfortable


---------01:59----------
talking about


---------02:00----------
um yeah you know you can just say so if


---------02:03----------
i ask you any question that you feel


---------02:04----------
like is out of line that's totally fine


---------02:06----------
just let me know i'm also going to try


---------02:09----------
to pay attention to things that may


---------02:10----------
maybe may make you feel uncomfortable


---------02:15----------
and then i may ask you for permission to


---------02:17----------
continue and i may even say


---------02:19----------
are you sure you want to continue


---------02:20----------
talking about that because it seems like


---------02:22----------
there's some emotions coming up or


---------02:23----------
something like that


---------02:24----------
is that okay yeah sounds good


---------02:27----------
um one other thing is that it seems like


---------02:30----------
okay cool


---------02:31----------
what are you excited about talking to


---------02:34----------
you


---------02:35----------
okay what what do you want to talk about


---------02:38----------
oh


---------02:38----------
now oh uh


---------02:42----------
uh uh my


---------02:45----------
issues okay that's a scary word


---------02:50----------
i have a lot of i have a lot of issues


---------02:53----------
okay what are your issues so many issues


---------02:56----------
oh


---------02:57----------
okay um uh


---------03:04----------
uh i guess i'm a big workaholic


---------03:09----------
okay i don't have i don't i feel


---------03:13----------
anxiety when um


---------03:16----------
whenever i hang out with friends or


---------03:19----------
family


---------03:20----------
um okay that's i i would say that's like


---------03:23----------
my number one issue i feel


---------03:25----------
um i feel guilty about um hanging out


---------03:29----------
with


---------03:30----------
friends and that's probably why i don't


---------03:32----------
have any friends


---------03:34----------
okay um


---------03:38----------
i think i also have like i can't


---------03:42----------
really um i don't really do well


---------03:45----------
in like a group setting


---------03:48----------
like a social group setting um


---------03:52----------
so i get a lot of anxiety um


---------03:58----------
and


---------04:01----------
insomnia i'm a huge insomniac i can't


---------04:04----------
sleep um


---------04:09----------
and that's yeah


---------04:12----------
that's around that's about it sounds


---------04:15----------
like


---------04:16----------
enough to me


---------04:21----------
sounds sounds actually pretty tough you


---------04:23----------
know


---------04:26----------
um um it's okay


---------04:30----------
it's all right i deal with it i've been


---------04:32----------
dealing with it for a while


---------04:34----------
how long have you been dealing with it


---------04:37----------
um


---------04:40----------
since


---------04:44----------
like college okay school


---------04:47----------
high school college and can you tell me


---------04:50----------
a little bit about


---------04:51----------
what high school was like for you


---------04:55----------
um high school wasn't too bad


---------04:59----------
my school was just like um


---------05:03----------
i would say high school was pretty


---------05:05----------
normal um


---------05:07----------
i thought i had a


---------05:11----------
lot of time to work on my stuff


---------05:14----------
i didn't really have any friends but um


---------05:16----------
i had one close friend


---------05:19----------
um but she kind of went a little crazy


---------05:25----------
i guess because like her parents became


---------05:28----------
like her parents are


---------05:29----------
super religious and then


---------05:32----------
um she they kind of


---------05:36----------
like she was like super cool with


---------05:39----------
a lot of things and then her parents


---------05:41----------
kind of took over her


---------05:43----------
and like told her like she um


---------05:48----------
like listens to music or watches movies


---------05:50----------
or you know


---------05:51----------
there's any of like those type of things


---------05:54----------
um they'll like abandon her and then so


---------05:57----------
like


---------05:58----------
yeah it was really extreme and then she


---------06:00----------
so she and i stopped being friends


---------06:03----------
um and then yeah that was the only thing


---------06:07----------
that was like really like uh on a during


---------06:10----------
high school


---------06:12----------
wow that's kind of wild what's it like


---------06:15----------
to lose your only friend to


---------06:17----------
religious extremism um


---------06:22----------
it sucked what talking about


---------06:25----------
um


---------06:32----------
well


---------06:34----------
because she was like the only person i


---------06:35----------
could talk to about things so like


---------06:38----------
um losing her uh


---------06:42----------
kind of sucks a lot


---------06:45----------
have you lost people before um yeah


---------06:49----------
i had like i had another best friend


---------06:54----------
um but she had to move


---------06:57----------
because of visa reasons to japan back to


---------07:00----------
japan and then when she moved she like


---------07:01----------
never


---------07:02----------
spoke to me again which was weird


---------07:05----------
um but


---------07:10----------
yeah and um


---------07:14----------
so can you help me understand so it


---------07:15----------
seems like you usually have


---------07:18----------
maybe like very few friends that are


---------07:19----------
very close yeah


---------07:21----------
uh-huh and what's your understanding of


---------07:24----------
kind of how that happens


---------07:30----------
i'm sorry what do you mean so when i


---------07:32----------
think about high school


---------07:34----------
like i was not very popular by any means


---------07:37----------
but yeah i had you know a little gang


---------07:40----------
and i think and i i think that you know


---------07:43----------
most people in high school have sort of


---------07:45----------
a gang or a click


---------07:47----------
and they certainly may have particular


---------07:48----------
friends that they're very close to but


---------07:50----------
i'm not really hearing that you


---------07:51----------
you really have a social circle like


---------07:53----------
even in high school no


---------07:55----------
no i never never had one do you have a


---------07:57----------
sense like did you have like a social


---------07:59----------
circle like it when you were younger


---------08:01----------
than high school like middle school


---------08:02----------
no no my my childhood was really bad


---------08:06----------
like what do you mean by that i was


---------08:09----------
so when i was in elementary school um


---------08:12----------
so i was born uh unlucky


---------08:16----------
kind of in korea um


---------08:19----------
so when you're close when you're born


---------08:21----------
close to lunar year in korea


---------08:23----------
your age um


---------08:26----------
it's like plus two it's weird


---------08:30----------
and so then the kids get


---------08:33----------
an option to go to school early


---------08:36----------
um so my parents wanted to


---------08:40----------
decided that they wanted to like further


---------08:42----------
my education


---------08:43----------
faster so because life is a race


---------08:50----------
yeah so they put me to school early um


---------08:53----------
back then


---------08:54----------
um korea had like capital punishment


---------08:57----------
um so like i couldn't


---------09:00----------
uh keep up with class because you know


---------09:03----------
kids


---------09:04----------
if you're like back when you're a kid


---------09:08----------
like one or two years of difference


---------09:09----------
makes like a big difference


---------09:11----------
right um so i couldn't keep up with like


---------09:16----------
homework i couldn't keep up with like


---------09:17----------
answers in class


---------09:19----------
um i was like the smallest out of all


---------09:21----------
the kids


---------09:22----------
and so like whenever we would get


---------09:24----------
something warm up like multiple times


---------09:26----------
like the


---------09:26----------
teachers would like bring us up and hit


---------09:28----------
us with like a wooden stick


---------09:30----------
um in front of like all the kids um but


---------09:33----------
because like i couldn't


---------09:35----------
keep up like 99 of the time i was always


---------09:39----------
like shown


---------09:40----------
and um hit


---------09:44----------
oh no okay okay okay wait


---------09:47----------
wait wait wait wait wait wait um so this


---------09:50----------
is like first grade too


---------09:53----------
hold on


---------09:56----------
so you know how i said that there are


---------09:57----------
going to be some things that may come up


---------10:00----------
because we haven't touched this is fun


---------10:02----------
that this is fine


---------10:03----------
yeah because i talked about this like in


---------10:06----------
the stream before so this is fine


---------10:09----------
what are you feeling right now uh


---------10:13----------
that i'm sensitive what does that mean


---------10:16----------
um because i'm like tearing up a bit


---------10:19----------
is being sensitive a bad thing no


---------10:23----------
it's just annoying what's annoying about


---------10:26----------
it


---------10:26----------
because i start crying and what's


---------10:29----------
annoying about that


---------10:31----------
um because it's


---------10:35----------
i don't know i guess there's nothing


---------10:37----------
wrong with


---------10:38----------
it there's nothing wrong with what


---------10:41----------
oh crying then why do you feel annoyed


---------10:45----------
what does that word


---------10:46----------
mean annoyed because i i'm i'm like i'm


---------10:49----------
a


---------10:49----------
like i'm an easy crier it's like


---------10:52----------
i um when i talk about emotional stuff i


---------10:55----------
tend to like cry


---------10:58----------
all right i understand that you do that


---------11:00----------
i see that you do that what i'm curious


---------11:02----------
about is


---------11:03----------
your reaction to the crying


---------11:06----------
oh yeah yeah it's um it's like it's not


---------11:10----------
necessary


---------11:11----------
why isn't it necessary um because it's


---------11:14----------
okay to cry


---------11:17----------
because it's okay to show your emotions


---------11:20----------
yeah so maybe i'm maybe i'm


---------11:22----------
misunderstanding you here you know but


---------11:24----------
what i'm sort of noticing is that you


---------11:26----------
cry


---------11:27----------
and then when i ask you about crying you


---------11:29----------
say it's annoying


---------11:31----------
oh yeah yeah yeah so so the annoying


---------11:35----------
so and then when you say it's okay to


---------11:36----------
cry like i'm a little bit confused


---------11:38----------
because it seems like there's a part of


---------11:39----------
you that feels


---------11:42----------
sensitive or annoying or like maybe


---------11:44----------
you're weak or something like that


---------11:46----------
and you shouldn't cry and there's a part


---------11:48----------
of you that no no it's totally fine to


---------11:50----------
cry


---------11:50----------
that's kind of what i'm getting from you


---------11:52----------
i'm getting kind of mixed


---------11:53----------
is that yeah accurate yeah yeah


---------11:57----------
for sure yeah okay so


---------12:01----------
i know this is gonna sound weird but


---------12:04----------
i think what we're gonna try to teach


---------12:06----------
you is that


---------12:08----------
you're okay okay and the weird thing


---------12:11----------
about that


---------12:12----------
is that part of teaching you that you're


---------12:13----------
okay doesn't mean just


---------12:15----------
accept you're accepting yourself for


---------12:17----------
crying it also means


---------12:19----------
accepting yourself for being annoyed at


---------12:21----------
crying


---------12:22----------
oh okay does that make sense or is that


---------12:24----------
kind of weird


---------12:26----------
so like it's it's weird but if you feel


---------12:28----------
judgment towards yourself like oh i'm


---------12:30----------
stupid i shouldn't cry i'm too sensitive


---------12:32----------
i want you to voice those feelings too


---------12:34----------
so we can learn how to sit with those as


---------12:36----------
well


---------12:38----------
okay because i think in a weird way what


---------12:40----------
you're doing is


---------12:41----------
is you're doing to yourself what your


---------12:43----------
teachers used to do to you


---------12:46----------
yeah you say yes if that makes sense


---------12:50----------
can you explain that to us um


---------12:54----------
so like you're basically saying like um


---------12:57----------
punishing myself by making myself feel


---------13:00----------
like


---------13:01----------
it's not okay to cry or


---------13:04----------
exactly is is that what you think you


---------13:06----------
may do sometimes


---------13:09----------
yeah a lot


---------13:12----------
i think so too i think maybe being a


---------13:15----------
workaholic has something to do with that


---------13:16----------
too what do you think


---------13:18----------
yeah probably yeah all right


---------13:21----------
so we could kind of go back to the story


---------13:23----------
but like first of all you know that's


---------13:25----------
like that sounds shocking and very


---------13:26----------
difficult to go through as a child


---------13:29----------
yeah because um what would happen is


---------13:32----------
like you know how kids learn


---------13:34----------
from adults yes so like you know when


---------13:38----------
um the teachers would like you know hit


---------13:40----------
me like the other kids like during


---------13:42----------
playtime or whatever would just kind of


---------13:44----------
gather up and hit me too


---------13:48----------
and so like it kind of um


---------13:51----------
so that was like my elementary school


---------13:54----------
experience


---------13:55----------
and then like um um


---------13:59----------
and then my dad got a job in the us


---------14:02----------
and we i was taken away from like


---------14:05----------
like my parents didn't know about any of


---------14:07----------
this because i never told them


---------14:10----------
um and what's your understanding of why


---------14:12----------
you never told them


---------14:17----------
um well what would happen is like


---------14:21----------
my parents would be called to school


---------14:24----------
um and my teachers will tell


---------14:28----------
my my my parents that


---------14:31----------
i'm not doing so good and that i'm not


---------14:34----------
very smart


---------14:35----------
and i'm not like i'm kind of stupid so


---------14:37----------
like my parents


---------14:39----------
um decided to like put me through like


---------14:42----------
arts


---------14:43----------
like direction of heart because they


---------14:44----------
thought i was like


---------14:46----------
too dumb to get a real job


---------14:50----------
yeah yeah um


---------14:54----------
i um


---------14:57----------
i don't know why i didn't tell them i


---------14:59----------
think i just thought that


---------15:02----------
everything that i was doing was just


---------15:03----------
wrong


---------15:05----------
so like at that time


---------15:10----------
do you ever feel that way now that


---------15:12----------
sometimes your mind just kind of feels


---------15:14----------
like everything you're doing is wrong


---------15:16----------
um uh in some ways


---------15:21----------
yeah in some ways yeah okay


---------15:24----------
so let's just put a quick pin in that we


---------15:26----------
can maybe come back to that thought or


---------15:28----------
that feeling later


---------15:30----------
yeah and so what happened when you moved


---------15:32----------
to the u.s


---------15:34----------
um it was really nice because like i was


---------15:36----------
really shocked that


---------15:37----------
like you can make mistakes and like


---------15:40----------
teachers


---------15:43----------
like other kids don't bully you and like


---------15:45----------
that was not allowed and


---------15:47----------
um it was really nice


---------15:50----------
but you know i had trouble making


---------15:52----------
friends because of the language


---------15:54----------
barrier and


---------15:57----------
but that's when i met like i became


---------15:59----------
friends like with my japanese friend


---------16:01----------
and because she was also um she also


---------16:05----------
came to the us


---------16:06----------
um and we kind of like learned and hang


---------16:08----------
out hung out together


---------16:12----------
and then how how old were you when you


---------16:15----------
moved to the us


---------16:17----------
eight and how did you do in school


---------16:21----------
when you moved to the us um i was like


---------16:24----------
so i have a severe adhd


---------16:25----------
so i would like i did my best because


---------16:29----------
like


---------16:31----------
um my parents didn't want me to get any


---------16:33----------
like bees


---------16:35----------
um so like i did all right but i didn't


---------16:38----------
like straight a's all the time


---------16:42----------
what what's your understanding what your


---------16:44----------
cat is doing right now


---------16:47----------
she loves me does she do that


---------16:52----------
or does she she's she cuddles


---------16:55----------
she wants cuddles 24 7. okay so this


---------16:59----------
isn't yeah it's not like she's


---------17:00----------
she can tell you're suffering or


---------17:01----------
anything and is coming over to


---------17:03----------
um sometimes sometimes


---------17:07----------
sometimes she's timed really well


---------17:10----------
okay and i know like if i whenever i


---------17:12----------
leave to take out the trash


---------17:14----------
she starts crying like yelling


---------17:18----------
um so i know she's very attached to me


---------17:23----------
um yeah she's cute she's really really


---------17:26----------
she does seem very comfortable yeah she


---------17:29----------
like


---------17:31----------
she's like to snuggle like right here


---------17:33----------
when i


---------17:34----------
go to sleep she's very cute


---------17:37----------
awesome and so


---------17:40----------
it sounds like you did okay in school


---------17:42----------
but your parents put some pressure on


---------17:44----------
you but you were generally relieved


---------17:46----------
when you moved here yeah yeah


---------17:50----------
and then they relief and what was it


---------17:54----------
like to have a friend


---------17:56----------
i was nice oh it was really nice i


---------17:59----------
remember like


---------18:01----------
um back when i was in south korea


---------18:04----------
i had like one friend i was like


---------18:08----------
i managed to convince one friend to come


---------18:11----------
over


---------18:12----------
or like to convince a person to come


---------18:14----------
over and


---------18:15----------
play and hang out and i had so much fun


---------18:18----------
and then when


---------18:19----------
that person left i cried so much


---------18:22----------
during like that time because it was


---------18:24----------
like


---------18:25----------
and then so now i have when i had a


---------18:28----------
friend who came up for all the time


---------18:29----------
it was awesome and when did your friend


---------18:33----------
leave to japan


---------18:36----------
um like in middle school


---------18:40----------
like like in the middle of school i


---------18:42----------
would say like mid or ends i


---------18:44----------
can't remember exactly i think middle of


---------18:47----------
middle school


---------18:48----------
because i had another friend that was


---------18:49----------
really close to but she also moved


---------18:54----------
hmm


---------18:56----------
it seems like your friends always leave


---------18:57----------
you yeah


---------19:00----------
yeah yeah


---------19:03----------
is that funny no i laugh


---------19:07----------
when i laugh i laugh


---------19:10----------
when i feel sad sometimes it's like it's


---------19:12----------
like my go-to


---------19:14----------
um yeah i laugh when i'm awkward i laugh


---------19:18----------
when i'm sad


---------19:19----------
um sometimes i laugh when i'm pissed off


---------19:22----------
i it's like my go-to um it's very


---------19:26----------
protective isn't it


---------19:27----------
stay yeah what do you so you


---------19:30----------
what do you think about that sort of


---------19:31----------
like growing up and having your friends


---------19:34----------
like


---------19:36----------
because here's here's kind of what i'm


---------19:37----------
envisioning so first of all you know you


---------19:39----------
were taught


---------19:40----------
early on that you suck


---------19:44----------
right like that's that's what i'm


---------19:46----------
hearing like your teachers used to like


---------19:48----------
you were you were put into the situation


---------19:50----------
where like you were you know the deck is


---------19:52----------
stacked against you


---------19:55----------
and and like it sounds really really


---------19:58----------
hard


---------19:59----------
but you were taught this lesson and i i


---------20:01----------
didn't curse to me that i was a little


---------20:03----------
insensitive to say that but


---------20:04----------
honestly that was the best way that i


---------20:06----------
could encapsulate like what i


---------20:08----------
imagined a child like that feels like


---------20:13----------
where your teachers would like publicly


---------20:15----------
shame you


---------20:16----------
and sort of tell you again and again and


---------20:19----------
again that you're not good enough you're


---------20:21----------
not good enough you're not good enough


---------20:23----------
and then furthermore the other kids


---------20:25----------
would be like oh she's the one who's not


---------20:27----------
good enough and we're supposed to hit


---------20:29----------
her


---------20:29----------
okay you know and so you were taught


---------20:33----------
that other


---------20:34----------
children were like not people that you


---------20:36----------
could connect with


---------20:39----------
and then you managed to find a friend


---------20:41----------
you know another little awkward


---------20:43----------
immigrant who maybe has language


---------20:44----------
barriers and you can connect to her


---------20:49----------
and then she leaves and then never talks


---------20:52----------
to you again


---------20:54----------
yep and how did you feel


---------20:57----------
like what thoughts went through your


---------20:59----------
head when she left and


---------21:01----------
not just when she left but when she


---------21:02----------
didn't well


---------21:04----------
i think back then because i'm i'm like


---------21:06----------
i'm 30 i'm turning 31


---------21:08----------
really soon so like back then it was


---------21:10----------
hard to


---------21:11----------
communicate outside of because like


---------21:14----------
there


---------21:15----------
on social media it was there was only me


---------21:17----------
email right


---------21:18----------
and you know um she didn't have like a


---------21:21----------
number or so but she did give like


---------21:23----------
me like her dad's email um


---------21:27----------
and i wrote her and stuff i like her


---------21:30----------
address


---------21:31----------
but i just never got like a response


---------21:33----------
back


---------21:35----------
so um i didn't really think much of it i


---------21:38----------
just thought oh she probably can't


---------21:42----------
like because it's her dad email or um


---------21:47----------
so it sounds to me like you attributed


---------21:50----------
reasons to her not responding


---------21:53----------
yeah yeah and is there a part of you


---------21:56----------
that sort of felt like


---------21:58----------
even though all that stuff may have been


---------21:59----------
true that she sort of didn't


---------22:01----------
care to respond or didn't care enough


---------22:03----------
about you


---------22:05----------
um


---------22:05----------
[Music]


---------22:08----------
i think like i i mean


---------22:11----------
i guess when i think about it now it


---------22:13----------
feels like that i think back then i just


---------22:15----------
kind of


---------22:16----------
because i tried for like four years


---------22:20----------
so long um yeah so i didn't


---------22:24----------
like i don't i don't know i just


---------22:27----------
i didn't really think like she doesn't


---------22:29----------
care about me i


---------22:30----------
constantly think oh she probably just


---------22:33----------
can't


---------22:34----------
reach back for some reason okay


---------22:38----------
and so it sounds like you made another


---------22:39----------
friend in middle middle school


---------22:41----------
yeah i've made another friend and then


---------22:44----------
but


---------22:45----------
she actually also moved away


---------22:48----------
out of state and how did you feel about


---------22:50----------
that do you remember


---------22:52----------
uh i thought oh crap


---------22:56----------
um i was sad about it but


---------23:00----------
you know i was like oh i could just i'll


---------23:03----------
make another friend


---------23:04----------
in high school and you made another


---------23:07----------
friend


---------23:08----------
in high school yeah i did i made a


---------23:10----------
another friend in high school


---------23:13----------
and she and i were really close


---------23:16----------
were yeah because she


---------23:20----------
kind of just suddenly like became


---------23:23----------
because she was like her family was


---------23:25----------
super religious


---------23:26----------
but she herself was she was still


---------23:29----------
religious but she wasn't fanatical


---------23:32----------
and then like she would hang out with me


---------23:34----------
all the time we would go watch movies we


---------23:36----------
would play games we would


---------23:38----------
um listen to music and like her parents


---------23:41----------
like found out


---------23:42----------
and like told her like you know


---------23:45----------
if she continues to watch movies um


---------23:51----------
listen to music then they'll like


---------23:53----------
abandon her


---------23:55----------
you know you know besides her yeah like


---------23:58----------
shun her


---------24:00----------
yeah you know this sounds really crazy


---------24:03----------
but it seems like life conspires to take


---------24:06----------
people away from you


---------24:08----------
yeah oh but i don't feel yeah


---------24:11----------
yeah i sometimes feel like that


---------24:16----------
that's weird


---------24:19----------
is that just are you just unlucky or


---------24:21----------
what's going on like how do we


---------24:22----------
understand that


---------24:24----------
um is it just a feeling like


---------24:27----------
how do you make sound i have no idea it


---------24:30----------
just


---------24:31----------
happens yeah


---------24:34----------
do you feel lonely


---------24:38----------
yeah but


---------24:41----------
i mean i have one


---------24:45----------
like i have one really close friend now


---------24:47----------
so like


---------24:48----------
i feel less lonely now because i feel


---------24:51----------
like when i have one


---------24:53----------
like all i need is like one close friend


---------24:55----------
sure


---------24:57----------
and um so now i feel like


---------25:00----------
less lonely i would say


---------25:05----------
let me think about how to say this


---------25:11----------
i can see that you can survive with just


---------25:14----------
one close friend


---------25:17----------
yeah and at the same time i think it's


---------25:20----------
really sad


---------25:21----------
when people can grow


---------25:24----------
accustomed to being


---------25:28----------
okay with the bare minimum of what they


---------25:30----------
really deserve in life


---------25:33----------
it's actually one of the saddest things


---------25:35----------
to me really when people get used to it


---------25:37----------
yeah


---------25:40----------
oh


---------25:43----------
what do you think so i should make more


---------25:46----------
friends


---------25:48----------
do you want more friends i do have


---------25:50----------
friends like i have


---------25:51----------
um i do have like


---------25:54----------
but i have like one close friend and


---------25:57----------
then i have like


---------25:58----------
friends i can hit up sometimes


---------26:02----------
now because um i made a lot of streamer


---------26:05----------
friends


---------26:07----------
um so


---------26:10----------
yeah it's but i feel also feel bad


---------26:13----------
because i don't have time


---------26:15----------
a lot of time to hang out with a lot of


---------26:18----------
them


---------26:19----------
because i'm too busy working sure


---------26:22----------
yeah i


---------26:27----------
can i think for a second yeah


---------26:46----------
i'm trying to figure out where to go can


---------26:48----------
i just think out loud


---------26:50----------
yeah yeah you can yeah you can help me


---------26:53----------
so first is that like you know we can


---------26:55----------
continue talking about your feelings and


---------26:57----------
trying to explore where things


---------26:59----------
come from and you know how you feel and


---------27:01----------
what you think about stuff


---------27:03----------
you asked me an interesting question you


---------27:04----------
said should i make more friends


---------27:07----------
and so that is what we that's kind of


---------27:09----------
like a problem-solving sort of thing so


---------27:10----------
like i


---------27:11----------
i don't always give people advice they


---------27:12----------
don't tell people that they should do x


---------27:14----------
y or z because i mean


---------27:15----------
who am i to say i mean and my


---------27:18----------
my gut reaction to that answer is like


---------27:20----------
you know it can be hard to


---------27:23----------
have just one friend because


---------27:27----------
life circumstances can take people away


---------27:29----------
from you


---------27:30----------
right yeah and so there's a part of me


---------27:32----------
that sort of says you should diversify


---------27:35----------
so that if someone has something going


---------27:37----------
on then then like


---------27:39----------
you know you're not stuck friendless for


---------27:40----------
a while in forming one connection but


---------27:42----------
you know that's that's just sort of it's


---------27:43----------
an intellectual answer i don't know that


---------27:45----------
you should make for


---------27:46----------
friends i think it's like that's a


---------27:47----------
question for you to decide


---------27:49----------
yeah um and then there are a couple of


---------27:53----------
other things so we can kind of continue


---------27:54----------
talking about friends and stuff like


---------27:55----------
that we can just switch


---------27:57----------
to sort of switch gears but i i think


---------27:58----------
it's all going to come back to this


---------28:00----------
because i think it didn't


---------28:01----------
i mean i don't know why but like it


---------28:03----------
feels to me like


---------28:04----------
you know growing up the way that you did


---------28:06----------
is gonna significantly give you social


---------28:08----------
anxiety


---------28:10----------
yeah and and so you know we can talk a


---------28:14----------
little bit about what social anxiety


---------28:15----------
feels like in the moment


---------28:17----------
what is it that keeps you from making


---------28:19----------
friends what


---------28:20----------
why is it that you make sort of one


---------28:22----------
friend at a time like how does that


---------28:24----------
happen


---------28:24----------
and why doesn't that number become two


---------28:27----------
and i suspect that that has something to


---------28:29----------
do with the way


---------28:30----------
that you interact with them not the way


---------28:31----------
that they interact with you


---------28:33----------
that you probably do certain things


---------28:35----------
until you find a friend


---------28:37----------
and then you stop doing those things


---------28:40----------
because then you have a friend like what


---------28:43----------
do you mean i'm not sure


---------28:44----------
that's why we can kind of talk about


---------28:46----------
that okay so because it is weird that


---------28:48----------
like you


---------28:49----------
there's got to be a reason why you have


---------28:50----------
one friend at a time basically


---------28:53----------
like that can't just be coincidence it


---------28:54----------
has to do you know


---------28:56----------
yeah i'm gonna sort of use a completely


---------29:00----------
like different kind of random and maybe


---------29:01----------
inappropriate example but like


---------29:03----------
you know sometimes i've worked with


---------29:04----------
people who have a lot of affairs


---------29:06----------
and it's like it's not a coincidence


---------29:08----------
that they keep having affairs it's like


---------29:10----------
they're doing something to put


---------29:12----------
themselves in a particular situation


---------29:14----------
where they create a particular kind of


---------29:17----------
social situation


---------29:18----------
and in your case you know i don't think


---------29:22----------
it's just like there's like just


---------29:23----------
randomly one person that you can connect


---------29:25----------
with i think something happens about


---------29:27----------
you know once you make a friend you


---------29:29----------
probably like either you start spending


---------29:31----------
a lot of time with them so you don't


---------29:32----------
have time to make other friends or


---------29:34----------
since that's enough for you you stop


---------29:38----------
eating because you feel full or not full


---------29:42----------
but you just don't feel hungry enough


---------29:43----------
[Music]


---------29:46----------
i see yeah what do you think about that


---------29:51----------
it's interesting i never thought about


---------29:52----------
it that way


---------29:55----------
um


---------29:59----------
i think like like for me what happens is


---------30:02----------
like


---------30:03----------
um


---------30:07----------
like i like i put


---------30:10----------
like i work a lot because like it's


---------30:12----------
where i feel like the safest


---------30:14----------
yep we're gonna get into that in a


---------30:16----------
second i'm good i'm glad you realize


---------30:17----------
that


---------30:18----------
saved us a lot of time yeah and then


---------30:21----------
like um


---------30:24----------
and


---------30:27----------
like i have i think i choose to have one


---------30:30----------
friend because like


---------30:31----------
um


---------30:35----------
with this one i don't feel


---------30:39----------
anxiety when i hang out with him because


---------30:42----------
he lets me work


---------30:43----------
when i'm hanging out um


---------30:47----------
so like i think


---------30:51----------
i i'm trying to figure out my reasons


---------30:53----------
why like i only


---------30:54----------
choose that one friend at a time um


---------31:01----------
i think it's i don't know i because i i


---------31:03----------
connect


---------31:05----------
really well when i have like one close


---------31:07----------
friend


---------31:08----------
because i do have like other friends i


---------31:10----------
can hit up


---------31:11----------
i think it's just that whenever i play


---------31:16----------
games or i'm away from my work fully


---------31:20----------
i get really anxious to go back to


---------31:23----------
working


---------31:23----------
so like um


---------31:27----------
like i guess like my close friend


---------31:28----------
understands that


---------31:30----------
so like when we hang out i'm still


---------31:33----------
working and he's totally cool with


---------31:35----------
it um


---------31:38----------
i also find myself being really curious


---------31:40----------
yuna and this is definitely a boundary


---------31:42----------
that we don't have to talk about but i'm


---------31:44----------
really curious about your romantic


---------31:46----------
relationships


---------31:47----------
and if you've had them um


---------31:52----------
and that that you know some people


---------31:53----------
aren't comfortable talking about that so


---------31:55----------
i i think it could be informative and


---------31:56----------
our goal here is to help you understand


---------31:58----------
yourself


---------31:59----------
and at the same time i can imagine that


---------32:01----------
you of all people would be quite private


---------32:03----------
so i want to steer clear of that if you


---------32:04----------
don't want to talk about it


---------32:07----------
yeah i can talk about


---------32:11----------
um let me let me think about it for a


---------32:14----------
second


---------32:19----------
um


---------32:24----------
yeah i guess i don't i don't know if i


---------32:26----------
want to get into makes perfect sense


---------32:29----------
i think we have a lot of stuff a lot of


---------32:31----------
other things that we can talk about


---------32:32----------
that'll be very productive


---------32:34----------
yeah so let's talk about the anxiety of


---------32:37----------
being a workaholic like to


---------32:39----------
help me understand what you mean by


---------32:40----------
anxiety when you're not working


---------32:42----------
um when i'm not working


---------32:45----------
and i'm like doing something else like


---------32:47----------
playing games or socializing i


---------32:49----------
i'm like i feel like i have this like i


---------32:52----------
don't know why


---------32:53----------
i know it's not right but i feel like


---------32:54----------
i'm wasting time because


---------32:57----------
i'm always i'm like oh but i have to do


---------32:59----------
this and if i


---------33:00----------
can get this done or like um


---------33:04----------
like and then i don't actually actively


---------33:07----------
think this i just feel it


---------33:10----------
feel like


---------33:13----------
like impatience like you're pointing to


---------33:16----------
your stomach


---------33:17----------
yeah like i don't know how to explain


---------33:21----------
that it's like


---------33:25----------
when you take a lot of caffeine it's


---------33:27----------
like i don't know how to explain that


---------33:28----------
it's um


---------33:31----------
i feel anxious


---------33:34----------
do you do you remember what you this is


---------33:36----------
to be kind of a weird shot in the dark


---------33:38----------
but do you remember


---------33:39----------
did you know when you were growing up in


---------33:42----------
korea that you were going to get called


---------33:44----------
on


---------33:44----------
and that you were going to get the


---------33:45----------
answer wrong


---------33:49----------
did you see it coming oh yeah do you


---------33:51----------
remember


---------33:52----------
how you felt when you saw it coming


---------33:57----------
scared is that the way that you feel now


---------34:00----------
when you feel anxious


---------34:02----------
yeah yeah let's see yeah how similar is


---------34:06----------
the feeling on a scale of one to ten


---------34:08----------
ten being exactly the same one being um


---------34:11----------
it's similar i would say it's similar


---------34:13----------
it's not exactly the same because


---------34:15----------
back then it was scarier yeah so so so


---------34:20----------
i i think what i'm hearing is that the


---------34:21----------
quality


---------34:23----------
of the feeling is the same the intensity


---------34:26----------
of the feeling is lower yeah


---------34:28----------
yeah and the more you work


---------34:32----------
the more the feeling goes away


---------34:36----------
yeah yeah i just feel safer when i'm


---------34:39----------
working


---------34:40----------
yep and so i know this sounds kind of


---------34:43----------
weird but like


---------34:44----------
this is gonna be a real stretch okay so


---------34:47----------
if it doesn't make sense


---------34:48----------
totally my fault but i think the reason


---------34:50----------
you're a workaholic


---------34:52----------
is because that's the way that your body


---------34:54----------
has learned how to avoid going up in


---------34:56----------
front of the classroom and getting


---------34:58----------
smacked with a stick


---------35:01----------
um i think like


---------35:06----------
i think that it's


---------35:09----------
true but i also feel like i'm a


---------35:11----------
workaholic because i feel like all my


---------35:13----------
worth is tied to my work for some reason


---------35:16----------
yes yeah that's not for some reason it's


---------35:20----------
the same


---------35:20----------
i mean so oh okay right so like let's


---------35:23----------
think about this what was your worth


---------35:25----------
tied to when you were growing up


---------35:28----------
me answering questions your performance


---------35:32----------
right yeah yeah and so you were taught


---------35:34----------
that you were like not a good human


---------35:36----------
being


---------35:37----------
because your performance is bad


---------35:40----------
yeah and now like when your performance


---------35:43----------
is bad how do you feel you know


---------35:46----------
really really really really really


---------35:47----------
really really bad


---------35:49----------
and do you feel like you did when you


---------35:51----------
were up front in front of a classroom


---------35:54----------
and um


---------35:57----------
the quality is the same like you were


---------35:59----------
saying definitely not as


---------36:01----------
um intense yeah sure yeah


---------36:05----------
and at the same time you used a lot of


---------36:07----------
reallys there


---------36:10----------
oh yeah that's true all right you're


---------36:12----------
like really really really really really


---------36:14----------
really bad


---------36:15----------
you're right that's true oh my gosh


---------36:24----------
what do you think about that


---------36:28----------
um i just never realized i it's just


---------36:31----------
late


---------36:34----------
it's just like so many connections are


---------36:37----------
being made i didn't


---------36:38----------
i didn't realize it before


---------36:43----------
um what do i think about it


---------36:46----------
um you could just sit for a second and


---------36:49----------
process


---------36:51----------
but yeah or you can say something


---------36:53----------
whatever you want to do


---------36:56----------
um


---------37:00----------
it makes sense um


---------37:11----------
i would say um it makes sense and


---------37:14----------
i guess it's not it's not necessary for


---------37:18----------
me to feel that way


---------37:20----------
sure it is what do you mean it's not


---------37:23----------
necessary help me understand that


---------37:26----------
i i think i'm kind of getting confused


---------37:30----------
i think my mind is staying like like my


---------37:33----------
mind is kind of getting confused


---------37:35----------
what are you confused by um i just said


---------37:38----------
something that was


---------37:38----------
kind of weird and contradictory so if


---------37:40----------
that's confusing you that was the


---------37:42----------
intention of my statement


---------37:43----------
oh no i'm like i'm trying to figure out


---------37:46----------
like how i feel about it but i don't


---------37:49----------
feel


---------37:49----------
good about it i feel good about what uh


---------37:52----------
i don't feel good about


---------37:54----------
that i um


---------37:59----------
punish myself for um


---------38:03----------
right not doing well yep


---------38:06----------
so remember when i said acceptance is


---------38:09----------
not just


---------38:11----------
saying it's okay to cry it's also


---------38:13----------
accepting what


---------38:16----------
um accepting that you


---------38:19----------
judge yourself for crying yeah yeah


---------38:23----------
right so i think you're doing the same


---------38:25----------
thing here


---------38:27----------
where you're not you're judging you're


---------38:30----------
punishing yourself for whatever


---------38:32----------
the reaction is it doesn't it sort of


---------38:33----------
doesn't matter


---------38:35----------
yeah even in this discussion what i'm


---------38:39----------
kind of hearing from you is that


---------38:42----------
i think part of the reason that what you


---------38:44----------
describe is confusion


---------38:46----------
and i can understand what feels like


---------38:48----------
confusion now i'm really maybe confusing


---------38:50----------
you so apologies but


---------38:51----------
i think part of what's confusing is that


---------38:53----------
like they're you're making revelations


---------38:55----------
and you're also judging those


---------38:57----------
revelations


---------38:58----------
and telling yourself at the same time oh


---------39:01----------
this should be different


---------39:06----------
is that going on um


---------39:09----------
[Music]


---------39:12----------
yeah i would say so and what are you


---------39:15----------
saying about yourself that should be


---------39:16----------
different tell us what should be


---------39:18----------
different about you


---------39:21----------
um well i just i feel like i should


---------39:26----------
um i


---------39:29----------
guess i should just not feel that i mean


---------39:32----------
i guess


---------39:32----------
i should just not feel like i'm judging


---------39:35----------
like


---------39:36----------
i shouldn't judge myself yep but that in


---------39:38----------
and of itself is you judging yourself


---------39:40----------
for not judging yourself oh no


---------39:42----------
i don't know what to do exactly exactly


---------39:44----------
that's the point


---------39:45----------
that's the point no no you're good good


---------39:47----------
good good good


---------39:48----------
that's what you do about it like you see


---------39:51----------
like


---------39:51----------
it goes on forever yeah


---------39:55----------
you can judge yourself for not judging


---------39:56----------
yourself for not judging yourself you


---------39:58----------
can ju


---------39:58----------
like you just keeps going on forever


---------40:01----------
yeah and so that's why that's why i'm


---------40:03----------
pointing it out to you because as long


---------40:05----------
as you judge yourself like as long as


---------40:06----------
there's any kind of judgment towards


---------40:08----------
yourself it'll like it'll it's never


---------40:09----------
gonna work


---------40:10----------
it's actually the same thing that


---------40:14----------
has put on a mask


---------40:17----------
but it's the same lack of acceptance and


---------40:20----------
judgment towards yourself for not being


---------40:21----------
good


---------40:22----------
good enough and you see how quickly it


---------40:24----------
moves it's like


---------40:25----------
oh you should be more accepting of


---------40:26----------
yourself


---------40:28----------
how dare you be less accepting of


---------40:30----------
yourself you know that's a judgment


---------40:32----------
yeah right and and so so this is what


---------40:36----------
happens is there's a part of your mind


---------40:39----------
that when you feel kind of insecure or


---------40:41----------
anxious


---------40:42----------
is gonna tell you yoona you need to do


---------40:44----------
better


---------40:47----------
yeah and even in this conversation it's


---------40:49----------
like it's telling you like oh you know


---------40:50----------
like you need to be less confusing


---------40:52----------
you need to like you need to be able to


---------40:54----------
listen and understand what he's saying


---------40:56----------
like you're going to be judging yourself


---------40:57----------
constantly whereas you're doing great


---------40:59----------
i can guarantee if there's any


---------41:00----------
communication problem in this


---------41:01----------
conversation it's totally on me


---------41:04----------
because i can be really hard to talk to


---------41:07----------
what do you think about that oh god i


---------41:09----------
just dreamt um


---------41:11----------
no you're awesome i don't i think you're


---------41:14----------
really easy to talk to


---------41:16----------
um i think um


---------41:19----------
you're right i shouldn't i shouldn't


---------41:22----------
judge


---------41:24----------
you're doing it again oh my god okay


---------41:27----------
wait i don't know what to do i know it's


---------41:29----------
really confusing


---------41:30----------
it's really confusing right so so this


---------41:33----------
way


---------41:33----------
like i know it sounds weird but at the


---------41:35----------
very beginning i said it's okay to judge


---------41:37----------
yourself


---------41:42----------
so because okay


---------41:46----------
because if you if you say it's okay to


---------41:49----------
judge yourself


---------41:50----------
you're not judging yourself for judging


---------41:52----------
yourself you're accepting yourself


---------41:56----------
okay i see see it's weird


---------42:01----------
yeah and it feels really foreign to you


---------42:05----------
like you don't


---------42:06----------
know how to do that you don't know how


---------42:08----------
to yeah


---------42:09----------
that's really weird how do you do that


---------42:12----------
it's really confusing and it's hard


---------42:14----------
trust me


---------42:14----------
yeah right because as a kid you were


---------42:17----------
taught how to judge yourself


---------42:19----------
you were judged by your teachers you


---------42:22----------
haven't really touched on parents will


---------42:23----------
probably steer clear of that because but


---------42:24----------
you're probably judged by your parents


---------42:26----------
because all of our parents judge us you


---------42:28----------
know you should do art because you're


---------42:29----------
not smart enough etc


---------42:33----------
you know and i mean they wanted to do


---------42:34----------
the best that they could for you and


---------42:36----------
they yeah


---------42:36----------
you know so they their heart was in the


---------42:38----------
right place but sometimes


---------42:40----------
you know that can still leave


---------42:42----------
psychological


---------42:44----------
imprints um and so i know it sounds


---------42:47----------
really really weird


---------42:49----------
to accept yourself and i know it's gonna


---------42:51----------
be really really confusing for you but i


---------42:53----------
think it's gonna


---------42:54----------
be like really really transformative


---------42:56----------
when you learn how to do it


---------42:59----------
because then suddenly you don't have to


---------43:00----------
be a workaholic


---------43:02----------
the only friends that i like being like


---------43:05----------
yes you do so let's talk about that that


---------43:08----------
was nice


---------43:09----------
what feels nice i love working what do


---------43:12----------
you love about working


---------43:14----------
it's fun okay it's


---------43:18----------
fun i love i l it's like but


---------43:21----------
my work is like my hobby as well so


---------43:24----------
um i love doing it


---------43:28----------
and i get really proud when i


---------43:32----------
wha i get proud and of the stuff that i


---------43:35----------
create


---------43:36----------
at the same time i'm always i have a


---------43:40----------
really severe imposter syndrome


---------43:43----------
so i'm like i'm proud of it but


---------43:47----------
at the same time i can't be it's weird


---------43:51----------
just like it's like um


---------43:54----------
because in my head i'm like oh it's not


---------43:56----------
a big deal because


---------43:58----------
you know if i can do it like why why is


---------44:01----------
it that special because i


---------44:02----------
i did it so it must not be that special


---------44:05----------
because


---------44:05----------
if i can do it anybody can do it um


---------44:09----------
so i guess yeah i have like i struggle


---------44:14----------
with a lot


---------44:14----------
i struggle with a lot of like being


---------44:16----------
proud of the things like i am proud like


---------44:19----------
i tell myself


---------44:20----------
that to be proud of it and to be happy


---------44:23----------
with


---------44:23----------
it but like i struggle with that a lot


---------44:25----------
because


---------44:27----------
um i don't actually feel it


---------44:31----------
yep what do you feel


---------44:34----------
i don't feel anything like i actually


---------44:37----------
like as a


---------44:38----------
like when i make something and i create


---------44:40----------
something and i know it's good like in


---------44:41----------
my head


---------44:42----------
i know it's good because


---------44:47----------
you know i get told that it's good


---------44:50----------
but like i myself


---------44:54----------
i tell it to myself i don't feel


---------44:58----------
um like oh this is awesome


---------45:02----------
oh what i created was awesome um


---------45:05----------
i tell it to myself i don't feel it i


---------45:07----------
don't know how to explain it do you feel


---------45:09----------
like


---------45:09----------
it's bad or you just don't


---------45:12----------
feel like yeah yeah i feel like it's bad


---------45:15----------
because


---------45:16----------
i'm like i shouldn't be so prideful


---------45:17----------
because like


---------45:19----------
you know at the end of the day i mean i


---------45:22----------
don't know i keep telling i keep pushing


---------45:24----------
my i keep putting myself down


---------45:25----------
honestly like when i think about it


---------45:27----------
because i always say like


---------45:29----------
oh i shouldn't be that proud because


---------45:32----------
like my code sucks there's so many


---------45:36----------
different ways to make this better like


---------45:38----------
you know it's so messy um


---------45:41----------
you know there's so many people that's


---------45:42----------
way better than


---------45:45----------
i am with like with coding and


---------45:48----------
um so like why should i like i shouldn't


---------45:51----------
feel


---------45:52----------
proud of it because it and at the end of


---------45:54----------
the day it kind of sucks so i need to do


---------45:56----------
better i need to fix


---------45:57----------
it um i'm not doing enough


---------46:00----------
um all this stuff


---------46:04----------
yeah right so here's what i'm hearing is


---------46:06----------
that it's not


---------46:07----------
good enough yeah


---------46:11----------
right because yuna isn't someone who is


---------46:13----------
good enough


---------46:16----------
yeah so even though


---------46:19----------
so so this is the tricky thing is that


---------46:21----------
there's like eight-year-old yoona


---------46:24----------
or six-year-old you know a four-year-old


---------46:26----------
yuna or whenever you started school


---------46:28----------
and then there's almost 31 year old yuna


---------46:32----------
an almost 31 year old yoona knows that


---------46:35----------
what she puts out is good


---------46:37----------
but inside there's like six-year-old


---------46:39----------
yuna who like every time she does her


---------46:41----------
best


---------46:42----------
what happens to her


---------46:46----------
um she gets like not you know what's


---------46:50----------
funny


---------46:51----------
i have adhd but i want to tell you a


---------46:53----------
funny story please


---------46:55----------
um i loved it so one time i found a


---------46:58----------
wooden stick


---------47:00----------
like a lay a big long one inside i don't


---------47:02----------
know i found it


---------47:03----------
this big long stick that like it's the


---------47:06----------
stick that you used to hit


---------47:07----------
people with right like the same ones


---------47:09----------
that they used


---------47:11----------
in the um schools and stuff i i found


---------47:14----------
the stick


---------47:15----------
and i was proud of finding the stick and


---------47:18----------
i brought it to school because


---------47:20----------
to defend myself and instead my teacher


---------47:23----------
took the stick


---------47:24----------
and used that stick to punish me


---------47:28----------
for like the the rest of


---------47:31----------
that was like her favorite stick um


---------47:34----------
so yeah it feels like it feels like um


---------47:39----------
i don't know why i've segued into that


---------47:40----------
story um i just when you told me like


---------47:43----------
how do i feel


---------47:44----------
about me getting hit um excuse


---------47:47----------
yourself like me getting hit like


---------47:51----------
like i i just that that one was like the


---------47:53----------
most shocking


---------47:56----------
like yeah i think that your mind is not


---------47:59----------
adhd there i think that is forming a


---------48:01----------
really important connection


---------48:03----------
that is actually exactly what we're


---------48:05----------
talking about


---------48:06----------
because i want to tell you i'm going to


---------48:08----------
interpret that story for you


---------48:10----------
in a way that i mean i sometimes is just


---------48:13----------
blows my mind


---------48:14----------
so what that story tells me is when yuna


---------48:17----------
tries to do something good in life


---------48:19----------
what happens


---------48:22----------
when she tries to take control it gets


---------48:26----------
turned around right so every time you


---------48:29----------
tell yourself


---------48:30----------
i'm doing a good job now this is good i


---------48:32----------
should be proud of this


---------48:35----------
inside is the girl who's like we tried


---------48:37----------
to take control we tried to move forward


---------48:40----------
we tried to get better


---------48:41----------
and we got beat yeah


---------48:46----------
like it's like like that's that's the


---------48:48----------
most important story you've shared


---------48:51----------
because it's the story that taught you


---------48:53----------
that you can't


---------48:54----------
make you can't change your life


---------48:58----------
yeah it's one thing to have your life


---------49:01----------
against you


---------49:02----------
it's another thing to try to change it


---------49:05----------
and be like beat with that stick for the


---------49:07----------
rest of elementary school


---------49:10----------
yep so like when you tell yourself that


---------49:15----------
like


---------49:15----------
hey i'm i'm a good person now i make


---------49:18----------
content that's good


---------49:19----------
i should be proud of this code that's


---------49:21----------
you picking up the stick again


---------49:23----------
[Music]


---------49:25----------
and then there's a part of you that's


---------49:26----------
like uh-uh we've been down that road


---------49:29----------
before it does not end well


---------49:31----------
who are you to pick up that stick you


---------49:33----------
better just leave it on the ground


---------49:39----------
[Music]


---------49:43----------
sorry oh wait i'm not that sorry


---------49:50----------
no so what i want you to say is i'm


---------49:52----------
sorry for crying and it's


---------49:53----------
okay for me to be apologetic for


---------49:55----------
something that i shouldn't


---------49:56----------
be apologizing for you just cry just


---------49:59----------
just sit


---------50:01----------
here


---------50:06----------
you want a tissue or something yeah i'm


---------50:10----------
gonna get one


---------50:11----------
sorry


---------50:25----------
let's see if she figures this out


---------50:30----------
all right okay


---------50:33----------
i'm just going to stand up for a second


---------50:35----------
okay so before


---------50:37----------
this is civilian so before before um we


---------50:40----------
had our interview you know i was telling


---------50:41----------
you i like to connect with twitch chat


---------50:43----------
so someone asked a question in chat what


---------50:45----------
should you do


---------50:47----------
when someone starts crying and then i


---------50:50----------
was telling them that you have to learn


---------50:51----------
how to sit with it and then someone in


---------50:53----------
chat was like can you stand with it and


---------50:54----------
i was like yes you could stand with it


---------50:56----------
and it's just a little but yeah yeah


---------50:59----------
it's it's


---------51:00----------
so what what are you feeling now what


---------51:01----------
was why did you start crying


---------51:12----------
um


---------51:17----------
i felt sad and then i felt embarrassed


---------51:19----------
and then i felt


---------51:20----------
and then i felt um when i said sorry i


---------51:24----------
felt


---------51:24----------
bad about that and then i felt


---------51:27----------
so i need to say sorry again and i felt


---------51:30----------
bad about that


---------51:32----------
yeah it's like it's it's it's the whole


---------51:34----------
cycle yeah and what are you feeling now


---------51:38----------
um


---------51:42----------
um


---------51:44----------
[Music]


---------51:46----------
uh giggling yeah right


---------51:49----------
so so i think i think so you you know


---------51:52----------
you asked me earlier what do i do about


---------51:54----------
that


---------51:54----------
and this is exactly what you do about it


---------51:57----------
you kind of like huh yes absolutely


---------52:00----------
right


---------52:01----------
right so like you sort of like recognize


---------52:03----------
the absurdity of it


---------52:05----------
and then all you can do is sort of laugh


---------52:08----------
you don't fight against it you don't try


---------52:11----------
to change you're just like


---------52:13----------
oh look at how crazy that is that's


---------52:16----------
ridiculous


---------52:18----------
and that's actually the first step so


---------52:19----------
there's a there's a funny kind of


---------52:21----------
tradition in zen buddhism that when zen


---------52:25----------
buddhist masters become enlightened the


---------52:27----------
first thing that they do


---------52:29----------
is laugh yeah and it's because they


---------52:31----------
realized that all this work that they


---------52:33----------
were doing was


---------52:34----------
never necessary yeah


---------52:38----------
and so as best as you can just kind of


---------52:40----------
notice it


---------52:41----------
and and just be like okay like because


---------52:43----------
at some point i think something magical


---------52:45----------
happens when you


---------52:46----------
stop apologizing and judging yourself


---------52:49----------
is you wind up laughing you're like well


---------52:53----------
yeah nothing i can do about that


---------52:56----------
lol right


---------53:00----------
yeah and then what happens is i know it


---------53:02----------
sounds kind of weird but like over time


---------53:04----------
as you


---------53:04----------
learn how to do that and the things that


---------53:07----------
you're and then what's going to happen


---------53:08----------
is the judgment is going to start to


---------53:09----------
melt away


---------53:11----------
as you learn how to like you're


---------53:13----------
accepting it because you're saying oh


---------53:14----------
yeah


---------53:15----------
you're not trying to change anything


---------53:16----------
you're just sort of saying like okay


---------53:17----------
like


---------53:18----------
that's ridiculous like that's not gonna


---------53:20----------
go anywhere well


---------53:22----------
and then you move on with the rest of


---------53:23----------
your day and every time you do that


---------53:26----------
every time you become


---------53:27----------
aware of the cycle the cycle actually


---------53:30----------
starts to break apart a little bit


---------53:33----------
and it's the cycle that i think is


---------53:35----------
really causing you


---------53:36----------
a lot of suffering and it's a cycle that


---------53:39----------
you've been


---------53:40----------
doing for a long time sounds like you


---------53:42----------
know 20 plus years


---------53:46----------
um the other thing you know is that


---------53:50----------
you know a lot of times we'll talk for a


---------53:52----------
while


---------53:53----------
like we would be sort of like a little


---------53:55----------
bit past the halfway point


---------53:57----------
but i'm noticing that you've actually


---------53:59----------
made i think you've discovered a lot in


---------54:01----------
a very short amount of time


---------54:03----------
yeah and so i'm gonna do something a


---------54:05----------
little bit unorthodox which is i'm gonna


---------54:07----------
give you the option to sort of stop here


---------54:10----------
like if you feel like this is enough for


---------54:12----------
you to kind of process and it's not like


---------54:14----------
i want you to pick one or the other


---------54:15----------
because i still have a lot of things i


---------54:17----------
mean you said earlier that you know you


---------54:19----------
feel the safest when you're working and


---------54:20----------
that's just


---------54:21----------
that's just too juicy for me like you


---------54:24----------
know like


---------54:25----------
like i have to ask you about safety and


---------54:26----------
all that i mean there's a lot of stuff


---------54:27----------
i'm still super curious about i think


---------54:29----------
there's a lot to learn


---------54:30----------
but at the same time i'm noticing that


---------54:32----------
you've been through a lot


---------54:34----------
and you've kind of discovered a lot in


---------54:35----------
like a relatively short amount of time


---------54:38----------
and and i want to give you the chance to


---------54:39----------
kind of just put a pot hit the pause


---------54:41----------
button and kind of process and work


---------54:43----------
through that


---------54:44----------
and then maybe like we can revisit down


---------54:46----------
the road


---------54:47----------
what do you think keep going or um i


---------54:50----------
want to talk more for some reason yeah


---------54:52----------
it feels nice


---------54:53----------
okay tell what do you want to talk about


---------54:56----------
um i feel let's save this when i'm


---------54:58----------
working


---------55:00----------
okay so tell me tell me about


---------55:03----------
what what tell me about feeling safe


---------55:05----------
while you're working


---------55:07----------
um i think


---------55:10----------
i think it's just i think i feel safe in


---------55:12----------
the marketing because


---------55:14----------
i feel like um i'm progressing every


---------55:17----------
time i work


---------55:17----------
it's like oh i'm progressing and i'm get


---------55:20----------
i'm doing


---------55:21----------
um it's helping in some way and then um


---------55:26----------
every time i'm not working i'm like


---------55:30----------
i feel like all my stuff that i worked


---------55:32----------
on like it's like falling apart


---------55:34----------
because i'm not working um


---------55:38----------
and i always like i'm like and i always


---------55:41----------
i'm like oh


---------55:42----------
because i spent these two hours hanging


---------55:44----------
out with my friends


---------55:46----------
now my


---------55:50----------
now uh i'm less ahead than i would have


---------55:53----------
been if i spent those two hours


---------55:55----------
working and i know it's wrong and so i


---------55:58----------
correct myself in my brain but


---------56:01----------
i have like why is it wrong


---------56:06----------
um because it


---------56:09----------
should be it's totally fine for you to


---------56:11----------
hang out with your friends


---------56:13----------
is it though oh it's not


---------56:16----------
i don't know i'm just saying that no i'm


---------56:19----------
just i'm i'm genuinely trying to


---------56:21----------
understand what


---------56:22----------
what you think um


---------56:26----------
like because i mean every time you hang


---------56:28----------
out with your friends you're you're


---------56:29----------
falling behind


---------56:30----------
i thought like you could be working yeah


---------56:33----------
it's like it's like


---------56:34----------
logically i know like it's totally okay


---------56:38----------
to hang out with your friends


---------56:43----------
but like my negative spiral cut like my


---------56:47----------
negative thoughts always like kind of


---------56:48----------
like


---------56:49----------
like go in and then i start and then i i


---------56:52----------
always feel


---------56:53----------
like that weird feeling in my stomach


---------56:56----------
and then


---------56:58----------
um and then like once i've got


---------57:02----------
once i'm back working once i'm back


---------57:04----------
progressing


---------57:06----------
then i feel like better


---------57:10----------
and i have this issue like with um not


---------57:13----------
just friends but with family too


---------57:15----------
where like um


---------57:17----------
[Music]


---------57:19----------
like i feel bad about spending time with


---------57:20----------
them like i i want to


---------57:22----------
[Music]


---------57:23----------
like i always have this desire when i'm


---------57:25----------
working oh i want to spend time with my


---------57:27----------
family i want to spend time with my


---------57:28----------
family


---------57:29----------
and then when i when it gets to the


---------57:30----------
spending time with my family


---------57:33----------
i start feeling like all that again and


---------57:35----------
then


---------57:36----------
i'm not i'm no longer like there paying


---------57:38----------
attention you know and i'm just like


---------57:41----------
i need to work and it's like it's really


---------57:45----------
weird because like


---------57:47----------
in my mind i'm like oh no i shouldn't


---------57:49----------
feel this way it's not right


---------57:52----------
like i can't help feeling it um


---------57:56----------
and then when i get rid of that


---------58:00----------
it sounds really like you're kind of


---------58:03----------
stuck like


---------58:04----------
if you work then you're kind of missing


---------58:06----------
out on your family but even


---------58:08----------
if you try to spend time with your


---------58:09----------
family your mind automatically goes to


---------58:11----------
work and doesn't even let you enjoy


---------58:13----------
time with your family yeah that's the


---------58:15----------
same type of thing i feel with


---------58:16----------
friends as well like um


---------58:20----------
you mentioned guilty earlier when you


---------58:22----------
were hanging out with friends is that


---------58:23----------
what you mean by guilty


---------58:26----------
um guilty guilt is like when you feel


---------58:30----------
like


---------58:31----------
you're


---------58:34----------
when you do something wrong right and


---------58:36----------
then you feel good about it


---------58:39----------
um oh yeah i think so


---------58:43----------
i was just a feeling how do you feel


---------58:46----------
when you hang out with your friends


---------58:49----------
um anxiety


---------58:54----------
wanting to go back to work um


---------58:58----------
also feeling like um i'm not


---------59:01----------
doing i'm not doing a good job


---------59:04----------
performing as a friend like a little


---------59:08----------
likable person as a friend as a caring


---------59:11----------
person


---------59:12----------
um yeah i judge myself a lot


---------59:16----------
i'm noticing yeah you do and


---------59:20----------
why do you think that is


---------59:23----------
um


---------59:31----------
because i always feel like i'm not good


---------59:32----------
enough yeah right so


---------59:35----------
so then then the question becomes why


---------59:40----------
why do you feel like you're not good


---------59:44----------
enough


---------59:46----------
i think this is like patterns of my life


---------59:49----------
which ones help us understand that um


---------59:52----------
you know the things that happen in


---------59:54----------
childhood


---------59:56----------
um you know when like


---------60:00----------
even when i like made friends


---------60:03----------
they left without it being our faults


---------60:06----------
at all like we never got into fighter


---------60:09----------
with circumstances


---------60:11----------
and then um


---------60:16----------
also like with my with the past


---------60:19----------
work that i had like in career as well


---------60:23----------
um


---------60:27----------
they always kind of made me feel like i


---------60:29----------
wasn't good enough even when i did a


---------60:31----------
good job


---------60:33----------
and um


---------60:36----------
i think one of the uh i think one of the


---------60:40----------
biggest reasons as well is also like


---------60:45----------
um


---------60:48----------
i guess


---------60:52----------
i had some relationships that made me


---------60:54----------
not feel


---------60:58----------
um good enough to


---------61:02----------
since i i was like i did have a


---------61:05----------
relationship when where i was cheated on


---------61:09----------
and that was like


---------61:12----------
not cool sure


---------61:15----------
um i can imagine that i i know


---------61:20----------
um you'd expressed a you know boundary


---------61:24----------
there so i'm going to just try to infer


---------61:26----------
a little bit


---------61:27----------
yeah just because you shared something


---------61:29----------
can i just work please


---------61:30----------
yeah go for it uh


---------61:34----------
it's workplace stuff as well whenever i


---------61:36----------
outperformed i was


---------61:39----------
like i had a in my opinion


---------61:46----------
i mean i don't know if i should go into


---------61:47----------
this either because


---------61:50----------
um i think i would school very simply


---------61:55----------
like whenever


---------61:56----------
i outperformed at work


---------62:01----------
um whenever you picked up a stick


---------62:05----------
was never i don't know like


---------62:08----------
it was i don't know if i should go into


---------62:10----------
like how sure i was treated


---------62:13----------
in my last job i i want you to in my


---------62:15----------
last few jobs


---------62:17----------
we're gonna pause for a second so you


---------62:19----------
know one of the really important things


---------62:21----------
about these conversations


---------62:22----------
is that they're supposed to be on


---------62:24----------
balance for your benefit


---------62:27----------
and so i certainly don't want you to


---------62:28----------
share anything that could negatively


---------62:30----------
impact your life in some way


---------62:32----------
yeah yeah so if you want to maintain


---------62:34----------
relationships with people


---------62:35----------
so i wouldn't talk about that if that's


---------62:37----------
yeah yeah yeah i think we've got plenty


---------62:40----------
so let me i can try to infer a couple of


---------62:43----------
things okay so one is that


---------62:45----------
you know when it comes to a romantic


---------62:47----------
relationship and getting cheated on


---------62:49----------
i can imagine that that would feed


---------62:52----------
this cycle that you have of your head


---------62:55----------
telling you


---------62:56----------
you're doing good enough and it's not


---------62:58----------
your fault and then some of the business


---------63:00----------
down here


---------63:01----------
telling you like like i can imagine you


---------63:03----------
talk about this conflict that you have


---------63:05----------
where like up here you tell yourself


---------63:06----------
it's enough i can hang out with my


---------63:08----------
friends i do a good job i should be


---------63:09----------
proud of what i do


---------63:10----------
and then like in here and then in your


---------63:13----------
stomach you've got these other feelings


---------63:15----------
that are like no


---------63:16----------
it's not good enough like you're not


---------63:18----------
actually doing a good job like anyone


---------63:19----------
could do this


---------63:20----------
and i can imagine that your romantic


---------63:22----------
relationships


---------63:24----------
feed that fire of your head telling you


---------63:27----------
one thing


---------63:28----------
and then your stomach telling you


---------63:29----------
something else yeah


---------63:35----------
and so you feel safe when you work


---------63:40----------
working is nice yeah it feels nice to


---------63:44----------
wear


---------63:46----------
what feels nice about it um


---------63:51----------
i'm doing this i'm doing something that


---------63:52----------
i love um


---------63:56----------
i also feel like like if i


---------64:01----------
for some reason in my head like i also


---------64:03----------
have like these thoughts of like


---------64:05----------
i can't depend on other people


---------64:08----------
but i can i i know like i can


---------64:12----------
like i think i have like control it's


---------64:14----------
just when it comes


---------64:15----------
like i can control my work i can make it


---------64:18----------
good


---------64:19----------
um you don't have control issues


---------64:23----------
you don't know how to trust people


---------64:25----------
because all of your friends have


---------64:27----------
abandoned you


---------64:29----------
yeah i mean i don't mean to be like too


---------64:32----------
blunt about it but like


---------64:33----------
yeah right


---------64:37----------
and and i i think when you say control


---------64:39----------
issues what i think that probably means


---------64:40----------
is that you have


---------64:41----------
you feel like you need to have be in


---------64:44----------
control of every little thing


---------64:46----------
with your work is that what you mean by


---------64:47----------
control issues oh actually no


---------64:50----------
no actually no actually you're right


---------64:52----------
it's not it's not really


---------64:54----------
a control issue i think what you what


---------64:56----------
you said was more


---------64:57----------
okay correct it's more that i feel safe


---------65:01----------
in my work because like don't


---------65:03----------
never leave i guess um


---------65:07----------
and also like i just can depend on it


---------65:11----------
because


---------65:12----------
it's just me myself i guess


---------65:15----------
and um like i can


---------65:19----------
depend on the fact that if i do like if


---------65:22----------
i work hard


---------65:23----------
then i can make something awesome


---------65:27----------
um and like it'll be there for me


---------65:31----------
and then um yeah i guess that


---------65:39----------
and then what's like people it's like


---------65:43----------
um i i guess i don't think you can


---------65:46----------
depend on them to be there for you


---------65:53----------
i think that's like the feelings like


---------65:54----------
that i think


---------65:56----------
yeah i mean i thought you said something


---------66:00----------
pretty profound when you said your work


---------66:01----------
will be there for you


---------66:04----------
yeah right


---------66:07----------
sounds very safe to me yeah i like


---------66:16----------
working


---------66:18----------
okay so let me ask you a quick question


---------66:20----------
so you know you said earlier that you


---------66:22----------
it feels good to talk so i don't know if


---------66:26----------
i should ask you more questions or


---------66:28----------
share like maybe a little bit of a


---------66:30----------
hypothesis


---------66:31----------
or try to explain to you what i'm


---------66:33----------
hearing what do you think would be


---------66:34----------
better


---------66:35----------
oh i want i would love i would love to


---------66:37----------
hear your thoughts


---------66:39----------
okay so i think it's tricky


---------66:44----------
because i i think you're one of these


---------66:45----------
people who genuinely enjoys their work


---------66:48----------
and finds it gratifying


---------66:50----------
yeah yeah


---------66:53----------
and


---------66:56----------
it is doing things for your psychology


---------66:59----------
that i think are holding you back


---------67:02----------
so the mind does this a lot where like


---------67:04----------
we'll find one thing that works for us


---------67:08----------
and then we'll do it to access and then


---------67:11----------
actually like


---------67:11----------
hurt ourselves in the process like for


---------67:14----------
example i like playing video games


---------67:17----------
and if i'm not careful i really


---------67:20----------
genuinely love video games like i think


---------67:21----------
they're so much fun and i really enjoy


---------67:23----------
playing them


---------67:24----------
and but if i'm not careful what i like


---------67:28----------
about video games is if i have a hard


---------67:29----------
day at work i can play a game and have


---------67:32----------
some fun and relax


---------67:34----------
get some dopamine spend time with my


---------67:36----------
friends


---------67:37----------
and it's like a genuinely like positive


---------67:39----------
and fun experience


---------67:41----------
and i can also use video games as an


---------67:44----------
escape


---------67:45----------
yeah right i can start to rely on them


---------67:48----------
to like


---------67:50----------
turn away from some of the things that i


---------67:52----------
don't like about my life


---------67:55----------
and i'm hearing sort of the same thing


---------67:56----------
from you about your work


---------67:59----------
that there's a lot of genuine pride


---------68:02----------
there's a lot of genuine fun


---------68:04----------
that a lot of times when you work it


---------68:06----------
doesn't even feel like work


---------68:08----------
yeah which is awesome and you're lucky


---------68:11----------
and you're grateful and all that good


---------68:12----------
stuff


---------68:13----------
and at the same time


---------68:18----------
work is a safe place that allows you


---------68:21----------
to not face certain things


---------68:25----------
because those things are painful


---------68:30----------
what do you think um


---------68:33----------
yeah i agree


---------68:36----------
so what's painful outside of work what


---------68:39----------
feels unsafe


---------68:40----------
outside of work


---------68:44----------
like you mean like my feelings


---------68:47----------
sure um


---------68:54----------
um i would see the feelings i feel


---------68:58----------
and the negative thoughts that i get


---------69:04----------
um


---------69:06----------
i would feel i would say that that feels


---------69:08----------
unsafe


---------69:10----------
are there particular thoughts that you


---------69:12----------
have outside like so like i'm


---------69:13----------
envisioning a particular day where


---------69:15----------
you know maybe someone messages you and


---------69:17----------
they're like hey do you want to hang out


---------69:19----------
and then in this in your mind or in


---------69:21----------
yourself in your whole being you have


---------69:23----------
this little war


---------69:24----------
where there's some thoughts and feelings


---------69:26----------
that are telling you one thing


---------69:28----------
and then what happens is you're like no


---------69:29----------
no no i'm gonna work instead


---------69:31----------
and then like everything kind of calms


---------69:32----------
down and you feel safe


---------69:34----------
so what was it that scared you back to


---------69:36----------
work in that moment


---------69:38----------
um i usually think whenever someone asks


---------69:41----------
me like


---------69:42----------
hey do you wanna hang out i go to my i


---------69:44----------
go to like my work first


---------69:45----------
i'm like i really do want to hang out


---------69:49----------
but i have to do


---------69:53----------
this this and this and this and this if


---------69:54----------
i don't do these things and i'm gonna


---------69:56----------
feel bad


---------69:58----------
about it and i know that when i'm


---------70:01----------
hanging out i'm just gonna be thinking


---------70:02----------
about those things to do


---------70:04----------
and feeling bad about it and then so


---------70:08----------
but then like in principle or like


---------70:11----------
logically i'm like but i should hang out


---------70:14----------
because


---------70:15----------
it's good for me


---------70:18----------
um i guess because like


---------70:21----------
the feelings that i get i don't


---------70:24----------
want to even do my mind i'm like you


---------70:28----------
should


---------70:31----------
can i think for a second yeah


---------70:35----------
[Music]


---------70:37----------
i'm gonna drink some water too yeah


---------70:40----------
water


---------70:43----------
okay you know this is going to sound


---------70:44----------
weird okay


---------70:46----------
maybe a little bit unsatisfying okay


---------70:50----------
but unfortunately i actually have an


---------70:52----------
answer for you


---------70:54----------
okay so i think i know like how to fix


---------70:57----------
this i say this rarely because usually


---------70:59----------
things are complicated and i usually am


---------71:01----------
wrong


---------71:02----------
but for whatever reason i don't know if


---------71:04----------
it's just because you've been really


---------71:05----------
really open


---------71:06----------
you shared that story like really early


---------71:08----------
like i think you've been incredibly


---------71:10----------
authentic


---------71:11----------
um i think you're also incredibly


---------71:13----------
insightful and even your subconscious


---------71:15----------
mind is like working to solve these


---------71:17----------
puzzles for you like you came up with


---------71:18----------
that story about the stick


---------71:20----------
that you picked up which i think is like


---------71:22----------
the best story to help us understand


---------71:25----------
what that feeling is like when you try


---------71:27----------
to rise up and you say to life


---------71:29----------
no i'm not going to take the [ __ ] that


---------71:31----------
you give me life is like uh-uh


---------71:34----------
sit the [ __ ] down right like when you


---------71:37----------
get a friend your friend is like


---------71:39----------
adios i'm going to japan and you can try


---------71:41----------
to contact me for four years and you'll


---------71:42----------
never hear from me


---------71:44----------
and oh you have another friend and it


---------71:46----------
turns out that their parents are


---------71:47----------
religious fanatics and they can't see


---------71:49----------
you anymore because you listen to music


---------71:51----------
together


---------71:52----------
how dare you yuda yeah


---------71:56----------
right so that's the story and so it


---------71:59----------
makes sense


---------72:00----------
it makes perfect sense to me that you


---------72:02----------
have the feelings that you have


---------72:04----------
that you carry around this idea that


---------72:06----------
you're not good enough


---------72:08----------
that work feels safe because you can


---------72:10----------
rely on it because it's a computer and


---------72:13----------
not a human being that's going to


---------72:14----------
abandon you


---------72:16----------
right yeah and so like i i get that it


---------72:19----------
feels safe


---------72:21----------
and i get that like there's a logical


---------72:23----------
part of you because and that


---------72:24----------
we're going to try a couple of


---------72:26----------
interesting


---------72:29----------
meditation exercises in a second okay


---------72:33----------
but i think basically what i see is that


---------72:35----------
you have these negative feelings


---------72:38----------
and you're being controlled by them and


---------72:40----------
by controlled by them i don't mean that


---------72:42----------
like you're crippled with depression


---------72:44----------
what i mean is that you'll do anything


---------72:47----------
to avoid


---------72:48----------
those negative feelings and you try to


---------72:51----------
push them down through logic you try to


---------72:53----------
convince yourself


---------72:54----------
you tell yourself oh i should go hang


---------72:56----------
out with these people and when you go


---------72:58----------
hang out with those people then those


---------72:59----------
feelings come up


---------73:01----------
and then like you can't even benefit


---------73:02----------
from hanging out with people and so they


---------73:04----------
all like


---------73:04----------
if you go hang out with people the


---------73:06----------
feelings are going to come up right


---------73:08----------
yes the only way you can get rid of the


---------73:10----------
feelings


---------73:12----------
is to workaholic


---------73:15----------
yeah there are going to be other things


---------73:18----------
that i think also


---------73:19----------
get rid of the feelings which oddly


---------73:20----------
enough is going to be like really


---------73:21----------
judgmental towards yourself i think they


---------73:23----------
actually make the feelings go down


---------73:25----------
which i know sounds weird what do you


---------73:26----------
think about that


---------73:28----------
that's interesting i would like to know


---------73:32----------
so when you beat yourself up what


---------73:34----------
happens to the feeling in your stomach


---------73:37----------
and i beat myself up


---------73:42----------
i'm not sure what do you mean i know it


---------73:44----------
sounds weird we'll we'll explore that


---------73:46----------
down the road but anyway let's not worry


---------73:47----------
about that for now


---------73:48----------
oh okay so the main thing though is that


---------73:50----------
when you work


---------73:51----------
it calms down the feeling right there


---------73:54----------
are so many things that you do


---------73:56----------
to calm down those feelings and those


---------74:00----------
are the things that make it hard for you


---------74:02----------
to live


---------74:02----------
life does that make sense


---------74:06----------
like you you you you exclude


---------74:09----------
portions of your life because spending


---------74:12----------
time with your friends and family brings


---------74:14----------
those feelings up


---------74:15----------
yeah so it's the avoidance of that


---------74:17----------
feeling that keeps you from living life


---------74:20----------
because you can live life with the


---------74:22----------
feelings or you could


---------74:24----------
forget about life and be a workaholic


---------74:26----------
and then you don't have to worry about


---------74:27----------
the feelings


---------74:28----------
yeah so oddly enough your answer is very


---------74:31----------
simple


---------74:32----------
you have to just learn how to sit with


---------74:34----------
those feelings and accept them


---------74:38----------
see if you can tolerate that feeling it


---------74:41----------
no longer needs to control you


---------74:45----------
i see yeah okay so now i'm gonna try to


---------74:49----------
evoke those feelings and you are you


---------74:51----------
ready


---------74:53----------
okay okay and we're to teach you how to


---------74:55----------
sit with them


---------74:57----------
and i'm going to teach you a meditative


---------74:58----------
practice that will like help you work


---------75:00----------
through them


---------75:01----------
and i i suppose i should ask for


---------75:03----------
permission first because i said i'm


---------75:04----------
going to do this thing but i don't know


---------75:05----------
if you really want to yeah yeah


---------75:08----------
okay i assumed you were but at the same


---------75:09----------
time you seem a little bit like oh [ __ ]


---------75:13----------
that's what i saw in your eyes there for


---------75:14----------
a second


---------75:17----------
how are you feeling i'm curious


---------75:20----------
okay sit up straight


---------75:25----------
you can cross your legs if you want to


---------75:26----------
can you sit cross-legged


---------75:29----------
uh i'm good like this okay wait do i


---------75:32----------
i like like this like yeah you can sit


---------75:35----------
just your back should be straight oh


---------75:37----------
okay like this


---------75:38----------
that feels like do you mean like the the


---------75:41----------
this thing


---------75:42----------
yes yeah yeah yeah yeah my feet are


---------75:45----------
gonna show


---------75:48----------
okay i guess that's


---------75:51----------
i don't know what the significance of


---------75:53----------
that is no because


---------75:55----------
because the tos says you can't show feet


---------76:00----------
oh the tio says no they're saying you


---------76:03----------
can't show me


---------76:04----------
on twitch i have t os ptsd


---------76:08----------
okay i don't know about any of that but


---------76:10----------
if the tio says you can't show feet then


---------76:12----------
don't show your feet


---------76:14----------
we can't talk to you about this i'm sure


---------76:17----------
real ptsd


---------76:22----------
ptsd this is the first time i've ever


---------76:24----------
heard of tio they didn't teach me about


---------76:26----------
this at


---------76:26----------
harvard medical school


---------76:31----------
so i think another big


---------76:34----------
i think okay so like i've been banned on


---------76:37----------
this platform three times


---------76:40----------
okay and um


---------76:46----------
so this i'll talk about the second and


---------76:49----------
third bands


---------76:51----------
okay um


---------76:54----------
because it's i it's legit it's a legit


---------76:56----------
piece


---------76:57----------
i dream about it um


---------77:01----------
i dream about this but like okay so


---------77:05----------
the first band was because i had


---------77:09----------
this feature i programmed this feature


---------77:11----------
that i thought was funny


---------77:13----------
where i said a dollar for d


---------77:17----------
so when someone sends me a dollar a


---------77:20----------
letter


---------77:20----------
d will pop up on my virtual character's


---------77:24----------
phone


---------77:26----------
and um i thought it was f


---------77:29----------
i thought it was a funny joke because


---------77:32----------
you know like you get the joke right for


---------77:36----------
dr


---------77:36----------
j i i i the dollar for d


---------77:40----------
meaning a dollar for dick okay so like


---------77:43----------
so like the the joke is like


---------77:47----------
because dollar for d is like um it's in


---------77:50----------
it's like kind of it's funny because


---------77:53----------
like


---------77:53----------
you think it's like a dick pic but it's


---------77:55----------
just a letter d


---------77:56----------
that pops up in your phone and it's like


---------77:59----------
haha it's funny anyway


---------78:01----------
anyways it was supposed to be like a


---------78:03----------
funny joke thing um


---------78:05----------
but i got banned for that and the


---------78:08----------
reasons was that i was soliciting


---------78:10----------
pornography


---------78:12----------
and um soliciting pornography


---------78:16----------
that was their reason you got something


---------78:18----------
on your lip maybe


---------78:19----------
you can't tell oh yeah um


---------78:23----------
soliciting pornography and then


---------78:28----------
um yeah that one that one


---------78:32----------
really like like


---------78:36----------
uh i cuz like that one that one i think


---------78:39----------
really like


---------78:41----------
messed with my brain because i was


---------78:44----------
i kind of know i i i don't think i was


---------78:47----------
soliciting pornography


---------78:49----------
with the joke i thought i was soliciting


---------78:51----------
a joke


---------78:52----------
um but i think like


---------78:59----------
in my mind it just


---------79:05----------
okay so my third band i'll talk about my


---------79:07----------
third band


---------79:08----------
my third band was because um


---------79:13----------
so i had i do this interview type


---------79:15----------
podcast


---------79:16----------
i bring up the streamer in my world


---------79:19----------
and we talk about things and one of the


---------79:22----------
topics that we wanted to


---------79:23----------
get into talk about was sexual


---------79:24----------
harassment towards female


---------79:26----------
streamers and she told me she collects


---------79:31----------
emails and messages and she has it in


---------79:34----------
the folder and she


---------79:37----------
you know she shares it on her stream and


---------79:40----------
i asked her if we can show it on my


---------79:44----------
stream and she was like


---------79:45----------
she was totally okay with it because we


---------79:47----------
were on the topic and i wanted to talk


---------79:49----------
about


---------79:50----------
female sexual harassment because i


---------79:52----------
thought i think it's an important topic


---------79:55----------
um so she sends me a screenshot


---------79:59----------
i pull it up i read it


---------80:02----------
we discuss it she sends me another one i


---------80:05----------
pull it up


---------80:06----------
i read it we discuss it


---------80:09----------
unfortunately that second screenshot had


---------80:12----------
the person's first and last name and


---------80:14----------
email on it


---------80:15----------
[Music]


---------80:16----------
and that's what got me banned


---------80:20----------
um


---------80:23----------
and like i was i couldn't figure out


---------80:25----------
what it was because


---------80:28----------
when i got banned um like i couldn't


---------80:30----------
figure out why i got better my like


---------80:32----------
when i got banned because um


---------80:35----------
in my mind like i didn't do anything


---------80:38----------
wrong


---------80:40----------
um but then when people when i was told


---------80:43----------
what happened i was like oh that makes


---------80:45----------
sense because


---------80:46----------
like at when i was showing the


---------80:48----------
screenshot


---------80:50----------
i never thought oh this is like a real


---------80:52----------
person and i'm doxing a real person


---------80:54----------
sure you know in my mind they think


---------80:58----------
it's a hate mail it's not it's obviously


---------81:00----------
using like a username alias like that's


---------81:03----------
that's kind of the thoughts i have in my


---------81:04----------
head right and


---------81:06----------
um but


---------81:09----------
i guess i think like that whole


---------81:12----------
experience of getting back three times


---------81:14----------
when


---------81:15----------
i myself didn't see myself as a toxic


---------81:18----------
streamer


---------81:20----------
like but


---------81:23----------
it feels like it feels like because i


---------81:28----------
got banned three times like


---------81:31----------
i must be a toxic streamer like i must


---------81:33----------
be


---------81:35----------
um not wanted on the platform and i


---------81:37----------
think


---------81:39----------
it kind of just reiterates like my


---------81:41----------
pattern


---------81:42----------
i guess of like i try really really hard


---------81:45----------
on something and you get punished for it


---------81:49----------
and i get punished for it and like


---------81:52----------
i have i have ptsd because i dream about


---------81:56----------
it because like


---------81:58----------
the last dream i had it's kind of funny


---------82:00----------
the last stream i had


---------82:02----------
i wanted to get pizza and i had a pizza


---------82:04----------
flyer


---------82:05----------
and i showed my chat the pizza flyer


---------82:09----------
that the owner's first and last name and


---------82:12----------
number was on the pizza flyer


---------82:15----------
and then i showed it to chad and i got


---------82:17----------
banned for it


---------82:18----------
and i was so upset in my dreams so


---------82:22----------
so you know i have to be honest with you


---------82:24----------
so first of all


---------82:25----------
you know just so people are aware okay


---------82:28----------
so


---------82:29----------
i don't even know what to do with this


---------82:30----------
but let me just let me give this a shot


---------82:32----------
okay


---------82:33----------
first is i i i i've never heard of tos


---------82:35----------
ptsd before but sure as hell sounds like


---------82:37----------
a thing


---------82:39----------
um you know it's interesting because


---------82:41----------
when we look at the features of ptsd


---------82:43----------
hypervigilance and nightmares are


---------82:45----------
actually two parts of it like they're


---------82:46----------
two parts of the diagnostic criteria


---------82:49----------
so i think you know you know we toss


---------82:51----------
around the word ptsd a lot or the phrase


---------82:54----------
um yeah i think you know i haven't sort


---------82:56----------
of said this yet but


---------82:59----------
it's so bizarre that you're talking


---------83:00----------
about tos ptsd but


---------83:02----------
you know you may actually i don't know


---------83:04----------
if you see a mental health professional


---------83:05----------
but like


---------83:06----------
depending on what's going on here like


---------83:08----------
you may actually want to get evaluated


---------83:10----------
because


---------83:11----------
yeah in the event that you actually have


---------83:13----------
because i mean you seem to be saying i


---------83:14----------
really have ptsd over this and i know it


---------83:16----------
sounds kind of absurd but


---------83:18----------
that you know just the little parts that


---------83:19----------
you've mentioned you know do make me


---------83:21----------
think that it's warrant


---------83:23----------
it's it warrants getting an actual


---------83:25----------
evaluation i've never heard of something


---------83:26----------
like this before


---------83:28----------
um but you know there are


---------83:32----------
treatments if you have real ptsd


---------83:35----------
yeah and and if you're if you like think


---------83:38----------
about it a lot and it's kind of


---------83:39----------
intrusive in the nature of its thoughts


---------83:42----------
if you have


---------83:42----------
nightmares about it and and things like


---------83:45----------
that like


---------83:47----------
i know it sounds so bizarre that's so


---------83:49----------
silly i know it sounds


---------83:50----------
so silly but


---------83:54----------
yeah go ahead sorry no


---------83:57----------
no no no it's just i feel like it's so


---------83:59----------
silly because like


---------84:02----------
like the pizza flyer story like if i if


---------84:05----------
i talk about it it's funny


---------84:07----------
like it is a funny story like why would


---------84:09----------
you dream about that but like


---------84:11----------
so it kind of also makes me feel um


---------84:14----------
it just makes me feel really silly and


---------84:18----------
yeah so you know i want you stupid i


---------84:21----------
want you to really hear what i'm saying


---------84:23----------
because


---------84:23----------
you feel silly and stupid and this is


---------84:25----------
the first time during the conversation


---------84:27----------
where i'm telling you that this could be


---------84:29----------
a real thing that warrants actual mental


---------84:31----------
health treatment


---------84:32----------
okay right so i'm telling you like i


---------84:35----------
know it sounds bizarre i mean it sounds


---------84:36----------
bizarre even to me


---------84:38----------
but the whole so one of the actually


---------84:40----------
interesting hallmarks of my


---------84:41----------
clinical experience of working with ptsd


---------84:44----------
is that


---------84:45----------
frequently people think that things are


---------84:47----------
silly or stupid to the outside world but


---------84:49----------
it affects them in a really profound way


---------84:52----------
right and the most simple example i can


---------84:54----------
think of is like people in abusive


---------84:55----------
relationships


---------84:57----------
where they're like oh you know it's like


---------84:58----------
i know this is silly and stupid i feel


---------85:00----------
so dumb but my


---------85:01----------
partner hits me every time you know i


---------85:03----------
don't make the food right


---------85:05----------
it's i just i'm so stupid it's so silly


---------85:09----------
and that's like actually what they'll


---------85:10----------
say and


---------85:12----------
and so i know it sounds bizarre but this


---------85:14----------
is the kind of thing where first of all


---------85:16----------
i'm a little bit dear in the headlights


---------85:19----------
because i


---------85:20----------
i don't quite know i have to think about


---------85:22----------
that for a little bit


---------85:24----------
i feel like it's a whole other can of


---------85:26----------
worms


---------85:27----------
um i i do see what you're saying in


---------85:29----------
terms of like there's a common theme


---------85:31----------
here about you


---------85:32----------
trying to assert yourself in some way


---------85:34----------
and you kind of get punished for it


---------85:37----------
um at the same time you know it does


---------85:39----------
make sense to me that you got banned if


---------85:41----------
you


---------85:42----------
accidentally sure it's an accident and


---------85:44----------
this is also where like we have to be a


---------85:46----------
little bit careful because you have this


---------85:47----------
complex within you that sort of thinks


---------85:49----------
that you're not good enough and this is


---------85:51----------
just


---------85:51----------
and it can take advantage it can use


---------85:54----------
this


---------85:55----------
tos kind of stuff is like fuel for its


---------85:58----------
you know like


---------85:59----------
energy for beating you up and judging


---------86:01----------
you yourself


---------86:03----------
and at the same time um


---------86:07----------
you know i i think that part of


---------86:09----------
understanding the appropriateness of the


---------86:11----------
ban


---------86:11----------
is in recognizing that the reason that


---------86:13----------
you're not banned


---------86:15----------
or the reason you're banned is not


---------86:16----------
because you're a toxic streamer or i


---------86:18----------
mean arguably that could be


---------86:20----------
viewed as toxic it sounds to me like it


---------86:21----------
was a genuine mistake


---------86:23----------
yeah that twitch appropriately sort of


---------86:26----------
says this is not acceptable behavior and


---------86:29----------
you need to be super super careful about


---------86:31----------
this


---------86:31----------
yeah so this is also where from a


---------86:33----------
behavioral standpoint i kind of think


---------86:35----------
about especially


---------86:36----------
temporary bands is is and i don't really


---------86:38----------
know because i don't talk to twitch and


---------86:40----------
maybe i'll feel differently


---------86:41----------
you know inevitably i guess one day i'm


---------86:43----------
going to get up and i'm going to walk


---------86:44----------
out i mean i i'm not wearing socks or


---------86:46----------
shoes right now i wear flip-flops


---------86:48----------
and so if i leave the room i guess my


---------86:49----------
feet are going to be visible that's fine


---------86:52----------
that's okay it's unless they interpret


---------86:55----------
it


---------86:56----------
as being sexual but like


---------86:59----------
most people won't


---------87:02----------
okay so i'm it's only it's only when


---------87:04----------
it's interpreted as being sexual that


---------87:05----------
when it gets


---------87:06----------
so i i mean this is another discussion i


---------87:08----------
guess i'll have to ask our account


---------87:10----------
manager but like


---------87:11----------
so i'm indian and i sit in yoga postures


---------87:15----------
and as part of my culture we do not wear


---------87:19----------
shoes or socks really in the house like


---------87:21----------
indian people go barefoot a lot


---------87:23----------
yeah you find as long as it's not being


---------87:26----------
interpreted as being sexual


---------87:27----------
so if i sit in a yoga posture like


---------87:30----------
badmasan which is the lotus posture


---------87:32----------
which buddha sits in


---------87:33----------
is meditating and you can see his feet


---------87:35----------
and all the statues about buddha


---------87:37----------
do you think that's something i can get


---------87:39----------
banned for


---------87:41----------
you know but if you are a sexy hot lady


---------87:47----------
that was like you know i had a lot of


---------87:50----------
booba


---------87:52----------
and um bubba means boobs


---------87:55----------
yeah okay a sexy hot lady with boobs


---------87:59----------
maybe like that's


---------88:03----------
why it's inter it's all the


---------88:06----------
interpretation like okay i mean


---------88:09----------
you know i i get it because you got to


---------88:10----------
keep the coomers at bay but


---------88:12----------
um you know i i was just okay thank you


---------88:15----------
for educating me because i


---------88:17----------
i sit cross-legged on stream i mean like


---------88:20----------
i'm sitting cross-legged without socks


---------88:22----------
on right now it's just you can't see


---------88:23----------
them


---------88:24----------
yeah but okay so so it's just i guess


---------88:26----------
it's about the sexuality of it


---------88:28----------
yeah yes the sexuality of it uh


---------88:31----------
and i mean i was advocating that you sit


---------88:33----------
cross-legged


---------88:35----------
not out of any sexuality but just


---------88:37----------
because i know the reason that


---------88:39----------
i sit cross-legged just because i think


---------88:41----------
it's a good meditative posture


---------88:42----------
i know don't worry yeah yeah yeah yeah


---------88:44----------
um anyway


---------88:46----------
so i'm gonna have to think about this


---------88:48----------
tos ptsd thing


---------88:50----------
can i have some time to process like i'm


---------88:52----------
serious i'm not i'm not trying to


---------88:53----------
name about it yeah it's just like i just


---------88:56----------
it's just so silly


---------88:57----------
like i don't even think i don't know i i


---------88:59----------
have like for example


---------89:01----------
like when you are telling me to get


---------89:02----------
mental health check out for ptsd


---------89:05----------
my first thought went to will i get


---------89:07----------
banned for that because


---------89:09----------
then you know will twitch see me as like


---------89:11----------
a legal threat


---------89:13----------
and would i get banned for that no


---------89:15----------
twitch is actually very supportive of


---------89:17----------
of streamers like taking care of their


---------89:19----------
mental health


---------89:21----------
okay so then what if i they see me as


---------89:24----------
like a legal threat or something


---------89:27----------
okay so this is where i can't i can't


---------89:29----------
speak for twitch but


---------89:31----------
but you you know we have a we


---------89:34----------
were like healthy gamer works with


---------89:36----------
twitch yeah


---------89:37----------
because twitch actually cares about your


---------89:40----------
mental health


---------89:41----------
and so we like literally have a program


---------89:44----------
where twitch will provide you with


---------89:46----------
coaching through healthygamer


---------89:48----------
so if you want to work with one of our


---------89:51----------
coaches


---------89:52----------
who works specifically on issues like


---------89:54----------
imposter syndrome


---------89:55----------
burnout and now like i have a meeting


---------89:57----------
with all of our creator coaches today


---------89:59----------
so these are coaches who work


---------90:01----------
specifically with streamers


---------90:03----------
and content creators so you can sign up


---------90:06----------
for that program and actually like


---------90:08----------
twitch is paying for it so they care


---------90:10----------
about your mental health like very


---------90:11----------
genuinely like i'm not


---------90:12----------
i'm not saying this because it's an


---------90:13----------
advertisement for them i'm saying


---------90:15----------
because like


---------90:16----------
they're actually you know they seem to


---------90:18----------
care about it


---------90:19----------
and they're working with us and in our


---------90:21----------
experience which is like really positive


---------90:23----------
and now with our in our meeting with our


---------90:25----------
coaches today i'm going to bring up tos


---------90:27----------
ptsd


---------90:28----------
and ask them to talk to their clients


---------90:30----------
about do you guys have ptsd over being


---------90:32----------
banned


---------90:32----------
because it sounds like it could be like


---------90:34----------
a common issue actually


---------90:37----------
and if so we'll try to figure out what


---------90:38----------
to do about it i think my issue was is


---------90:41----------
that


---------90:41----------
like it just keeps on making these weird


---------90:45----------
silly


---------90:45----------
things in my brain like for example when


---------90:48----------
i want


---------90:48----------
like oh like can i get banned now


---------90:52----------
because


---------90:53----------
if i seek mental health um


---------90:56----------
like stuff for it does that make me like


---------91:00----------
elite like you know how that those


---------91:01----------
connections


---------91:02----------
are kind of silly but like i make them


---------91:04----------
yeah so so i think that's a it's a


---------91:05----------
reasonable connection though so when it


---------91:07----------
comes to getting mental health treatment


---------91:08----------
this is what i would


---------91:09----------
advocate is that like you know that's a


---------91:11----------
private thing


---------91:13----------
so like you should like when i say that


---------91:15----------
you know there are particular bounds


---------91:16----------
even around this conversation that like


---------91:18----------
there are a lot of things that if i was


---------91:20----------
actually your therapist i think would be


---------91:22----------
really important to discuss


---------91:24----------
yeah such as diagnostic criteria for


---------91:26----------
ptsd i would evaluate for that


---------91:28----------
i i you know other things would be like


---------91:30----------
really digging into romantic


---------91:32----------
relationships because that sounds


---------91:33----------
important to me but like


---------91:34----------
here in a public discussion about


---------91:36----------
anxiety and some of the things that


---------91:38----------
happen in your mind that's not really


---------91:39----------
appropriate


---------91:41----------
yeah um i don't think that they're going


---------91:44----------
to think you're a threat in fact i think


---------91:45----------
it's sort of like


---------91:46----------
you're taking care of your health right


---------91:48----------
being yeah you know


---------91:51----------
yeah i really don't think so that i


---------91:53----------
haven't gotten i mean i can't speak for


---------91:54----------
twitch but


---------91:55----------
generally speaking the response that


---------91:56----------
i've gotten from them is overwhelmingly


---------91:58----------
positive and supportive


---------92:00----------
that they recognize that you guys deal


---------92:01----------
with a lot of hard stuff and they're


---------92:03----------
actually going out of their way


---------92:05----------
to support content creators on the


---------92:07----------
platform


---------92:08----------
that's been my experience yeah um i also


---------92:11----------
know


---------92:12----------
that like twitch even provides discounts


---------92:13----------
for therapy and some so


---------92:15----------
something that my account manager sent


---------92:16----------
me so you have some information there


---------92:18----------
which you can talk to your account


---------92:19----------
manager about but


---------92:21----------
um so i think they actually do a fair


---------92:22----------
amount cool


---------92:24----------
and i can't imagine that they would


---------92:26----------
punish people for you know they're like


---------92:28----------
trying to provide you


---------92:29----------
like trying to oh no me saying that was


---------92:32----------
more of me


---------92:33----------
just telling you that i think it's silly


---------92:36----------
that i oh i see that's the


---------92:37----------
example of an irrational thought yeah


---------92:39----------
yeah yeah got it


---------92:40----------
got it um so i was trying okay that


---------92:42----------
makes sense yeah so it was just


---------92:44----------
like these irrational thoughts always


---------92:46----------
pop up in my head


---------92:48----------
even when i'm streaming um


---------92:51----------
even when i'm like making content all


---------92:54----------
these irrational thoughts just


---------92:56----------
pop up and make weird connections and


---------92:59----------
it's been


---------93:00----------
like one of the biggest things that's


---------93:02----------
been kind of


---------93:03----------
holding me back from like who i was


---------93:07----------
before


---------93:08----------
um when i perform on twitch


---------93:12----------
and it's something that i've been like


---------93:13----------
really frustrated with


---------93:18----------
can i think of can i just process for a


---------93:20----------
second yeah


---------93:23----------
i'm gonna use the restroom real fast


---------93:25----------
okay don't show your feet


---------93:43----------
so chad is any anyone else


---------93:46----------
a little bit offended on my behalf that


---------93:50----------
i won't get banned for showing my feet


---------93:53----------
because apparently i'm not sexy enough


---------93:56----------
um one second sorry i'm saying


---------93:59----------
okay uh once again what's up once


---------94:07----------
[Music]


---------94:10----------
i can't hear you now


---------94:16----------
apparently i'm not sexy enough chat


---------94:26----------
my mic's still working though


---------94:37----------
no i mean it's weird right i i guess


---------94:41----------
i guess coopers will come to anything i


---------94:44----------
i don't i really don't i don't


---------94:45----------
understand this at all


---------94:47----------
but okay i mean gotta live and learn


---------94:51----------
and one of the best educational tools on


---------94:53----------
the internet is the band hammer


---------94:55----------
if you guys haven't you know


---------95:00----------
i still don't entirely understand what a


---------95:02----------
kumar is


---------95:03----------
by the way


---------95:25----------
yeah so you know at some point we could


---------95:26----------
talk about lust like i don't mean like


---------95:29----------
i mean because it's you know to step


---------95:31----------
back from the memes but to be all


---------95:33----------
you know serious like the satisfaction


---------95:35----------
of desires and


---------95:37----------
exploring lust and and sort of managing


---------95:40----------
some of your feelings whether it be lust


---------95:42----------
for food lust for


---------95:45----------
more sexual things


---------95:49----------
important topics very important


---------96:00----------
okay i'm back i'm back okay welcome back


---------96:04----------
hey so um


---------96:11----------
i i i'm gonna have to think about some


---------96:13----------
of the stuff more you know


---------96:15----------
yeah yeah um you know i think


---------96:18----------
i think there's something really


---------96:19----------
important that you just said about


---------96:21----------
who you were before and the thoughts


---------96:23----------
that you have that keep you from being


---------96:26----------
yourself


---------96:27----------
like it's almost like they you know it


---------96:29----------
sounds like they're very intrusive


---------96:30----------
and kind of disruptive and dominating in


---------96:33----------
terms of like


---------96:34----------
affecting you it's not just a thought


---------96:36----------
that comes and goes it's like you're


---------96:37----------
trying to live your life and then


---------96:39----------
this thought comes in and it kind of


---------96:40----------
really disrupts your


---------96:42----------
your joy and tranquility i also


---------96:45----------
feel like i also feel like a bit


---------96:49----------
like i don't have control over my work


---------96:51----------
as well anymore because


---------96:53----------
um in a way because sometimes i work


---------96:56----------
really hard and then i'm like


---------96:58----------
oh i like i'm probably going to get bad


---------97:01----------
and so like


---------97:02----------
why am i trying


---------97:05----------
like i i have these irrational thoughts


---------97:07----------
that like always truly pop


---------97:09----------
up and i think it's just kind of it's


---------97:12----------
like it's just been a pattern of my life


---------97:15----------
and it's like it's like whatever


---------97:18----------
it's like whenever i take control of


---------97:20----------
something and do really well on


---------97:21----------
something


---------97:23----------
i get knocked down and


---------97:27----------
and like


---------97:31----------
um it's just it's like


---------97:34----------
it's i recognized like that was like


---------97:37----------
completely my mistake even if it was an


---------97:39----------
accident


---------97:40----------
but i just for some reason i always get


---------97:43----------
myself into these situations even if


---------97:45----------
it's an accident even if i don't mean to


---------97:47----------
do it


---------97:48----------
that always just kind of like


---------97:54----------
happens yeah um


---------97:58----------
so you know i think this is really a


---------98:00----------
different


---------98:01----------
topic because i know this sounds kind of


---------98:03----------
weird but so


---------98:05----------
i i wanna so i think that there are some


---------98:08----------
weird


---------98:09----------
principles from spirituality about


---------98:11----------
getting yourself in


---------98:12----------
into situations and then also learning


---------98:16----------
so they're learning how to not get into


---------98:18----------
those situations


---------98:20----------
yeah and and i know this sounds weird


---------98:21----------
like we're kind of we tend to take a


---------98:23----------
pretty like we've taken a pretty


---------98:24----------
psychological approach today in terms of


---------98:26----------
these patterns and what you think about


---------98:28----------
yourself and not being good enough but i


---------98:30----------
think there are also


---------98:30----------
other dimensions that you can work on


---------98:33----------
this


---------98:34----------
like in terms of cultivating the right


---------98:36----------
kind of shakti


---------98:37----------
or energy that's s-h-a-k-t-i


---------98:40----------
which is the sanskrit word for energy


---------98:42----------
there are certain practices that you can


---------98:44----------
do certain things that you can do that


---------98:45----------
sort of cultivate a particular kind of


---------98:47----------
energy


---------98:48----------
and it's not really scientific really


---------98:51----------
at all but um i do


---------98:54----------
find that taking that sort of approach


---------98:57----------
about you know what am i sort of putting


---------98:59----------
out into the world and being very like


---------99:01----------
thoughtful and careful about that


---------99:03----------
can actually help people but that's a


---------99:06----------
different dimension so i think that


---------99:07----------
that's a discussion


---------99:08----------
about how do you avoid getting yourself


---------99:11----------
into those situations


---------99:12----------
which i think you can absolutely avoid


---------99:14----------
doing now


---------99:16----------
that's the big caveat there is that you


---------99:17----------
don't really control


---------99:20----------
um you know you can't really control


---------99:22----------
what the outside world does you can't


---------99:24----------
control what twitch chat does you can't


---------99:25----------
control


---------99:26----------
twitch it does but there are certainly


---------99:28----------
ways of cultivating particular things


---------99:31----------
and sort of setting yourself up for


---------99:33----------
success that's kind of one angle


---------99:36----------
the second angle is sort of helping you


---------99:38----------
deal with


---------99:39----------
who i am who you were before and what


---------99:42----------
how these thoughts


---------99:44----------
have really shattered that how can we


---------99:46----------
help you find a place of like


---------99:48----------
peace and tranquility where you've


---------99:51----------
learned from your mistakes


---------99:53----------
you're going to be careful about not


---------99:54----------
making them again


---------99:56----------
and also like those mistakes haven't


---------99:59----------
shattered


---------99:59----------
who you used to be because what i'm


---------100:02----------
really hearing is that they've really


---------100:03----------
remapped


---------100:05----------
the way that you think about situations


---------100:07----------
and the way that like you exist


---------100:09----------
in the world which sounds very


---------100:11----------
devastating to me


---------100:15----------
um what do you think about that


---------100:20----------
um


---------100:22----------
they as in like the situations that


---------100:24----------
happen in my past the thoughts


---------100:26----------
i would say really the thoughts that are


---------100:28----------
intrusive


---------100:29----------
yeah um


---------100:32----------
i'm hearing that you can't be yourself


---------100:34----------
anymore


---------100:36----------
yeah i


---------100:40----------
i think like


---------100:48----------
um i think it's just that i get to


---------100:52----------
i get influenced


---------100:55----------
too easily by


---------100:58----------
outside situations that's like like for


---------101:01----------
example like i have


---------101:03----------
a hard time recovering from things that


---------101:06----------
shouldn't be that big of a deal i guess


---------101:09----------
okay


---------101:10----------
that makes sense sure it makes a lot of


---------101:12----------
sense so here


---------101:13----------
here's what i'm gonna say at this point


---------101:15----------
so you know i think we


---------101:16----------
uncovered a really really important


---------101:22----------
understanding of a little bit about how


---------101:24----------
you work


---------101:25----------
especially in like the first hour of the


---------101:27----------
conversation


---------101:28----------
and i feel like we're opening up a


---------101:30----------
couple of doors and i'm a little bit


---------101:32----------
hesitant because i feel like


---------101:34----------
there's a lot of like there's some


---------101:36----------
important lessons which i'd really like


---------101:37----------
to


---------101:38----------
drive home with you yeah so that you can


---------101:41----------
start to make progress


---------101:42----------
with like spending time with your


---------101:44----------
friends and family yeah


---------101:46----------
and if it's okay with you all table


---------101:48----------
everything else yeah


---------101:49----------
yeah and teach you a little bit of


---------101:51----------
meditation yeah


---------101:53----------
i i don't mean to say that this stuff


---------101:55----------
isn't important it really does sound


---------101:56----------
important but i think like let's


---------101:58----------
let's try to work on one problem at a


---------102:00----------
time i told you i have so many issues


---------102:04----------
you did i have so many issues


---------102:07----------
oddly enough i i think a lot of your


---------102:09----------
issues are related this


---------102:11----------
ptsd tos stuff sounds different to me


---------102:13----------
though


---------102:14----------
i think that's related though because


---------102:17----------
it's


---------102:18----------
i have like i think i have


---------102:21----------
more pt i think i have ptsd for my


---------102:24----------
because


---------102:25----------
of situations that happen in my past


---------102:27----------
like okay


---------102:29----------
because the thing is is that i think


---------102:32----------
it's the whole like


---------102:33----------
it's a whole like i because i work so


---------102:35----------
hard on my stream


---------102:37----------
like it's my entire life literally the


---------102:40----------
things that i've created is literally


---------102:42----------
like my entire life and


---------102:46----------
it's something that i thought i finally


---------102:47----------
had control over


---------102:50----------
and you know the dollar for d


---------102:53----------
thing i could never i just i just could


---------102:56----------
not


---------102:57----------
foresee that one and like


---------103:00----------
i just in my mind i could not foresee


---------103:03----------
like that a letter d


---------103:04----------
would be it would equate to pornography


---------103:09----------
as me selling pornography like it just i


---------103:11----------
just i still to this day


---------103:12----------
i still have i still have trouble making


---------103:14----------
those links


---------103:16----------
um and like


---------103:19----------
i think it's just that these


---------103:23----------
so like in my mind that situation wasn't


---------103:26----------
really


---------103:26----------
in my control like in my mind that's


---------103:29----------
kind of how i see it


---------103:30----------
how i show it and um


---------103:34----------
i work like my stream is my life and i


---------103:37----------
put so much into it


---------103:40----------
um and now i'm already on my third band


---------103:45----------
and i feel like it's


---------103:49----------
i just feel like you know again this


---------103:52----------
is probably gonna be taken away from


---------103:54----------
from me


---------103:56----------
um and so that's severe like worry and


---------103:58----------
that's severe like


---------104:00----------
um just anxiety


---------104:04----------
um i think that's what's causing


---------104:08----------
i don't even know if it's ptsd oh like i


---------104:11----------
just have dreams


---------104:13----------
about getting banned a lot um


---------104:16----------
in different situations i didn't mean um


---------104:19----------
it's always like


---------104:20----------
i do something that i completely didn't


---------104:22----------
realize that i was doing


---------104:24----------
at the time and then and then hindsight


---------104:27----------
they


---------104:27----------
they tell me oh like the pizza flyer


---------104:30----------
thing oh you had the owners first and


---------104:32----------
last name and number on there but


---------104:35----------
um and so i


---------104:38----------
i think it's just that it's just like a


---------104:40----------
pattern


---------104:41----------
of my of my life that i've been dealing


---------104:44----------
with where i


---------104:45----------
even with something that i feel like i


---------104:48----------
had


---------104:48----------
complete control over and was doing


---------104:50----------
really well and


---------104:52----------
um can be just taken away from me


---------104:56----------
and will probably be taken away from me


---------104:58----------
considering


---------104:59----------
all the things that happened


---------105:03----------
sounds like it's almost inevitable


---------105:06----------
well that's why i convinced myself which


---------105:08----------
is bad


---------105:09----------
but um that's just kind of what i


---------105:12----------
convinced myself


---------105:14----------
i like what you did there what


---------105:18----------
so you said that's what i convinced


---------105:20----------
myself of and it's bad yeah


---------105:22----------
you didn't say i shouldn't do it


---------105:29----------
did you notice that i don't know if you


---------105:31----------
were thinking it but


---------105:33----------
just right there you sort of just stated


---------105:36----------
what you felt without judging yourself


---------105:38----------
for feeling it


---------105:39----------
yeah which i think is progress


---------105:44----------
but i'm also seeing that this is like


---------105:46----------
very feels


---------105:47----------
really really important to you and


---------105:51----------
i i'm i'm getting a sense of


---------105:54----------
you know the train is coming down the


---------105:55----------
tracks and you're kind of stuck on the


---------105:57----------
tracks kind of thing


---------106:00----------
that no matter what you do that this is


---------106:02----------
gonna happen


---------106:06----------
it's just like a it's just a pattern you


---------106:08----------
know


---------106:09----------
it's just i even like now when i feel


---------106:12----------
like


---------106:13----------
i'm doing really well and i'm


---------106:16----------
in my mind i'm like in my brain i'm like


---------106:19----------
oh


---------106:20----------
i think i'm i'm successful or


---------106:23----------
not successful but it's i think i'm


---------106:25----------
doing really well


---------106:26----------
um i tell myself i


---------106:29----------
shouldn't enjoy it because it's gonna


---------106:32----------
hurt too much when it's like


---------106:35----------
ripped from me


---------106:47----------
it's hard to live life where your two


---------106:49----------
choices


---------106:50----------
are to try to protect yourself


---------106:54----------
and forgo living or to enjoy yourself


---------106:59----------
and be punished for it


---------107:07----------
it sounds really tough you know


---------107:11----------
i just i kind of just i don't know i in


---------107:13----------
my eyes kind of justify as like oh it's


---------107:17----------
good because you shouldn't be


---------107:20----------
that successful i don't know


---------107:23----------
my my brain works in a weird way


---------107:26----------
my brain is a weird place i know it


---------107:30----------
looks weird and contradictory


---------107:31----------
but one of the things i've come to


---------107:33----------
appreciate about our minds is that


---------107:35----------
they're actually


---------107:36----------
quite logical they just have their own


---------107:38----------
system of logic


---------107:40----------
which sometimes we can't see


---------107:45----------
so i'm going to ask you in the last few


---------107:47----------
minutes that we have do you want to


---------107:49----------
continue talking or would you rather


---------107:51----------
learn


---------107:52----------
meditation


---------107:58----------
what is your recommendation mr dr


---------108:01----------
k my recommendation would be that you


---------108:04----------
learn meditation


---------108:05----------
but what i'm picking up from you is that


---------108:08----------
you still have a lot more to say


---------108:10----------
so i think ultimately it's i have so


---------108:13----------
many issues


---------108:15----------
so so this is where i e you know i kind


---------108:18----------
of say this and sometimes people think


---------108:19----------
that i'm doing this as kind of a


---------108:20----------
disclaimer or whatever but i


---------108:22----------
i really think uh you know you could you


---------108:24----------
should either sign up for our


---------108:26----------
content creator coaching program or


---------108:31----------
um and or go see a mental health


---------108:34----------
professional and just sort of get


---------108:36----------
evaluated


---------108:37----------
and and they may be able to help you


---------108:39----------
with social anxiety or ptsd or things


---------108:41----------
like that


---------108:43----------
um and you know i say this as a


---------108:45----------
psychiatrist like i


---------108:46----------
you know i think it would be very


---------108:49----------
appropriate for someone like you to come


---------108:51----------
into my office


---------108:53----------
and say hey here's what i'm concerned


---------108:54----------
about and like i think it's very


---------108:57----------
reasonable and an appropriate thing to


---------108:58----------
explore about whether this is


---------109:00----------
you know really ptsd or not yeah


---------109:04----------
um and in terms of meditation i mean i


---------109:08----------
i think that meditation is good because


---------109:10----------
i i'd like to teach you


---------109:11----------
a practice to learn how to sit with


---------109:13----------
yourself


---------109:14----------
and especially sit with those negative


---------109:16----------
emotions so that you don't have to work


---------109:19----------
on them but i'm sort of feeling like now


---------109:21----------
it's kind of artificial


---------109:24----------
but i mean the meditation but anyway


---------109:26----------
it's okay


---------109:27----------
but so if you really want to learn i'm


---------109:29----------
happy to teach you


---------109:31----------
wait why is it artificial i felt like it


---------109:34----------
was a lot more appropriate before we


---------109:36----------
opened this other thing up


---------109:38----------
and it feels a little bit distant to me


---------109:40----------
from the current topic of conversation


---------109:43----------
that's all


---------109:50----------
i see


---------109:54----------
um but it is still like the same type of


---------109:56----------
pattern


---------109:57----------
same pattern same same thing okay so sit


---------110:00----------
up straight


---------110:01----------
okay okay so


---------110:04----------
what do you close your eyes for a second


---------110:08----------
okay and what do you feel in your body


---------110:12----------
hunger okay


---------110:16----------
i just realized i'm hungry okay


---------110:19----------
okay sorry yeah okay


---------110:24----------
really hungry okay so


---------110:28----------
so okay then you know we're gonna we're


---------110:30----------
gonna


---------110:31----------
not do this okay okay so this is this no


---------110:34----------
no


---------110:34----------
there's nothing to apologize for i


---------110:36----------
actually didn't


---------110:42----------
yeah so i want this to be a really


---------110:44----------
really important lesson that that i want


---------110:46----------
people to take away


---------110:47----------
so meditation is wonderful it's great


---------110:49----------
all that good stuff i'm a big fan of it


---------110:51----------
there's


---------110:52----------
science that suggests it helps with ptsd


---------110:54----------
it helps with anxiety


---------110:56----------
and also sometimes it's not the right


---------110:58----------
time to meditate


---------111:00----------
yeah and if you get really really sleepy


---------111:02----------
when you meditate


---------111:03----------
if you're really really hungry rather


---------111:06----------
than


---------111:07----------
i know it's kind of ironic because what


---------111:08----------
we're trying what i was about to try to


---------111:10----------
teach you


---------111:11----------
what how to do is to you know sit with


---------111:13----------
some of the feelings that you've got


---------111:14----------
instead of giving in to them


---------111:16----------
oddly enough i think you should just go


---------111:18----------
and eat something


---------111:21----------
and and like like honestly like just do


---------111:24----------
what your body and your mind sometimes


---------111:26----------
tells you


---------111:26----------
like you learn how to resist some of it


---------111:28----------
and some of it you just gotta you just


---------111:30----------
gotta eat something


---------111:31----------
you know because you woke up this has


---------111:33----------
been intense you've been at this for two


---------111:34----------
hours you've been crying off and on


---------111:36----------
exploring a lot of stuff


---------111:37----------
it's very energy intensive so i'd say


---------111:40----------
just


---------111:41----------
go eat okay i'm sorry


---------111:44----------
no it's fine i feel like i i feel like i


---------111:48----------
ruined this interview


---------111:53----------
very careful with my language you i had


---------111:56----------
an


---------111:57----------
expectation and a hope which you have


---------111:59----------
thrown a wrench in and one of the most


---------112:03----------
is that bad


---------112:08----------
yes oh but there's a big butt


---------112:11----------
so this is the other really important


---------112:13----------
thing that i think it's really important


---------112:15----------
for you to learn yoona


---------112:16----------
is that it's okay to ruin stuff


---------112:19----------
right like this is the big lesson that


---------112:21----------
you've got to learn is like


---------112:22----------
if your stream is not perfect it's okay


---------112:26----------
if you say something and you're with


---------112:29----------
your family like if you go and hang out


---------112:30----------
with your family


---------112:32----------
and you feel like you're distracted by


---------112:34----------
stream


---------112:35----------
and work and stuff like that that's okay


---------112:39----------
so what i want you to do is learn how to


---------112:41----------
be okay like


---------112:42----------
with i mean you didn't like the


---------112:44----------
interview was incredibly productive i


---------112:46----------
think it was incredibly educational


---------112:48----------
and all of the important things that we


---------112:49----------
needed to accomplish i think we


---------112:51----------
accomplished


---------112:54----------
i had this other expectation because i


---------112:55----------
had a really good meditation technique


---------112:57----------
but i just don't think sometimes


---------112:59----------
sometimes it's just it's not gonna work


---------113:01----------
which is fine


---------113:02----------
right that's life and that's an


---------113:04----------
important lesson that we have to learn


---------113:05----------
how to let go of our expectations


---------113:08----------
and then like the second time this rolls


---------113:10----------
around we'll do it again and then we'll


---------113:12----------
teach you meditation


---------113:13----------
so remember that life is going to send


---------113:15----------
you some things on its timeline


---------113:17----------
and like you just have to respect that


---------113:19----------
and if you're hungry


---------113:20----------
genuinely speaking from the bottom of my


---------113:22----------
heart to someone who's been teaching


---------113:24----------
meditation for almost 20 years


---------113:26----------
i'd say you need to go eat okay


---------113:29----------
okay okay thank you are you judging


---------113:33----------

---------113:36----------

---------113:40----------
