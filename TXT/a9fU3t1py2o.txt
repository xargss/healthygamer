---------00:00----------
all right so I guess I will actually


---------00:01----------
start I you should get used to being a


---------00:03----------
bit more responsible like you and so yes


---------00:06----------
this is for educational purposes only


---------00:08----------
and so yeah if you have a problem please


---------00:11----------
go see your doctor but yeah thank you


---------00:16----------
um so my name is will Co is uh a lock


---------00:20----------
and yeah I'm 40 years old and you know


---------00:25----------
we met when I was in my psychiatry


---------00:27----------
residency about so I started at Harvard


---------00:31----------
about eight years ago nine years ago and


---------00:34----------
at that time you know I I was raised


---------00:37----------
Jehovah's Witness and so I was not into


---------00:40----------
drugs I had only smoked pot about five


---------00:43----------
times in my life and I was a believer


---------00:46----------
you know and what we were taught which


---------00:48----------
was that psychedelics were dangerous


---------00:51----------
they were illegal and they were


---------00:52----------
addictive and you know and so I got into


---------00:57----------
the mental health field I thought I was


---------00:59----------
going to be an academic researcher and


---------01:01----------
just just in case anyone's wondering I


---------01:03----------
did not have long hair I did not have


---------01:05----------
piercings I did not have jewelry back


---------01:07----------
then I think a lot can in for that and I


---------01:12----------
yes I was this traditional guy who was


---------01:15----------
like going through the hoops of life and


---------01:17----------
being like I'm gonna be you know if I


---------01:18----------
get all these degrees and I go to all


---------01:20----------
these great institutions I'll be happy


---------01:24----------
and I kind of hit like a low the second


---------01:27----------
big low points of my life and I was like


---------01:29----------
I achieved all these things that I told


---------01:32----------
myself I wanted to achieve and I was


---------01:34----------
still not happy and so yeah I went into


---------01:40----------
therapy for the first time meaning


---------01:42----------
receiving my own therapy and um the


---------01:47----------
story is that then I started doing


---------01:48----------
psychoanalysis and I was analyzing my


---------01:51----------
dreams and my childhood can you just


---------01:53----------
best explained us real quick about


---------01:55----------
psychoanalysis is OSs psychoanalysis is


---------02:00----------
a form of psychotherapy it's kind of the


---------02:02----------
most traditional where you're like


---------02:03----------
laying on a couch and telling your


---------02:07----------
therapist about what's going on


---------02:08----------
basically and so my childhood best


---------02:13----------
and kind of did the opposite of me after


---------02:15----------
high school where he decided to not go


---------02:18----------
to college you just worked and was in a


---------02:20----------
band and partied but after the financial


---------02:23----------
crisis in a 8:09 he ended up deciding to


---------02:27----------
go back to school so he's going back to


---------02:29----------
school into college his first year of


---------02:31----------
college as I'm like having this like


---------02:33----------
life crisis at my in my early thirties


---------02:35----------
and he gets introduced to psychedelics


---------02:37----------
and one in particular called DMT and it


---------02:43----------
convinced me to even read about it he


---------02:45----------
was like DMT is what's made in the brain


---------02:47----------
and it's what causes us to dream so I


---------02:49----------
was like what and so then I went at our


---------02:53----------
like our little search engine and I


---------02:57----------
googled this and I searched it and I'm


---------02:59----------
like oh my god it's true like all these


---------03:02----------
government labs in the 50s and 60s were


---------03:04----------
putting most of their psychiatric money


---------03:07----------
and research into psychedelics I'm like


---------03:09----------
that was the first time where I'm like


---------03:10----------
wait does the government lie to us or or


---------03:12----------
you know or they not at least only


---------03:14----------
always truthful and so you know I would


---------03:18----------
just say to you that within you know


---------03:19----------
another six months a year from that I


---------03:21----------
was just so curious and I connected to


---------03:24----------
the psychedelic research community and


---------03:26----------
got involved in the training and so I've


---------03:28----------
been trained by maps so for those of you


---------03:31----------
guys that don't know Maps is the


---------03:34----------
multidisciplinary Association for


---------03:36----------
psychedelic studies and they're the main


---------03:39----------
funders of the psychedelic research it


---------03:41----------
was founded by a guy named Rick Doblin


---------03:43----------
and it has completely 100% funded


---------03:48----------
psychedelic research from young


---------03:50----------
donations and just an interesting tidbit


---------03:53----------
as they succeed to be you know a


---------03:57----------
prescribed Abul medication it'll be the


---------03:59----------
only the second time in history a


---------04:01----------
medication was brought to the market by


---------04:04----------
completely by donations and so it's a


---------04:07----------
pretty big deal what's the first game


---------04:09----------
yeah


---------04:10----------
do you know plan B which is the plan B


---------04:13----------
is the medication


---------04:15----------
yeah which which will you know allow


---------04:17----------
someone to prevent in a pregnancy the


---------04:20----------
morning it's like the morning-after pill


---------04:21----------
is what people call it interesting


---------04:26----------
and so yeah that's kind of in so yeah


---------04:29----------
once I discovered psychedelics and read


---------04:31----------
into them I just got more and more into


---------04:32----------
it and then I was able to luckily have


---------04:35----------
an experience taking MDMA legally in a


---------04:38----------
therapeutic setting in 2017 which was


---------04:41----------
life-changing to me and this was part of


---------04:43----------
the training for maps for therapists and


---------04:46----------
I'm happy to talk about that and it's a


---------04:47----------
beautiful thing because I can then talk


---------04:49----------
about doing this psychedelic without you


---------04:52----------
know saying oh my god I did something


---------04:53----------
illegal and get in trouble as a doctor


---------04:56----------
and I think education is very important


---------04:58----------
around psychedelics I've also had a


---------05:00----------
number of experiences legally with


---------05:02----------
ketamine as well as a treatment which i


---------05:05----------
think is a wonderful treatment works


---------05:07----------
very different I've also had experiences


---------05:10----------
taking ayahuasca in Peru where it's


---------05:12----------
legal as well and so I can talk about


---------05:13----------
those experiences these days you know I


---------05:17----------
have a clinical practice in Southern


---------05:19----------
California and Los Angeles


---------05:21----------
I am a big believer in public education


---------05:24----------
I think everyone should know about these


---------05:27----------
medicines no had about how to use them


---------05:29----------
responsibly and no note that I call them


---------05:32----------
medicines I think when they're in use


---------05:34----------
for for healing you know I think it's


---------05:36----------
the most powerful thing we have in our


---------05:38----------
definitely in the mental health


---------05:40----------
psychiatric bracket in terms of


---------05:42----------
treatment and so it's very exciting to


---------05:44----------
be involved in this stuff and I provide


---------05:47----------
ketamine assisted therapy for many of my


---------05:49----------
clients so that's that's the only fully


---------05:51----------
legal if you want to call it therapy


---------05:53----------
with psychedelics that's available in


---------05:57----------
the US right now without being in a


---------05:59----------
clinical trial and yeah and I provide


---------06:04----------
what people call like psychedelic


---------06:05----------
integration therapy which means like if


---------06:07----------
someone has gone out to a retreat or has


---------06:10----------
done illegal underground therapy I try


---------06:13----------
to help them through the in process the


---------06:15----------
experience so it can be you know


---------06:16----------
hopefully a healing one for them


---------06:18----------
sure awesome man so thank you so much


---------06:21----------
for that introduction so generally


---------06:24----------
speaking when people come on stream like


---------06:26----------
I'll ask them sort of questions about


---------06:27----------
their personal life and and their


---------06:30----------
journey and things like that I you know


---------06:32----------
and since you're coming on sort of as an


---------06:34----------
expert I could ask you more personal


---------06:36----------
questions like I was curious about a


---------06:37----------
couple of things that you said


---------06:39----------
um one was that that was the second that


---------06:42----------
was like your you had a myth like a


---------06:43----------
second life crisis and so I'm curious


---------06:45----------
about what your first thought was and


---------06:47----------
then there's also like more kind of


---------06:49----------
expert oriented questions about like


---------06:51----------
what's the difference between DMT LSD


---------06:55----------
psilocybin ketamine ayahuasca ibogaine


---------07:00----------
like you know like and and what do you


---------07:03----------
think so kind of like more treatment


---------07:06----------
oriented questions or expert questions


---------07:08----------
or like like sort of like what your


---------07:10----------
journey has been more specifically what


---------07:12----------
do you do you feel like we should go in


---------07:15----------
a particular direction


---------07:18----------
sure I've just got to say something


---------07:22----------
because or else that's gonna distract me


---------07:24----------
but I just opened up this twitch thing


---------07:26----------
I've never been on it before and it's


---------07:27----------
like trivial like interesting interface


---------07:31----------
between all this stuff it's it's really


---------07:34----------
cool yeah anyway I guess that's what


---------07:40----------
makes me a Boomer I'm curious creameries


---------07:42----------
but I'm assuming it just means I don't


---------07:44----------
know yeah I don't know a lot of things


---------07:47----------
if you're a Boomer a Boomer is someone


---------07:50----------
who is respected and loved by the twitch


---------07:52----------
community basically yeah so twitch is


---------07:57----------
interface so so let me just explain one


---------08:00----------
or two things about twitch so twitch I


---------08:01----------
don't know exactly how many people we


---------08:03----------
have watching right now we can just look


---------08:04----------
real quick okay so we've got about 2400


---------08:07----------
people watching and then twitch also has


---------08:09----------
a chant which means that there's there


---------08:12----------
like people that are posting things in


---------08:14----------
chat like there they may be posting


---------08:15----------
reactions or questions things like that


---------08:17----------
and that's how we know whether twitch


---------08:19----------
chat is happy with what we're doing or


---------08:21----------
sad what we're doing I try to steer


---------08:23----------
clear of looking at numbers or twitch


---------08:26----------
chat while I'm actually streaming unless


---------08:29----------
I'm like interacting with them like


---------08:30----------
answering questions or whatever so right


---------08:32----------
now let's see what they're saying well


---------08:35----------
it's a boom right I don't have glasses I


---------08:37----------
can't read anyway okay fantastic see he


---------08:39----------
understands what a rumor is he's one of


---------08:41----------
us it'll fit in it'll fit right in he's


---------08:44----------
he can feel the boom Earnest inside but


---------08:48----------
so what do you think well do you want to


---------08:50----------
do you want to talk like a little bit


---------08:52----------
more


---------08:52----------
like about your personal journey or do


---------08:54----------
you want to like maybe start with more


---------08:56----------
questions or like about more details


---------08:58----------
around different kinds of treatment and


---------09:00----------
where you think the field is going sure


---------09:03----------
I'm happy to talk about you know I I


---------09:05----------
love talking about stories you know I


---------09:07----------
think stories bigger picture is what


---------09:12----------
leads to healing you know could I sit


---------09:14----------
here and talk to you about the you know


---------09:16----------
the brain MRI studies with LSD and you


---------09:20----------
know that that you know the default mode


---------09:24----------
network is suppressed during MDMA


---------09:27----------
therapy sure but but I think what people


---------09:28----------
really care about is why these things


---------09:31----------
work so much better than your you know


---------09:34----------
SSRIs Prozac etc and so I think stories


---------09:38----------
really matter in terms of what you know


---------09:41----------
what happens to people tell us and how


---------09:43----------
to heal for sure so you know my my first


---------09:47----------
you know big life crisis I would say was


---------09:51----------
in my late 20s I was a medical student


---------09:53----------
at UCLA and my dad had gotten diagnosed


---------09:57----------
with with cancer in in the middle of my


---------10:02----------
PhD time and so you know that was a


---------10:05----------
first big wake-up call of like you know


---------10:09----------
my dad was healthy it wasn't something


---------10:10----------
that was expected and it was like you


---------10:13----------
know that dreaded phone call as a young


---------10:14----------
man like you know the moment we learned


---------10:17----------
that we died it's like oh [ __ ] we


---------10:19----------
realized oh my god our parents aren't


---------10:21----------
gonna be around and so I got that


---------10:24----------
dreaded phone call and then I was you


---------10:27----------
know living in DC at the time working in


---------10:29----------
a laboratory and it was just a big low


---------10:32----------
point and you know my dad ended up


---------10:34----------
living about two years and he ended up


---------10:36----------
getting like rounds of chemo and blood


---------10:38----------
transfusions and but it really was ended


---------10:41----------
up impacting my mental health and at


---------10:44----------
that time I'll say so I didn't actually


---------10:46----------
decide to become a psychiatrist until


---------10:48----------
the end of medical school which you know


---------10:50----------
we don't have to get into the details


---------10:52----------
but I at this point in my life like


---------10:55----------
mental health was not on my radar I've


---------10:57----------
never been to therapy like I didn't even


---------10:59----------
think about you know I didn't know what


---------11:01----------
psychology was or Freud really so I I


---------11:05----------
just got


---------11:06----------
down and then unconsciously because I


---------11:09----------
was like hiding my feelings and didn't


---------11:11----------
know how to process them I ended up


---------11:12----------
developing this really bad flying phobia


---------11:14----------
which lasted two years


---------11:17----------
there was a two-year period where I did


---------11:19----------
not fly whatsoever


---------11:21----------
and it was really embarrassing to me at


---------11:23----------
the time when I was I was actually


---------11:26----------
finishing my PhD towards the end of my


---------11:29----------
dad's life when he was dying and I


---------11:31----------
actually ended up taking a boat across


---------11:33----------
the Atlantic because I was too scared of


---------11:36----------
flying and then when I got to New York I


---------11:38----------
took a train across the country to go


---------11:41----------
back home because I was too scared so


---------11:43----------
the flying phobia had just taken out


---------11:45----------
alkalete hold over my life and and so


---------11:50----------
yeah that was you know my first big


---------11:52----------
crisis and then but you know like I


---------11:55----------
didn't know how to heal and so I was


---------11:57----------
just like okay power through keep on the


---------12:00----------
goals like okay I graduated then I got


---------12:02----------
into Harvard and I'm like okay that's


---------12:04----------
what you know it was a few years later


---------12:05----------
after that where I hit my low because I


---------12:07----------
was just like I'm putting hoop after


---------12:09----------
hoop after hoop in


---------12:13----------
when I sure yeah sorry go ahead I just


---------12:16----------
switched to these two terms I call them


---------12:21----------
perceived values versus true values to


---------12:24----------
me true values are the things that we're


---------12:26----------
born with that we you know the things


---------12:28----------
that we want to how we want to express


---------12:30----------
ourselves in our lives what we want to


---------12:32----------
spend our lives doing and then I think


---------12:34----------
of person where it's like culture


---------12:36----------
religion family you know capitalism


---------12:39----------
tells us X Y Z this is what you're


---------12:43----------
supposed to do um this is what you're


---------12:46----------
supposed to do in life and then I think


---------12:48----------
this you know in perceived values can


---------12:50----------
become so ingrained that they seem true


---------12:54----------
and so what I realized for myself was


---------12:55----------
that I was all these coops that I had


---------12:57----------
put in front of myself they weren't


---------12:59----------
making me happy because that's not what


---------13:01----------
I actually wanted to be doing I didn't


---------13:03----------
want to be a professor and how did you


---------13:05----------
realize that


---------13:08----------
well it's interesting cuz I'm actually


---------13:10----------
fast forwarding quite a bit so I mean


---------13:12----------
the actual realization of that didn't


---------13:14----------
come until the end of residency which


---------13:18----------
you know when I knew you which was


---------13:19----------
around 20 2014 and so it was through


---------13:25----------
therapy it was really through looking at


---------13:27----------
myself looking at my life so how would


---------13:30----------
it be all how on earth can we understand


---------13:32----------
like what how does one develop a phobia


---------13:34----------
of flying and like what happened with


---------13:36----------
that because you said it lasted about


---------13:38----------
two years so I presume that you still


---------13:40----------
don't have it like what's your


---------13:42----------
understanding of what happened there so


---------13:45----------
with you know I I think it was about you


---------13:48----------
know so I actually flew home when my dad


---------13:51----------
was diagnosed when he collapsed and that


---------13:55----------
was from DC to LA and again it was that


---------13:57----------
dreaded time like went right on kayak or


---------14:00----------
whatever and I'm like let's get the next


---------14:02----------
flight out and I remember in my mind


---------14:06----------
meaning I don't know objectively if it


---------14:08----------
was true that it was like the bumpiest


---------14:10----------
worst flight I'd ever been on and when


---------14:12----------
we were in the middle of you know the


---------14:15----------
flight across the u.s. very bumpy and


---------14:17----------
the pilot went on the you know on the


---------14:20----------
intercom and he was like oh sorry there


---------14:23----------
was a plane that flew too close above us


---------14:25----------
and I


---------14:26----------
just like are you [ __ ] kidding me


---------14:28----------
like like you guess that happens like


---------14:31----------
come on guys and then so I you know so


---------14:37----------
sorry I'm just like getting distracted


---------14:39----------
but it's which thing is so that's


---------14:41----------
fascinating I'm gonna get it not look at


---------14:43----------
it don't look at it will resist what how


---------14:46----------
are you looking at on your phone yeah


---------14:49----------
it's in it's on it's not on life Isis I


---------14:52----------
don't even know what these words mean so


---------15:00----------
what happened was then you know I I


---------15:04----------
started associating right instead of


---------15:06----------
letting you know we're going we're


---------15:08----------
covering a lot right now but you know


---------15:09----------
what we want in a healthy situation you


---------15:12----------
know when we experience a trauma is that


---------15:15----------
or you know what we call a trauma is


---------15:18----------
that we want to be able to fully express


---------15:20----------
the emotion physically it's like if you


---------15:24----------
if you have a clear glass wall and a


---------15:26----------
bird flop eyes into it right and it


---------15:29----------
collapses it's done for a second it gets


---------15:32----------
up it shakes it like chirps and then it


---------15:35----------
moves on with its life then it starts go


---------15:36----------
hunting worms again it doesn't sit there


---------15:38----------
and it's like mmm ruminate II oh [ __ ]


---------15:41----------
like I've gotta look out for for other


---------15:44----------
glass now for the rest of my life it


---------15:47----------
like it has the experience it shakes it


---------15:49----------
off and it moves on and our culture you


---------15:52----------
know I think of six basic emotions we


---------15:55----------
don't know we can get into it later if


---------15:57----------
it matters but we have a cluster of


---------15:59----------
emotions that we have started calling


---------16:01----------
that we've started judging as being weak


---------16:03----------
right and to me those are sadness fear


---------16:07----------
and shame it's like you know the if


---------16:09----------
you're feeling those they're weak you're


---------16:11----------
not a man and so we don't get that


---------16:14----------
opportunity for catharsis right because


---------16:16----------
we're told from a young age boys don't


---------16:17----------
cry hide it you know and so then we


---------16:20----------
start locking in all of these


---------16:22----------
experiences in our body


---------16:24----------
year after year experience after


---------16:26----------
experience and they build up and and


---------16:28----------
that has to go somewhere and so you know


---------16:31----------
what happened was that I had all this


---------16:33----------
stuff all these feelings about my dad


---------16:36----------
dying and I didn't know where they


---------16:37----------
expressed them I didn't have people


---------16:39----------
that would listen that could listen the


---------16:41----------
way I needed them to listen and so it


---------16:44----------
built up in and then so the psyche the


---------16:46----------
unconscious like tries to put that


---------16:48----------
somewhere right and that's somewhere


---------16:50----------
sometimes is you know depending on your


---------16:52----------
genetics and your upbringing


---------16:54----------
looks like alcoholism or it looks like


---------16:57----------
an eating disorder it looks like PTSD


---------17:00----------
you know for me that cluster of things


---------17:02----------
at that moment of my life


---------17:03----------
looked like a phobia and and I prefer to


---------17:06----------
think of mental illness in these


---------17:08----------
categories of just like again because of


---------17:10----------
your unique traits it expresses this way


---------17:12----------
but I don't believe in like I used to


---------17:14----------
believe but I don't anymore that there's


---------17:15----------
these like hard evidence DSM diagnosis


---------17:19----------
that like are genetically predisposed


---------17:21----------
and you can never be healed from them


---------17:23----------
like psychedelics have shown me that


---------17:25----------
like almost without exception the


---------17:28----------
paradigm of mental illness that we have


---------17:30----------
created is especially the categorization


---------17:32----------
is a lot of baloney you know and I think


---------17:35----------
that you know we can do really deep


---------17:38----------
healing by revisiting you know these


---------17:41----------
past experiences and so that's where


---------17:43----------
psychedelics come in right because


---------17:46----------
psychedelics you know what I'm basically


---------17:48----------
saying is we need to allow the emotion


---------17:50----------
and the the movement to come to the


---------17:52----------
surface so that we can deal with it so I


---------17:54----------
like to think about psychedelics as


---------17:57----------
evocative therapies as opposed to


---------18:01----------
suppressive therapy right because like


---------18:04----------
he's impressive you can even see that in


---------18:07----------
our in our in our the categories of our


---------18:10----------
medications the psychiatric medications


---------18:12----------
antidepressants anti-anxiety what are


---------18:15----------
those say anti sadness aunty fear if


---------18:19----------
you're feeling something numb it down I


---------18:21----------
don't want to see it


---------18:22----------
right and we as a mental health you know


---------18:28----------
field like that's that's we're not even


---------18:32----------
taught how to deal with increased


---------18:34----------
emotions we're taught how to suppress


---------18:36----------
them and that's where psychedelics that


---------18:38----------
is why they're so effective like we're


---------18:40----------
seeing you know MDMA and psilocybin have


---------18:43----------
both been lit labeled and we can talk


---------18:45----------
about what this means in a second the


---------18:47----------
FDA has labeled them as breakthrough


---------18:49----------
therapies which means they get like an


---------18:51----------
accelerated approved


---------18:52----------
through the FDA that's the only two


---------18:54----------
times in history that that designation


---------18:57----------
has been used for a mental health a


---------18:58----------
primary mental health condition and so


---------19:01----------
you're seeing we're seeing rates of like


---------19:02----------
60 70 plus percent of people healed


---------19:07----------
after one to three treatments with a


---------19:09----------
psychedelic with psychotherapy in


---------19:11----------
between and like you know as well as I


---------19:15----------
that that those numbers are like unheard


---------19:17----------
of yeah in psychiatry you know so a good


---------19:19----------
number in psychiatry is like 30 30 35


---------19:23----------
percent yeah you know yeah so that's


---------19:25----------
that's crazy man you know it's so


---------19:27----------
interesting so I think a lot of why


---------19:29----------
we've grown is because our my personal


---------19:34----------
approach is like very aligned with yours


---------19:36----------
so I think of I don't think a mental


---------19:38----------
illness is an illness like I don't think


---------19:40----------
these things are broken within people I


---------19:42----------
think these are adaptive mechanisms that


---------19:45----------
have kind of gotten out of control so


---------19:47----------
the way that I understand anxiety for


---------19:51----------
example is we all have a future


---------19:53----------
functioning capable of capacity within


---------19:56----------
our brain to predict problems in the


---------19:58----------
future right like that's what our brain


---------20:01----------
is designed to do and if we anxiety is


---------20:06----------
simply that future problem predicting


---------20:08----------
capability like gone out of control and


---------20:11----------
like you know even depression or I


---------20:15----------
struggle with some things like


---------20:16----------
schizophrenia which in my clinical


---------20:18----------
experience have been like more like an


---------20:21----------
illness like I have trouble seeing sort


---------20:23----------
of the value of that especially with


---------20:28----------
some of the negative symptoms like


---------20:29----------
cognitive you know cognitive problems


---------20:31----------
and things like that but I think for a


---------20:33----------
lot of these kind of neurotic conditions


---------20:35----------
or feelings of like depression or


---------20:37----------
anxiety or whatever like they're they're


---------20:39----------
just our bodies and minds way of trying


---------20:42----------
to express something and we don't let


---------20:45----------
ourselves express it and a lot of the


---------20:47----------
work that we do on stream the reason


---------20:49----------
that we kind of ask personal questions


---------20:50----------
and I think part of the reason that


---------20:51----------
we've grown is that we see a lot of


---------20:53----------
catharsis like on on stream so we talked


---------20:56----------
to people we sort of evoke emotions we


---------20:59----------
ask important questions and then people


---------21:01----------
oftentimes have catharsis which i think


---------21:04----------
is a good word to


---------21:05----------
describe it where they will sort of have


---------21:07----------
like this emotional moment and the other


---------21:09----------
thing by the way we'll just in terms of


---------21:11----------
like things that we were taught like you


---------21:13----------
know I remember working with


---------21:15----------
psychoanalytic supervisors and stuff


---------21:17----------
like that and then them talking about


---------21:18----------
therapy is like a really long-term thing


---------21:20----------
like patient had a breakthrough after


---------21:22----------
like two two-and-a-half years and then I


---------21:25----------
remember thinking is like like a


---------21:27----------
resident you know because I'm I'm the


---------21:29----------
one who's being taught so I'm not an


---------21:31----------
expert I'm like what the [ __ ] were you


---------21:32----------
doing for the first two years like if


---------21:35----------
they had a breakthrough it like three


---------21:36----------
years and one of the things that I've


---------21:38----------
come to believe is that like I don't


---------21:40----------
think that our paradigms as well as like


---------21:42----------
medication I don't think that you know


---------21:45----------
psychotherapy needs to be this long and


---------21:47----------
protracted process that that you know


---------21:50----------
lasts years and years I think that you


---------21:52----------
can use certain tools so I personally


---------21:54----------
use meditation to evoke a lot of emotion


---------21:57----------
and and like when you empty your mind


---------22:00----------
like whatever's down there so you have


---------22:01----------
this suppressive mechanism right that


---------22:04----------
keeps all these emotions down and then


---------22:05----------
when you empty your mind it creates a


---------22:07----------
vacuum and whatever's down below comes


---------22:10----------
up on its own and and so that's been


---------22:12----------
sort of my personal experience and also


---------22:15----------
my experience teaching meditation of my


---------22:16----------
patients is that like it accelerates the


---------22:19----------
rate of therapy which I doubt it


---------22:22----------
accelerates it at the same rate as is


---------22:23----------
psilocybin and things like that but you


---------22:27----------
know I mean I I'm aligned with what


---------22:29----------
you're saying but yeah so a few things


---------22:34----------
you know I on this anxiety piece which i


---------22:38----------
I've come to as a meditator I think you


---------22:41----------
yeah I'd be curious to get your thoughts


---------22:42----------
on this but I've started essentially


---------22:45----------
grouping you know what we call mental


---------22:47----------
illness into two places anxieties or


---------22:50----------
depressions because what we want we what


---------22:53----------
we want to be in theory is fully present


---------22:55----------
we want to be in flow right right I


---------22:57----------
imagine you know when we're engaged like


---------22:59----------
if we're on a on the first date when


---------23:02----------
were you only like the person or if


---------23:03----------
you're playing a game and you're really


---------23:04----------
into it you're not thinking about stuff


---------23:07----------
right you're just in flow or where you


---------23:09----------
are and so I like to think of anxieties


---------23:12----------
of as the category meaning I'm not


---------23:14----------
present because I'm living in the future


---------23:16----------
I'm worried about something


---------23:18----------
or depression I'm not present because


---------23:21----------
I'm worried about something in the past


---------23:23----------
that happened and interestingly I think


---------23:26----------
with with psychedelics what we're give a


---------23:28----------
lot of thought to it is are certain


---------23:30----------
psychedelics better for certain things


---------23:32----------
and we'll get to that and I'm glad you


---------23:34----------
asked that in the beginning and you know


---------23:37----------
I like that you mentioned meditation you


---------23:39----------
know I think the things that


---------23:41----------
psychedelics facilitate memories


---------23:44----------
emotions etc that we need to bring up to


---------23:47----------
heal they're only doing something that


---------23:50----------
we are completely capable of doing


---------23:52----------
anyway like the human body the psyche


---------23:55----------
the Spirit is completely capable of


---------23:57----------
doing that type of work it just is


---------24:00----------
facilitated by something like


---------24:02----------
psychedelics but it can also be


---------24:03----------
facilitated by a meditation or it can be


---------24:06----------
facilitated by holotropic breathwork etc


---------24:09----------
etc yeah great those are the two points


---------24:13----------
I wanted to make so first of all I agree


---------24:15----------
with you completely so i intent alil 'no


---------24:17----------
sin to future-oriented and past oriented


---------24:21----------
which I call worry and reverent which I


---------24:24----------
I mean no surprise that it's basically


---------24:26----------
exactly what you said that that because


---------24:28----------
I even try to in my language I found


---------24:30----------
that it's useful to step away from


---------24:32----------
anxiety and depression


---------24:33----------
because they are medicalize terms so I


---------24:35----------
use worry and regret so if you look at


---------24:38----------
like literally if so I a lot about this


---------24:42----------
stuff so if you guys have watched its


---------24:44----------
own stream like literally the cool thing


---------24:46----------
about anxiety is that like if you look


---------24:48----------
at any anxious thought it is it is when


---------24:51----------
your mind is not in the present it's in


---------24:53----------
the future and some people even say well


---------24:55----------
I have anxieties about the past but if


---------24:57----------
you really tunnel down into that what


---------24:58----------
they're really doing is something


---------25:00----------
happens like oh I went to a party


---------25:01----------
yesterday I looked dumb so people won't


---------25:05----------
like me and won't invite me next time


---------25:07----------
and they'll think that that's like


---------25:09----------
worrying about the past but it's not


---------25:10----------
real technically it's not worrying about


---------25:12----------
the past if you really pay attention to


---------25:14----------
your thoughts you're worried about the


---------25:15----------
future consequences of a past action and


---------25:18----------
so all worry is future-oriented mind and


---------25:21----------
all regret is past oriented mind and


---------25:23----------
literally if you can be in the present


---------25:26----------
with your mind anxiety cannot exist in


---------25:28----------
order for anxiety to exist you must be


---------25:31----------
think


---------25:32----------
in the future and so part of what I


---------25:34----------
think is really powerful is like people


---------25:35----------
don't realize that like they think about


---------25:37----------
anxiety is something that you have to


---------25:38----------
you know grapple with and treat and and


---------25:40----------
things like that and my my general


---------25:42----------
approach to anxiety is twofold one is to


---------25:44----------
dig into the underlying things that make


---------25:47----------
you anxious and this kind of goes to


---------25:50----------
what you were talking about about like


---------25:51----------
you know there's a certain amount of


---------25:52----------
personal stuff and there's a certain


---------25:54----------
amount of like environmental stuff that


---------25:56----------
causes mental illness to manifest in a


---------25:58----------
particular way so in the Eastern system


---------26:01----------
of Vedic psychology they talk about


---------26:03----------
these things called some scars which are


---------26:05----------
essentially like unprocessed traumas and


---------26:07----------
that some scars manifest as particular


---------26:10----------
things they're like they're kind of like


---------26:12----------
you know subconscious psychological


---------26:14----------
conflicts I think like the psychoanalyst


---------26:16----------
kind of had a sense of this and so you


---------26:20----------
can kind of work on the root or what you


---------26:23----------
can actually do is change the function


---------26:25----------
of your mind in the moment which is


---------26:26----------
completely ignoring the root and


---------26:28----------
literally turn off the anxiety by


---------26:30----------
focusing on the present and when I work


---------26:32----------
with people with like procrastination


---------26:33----------
and things like that like you can sort


---------26:35----------
of deal with the subconscious origin of


---------26:37----------
your fears which is a more long-term


---------26:39----------
process and in the moment you can learn


---------26:42----------
how to like literally shock off or


---------26:44----------
overcome procrastination by


---------26:46----------
understanding like the mechanism of how


---------26:48----------
mind works but anyway I'm with you a


---------26:51----------
hundred percent in terms of like your


---------26:53----------
foam formulation it's like I think great


---------26:55----------
and I also agree with you by the way and


---------26:57----------
this is something I'm curious about


---------26:58----------
that you know one thing that I realized


---------27:00----------
some time ago is that any substance that


---------27:03----------
we put into our body is only capable it


---------27:06----------
doesn't create anything it only


---------27:07----------
activates things right so if we think


---------27:10----------
about our alcohol like that activates


---------27:12----------
gaba receptors like cannabis activates


---------27:17----------
cannabinoid receptors it doesn't create


---------27:20----------
something new in our brain it only turns


---------27:22----------
off or on what's already there and so


---------27:24----------
any experience that you can have through


---------27:27----------
a psychedelic it's my belief and this is


---------27:30----------
kind of where I'm curious that you can


---------27:32----------
attain something similar through


---------27:34----------
meditation and I know that you know when


---------27:35----------
I talk to people who have had psychosis


---------27:37----------
has had like psychedelic experiences I


---------27:40----------
can relate to them through my personal


---------27:42----------
spiritual experiences which sound varies


---------27:45----------
in some ways and also very different I'm


---------27:47----------
kind of curious do you think that


---------27:50----------
because this is something that that


---------27:52----------
people have sort of asked about and


---------27:53----------
there's been some debate about do you


---------27:56----------
think that anything that you can attain


---------27:57----------
through meditation you can attain


---------27:59----------
through psychedelic use and vice versa


---------28:05----------
yes I just want to put a footnote on


---------28:10----------
mentioning something about psychosis


---------28:12----------
because it's something that it just came


---------28:14----------
back to me that you had mentioned yes so


---------28:18----------
yeah I think we sounds like we


---------28:20----------
completely agree on that that you know


---------28:24----------
yeah things are just unlocked by


---------28:26----------
different experiences external to the


---------28:29----------
body or internal to the body right like


---------28:32----------
so yeah we can put things in like unique


---------28:34----------
even together that is basic as sugar and


---------28:37----------
whatever we eat for meals as you said


---------28:40----------
alcohol um I really like that way of


---------28:42----------
looking at it I haven't haven't quite


---------28:44----------
worded it that way and you know I'm just


---------28:47----------
trying to think of like my mind's at the


---------28:48----------
same time like wait can we add something


---------28:50----------
that wasn't there which is interesting


---------28:54----------
oh there ain't just a quick tangent


---------28:56----------
because like what about sensory


---------28:58----------
stimulation like the vision or touch can


---------29:02----------
add something to us technically right


---------29:04----------
that's external like a trauma so so


---------29:06----------
could a chemical do that I don't know


---------29:08----------
anyway it's it's it's more of like maybe


---------29:10----------
an intellectual topic but you know the


---------29:14----------
piece about psychosis is that I actually


---------29:17----------
I do believe that that you know perhaps


---------29:22----------
that at least a good amount of what we


---------29:25----------
call schizophrenia or psychosis could P


---------29:28----------
could be just an incredibly complex


---------29:30----------
defense mechanism meaning you know I I


---------29:33----------
haven't worked at least anyone who is


---------29:35----------
deeply deeply suffering from


---------29:37----------
schizophrenia who hadn't had a really


---------29:40----------
really rough set of years in their in


---------29:43----------
their early life and you know I would


---------29:46----------
think of it as you know the uh the


---------29:50----------
unprocessed traumas again because of


---------29:52----------
that person's mixture of genetics and an


---------29:54----------
upbringing end up creating a reality


---------29:59----------
because that created reality as painful


---------30:03----------
as it may appear to someone on the


---------30:05----------
outside could be more less painful than


---------30:08----------
having to sit with what actually


---------30:10----------
happened and I know that that's you know


---------30:13----------
kind of what the early psychoanalyst


---------30:15----------
used to believe so people used to do


---------30:16----------
long term therapy with schizophrenia not


---------30:20----------
that it worked very well we didn't see I


---------30:22----------
mean that it that it had very good


---------30:24----------
results but quite honestly there aren't


---------30:25----------
many studies with psychotherapy that


---------30:29----------
work and you know consistently had a


---------30:31----------
higher rate with any mental illness and


---------30:35----------
Stingley stan grof who is someone who


---------30:39----------
can I just jump in for a second so like


---------30:40----------
our discord seems to be lagging like a


---------30:43----------
ton oh there we go seems to have fixed


---------30:45----------
itself is there anything you can do to


---------30:47----------
improve your like Wi-Fi or like position


---------30:50----------
or anything like that I think everything


---------30:54----------
is off except for let me see the other


---------30:58----------
thing we can try doing is using a


---------30:59----------
different platform okay I mean all my


---------31:07----------
devices are off of Wi-Fi except here


---------31:09----------
okay all right


---------31:11----------
no problem let's let's keep going sorry


---------31:15----------
you see you were saying that


---------31:17----------
schizophrenias could be an incredibly


---------31:19----------
complex defense mechanism yeah and so


---------31:23----------
you know stan grof who probably most


---------31:26----------
people here have not heard of is he's


---------31:29----------
still alive I didn't he's nearing 90 he


---------31:31----------
was a he was it's like in some ways the


---------31:34----------
The Godfather of psychedelic therapy and


---------31:38----------
so he he was you is a guy from the Czech


---------31:44----------
Republic and he was a training


---------31:46----------
psychiatric resident all right as a


---------31:48----------
plane flight ain't flying overhead if


---------31:50----------
you hear some noise de said if he was


---------31:53----------
gonna he was took me a minute but you


---------32:02----------
know so Stan was training as a


---------32:05----------
psychiatrist when Albert Hoffman the the


---------32:10----------
scientist who discovered LSD was


---------32:12----------
and to put it into practice and so Stan


---------32:15----------
was one of the first people who actually


---------32:17----------
did legal psychedelic therapy and he


---------32:20----------
ended up doing between it's estimated


---------32:22----------
three and four thousand LSD sessions


---------32:25----------
with patients completely legally and


---------32:27----------
half of those were in the United States


---------32:30----------
and just for anyone that's wondering


---------32:33----------
that's like unheard of like that is a


---------32:35----------
large large number of people to have had


---------32:38----------
experiences with Stan interestingly his


---------32:41----------
first wife actually had schizoaffective


---------32:43----------
disorder which is which is a kind of a


---------32:48----------
milder form I would say of schizophrenia


---------32:50----------
and and in part of those 3,500 cases and


---------32:55----------
in Stan's personal experience with his


---------32:57----------
wife and other people they actually


---------32:59----------
treated numerous people that had what we


---------33:02----------
would nowadays call schizophrenia and he


---------33:05----------
reports that and he has reported that he


---------33:07----------
had a lot of success with people right


---------33:09----------
and these were not large-scale you know


---------33:11----------
double-blind placebo-controlled trials


---------33:13----------
because those dead-like


---------33:14----------
placebo-controlled trials didn't even


---------33:16----------
really start until the 1990s and so I


---------33:20----------
think there is some evidence from within


---------33:21----------
you know the the psychedelic research


---------33:23----------
from that time period that actually


---------33:25----------
supports that that you know a lot of


---------33:27----------
schizophrenia at least should be looked


---------33:29----------
at in the future in terms of potentially


---------33:31----------
being treatable by psychedelics you know


---------33:34----------
I don't think it's anything that you


---------33:36----------
know we'll get into like in the next few


---------33:38----------
years but you know maybe in 10 or 15


---------33:40----------
years it's worth looking at because what


---------33:41----------
if this group of people we've


---------33:44----------
essentially in some ways the


---------33:46----------
capitalistic system has said these


---------33:48----------
people are so useless to the


---------33:51----------
capitalistic machine to make money so


---------33:54----------
they're like the homeless population


---------33:55----------
like what if even 20 percent of those


---------33:59----------
people could be living a pretty normal


---------34:01----------
life if they had a you know a big


---------34:04----------
significant healing experience with a


---------34:06----------
psychedelic like what does that mean


---------34:07----------
about us as ultra in our society hmm


---------34:11----------
yeah it's interesting so I think we so


---------34:15----------
I'm just wondering like there were a


---------34:17----------
couple of general threads so you


---------34:18----------
mentioned kind of this this thing with


---------34:20----------
your phobia and we kind of got up like


---------34:22----------
we sort of bounced around a little bit


---------34:24----------
so what ended up half


---------34:26----------
like with your like what's your


---------34:27----------
understanding of so you you kind of said


---------34:29----------
that you know the phobia was sort of a


---------34:32----------
manifestation of like internal emotions


---------34:34----------
that didn't have any other way to come


---------34:36----------
out and and that to sort of makes sense


---------34:38----------
to me because I'm kind of envisioning


---------34:40----------
like this pile of stuff that you know


---------34:42----------
would affect so many different


---------34:44----------
dimensions of your life so it's almost


---------34:45----------
like your brain kind of like packages it


---------34:47----------
up and just gives you like a very like


---------34:49----------
intense slice of emotion with like one


---------34:52----------
thing so it kind of packs all that


---------34:54----------
emotion into a particular fear so what


---------34:58----------
ended up happening with you are you


---------34:59----------
still afraid of planes and and if not


---------35:02----------
like what changed not at all I mean I


---------35:07----------
it was gradual so I started my personal


---------35:11----------
psychotherapy around my dad and that


---------35:13----------
stuff in 20 I guess I was probably 2014


---------35:17----------
2013 and I continued it I took a little


---------35:21----------
break in the beginning of residency


---------35:22----------
because the first year of residency was


---------35:23----------
so challenging and then I doe back into


---------35:26----------
therapy you know when I had the second


---------35:27----------
mental health crisis but you know this


---------35:31----------
whole thing about catharsis and the body


---------35:33----------
etc I had no idea you know what that was


---------35:36----------
back then right I was of a lot of people


---------35:38----------
you know the mind of a lot of people


---------35:40----------
were I'm like you know illness is only


---------35:43----------
the mind right right where I've started


---------35:45----------
thinking that the mind and the voice in


---------35:49----------
the body are actually three different


---------35:52----------
levels of healing that are necessary and


---------35:55----------
that simply heating the mind is one step


---------35:58----------
but it's not the whole step you know and


---------36:00----------
in the beginning I what do you mean by


---------36:03----------
the voice so I believe you know that


---------36:07----------
were these physical beings right and I


---------36:10----------
guess I'll give you the examples so


---------36:13----------
there's a book called The Four


---------36:14----------
Agreements I'm not sure if your if


---------36:16----------
you're familiar with it I thought it's


---------36:19----------
like the spiritual wellness you know


---------36:22----------
anyway they talk the guy talks about


---------36:23----------
these four agreements and the forth


---------36:25----------
agreement I think is being impeccable


---------36:28----------
with your word and I remember thinking


---------36:31----------
about that and I and I didn't agree and


---------36:35----------
I was like you know especially this day


---------36:37----------
and age of people posting


---------36:39----------
quotes in memes etc like in many of them


---------36:42----------
in my you know circle of friends and


---------36:45----------
colleagues or even myself


---------36:47----------
it seemed hypocritical because some


---------36:49----------
people would post some beautiful quote


---------36:51----------
and then act like an [ __ ] the next


---------36:53----------
week and I'm like there's this like this


---------36:55----------
this discrepancy and so I intention


---------37:00----------
knows because to me there's one level of


---------37:02----------
understanding it's like I know here what


---------37:04----------
I need to do and how I need to you know


---------37:06----------
treat my fellow man but then when I get


---------37:09----------
triggered I'm gonna behave a different


---------37:12----------
way so I actually liked you know sort of


---------37:16----------
uh adjusting that agreement with


---------37:19----------
actually being impeccable with your deed


---------37:20----------
it almost it felt more powerful to wait


---------37:23----------
and see what people were like by the way


---------37:25----------
I got to know them and I saw them


---------37:27----------
behaved towards me other people over the


---------37:29----------
course of time and so to me is like but


---------37:33----------
you need the mind right you need the


---------37:34----------
mind to heal because that's like a first


---------37:36----------
level the voice I add because I think


---------37:39----------
our voice is how we make ourselves known


---------37:41----------
to the world how we announce ourselves


---------37:43----------
it's like this is who I am this is what


---------37:45----------
I want this is how I'm gonna engage with


---------37:48----------
you and there's a level of healing


---------37:51----------
that's a difficulty that that is to like


---------37:54----------
express what we feel right and we know


---------37:57----------
there's a whole history in psyche you


---------37:58----------
know we can get into psychology why that


---------37:59----------
can happen but you know it you know if


---------38:03----------
if I'm doing if I'm treating you know


---------38:05----------
say a young woman who is in an abusive


---------38:07----------
relationship right and through the work


---------38:09----------
together that we do in therapy she


---------38:11----------
realizes oh I don't want to be an


---------38:15----------
abusive relationship before I want to


---------38:17----------
stand up for myself but it's another


---------38:19----------
level to go home if she's like living


---------38:21----------
with that person and vocalized that and


---------38:24----------
be like I'm leaving you I don't need


---------38:26----------
this anymore


---------38:26----------
right so it's one level to here and


---------38:29----------
he'll hear that but then we have to


---------38:31----------
actually be able to speak from the heart


---------38:33----------
and you know lastly it's then - like the


---------38:38----------
body why I think of that as differently


---------38:39----------
and it's at two levels am i moving


---------38:41----------
literally with integrity and and and


---------38:43----------
allowing my body to just be but I also


---------38:46----------
think that you know saying that there's


---------38:48----------
a healing level to the body is am i


---------38:50----------
spending my time moving


---------38:52----------
about the world in a way that I most


---------38:56----------
love am i spending that time in a job


---------38:59----------
that I really care about that I'm


---------39:01----------
passionate about am I you know going to


---------39:03----------
college just because my parents told me


---------39:05----------
to do we took go and I actually really


---------39:07----------
[ __ ] hate this and I would actually


---------39:08----------
rather be doing something else and so


---------39:10----------
you know and it's harder to act and move


---------39:12----------
because I feel like as we heal things in


---------39:15----------
the mind it's like we're we're fighting


---------39:17----------
a narrative within our mind but actually


---------39:20----------
once we go to the level of the voice and


---------39:22----------
the body those tests are almost outside


---------39:26----------
of the mind and they're out in the real


---------39:27----------
physical world and I think there's a


---------39:28----------
different level of of difficulty doing


---------39:32----------
that yeah I mean that once again it


---------39:35----------
words from my own heart but so let me


---------39:38----------
ask you a question well like so let's


---------39:40----------
say that someone is fighting these


---------39:42----------
struggles right so like this is you're


---------39:43----------
talking about essentially like twitch


---------39:45----------
like this is who we are


---------39:46----------
we're people who are not moving our body


---------39:49----------
in a way that is like aligned with our


---------39:51----------
true values where people who don't


---------39:54----------
express our emotions and we may even not


---------39:56----------
like we may not even be clear in the


---------39:58----------
mind like in fact I mean I think many


---------40:00----------
people aren't so how do people start


---------40:05----------
sorry that you cut off a lesson so how


---------40:07----------
do people start okay so this is um no


---------40:12----------
this is great we're getting like deep


---------40:13----------
into the philosophy so if you know so


---------40:15----------
the other thing that I like to think


---------40:16----------
about is so the things that need to be


---------40:20----------
healed or realigned are the mind the


---------40:23----------
voice the body and I like to use the


---------40:26----------
word alignment because what are we


---------40:28----------
aligning to right or in the psychedelic


---------40:31----------
world you hear the term psychedelic


---------40:32----------
integration but I've never heard of a


---------40:34----------
good definition of what that actually


---------40:36----------
means it's almost like a buzzword now


---------40:38----------
but because what are we integrating to


---------40:40----------
and so I like to think about the heart


---------40:43----------
right I think it happened you know that


---------40:45----------
you know not to get I don't know how


---------40:46----------
many people on here follow chakras etc


---------40:48----------
but you know the heart is the part of me


---------40:51----------
that I think about note that knows like


---------40:54----------
like it cannot get off course you know


---------40:59----------
it's kind of like the GPS that's


---------41:02----------
installed in us the moment we're born


---------41:04----------
and it is like this you know


---------41:06----------
we're starting here this is where you


---------41:07----------
want to be at the end of your life or


---------41:09----------
this is how you want to live with your


---------41:11----------
life and that part to me I like to think


---------41:14----------
about it again it is it will not fear


---------41:16----------
and the things that can veer on or off


---------41:20----------
are the mind the voice of body and I


---------41:24----------
actually think of emotions then as not


---------41:27----------
being like I don't think of don't yeah I


---------41:31----------
want to get rid of sadness or I want to


---------41:33----------
get rid of fear because to me he you


---------41:36----------
know the what we call painful emotions


---------41:38----------
are actually the GPS signal like it were


---------41:42----------
if we're driving and we go on the wrong


---------41:43----------
Street


---------41:44----------
the GPS is like no turn around here make


---------41:47----------
a u-turn go back you're going on the


---------41:49----------
wrong direction


---------41:50----------
and so to me sadness fear shame are


---------41:54----------
emotions that tell us you're going off


---------41:57----------
course come back to where you want to be


---------41:59----------
but we began learn to judge the emotions


---------42:01----------
we've learned to to to want to get rid


---------42:04----------
of them where I'm like I actually want


---------42:06----------
those things because if I didn't have


---------42:09----------
anxiety and fear and sadness when I was


---------42:13----------
like living this life I didn't want to


---------42:15----------
live I would still be doing that and I


---------42:16----------
would be miserable and so so when I when


---------42:21----------
I think of the healing I think of like


---------42:23----------
getting back on on that path and so I


---------42:24----------
like to think about you know when the


---------42:26----------
mind boughs to the heart when the voice


---------42:29----------
boughs to the heart when the body boughs


---------42:31----------
to the heart that is the flow state to


---------42:33----------
me so so it was like good saying like I


---------42:35----------
don't know what my heart says how do I


---------42:39----------
find out how do I find that out


---------42:42----------
beautiful and so and that that is a


---------42:44----------
challenge right and I and I would say


---------42:48----------
it's listening to the body so the


---------42:50----------
emotions are also not to me the body is


---------42:53----------
where we feel emotion and that those


---------42:58----------
signals are all also never wrong a


---------43:01----------
problem can be mixed in there because


---------43:03----------
once we start adding Western medications


---------43:05----------
right if we start feeling again


---------43:08----------
depressed or sad and we take


---------43:11----------
antidepressants it can numb us so then


---------43:13----------
we can lose connection to our body or if


---------43:18----------
we take stimulant


---------43:19----------
right a lot of people are on ritalin or


---------43:22----------
on adderall and adderall increases


---------43:25----------
anxiety so all of a sudden like the


---------43:27----------
normal signals from our body are getting


---------43:29----------
all these mixed-up things from what many


---------43:32----------
of the doctors out there are prescribing


---------43:33----------
people so I would say step one to


---------43:36----------
reconnecting to our hearts is to try


---------43:39----------
when safe is possible to try to build a


---------43:42----------
connection with the body and start


---------43:43----------
trusting it again and being like my but


---------43:45----------
there's nothing wrong with my body it's


---------43:47----------
just trying to tell me something and


---------43:48----------
that's bad in the Western world as a


---------43:50----------
whole it's a new concept so I'm gonna


---------43:53----------
try to push you a little bit on this


---------43:55----------
because I'm gonna like envision


---------43:56----------
something for a second okay like if


---------43:58----------
you're talking about stories so I want


---------44:00----------
you to imagine a 24 year old guy who's


---------44:02----------
living at home with his parents in his


---------44:05----------
parents basement finished two and a half


---------44:07----------
years of college before dropping out


---------44:09----------
plays video games all day


---------44:10----------
his overweight doesn't eat healthy


---------44:13----------
doesn't know what he wants and is deeply


---------44:15----------
unsatisfied with his life but feels


---------44:17----------
absolutely stuck


---------44:19----------
anytime he tries to go out into the


---------44:21----------
world it hurts


---------44:23----------
anytime he thinks about his life it


---------44:26----------
hurts what does that person do how does


---------44:29----------
that person begin he doesn't even know


---------44:31----------
what he wants or okay so I would start


---------44:40----------
one of the things that I am big on right


---------44:43----------
now is is watching the mind and starting


---------44:48----------
by saying you are not your mind so I


---------44:51----------
listen to narratives very closely when I


---------44:54----------
am working with a client because you


---------44:57----------
know and the reason I mentioned this is


---------44:59----------
because you said and I believe that many


---------45:01----------
people out there believe I don't know


---------45:03----------
what I want and and this comes from the


---------45:07----------
area of like I think we create our


---------45:09----------
reality based on our thoughts and if I


---------45:12----------
approach the world say being like I


---------45:15----------
don't know what I want that supports


---------45:17----------
that what you know that basically says


---------45:18----------
my body's not I I don't have a


---------45:21----------
connection to my heart I don't have a


---------45:22----------
connection to my body so first I would


---------45:24----------
start saying you know I feel like it's


---------45:27----------
it's difficult to know what I want right


---------45:30----------
or I'm learning how to how to


---------45:32----------
how to figure out what I want so you


---------45:36----------
know I would say that most everybody


---------45:37----------
also has a certain number of things that


---------45:40----------
they do enjoy maybe it's a small number


---------45:44----------
of things but I would start by saying ah


---------45:46----------
when I have had these experiences in the


---------45:48----------
past or when I have these experience


---------45:51----------
nowadays it may only be 5% of my living


---------45:54----------
day but these things have brought me joy


---------45:57----------
you know what you know why is it why


---------46:00----------
doesn't my life look more like this


---------46:03----------
and so that's trying to just you know


---------46:06----------
piece together the puzzle so one would


---------46:08----------
be like a practical just like well can I


---------46:11----------
spend my more of my life you know doing


---------46:15----------
these things that I like so that's one


---------46:17----------
level yeah it's interesting it's it's


---------46:21----------
hard a little bit but I like I like that


---------46:23----------
you're pushing me on this and you know


---------46:26----------
for me I was actually really overweight


---------46:28----------
I'm open about this I've liked some


---------46:29----------
pictures out there or I'm like hey Devon


---------46:32----------
drew pounds more than I weighed right


---------46:34----------
now about 15 years ago you know and so


---------46:36----------
you mentioned the weight thing because


---------46:39----------
that was in some ways for me a way of


---------46:41----------
ignoring my body right I was like


---------46:42----------
feeling discomfort or anxiety and I


---------46:44----------
would eat so another way of actually


---------46:49----------
trying to make choice points and what we


---------46:52----------
do and how we spend our time is saying


---------46:53----------
ah if I am doing a behavior and that


---------46:57----------
could be like porn that could be


---------46:59----------
spending a lot of time you know too much


---------47:00----------
time on a game or something like there's


---------47:03----------
a level where we usually know like this


---------47:05----------
is fun or I'm doing this to escape I'm


---------47:09----------
doing this to ignore something


---------47:10----------
so another thing become aware of when is


---------47:13----------
my behavior shifting towards perhaps


---------47:15----------
just wanting to ignore what's happening


---------47:17----------
out there because that could usually be


---------47:19----------
a choice where a choice point was


---------47:21----------
possible you know I my friend how did


---------47:25----------
she lose the weight by by doing the


---------47:29----------
healing it happened it was very gradual


---------47:31----------
you know I first I actually I was living


---------47:33----------
in England so I moved to England to


---------47:35----------
start my PhD and this is an interesting


---------47:37----------
story


---------47:37----------
so I weighed 235 pounds at my maximum


---------47:42----------
and I'm like 150 155 right now but when


---------47:45----------
I


---------47:45----------
lived when I moved to England I was at


---------47:48----------
235 and it's funny because in grad


---------47:51----------
school in England you have a lot of


---------47:53----------
foreigners coming in and yep two major


---------47:56----------
categories you have Americans and you


---------47:57----------
have Europeans and British food is


---------48:00----------
really unhealthy so it's funny though so


---------48:04----------
the Europeans that go to grad school in


---------48:06----------
England end up gaining a bunch of weight


---------48:08----------
because the food that's served is really


---------48:11----------
unhealthy but the Americans end up


---------48:13----------
losing weight because food is portioned


---------48:16----------
at school and so in order to like keep


---------48:18----------
feeding myself I would have had to ask


---------48:20----------
for double portions and I was like too


---------48:22----------
embarrassed that happened to correlate


---------48:27----------
with me just doing getting out of


---------48:29----------
medical school and having people


---------48:31----------
actually respect me intellectually and


---------48:33----------
it was it was a time of just like


---------48:35----------
feeling appreciated and so it was kind


---------48:37----------
of both of those things happening at the


---------48:38----------
same time you know so that in some ways


---------48:42----------
started my healing even before my first


---------48:44----------
you know big big mental health crisis


---------48:47----------
but that's to say it's just like again


---------48:49----------
it's building the relationship with the


---------48:51----------
emotions in the body and being like okay


---------48:53----------
like I'm avoiding this by doing this and


---------48:59----------
and and then once we can identify some


---------49:01----------
of those it's like okay well why am i


---------49:03----------
avoiding this is it because I'm scared


---------49:05----------
am i afraid of being rejected by friends


---------49:08----------
or girl or or whatever and then and then


---------49:11----------
looking at that mean like if that's


---------49:13----------
something I can work on because I would


---------49:14----------
actually really rather be over here


---------49:16----------
doing this but it's scary to go from


---------49:19----------
here to there this is easy right


---------49:21----------
comforting myself with food I know it


---------49:23----------
works or comforting myself with again


---------49:26----------
porn are comforting myself with this it


---------49:28----------
works but in the short term right but


---------49:31----------
where I want to actually have my life be


---------49:33----------
is over here and to me that's the


---------49:35----------
healing work how do I get back to here


---------49:37----------
to trust you myself to building my


---------49:38----------
confidence to to feeling like you know


---------49:41----------
all of us at some age we're like you


---------49:44----------
know life is a miracle and I can achieve


---------49:46----------
anything and then the world outside of


---------49:48----------
us starts making ourselves doubt and so


---------49:50----------
how do we then build that back up as


---------49:52----------
adults and being like no I am capable of


---------49:55----------
pretty much living any life I want to


---------49:57----------
live


---------49:59----------
yeah it's interesting I'm just


---------50:00----------
remembering actually we had an interview


---------50:02----------
on Wednesday where it was kind of


---------50:07----------
bouncing around for a while but then the


---------50:09----------
person I was talking to said this one


---------50:11----------
sentence that for some reason just


---------50:12----------
really bothered me and and and she said


---------50:16----------
something like I don't have a voice like


---------50:17----------
people don't listen to me or people


---------50:20----------
don't yeah and and that was something


---------50:22----------
that I for some reason it resonated with


---------50:25----------
me and I took issue with it and I really


---------50:27----------
challenged her on it that her words have


---------50:31----------
no meaning and and that it was it was


---------50:34----------
weird it was like kind of a random thing


---------50:36----------
which usually is like what happens and


---------50:37----------
when we talked to people on stream is


---------50:39----------
like we're just kind of bouncing around


---------50:41----------
for an hour and then like something


---------50:42----------
happens where we catch on something and


---------50:45----------
then some kind of catharsis comes out of


---------50:47----------
it and that I think was the start of her


---------50:49----------
catharsis a couple of days ago so it's


---------50:52----------
fascinating I think a little bit about


---------50:53----------
voice and and I I really like the way


---------50:57----------
that you frame that you know the


---------50:59----------
negative things that we feel but if


---------51:01----------
someone says I don't know what I want in


---------51:04----------
life the negative things that we feel


---------51:06----------
are actually signals that are pointing


---------51:08----------
us in the right direction right and and


---------51:12----------
it can be something as simple as like I


---------51:13----------
don't want to be ashamed of the way that


---------51:15----------
I look and and so you can sort of


---------51:17----------
suppress that through video games or


---------51:19----------
medications or other things or you can


---------51:21----------
evoke and sort of sort through that and


---------51:24----------
use that as your navigating compass to


---------51:27----------
like get back to where you really want


---------51:28----------
to go and make a positive change which


---------51:31----------
is I think a beautiful way to put it so


---------51:34----------
I'm kind of curious yeah and I started


---------51:36----------
gonna go ahead it's gonna say I think


---------51:38----------
each emotion has a healthy version of it


---------51:41----------
in an unhealthy version and the I guess


---------51:45----------
maybe like a healthy game or an


---------51:47----------
unhealthy gamer yeah boomer joke and no


---------51:52----------
one's gonna think no no but but we'll


---------51:53----------
just to jump in for a second that's


---------51:55----------
exactly why we chose the name that we


---------51:57----------
did because like everyone is talking


---------51:59----------
about video game addiction and they're


---------52:01----------
talking about it is is like a one


---------52:04----------
unidirectional negative thing like a


---------52:06----------
couple months ago Trump said something


---------52:08----------
like video games are the reason that


---------52:10----------
school shootings happen and you know


---------52:11----------
people demonize video games and stuff


---------52:13----------
that and and my goal is not to like I


---------52:16----------
don't think that it's like an


---------52:17----------
abstinence-only kind of thing right it's


---------52:19----------
like if someone's addicted like is


---------52:21----------
addicted to sex like our goal is not to


---------52:23----------
make them celibate our goal is to help


---------52:25----------
them be like a healthy person like an


---------52:27----------
integrated person someone who enjoys


---------52:29----------
games and derives pleasure out of them


---------52:31----------
but also that the games don't get in the


---------52:33----------
way of like all of this other [ __ ]


---------52:35----------
that they don't become exclusionary and


---------52:38----------
and so I mean I'm glad you kind of


---------52:40----------
picked up on that because that's


---------52:41----------
absolutely those precisely the


---------52:43----------
inspiration behind what we're trying to


---------52:45----------
do we're not really even treating video


---------52:47----------
game addiction we're just trying to help


---------52:49----------
total our people good yeah that's to me


---------52:54----------
what leads to some of the initial stuff


---------52:55----------
anyway like I'm you know yeah I've never


---------52:57----------
played video games really because


---------52:58----------
honestly I suck at anything but I


---------53:02----------
yeah we what makes you feel like your


---------53:04----------
video game playing is inadequate well


---------53:06----------
why do you think that hosted me therapy


---------53:10----------
or do we are we gonna do therapy in my


---------53:11----------
game addiction no on your avoidance of


---------53:14----------
playing video games so why you feel like


---------53:17----------
like Nintendo is what I had in


---------53:20----------
elementary theory and like I just sucked


---------53:24----------
it all the fighting like Aaron would


---------53:25----------
kick my ass and it made my self-esteem


---------53:27----------
just drop like I just was horrible okay


---------53:30----------
no all right god oh well so so healthy


---------53:38----------
and unhealthy right so I would say what


---------53:41----------
is healthy you know why would I you know


---------53:44----------
I think there's a healthy version of


---------53:46----------
shame and there's an unhealthy version


---------53:48----------
of shame there's healthy sadness there's


---------53:50----------
unhealthy sadness the healthy and


---------53:53----------
unhealthy for me comes from the choice


---------53:57----------
that we make after experiencing it it's


---------54:00----------
the part of free will of being a human


---------54:02----------
being that is one of the coolest parts


---------54:03----------
of this larger video game that we're in


---------54:06----------
called the human experience like if I


---------54:10----------
have shame over something and that shame


---------54:12----------
leads me to go back onto a path that


---------54:16----------
leap that is in the line with my heart


---------54:18----------
that's healthy shame if I experience


---------54:21----------
shame over something and I feel worse


---------54:22----------
and then I end up


---------54:26----------
doing behaviors that that make me


---------54:28----------
disconnect from people like diving into


---------54:32----------
alcohol or something else then it's


---------54:35----------
unhealthy shame because I'm using it to


---------54:37----------
further pull myself away is the way I


---------54:39----------
like to do it I like to believe that


---------54:43----------
everyone's trying their best and


---------54:44----------
everyone wants to be in alignment and


---------54:46----------
and you know and I think there's a


---------54:48----------
tremendous amount of judgment from the


---------54:50----------
outside world so when you were talking


---------54:51----------
about this you know this conversation


---------54:53----------
that you were having earlier in the week


---------54:55----------
you know you know I think I'm like knit


---------54:58----------
again when I listen to narratives you


---------55:00----------
know narratives are usually another


---------55:02----------
beautiful sign of where the root of the


---------55:07----------
problem is like if someone's like you


---------55:11----------
know I remember myself I used to tell


---------55:12----------
myself and I still struggle I would say


---------55:13----------
like I'm single and I'm dating and I


---------55:15----------
like I still like I think you know


---------55:17----------
ultimately you're such a catch are you


---------55:21----------
trying to hit on me no but maybe one day


---------55:26----------
you know one of the things that you know


---------55:30----------
I used to tell myself and I'm still


---------55:32----------
working through at some level is like I


---------55:34----------
know you know if I go to a party I I


---------55:38----------
would you know I uppal years ago I would


---------55:40----------
be walking into the party being like oh


---------55:43----------
this is gonna be one of those parties


---------55:45----------
where I'm gonna like see someone a girl


---------55:47----------
I like and I'm not gonna talk to her and


---------55:49----------
then I'm gonna go home and feel shitty


---------55:50----------
about myself or oh I shouldn't even go


---------55:53----------
to that party cuz like these people who


---------55:54----------
were cooler than me are gonna be there


---------55:56----------
and then like but what I realized is


---------55:58----------
like I don't know I'd like to think of


---------56:00----------
these three positions right so and years


---------56:03----------
ago I was in his position of and then at


---------56:05----------
some point I started talking myself out


---------56:06----------
of it being like oh my career is more


---------56:08----------
important you know dating is a waste of


---------56:10----------
time you know if it's not helping me


---------56:14----------
towards this goal but what I was


---------56:16----------
realizing there was a narrative I built


---------56:17----------
for myself that narrative was I don't


---------56:21----------
want to be in a relationship and I don't


---------56:23----------
want there sorry I'm not in a


---------56:25----------
relationship


---------56:25----------
and I don't want to be in one the


---------56:28----------
position I want to be in is I want to be


---------56:32----------
in a relationship and I'm in one mmm


---------56:35----------
but that wasn't happening there's this


---------56:38----------
position of pain in the middle which is


---------56:41----------
saying I admit that I want to be in a


---------56:43----------
relationship and I'm not in one mm-hmm


---------56:45----------
but the less acutely painful position on


---------56:48----------
a daily basis would be to say tell


---------56:50----------
myself I don't want that


---------56:52----------
like I'm not capable of that so then


---------56:55----------
that narrative starts saying I'm gonna


---------56:57----------
hide I'm gonna shrink myself I'm gonna


---------56:59----------
make myself small so what I think of the


---------57:01----------
healing path it is it is necessary to go


---------57:04----------
through this middle experience but it's


---------57:06----------
really hard because usually at some


---------57:08----------
point in our life we built a life around


---------57:10----------
ourselves that supports that that


---------57:12----------
narrative of here right at some point I


---------57:15----------
was surrounding my friends that were you


---------57:19----------
know that were cooler than me or that


---------57:21----------
felt that they were better than me and


---------57:23----------
then at some point I was like as I was


---------57:24----------
doing the healing I'm like all these


---------57:26----------
people like if they're not supporting


---------57:27----------
like Who I am in my heart goodbye and


---------57:30----------
that and that was one of the harder


---------57:32----------
things as I transition through my


---------57:34----------
healing step after step is trusting


---------57:36----------
myself it was saying I know what's right


---------57:38----------
for me and all these people around me


---------57:41----------
are a lot of them they're wrong and that


---------57:43----------
was a big step of trusting myself and


---------57:46----------
and I think as a young man if I try to


---------57:48----------
think back when I was in my early 20s I


---------57:49----------
think that would have been a big one is


---------57:51----------
to just is to really just learn you know


---------57:54----------
to have emotions to express them because


---------57:57----------
like men especially are you know again


---------57:59----------
if you if you're sad if you're crying if


---------58:01----------
you're scared you're weak and I'm like


---------58:03----------
you know up until when I started my


---------58:05----------
healing seven eight years ago I hadn't


---------58:07----------
cried in like 15 years and I will say I


---------58:10----------
cry most you know at least once or twice


---------58:13----------
a week and I love it I'm where I was


---------58:16----------
living in New York City up until


---------58:17----------
December and there was many points in


---------58:20----------
the last year that I was living there I


---------58:21----------
would be on the subway its crowd in rush


---------58:23----------
hour I would see a cute girl or whatever


---------58:25----------
and if I was going through something and


---------58:27----------
I was sad I let myself cry and you know


---------58:29----------
and it felt so good to be like I don't


---------58:32----------
have to hide anything like I am just Who


---------58:34----------
I am and it maybe seems paradoxical but


---------58:39----------
through that like I wasn't I was just


---------58:42----------
more and more free to be who I was you


---------58:44----------
know I mean and I was just like [ __ ] all


---------58:45----------
this like I am this human being I have


---------58:48----------
emotion


---------58:49----------
and yeah my life has been only better


---------58:52----------
you know but it's step by step and


---------58:54----------
awesome yeah thank you so much for


---------58:56----------
everything how are you feeling right now


---------59:00----------
really good yeah I really love like I


---------59:04----------
think about my Dharma and why I'm here


---------59:06----------
and to me it's it's to be a healer but


---------59:09----------
you know the kind of like when we


---------59:11----------
started I that's why I love stories


---------59:12----------
because you know I realized after some


---------59:14----------
time like talking to my patients or


---------59:16----------
after giving a public talk or something


---------59:18----------
that people come up to me and especially


---------59:20----------
men and I love it when they do this cuz


---------59:22----------
they're like oh my god thank you for


---------59:24----------
saying this like that's me and I'm like


---------59:26----------
I started realizing this is everyone and


---------59:28----------
so that's when I started being much less


---------59:30----------
afraid of being me cuz I'm like I'm


---------59:33----------
myself and this is another thing that I


---------59:36----------
think about is like you know some some


---------59:39----------
people so I talked about my traumas or I


---------59:40----------
talked about like I gave a talk actually


---------59:42----------
last December about how like like my


---------59:44----------
penis size and when I was like younger I


---------59:46----------
was like super self-conscious about my


---------59:48----------
penis size and like I never hear guys


---------59:50----------
talking about this and it was


---------59:53----------
interesting because it's one example


---------59:55----------
where there's two things that happen


---------59:56----------
after I give a public talk and I'm open


---------59:59----------
about something people or they'll email


---------60:01----------
me and they'll say one I'll either say


---------60:03----------
thank you for being strong or number two


---------60:06----------
they will say thank you for being


---------60:08----------
vulnerable and I realized that depending


---------60:12----------
on where I was in my stage of healing


---------60:14----------
something those that one or the other


---------60:16----------
used to feel true but once I had my real


---------60:21----------
catharsis after you know whether it's in


---------60:23----------
with my therapist or whether I have you


---------60:25----------
know I was in an ayahuasca retreat is


---------60:27----------
both of those stopped resonating because


---------60:30----------
I'm like I'm not actually being


---------60:31----------
particularly strong I'm just being Who I


---------60:33----------
am or number two I'm not being


---------60:36----------
vulnerable like vulnerable to what if I


---------60:39----------
if I tell someone that I had a flying


---------60:42----------
phobia if I'm on a date or if I tell a


---------60:44----------
girl like hey when I was like you know


---------60:46----------
for a lot of my adult male life I was


---------60:49----------
like self-conscious about my penis size


---------60:51----------
and that girl decides to like not date


---------60:52----------
me


---------60:53----------
like that's not vulnerable like I would


---------60:55----------
actually thank you like I wouldn't even


---------60:57----------
want to be dating someone who who would


---------60:59----------
who would leave me for that so I


---------61:00----------
actually think of it as a favor like it


---------61:02----------
not even then I'm being bolder bomb just


---------61:03----------
like thank you like like don't wait by


---------61:05----------
time yeah absolutely I mean I think it's


---------61:08----------
beautifully put and I think that's what


---------61:09----------
people you know that's where people want


---------61:11----------
to be can you tell us a little bit about


---------61:13----------
the ayahuasca retreat yeah so ayahuasca


---------61:17----------
it's interesting so you know maybe that


---------61:19----------
we can talk a little bit about a


---------61:21----------
different shirt different target


---------61:23----------
psychedelics and and first of all you


---------61:25----------
know I wanna I want to say I like to


---------61:26----------
think about psychedelics there's five


---------61:31----------
general like I think legitimate uses of


---------61:36----------
psychedelics and legitimately meaning


---------61:37----------
they're distinct uses of them so I think


---------61:39----------
of healing which we're talking about any


---------61:43----------
second would be kind of spirituality or


---------61:45----------
enlightenment third would be recreation


---------61:48----------
and fun fourth would be kind of like


---------61:53----------
exploration of human potential or


---------61:55----------
wanting to think of new ideas and fifth


---------61:58----------
would be abuse or addiction and I don't


---------62:02----------
again I'm not someone who judges anyone


---------62:04----------
but I just like to tell people will be


---------62:06----------
clear about why you're using it that's


---------62:09----------
all we need to do like don't say that


---------62:11----------
you're gonna go out and just do it at a


---------62:12----------
festival and that equals healing there


---------62:15----------
is mixes between them right fun if you


---------62:18----------
have a really fun connected experience


---------62:20----------
that can be healing or you know


---------62:21----------
spirituality enlightenment is on the


---------62:24----------
continuum of healing but I think it's


---------62:26----------
useful to think of them that way so


---------62:28----------
along the lines of that so I also like


---------62:32----------
to think of the different categories of


---------62:33----------
psychedelics as being there they're not


---------62:37----------
they're also on a continuum meaning like


---------62:40----------
the in effects are very different you


---------62:42----------
know you have something like MDMA which


---------62:45----------
I like to describe as I mean people call


---------62:46----------
it a heart opener right it's a connector


---------62:48----------
you there's a trusting feeling when


---------62:50----------
you're diving into trauma I also like to


---------62:53----------
say that MDMA stays on the plane of this


---------62:57----------
consensus reality meaning for the most


---------63:00----------
part 99.9 percent of the time it's gonna


---------63:04----------
have some you know the experience you


---------63:05----------
have has something to do with this birth


---------63:07----------
to this death you know meaning it does


---------63:10----------
not get what we call transpersonal or


---------63:12----------
non ordinary on the other end of the


---------63:15----------
spectrum is Iowa


---------63:16----------
where you will have people have


---------63:17----------
experiences and they'll say oh my god I


---------63:19----------
relived a past life or I had my death


---------63:23----------
than my rebirth or you know I was


---------63:25----------
connecting with spirits that were


---------63:27----------
talking to me about my past you know


---------63:30----------
dead relatives or something like that


---------63:31----------
and so those are kind of on opposite


---------63:34----------
ends of the spectrum and and you know I


---------63:37----------
I just like to have people at least know


---------63:40----------
that basic because if I'm someone who


---------63:43----------
just wants to like feel less depressed


---------63:44----------
feel less anxious and say I come from a


---------63:48----------
relatively conservative background like


---------63:52----------
right I was I was Jehovah's Witness and


---------63:54----------
so even though I had left the church


---------63:55----------
when I was in my teens the history of


---------63:57----------
that trauma stayed with me so for me to


---------64:00----------
go straight into something like


---------64:01----------
ayahuasca would be a big deal if I just


---------64:04----------
want to feel less anxious because like


---------64:06----------
like to get all sorts of other


---------64:08----------
experiences like spirits and stuff I


---------64:11----------
wasn't ready for that and so you know


---------64:15----------
we're something like MDMA which is more


---------64:16----------
gentle and again it just stays on the


---------64:18----------
plane of this reality I think is you


---------64:20----------
know an interesting way to think about


---------64:22----------
it okay so now to actually answer your


---------64:23----------
question


---------64:24----------
so ayahuasca for those who don't know


---------64:26----------
there's a lot of it in the media and


---------64:28----------
it's it's a mixture of a bunch of


---------64:32----------
different plants that comes from


---------64:33----------
Amazonian culture so the Amazon in Peru


---------64:36----------
or Brazil or Ecuador or Colombia and


---------64:40----------
it's a it's a psychedelic tea that plant


---------64:43----------
healers used to use or that still use


---------64:45----------
that has been around for a thousands of


---------64:47----------
years at this point it's thought and you


---------64:51----------
know some Westerners went down I think


---------64:52----------
it was like in the early 90s and then


---------64:55----------
got connected with the tribes tried this


---------64:57----------
tea and we're like oh my god this helps


---------64:58----------
so much and so it is an incredibly


---------65:01----------
powerful healing tool and it is like my


---------65:03----------
personal like I don't want to say


---------65:07----------
favorite favorite it's just my preferred


---------65:09----------
tool for healing myself right now


---------65:10----------
because it's like now that I've learned


---------65:12----------
to work with it it is very powerful and


---------65:16----------
it's out there a lot in and you just


---------65:17----------
want to be really mindful like of all


---------65:19----------
the ayahuasca retreats because there's


---------65:20----------
all sorts of advertisements and people


---------65:22----------
claiming it's going to do XYZ for you a


---------65:25----------
lot of them at this point are in it for


---------65:27----------
the money or the the people facilitate


---------65:30----------
the experience don't really know what


---------65:32----------
they're doing they don't emphasize like


---------65:35----------
the preparation of the person in the


---------65:38----------
week's calm or the you know help after


---------65:40----------
they they're just really in there to get


---------65:42----------
people in you pay us a two or three


---------65:44----------
thousand dollars and then you go home


---------65:45----------
and you know there's only one or two in


---------65:48----------
the world that I completely trust


---------65:50----------
because you know I I really think that


---------65:52----------
all these other things that we're


---------65:53----------
talking about are so important to the


---------65:55----------
healing process and the psychedelic is


---------65:56----------
like this it's powerful but it's still


---------65:58----------
only like a little step in the tool of


---------66:01----------
your of your own ability to heal


---------66:03----------
yourself so so can you tell us a little


---------66:06----------
bit about like the other ones so you


---------66:08----------
said that you know MDMA is not quite as


---------66:10----------
trans personal and sort of enhances


---------66:12----------
trust you know has very promising uses


---------66:18----------
for like preliminary trials for like


---------66:19----------
PTSD or something like that and kind of


---------66:21----------
enhances the therapeutic relationship


---------66:23----------
ayahuasca is very transpersonal has more


---------66:26----------
of a spiritual kind of experience what


---------66:29----------
about things like ketamine psilocybin


---------66:34----------
ibogaine yep LSD that would literally


---------66:42----------
take another hour but let me at least


---------66:43----------
summarize so ketamine is an interesting


---------66:48----------
one you know it's interesting because a


---------66:51----------
it's the only one that's legally


---------66:52----------
available right now B by the way how our


---------66:55----------
audience is from the EU about ah


---------66:58----------
interesting


---------66:59----------
yeah actually ketamine I believe is also


---------67:01----------
legal right now in the EU I don't know


---------67:05----------
how many actual mental health


---------67:06----------
practitioners are using it my guess


---------67:08----------
would be very few and the ketamine is an


---------67:12----------
interesting one it comes from its


---------67:14----------
historical use has been in anaesthesia


---------67:16----------
and so it's an anesthetic because it


---------67:18----------
dissociates and meaning it dissociates


---------67:19----------
the body from the mind and if you get


---------67:22----------
complete disconnection you can cut into


---------67:25----------
the skin because you're not going to


---------67:26----------
feel pain and you can do surgery about


---------67:29----------
twenty years ago now there was an


---------67:32----------
orthopedic surgeon who was doing a bunch


---------67:33----------
of procedures on his patients and then


---------67:35----------
decided to look at his data and then


---------67:38----------
found just by chance that the people who


---------67:41----------
were depressed and suicidal who


---------67:43----------
he used ketamine with we're feeling less


---------67:47----------
depressed and suicidal and that's how it


---------67:48----------
really entered the knowledge of


---------67:50----------
psychiatry because it was just found


---------67:52----------
that oh my god this happens to work I


---------67:54----------
mentioned that because ketamine is on a


---------67:57----------
gradient right like you would have to


---------67:59----------
use really high doses to do complete


---------68:02----------
anesthesia on someone and that is not to


---------68:04----------
me the area where we want to be for


---------68:07----------
psychedelic healing um I guess I maybe I


---------68:10----------
want to introduce this this concept of


---------68:12----------
the what we call the liminal space the


---------68:15----------
word isn't important but basically you


---------68:17----------
know if we think of ourselves as here as


---------68:19----------
a human being with a body with an ego


---------68:23----------
that's like me and my isolated again


---------68:27----------
mind and body you know I like to think


---------68:30----------
I'm also that place that we look at deep


---------68:33----------
in spirituality religion or even without


---------68:36----------
those like like even people who are say


---------68:38----------
often agnostic or like at least there's


---------68:40----------
something there could be something


---------68:41----------
greater so I don't like to make it you


---------68:44----------
know denominational so there's this


---------68:46----------
place that most people believe you know


---------68:49----------
is that place that we come from and


---------68:51----------
where we will go after we die so there's


---------68:53----------
these two positions and I like to think


---------68:55----------
about psychedelics can connect you on a


---------68:58----------
continuum from one to the other and some


---------69:01----------
of them do it very intensely and some of


---------69:04----------
them do it gently or more gradually and


---------69:06----------
I happen to think that the powerful


---------69:09----------
healing aspect of psychedelics is when


---------69:12----------
we're on the liminal space meaning you


---------69:14----------
have some awareness of this and you have


---------69:17----------
some awareness of this and if you can


---------69:19----------
ride that then you can do the healing


---------69:21----------
work there and so that's a long-winded


---------69:24----------
way of saying like ketamine and you know


---------69:26----------
I think all psychedelics dose matters


---------69:29----------
along that continuum but ketamine is one


---------69:31----------
where it's very important and because


---------69:33----------
it's getting more use and it's out and


---------69:35----------
there in the media like I'll assure you


---------69:37----------
99.9% of people doctors using ketamine


---------69:41----------
don't understand what I'm talking about


---------69:43----------
right now and they're just like okay


---------69:44----------
well let me just inject this and we'll


---------69:45----------
charge people $500 or whatever like this


---------69:48----------
it's a it's a really intimate science of


---------69:51----------
how this works and so I try to actually


---------69:54----------
help people stay on that liminal space


---------69:56----------
right because it's like how


---------69:57----------
how can I you know again have access to


---------70:00----------
both of these things at the same time on


---------70:02----------
the other end of the spectrum the smoked


---------70:05----------
version of ayahuasca which is called DMT


---------70:07----------
or there's this other compound that


---------70:09----------
people refer to as toad because it's


---------70:11----------
it's five Meo DMT which is if you like


---------70:16----------
there's this Sonoran frog in in Mexico


---------70:19----------
where they used to use this frog


---------70:20----------
medicinally or they still do some some


---------70:22----------
indigenous where you milk the I think


---------70:25----------
it's the salivary gland and you can get


---------70:27----------
this compound it's that psychedelic out


---------70:30----------
of out of the toad and those two the


---------70:33----------
smoked versions are the most powerful


---------70:35----------
psychedelic that you could ever


---------70:36----------
encounter you go from here to here you


---------70:41----------
you start going into it intensely within


---------70:43----------
15-20 seconds and you are completely


---------70:44----------
here for about I don't five to eight


---------70:49----------
minutes but again it's weird because of


---------70:53----------
the five to eight minutes don't matter


---------70:54----------
because up here time time ceases to


---------70:57----------
exist so I've had people that experience


---------70:59----------
it and they're like I experienced every


---------71:02----------
single event from the beginning of time


---------71:04----------
to the end of time during that that


---------71:07----------
absurd observed outside time that was


---------71:09----------
five minutes you know and I'll mention


---------71:11----------
that because I rarely now find a healing


---------71:14----------
usefulness of going from here to here


---------71:16----------
like doing this is it interesting is it


---------71:20----------
magnificent you know can it remind you


---------71:23----------
of you know the bigger picture sure but


---------71:27----------
you still got to come back and like work


---------71:29----------
with these you know these narratives and


---------71:31----------
these painful things in everyday life


---------71:33----------
and so I'm someone who actually is much


---------71:35----------
more of an advocate for lower doses and


---------71:37----------
it's just you don't see that much out


---------71:39----------
there right now because people part of


---------71:41----------
what pulls people to psychedelics is the


---------71:43----------
stories oh my god like did I wasps guy


---------71:45----------
and I saw this like Panther didn't


---------71:47----------
appeared and it like converted into my


---------71:49----------
grandmother and you know people tell me


---------71:51----------
those stories and I'm like well okay but


---------71:53----------
how does that help you in a daily basis


---------71:55----------
you know yeah absolutely I think that's


---------71:57----------
it's a great point I mean I think it's


---------71:59----------
also interesting to kind of think a


---------72:01----------
little bit about staying connected to


---------72:02----------
like the person that you have to come


---------72:04----------
back to and if you have an experience


---------72:07----------
that is completely unrelated to the


---------72:09----------
person that you live


---------72:10----------
of your life as like it's gonna be hard


---------72:12----------
for that experience to actually help you


---------72:14----------
in some way you know yeah so we're we're


---------72:18----------
along that continuum is like psilocybin


---------72:20----------
and LSD I think of is kind of right in


---------72:26----------
the middle of the continuum but again


---------72:28----------
these are all these are dose based right


---------72:29----------
and so you can get it actually a


---------72:31----------
beautifully ideal LSD or psilocybin


---------72:35----------
space that rides the liminal but um you


---------72:38----------
know I think it most dose is that you


---------72:40----------
know even if people use like double a


---------72:41----------
normal dose you're still yes you're


---------72:44----------
still riding the limit I like like with


---------72:45----------
those two and so then it becomes more of


---------72:49----------
a time preference right LSD I don't


---------72:51----------
think is ever gonna go down as a


---------72:53----------
consistent psychedelic therapy cuz it


---------72:55----------
lasts so long you know it's like a 10 or


---------72:58----------
12 hour experience and it'll never fit


---------73:00----------
like you know the nine-to-five work


---------73:03----------
world of my dog no doctor doc doesn't


---------73:05----------
really work 9:00 to 5:00 but you know


---------73:06----------
it's not gonna work for just the


---------73:09----------
healthcare profession we're something


---------73:11----------
that's why you're like MDMA you know


---------73:14----------
maybe things could potentially you can


---------73:15----------
get them down in like six hour sessions


---------73:17----------
sure and that's another place where


---------73:19----------
ketamine is actually powerful if it's


---------73:21----------
injected and it's done in a medical


---------73:23----------
environment you can be in and out in


---------73:25----------
like 90 minutes to two hours so okay so


---------73:28----------
we'll I'm wondering like I have one or


---------73:31----------
two other questions for you but like


---------73:34----------
maybe what we can do is hop on discord


---------73:37----------
and I'll walk you had through how to do


---------73:39----------
that in a couple minutes I just have one


---------73:41----------
last question for you so let's say like


---------73:42----------
they're gonna be like so first of all be


---------73:44----------
prepared for you know the the flow of


---------73:49----------
people you know googling your name at


---------73:51----------
this point you may get a bunch of


---------73:53----------
requests and if you need help with that


---------73:56----------
you know we can I can I can try to help


---------73:57----------
you with that


---------73:58----------
afterwards I have to deal with thousands


---------74:01----------
of people contacting you for me I did it


---------74:05----------
thank you yeah of course we have to have


---------74:06----------
you on but so so let's say like people


---------74:09----------
are interested in this right so like


---------74:11----------
you've been talking about psychedelics


---------74:12----------
and they're people who are watching our


---------74:13----------
stream who are like yeah how do I start


---------74:15----------
like how do I do this this all sounds


---------74:17----------
wonderful what do I do about it


---------74:20----------
so it's interesting I will honestly say


---------74:23----------
there isn't


---------74:24----------
much that is too helpful out there right


---------74:26----------
now it honestly it's something that


---------74:29----------
we've talked about what I want to do


---------74:31----------
soon but again I'm a Boomer so I don't


---------74:33----------
know how to do it is I actually want to


---------74:35----------
start putting out educational videos out


---------74:37----------
there for people that just take them


---------74:39----------
step by step in the process and and so


---------74:42----------
hopefully in the next like six months or


---------74:44----------
so right now be open like most of what I


---------74:46----------
what's Google about me is my clinical


---------74:48----------
website silent I don't really have room


---------74:50----------
for new clients right now but at some


---------74:53----------
point I want to link that to you know


---------74:55----------
notice I want to do this pretty soon in


---------74:56----------
the next two or three months and I


---------74:57----------
actually want to put out a priest URIs


---------74:59----------
to help people understand like it all


---------75:01----------
likes how to do them responsibly etc etc


---------75:03----------
um I mean there's really yeah there's


---------75:07----------
not really much I can point to out there


---------75:09----------
I mean Maps is an interesting thing to


---------75:12----------
look at just in as their organization


---------75:14----------
but and yeah I mean they'll have


---------75:16----------
information on conferences and stuff but


---------75:18----------
again if you followed this conversation


---------75:21----------
today like honestly like it's it's this


---------75:23----------
is much deeper than any of the stuff out


---------75:25----------
there that that you can find and so um


---------75:28----------
so what I'm hearing is that there isn't


---------75:30----------
really like a good clean way for someone


---------75:33----------
to there's not a phone number that


---------75:35----------
someone can call where they can find a


---------75:37----------
therapist take MDMA kind of graduate to


---------75:42----------
ayahuasca over time and that that's that


---------75:45----------
infrastructure hasn't been formed yet no


---------75:48----------
you know but yeah it's like you know


---------75:51----------
again and the reason why I really


---------75:52----------
emphasize I like to talk the way I talk


---------75:54----------
is because I don't it this isn't hey


---------75:57----------
there's there's a lot of nuance but it's


---------75:59----------
not so complex like I and like Rick


---------76:03----------
Doblin the founder of maps I'm not


---------76:05----------
someone who is like psychedelic healing


---------76:08----------
and therapy should only be done with


---------76:09----------
doctors and psychologists you know I


---------76:11----------
think people should be free to explore


---------76:13----------
their own consciousness if they're not


---------76:15----------
helped hurting other people and so I


---------76:18----------
would say if you're you know set in


---------76:20----------
setting is a term that's thrown out


---------76:22----------
there a lot meaning you know the


---------76:24----------
experience of a psychedelic I think is


---------76:26----------
determined in some ways by set setting


---------76:30----------
and dosage meaning set is like where the


---------76:34----------
person is like mentally where they are


---------76:36----------
in their stage of lie


---------76:38----------
you know is this a huge peak of anxiety


---------76:40----------
right now because maybe I want to wait a


---------76:42----------
week or two before trying it so if you


---------76:44----------
can manage where you are setting is like


---------76:47----------
where I am taking the psychedelic and


---------76:49----------
who I'm with am I gonna have a sober


---------76:52----------
friend that I really trust can they sit


---------76:54----------
with me for six or eight hours and and


---------76:58----------
are we gonna do this you know at


---------76:59----------
someone's house and it's quiet or out in


---------77:01----------
nature and you don't want if you're


---------77:02----------
doing something for healing don't do


---------77:04----------
that in the middle of a concert or a


---------77:07----------
show because that can turn really bad


---------77:08----------
right it's so many other people and


---------77:11----------
influences dose is the third one like


---------77:14----------
you know if don't don't overdo it you


---------77:17----------
know and so if you start gently with all


---------77:19----------
three of those this is how you learn how


---------77:22----------
to do it right at some stage that's what


---------77:24----------
I did right because there is still no


---------77:26----------
training process for psychiatrists on


---------77:29----------
how to do this a lot of this was me just


---------77:31----------
going out and experimenting finding


---------77:33----------
ketamine doctors who treated me and the


---------77:36----------
early ones I'm like I would never go


---------77:37----------
back and I wouldn't recommend them and


---------77:39----------
then just learn in the process I've been


---------77:41----------
to more ayahuasca retreats that I cannot


---------77:45----------
recommend people to go to then ones I


---------77:48----------
can you know so what I'm trying to do is


---------77:50----------
like you just put together my experience


---------77:51----------
out there for people to try to hopefully


---------77:53----------
have them not have to go through the as


---------77:56----------
much trial and error as I had to sure so


---------77:58----------
I think unfortunately what I'm hearing


---------78:00----------
is that like I know a lot of people out


---------78:02----------
there I get questions about psychedelics


---------78:04----------
a lot and you know some people think


---------78:07----------
that because it has this powerful


---------78:09----------
transformative potential they kind of


---------78:11----------
think like oh if I go to a white


---------78:12----------
ayahuasca retreat I'm gonna be fixed and


---------78:14----------
I'm hearing the very opposite that


---------78:17----------
there's a lot of nuance there's a lot of


---------78:19----------
growth there so a lot of like we're


---------78:20----------
turning to the person that you are and


---------78:23----------
that this is not really like a magic


---------78:25----------
bullet yeah definitely not a magic


---------78:28----------
bullet because I actually I mean I could


---------78:30----------
I think I got at least five emails this


---------78:33----------
week that were like I went to an


---------78:34----------
ayahuasca retreat I did this and I feel


---------78:37----------
a hell of a lot worse like in it it's


---------78:39----------
really sad because that is only in my


---------78:42----------
messages that are about that are only


---------78:44----------
increasing in the last six months year


---------78:46----------
and and yep you know we want to be


---------78:48----------
purple you know so I actually think the


---------78:50----------
best thing to do is if you can get


---------78:51----------
say a cluster of again this is just for


---------78:54----------
educational purposes if you can get


---------78:56----------
three or four people who you really


---------78:57----------
trust friends that you can be open with


---------79:00----------
that you know that you can cry in front


---------79:02----------
of her you can at least be open about


---------79:03----------
you know micro dosing is the whole topic


---------79:06----------
we haven't talked about but it's


---------79:07----------
basically taking small amounts of


---------79:09----------
mushrooms like a 10% dose a 15% dose and


---------79:14----------
say you do you know if I were to you


---------79:16----------
know maybe take that with a close group


---------79:19----------
of friends and we just get together on a


---------79:21----------
Sunday night I guarantee you it's less


---------79:24----------
it's less jarring than the first time we


---------79:28----------
ever got like drunk or passed out you


---------79:31----------
know it's just now we're like used to


---------79:32----------
drinking but that first time where we


---------79:34----------
got really drunk if you think back was


---------79:36----------
probably pretty damn scary yeah you know


---------79:38----------
but it's Tufted in the culture we're


---------79:40----------
like again a 10-15 percent microdose


---------79:43----------
would be so gentle compared to that you


---------79:45----------
know and so I think you know again just


---------79:47----------
creating potentially your own safe


---------79:49----------
setting to do things and explore your


---------79:52----------
consciousness you know so over time


---------79:55----------
unfortunately will I've had similar


---------79:57----------
emails and and one thing that I'll let


---------79:59----------
people know I've actually encountered


---------80:01----------
people who have PTSD from using


---------80:04----------
psychedelics so they'll develop anxiety


---------80:07----------
disorders or will be actually crippled


---------80:09----------
and disabled after having some very very


---------80:12----------
difficult experiences during trips so I


---------80:14----------
think you guys have to be really really


---------80:16----------
careful absolutely so will if you've got


---------80:19----------
you know it sir also you know try to not


---------80:22----------
not build the story kind of as you were


---------80:24----------
saying that LSD equaled my suffering


---------80:28----------
right it's LSD plus difficult things


---------80:32----------
that came up that I couldn't process led


---------80:35----------
to this suffering meaning you don't have


---------80:36----------
to necessarily be terrified of going


---------80:39----------
back to that place if you can set up


---------80:41----------
things for yourself in the future where


---------80:43----------
you know you have more support


---------80:44----------
absolutely man so if you've got time


---------80:47----------
what we're gonna do is just hop on our


---------80:49----------
discord and then give other people a


---------80:51----------
chance to ask questions sure all right


---------80:54----------
so I'll walk you through that process


---------80:55----------
okay so let me just we're gonna set that


---------80:59----------
up we're gonna take like a why don't we


---------81:01----------
take a two or three minute break


---------81:05----------
[Music]


---------81:16----------

---------82:47----------
[Music]


---------82:56----------
you


---------83:02----------
endure for an hour


---------83:06----------
okay cool


---------83:13----------
essentially oh it coming today messages


---------83:17----------
in this channel


---------83:20----------
I think at the bottom says like I don't


---------83:22----------
have permission to send messages in this


---------83:24----------
channel


---------83:28----------
hey hi I can hear you hi dr. Weil hi dr.


---------83:32----------
kay my question is how do you know if


---------83:35----------
you're in a good space mentally to make


---------83:37----------
use of psychedelics to hear from trauma


---------83:39----------
and maybe even understand yourself


---------83:41----------
better


---------83:43----------
it's there one more time sorry I I was a


---------83:46----------
little thrown off by I thought it was I


---------83:49----------
was gonna see something good


---------83:50----------
oh no problem my question is how do you


---------83:54----------
know if you're in a good space mentally


---------83:56----------
to make use of psychedelics to you from


---------83:58----------
trauma and understand yourself better


---------84:03----------
you know I would say it's


---------84:08----------
um it's a great big question first of


---------84:12----------
all and second I would say in terms of a


---------84:16----------
good space I would say oh can I


---------84:20----------
am I in a really bad or dangerous and


---------84:24----------
then if you're if that's no meaning if


---------84:26----------
you're suicidal for instance never


---------84:31----------
or if you're in a really big cry and you


---------84:35----------
have no one to really reach out to not a


---------84:37----------
time to take psychedelics no otherwise I


---------84:40----------
would actually say you know hey can I


---------84:43----------
make changes again I have people in my


---------84:46----------
life that I trust that I can talk to


---------84:48----------
about my experience and it could even be


---------84:50----------
with me during it it would be more like


---------84:53----------
can I met what can I maximize an


---------84:56----------
experience that is out to be good you


---------84:59----------
know cuz I you know every time I go into


---------85:01----------
one have a pretty good amount of anxiety


---------85:05----------
and fear you know but I don't


---------85:07----------
necessarily think that that's an


---------85:08----------
unhealthy thing but to basically be able


---------85:11----------
to go into something and say I respect


---------85:13----------
it enough because difficult can come up


---------85:18----------
is a good thing to have healthy fear you


---------85:21----------
know so does that help her


---------85:24----------
yeah that helps so if I understood you


---------85:28----------
correctly it's to have a good sense of


---------85:31----------
where you are and in life in terms of


---------85:34----------
like if you're not an any extreme and to


---------85:37----------
go in with the healthy amount of maybe


---------85:41----------
even fear is that oh yeah so I mean I


---------85:46----------
also heard him kind of say like having


---------85:47----------
the right support structure right so


---------85:50----------
like I'm envisioning our 24 year old


---------85:53----------
who's sitting at home and playing games


---------85:54----------
all day like I don't know that that


---------85:56----------
person has the right support structure


---------85:59----------
to help him make that experience like


---------86:01----------
productive right cool thanks for your


---------86:09----------
question


---------86:10----------
thank you or is he just like ready for


---------86:15----------
round two


---------86:16----------
it can people see me or noses voices


---------86:19----------
voice only okay oh sorry hey hey I'm


---------86:26----------
sorry I was hearing the stream hello


---------86:28----------
thanks so much for the whole the whole


---------86:30----------
show it was amazing my question is


---------86:32----------
basically this I'll do a comparison to


---------86:35----------
make it like better to make it feel more


---------86:37----------
like understandable but it's basically


---------86:39----------
like this there's healthy choices we can


---------86:41----------
make in the setting of therapy or


---------86:44----------
something in in the pursue of getting


---------86:46----------
better like like healthy dieting like


---------86:48----------
maybe exercise and how would the use of


---------86:51----------
psychedelics fit here and what I mean by


---------86:53----------
that is basically if you if you do


---------86:55----------
exercise maybe you have a better like


---------86:58----------
cardio respiratory situation maybe you


---------87:00----------
you can have or and then in case of diet


---------87:04----------
you can improve your diet and maybe you


---------87:06----------
can feel better because of the diet and


---------87:07----------
how would psychedelics do maybe how they


---------87:09----------
change in the brain or how would they


---------87:11----------
change basically your your either your


---------87:13----------
consciousness or how you see it it's


---------87:15----------
basically that thanks


---------87:19----------
yeah and so yeah I think of psychedelics


---------87:23----------
as one of the tools


---------87:28----------
Deeley in a whole box that we have with


---------87:32----------
many different tools of different


---------87:34----------
varieties that we can use at different


---------87:36----------
times of our life


---------87:40----------
Plus through those ups and downs you


---------87:42----------
know cuz I've done a tremendous amount


---------87:43----------
of healing in the last seven or eight


---------87:44----------
years I still have time from time to


---------87:46----------
time that I struggle you know it's much


---------87:48----------
less than it has been before in my life


---------87:50----------
but it's some still come up and so I


---------87:55----------
think and just think of them as one of


---------87:58----------
the tools in your toolbox I think is the


---------88:00----------
way to do it and and and you know I


---------88:02----------
think just having a variety of things to


---------88:04----------
go to is the ideal place and never bling


---------88:08----------
that one thing is gonna be the answer to


---------88:11----------
all of my problems because there's a lot


---------88:13----------
of people that are like psychedelics


---------88:14----------
like a percent everyone should do them


---------88:17----------
and I actually don't believe that you


---------88:18----------
know I think that some people could


---------88:20----------
could find the air healing tool could be


---------88:23----------
meditation or could be else that that's


---------88:26----------
not so good


---------88:29----------
you


---------88:32----------
I don't mean to be like like super like


---------88:34----------
oh my god but I just wanted to ask


---------88:36----------
i I can't understand that is it is it


---------88:38----------
true and I agree with that I just my


---------88:40----------
question was more of like how did two


---------88:42----------
works or how so well I think he's asking


---------88:45----------
what's the mechanism right so like


---------88:48----------
running improves our cardiovascular


---------88:50----------
health effects are like insulin glucagon


---------88:53----------
balance increases are based on a bottle


---------88:56----------
of great what's your understanding of


---------88:58----------
the mechanism through which psychedelics


---------89:00----------
affect change okay so I would say that


---------89:05----------
unlike what you'll read out there is I


---------89:08----------
don't think it is the neurotransmitters


---------89:10----------
it is not is not serotonin and fixing


---------89:15----------
serotonin levels I really love to think


---------89:18----------
of this as the catharsis a stored up


---------89:22----------
motional trauma because you know I kind


---------89:25----------
of think about like life is a movie room


---------89:28----------
at any one point in our life we are


---------89:31----------
accumulation of every single moment


---------89:33----------
that's ever happened to us


---------89:34----------
pink of like if there's slides in that


---------89:37----------
movie reel that have not been fully


---------89:40----------
expressed emotionally slides have more


---------89:44----------
of an impact on our everyday life as we


---------89:47----------
go back and we can heal these right I've


---------89:49----------
never said that this your this is gonna


---------89:51----------
make you forget something that's


---------89:52----------
happened or make it go the impact of


---------89:54----------
that past thing on your current life


---------89:58----------
will be much less and so I think of it


---------90:00----------
you know as also this is a new paradigm


---------90:02----------
of thinking it's molecules in cells it's


---------90:05----------
actually a psychological way of healing


---------90:08----------
and catharsis okay thanks so much man


---------90:11----------
now I understand thank you that was


---------90:13----------
great


---------90:13----------
you're welcome great questions awesome


---------90:17----------
man thank you there is some misc we're


---------90:20----------
ready for the next


---------90:22----------
[Music]


---------90:30----------
you do


---------90:34----------
can you guys hear me yes well I actually


---------90:40----------
have a question about panic disorders


---------90:43----------
and anxiety is there a way to do


---------90:47----------
psychedelics safely if you have like


---------90:49----------
panic disorders or are prone to be fee


---------90:54----------
be afraid basically


---------90:57----------
um would say well I'll share that I


---------91:02----------
suffered from panic disorders from my


---------91:05----------
flying phobia so I never had a panic


---------91:09----------
disorder hanok attack until the middle


---------91:12----------
of my flying phobia and they continued


---------91:14----------
for some time


---------91:16----------
after I started my healing work and


---------91:19----------
they're gone now I haven't had a panic


---------91:21----------
attack in


---------91:23----------
years


---------91:25----------
so I will say you know as long as better


---------91:28----------
everything is medically safe and it's


---------91:30----------
like a true panic attack it's not it's


---------91:32----------
not some other you know cardiac disorder


---------91:33----------
um they yeah because you know a panic


---------91:37----------
attack is I kind of think about as an


---------91:39----------
elevated level of fear right something


---------91:42----------
in the past has in care therefore that


---------91:44----------
part is playing a bigger game you know a


---------91:46----------
part in our everyday life so something


---------91:49----------
is legitimately fearful today if I


---------91:53----------
almost get run over


---------91:56----------
amplified because of this past thing and


---------91:59----------
so then it puts the body into fighting a


---------92:02----------
panic attack


---------92:02----------
oh you know I just think that normally


---------92:05----------
when we have these we're not in a


---------92:07----------
position to really be held or we're not


---------92:09----------
being held emotionally or that we don't


---------92:13----------
have an understanding of this and say


---------92:15----------
the original trauma and so I actually


---------92:17----------
think psychedelics can


---------92:19----------
broad statement numbness recommending


---------92:21----------
this for you you know MDMA you know for


---------92:24----------
people with PTSD so the main clinical


---------92:28----------
studies right now for MDMA or Molly or


---------92:31----------
ecstasy is with other people more on in


---------92:34----------
the non-medical world has been used for


---------92:37----------
PTSD and and so many of the patients in


---------92:41----------
the studies have had panic attacks and


---------92:43----------
have had them healed from from you know


---------92:46----------
ambien and I want to also emphasize


---------92:47----------
something that I didn't say clearly is


---------92:50----------
that you know III think about


---------92:54----------
psychedelic assisted psychotherapy I


---------92:57----------
don't think of it as psychedelic therapy


---------92:59----------
meaning psychedelics are you know one


---------93:03----------
part of a comprehensive long-term


---------93:07----------
therapy relationship so in the maps MDMA


---------93:12----------
trial for instance you take you're doing


---------93:16----------
therapy every week for four three times


---------93:19----------
over the course about four months you


---------93:20----------
take MDMA but but really the foundation


---------93:23----------
of the healing is is this extended


---------93:26----------
psychotherapy


---------93:30----------
right so um yeah that's great actually


---------93:35----------
so will what I'm hearing you say is is


---------93:38----------
that like so the short answer is if you


---------93:40----------
have an anxiety or panic disorder your


---------93:42----------
personal experience right so you're not


---------93:44----------
making a medical you're not medically


---------93:46----------
advising people but you're sharing a


---------93:48----------
personal experience that you had a


---------93:50----------
phobia and you used it and you found it


---------93:53----------
was helpful and secondly that it can be


---------93:56----------
done but the the cornerstone of


---------93:58----------
psychedelic assisted therapy is the


---------94:00----------
ideas that the psychedelic does not do


---------94:02----------
the therapy in and of itself you just


---------94:05----------
don't get high and/or heal that there's


---------94:07----------
like a process I mean what I'm hearing


---------94:09----------
you say kind of time and again is that


---------94:10----------
like this crack kind of expands your


---------94:12----------
consciousness allows you to experience


---------94:14----------
things in a different way in order to


---------94:17----------
really facilitate that healing you have


---------94:19----------
to translate those experiences in a way


---------94:22----------
that like affects your daily life and


---------94:24----------
that's usually done through the right


---------94:26----------
kind of support network and it can be


---------94:28----------
medical but it also is not exclusive to


---------94:31----------
medical people like you've seen


---------94:33----------
experiences of psychedelic assisted


---------94:35----------
healing with people like shamans or


---------94:38----------
other friends or people that you can


---------94:40----------
trust is that a good way to put it so I


---------94:45----------
don't know if we have one thing I didn't


---------94:48----------
talk about and but maybe I'll mention


---------94:53----------
actually an equation to come I think


---------94:56----------
that equation is the emotional memory


---------95:04----------
selection you're cutting out a little


---------95:06----------
bit but yeah I'm not sure what to do


---------95:10----------
about that but it's weird cuz I think it


---------95:11----------
was better on the video call I'm not


---------95:13----------
sure why this is can you try saying that


---------95:15----------
again


---------95:16----------
maybe we'll just wait - next okay why


---------95:19----------
don't we why don't we take one more


---------95:20----------
question maybe we can hop back on a


---------95:22----------
video call and you can share that


---------95:23----------
equation with us and then we'll end does


---------95:25----------
that sound okay okay we'll take one more


---------95:29----------
question thanks Jordan good questions


---------95:34----------
ready for the next one I think and they


---------95:36----------
were good oh great okay perfect okay all


---------95:39----------
right we'll I'm gonna call you again on


---------95:41----------
discord okay okay so you should get a


---------95:46----------
call right now and then you can tell us


---------95:48----------
your


---------95:52----------
like


---------95:54----------
before explaining it to him Oh God can


---------95:58----------
he join


---------96:01----------
well I abandoned him in ER oh you made


---------96:06----------
it


---------96:06----------
awesome will can you hear me


---------96:10----------
there we go okay can you turn on your


---------96:14----------
camera perfect tell us there's a beat


---------96:15----------
like I feel like this is important so


---------96:17----------
tell us this equation thank you not this


---------96:21----------
is actually it's whatever I judge me I


---------96:24----------
won't just fight like well I didn't read


---------96:27----------
many of the messages on Twitch but just


---------96:29----------
based on the questions and the


---------96:30----------
engagement I think this group of people


---------96:34----------
really gets it so I really yeah been fun


---------96:38----------
to do this so yeah I'm happy to actually


---------96:41----------
go into this and so you know I think


---------96:44----------
this catharsis thing is again this


---------96:47----------
really came from from my experience of


---------96:50----------
my own healing and so I think of three


---------96:53----------
things that are necessary for emotional


---------96:56----------
catharsis or release is that if we have


---------97:00----------
the emotional memory of something that


---------97:02----------
happened come with the narrative memory


---------97:07----------
meaning the the body experience of the


---------97:11----------
emotion plus the memory of you know


---------97:14----------
something that happened early in life


---------97:16----------
that that fits that situation plus the


---------97:20----------
third critical thing is is an empathic


---------97:26----------
setting and for me empathic is very


---------97:31----------
different from sympathy right you know


---------97:34----------
sympathy is like me telling a story


---------97:36----------
about kind of getting bullied and


---------97:38----------
someone's like that must suck like that


---------97:41----------
you got bullied I'm sorry but just okay


---------97:44----------
like some random person on the street


---------97:45----------
right where I think of empathy is when


---------97:49----------
something hit like when we have an


---------97:52----------
interaction with someone where we feel


---------97:56----------
that that person understands our


---------97:58----------
experience he understands our experience


---------98:02----------
and often that's not even verbal so it


---------98:05----------
does it's like the word sometimes can't


---------98:07----------
even distract but we're just like this


---------98:09----------
person gets me like like they know how


---------98:12----------
hard this


---------98:13----------
and when those three things happen I


---------98:15----------
think that's when tears come when when


---------98:18----------
the body can shake when the fear leaves


---------98:20----------
the body and you know just in case it


---------98:24----------
isn't clearly connected that usually


---------98:26----------
help is [ __ ] up to begin with because


---------98:29----------
the people who are supposed to be


---------98:31----------
empathic to us parents brothers and


---------98:34----------
sisters friends weren't so then that


---------98:37----------
release didn't happen it's stored in the


---------98:40----------
body and that's where the set the


---------98:42----------
setting thing is important in the set


---------98:44----------
setting in dose because if we can


---------98:46----------
recreate an environment where we are


---------98:48----------
with psychedelics helping emotional


---------98:52----------
memory and narrative memory come


---------98:54----------
together and then we have a setting


---------98:56----------
which is M Pathak that's why we get


---------98:57----------
these huge catharsis and people are like


---------99:00----------
you know this thing I was walking around


---------99:03----------
with for 20 years is now gone


---------99:05----------
and so I actually think it's a very


---------99:06----------
simple equation and it's why I'm so


---------99:09----------
passionate about education because you


---------99:13----------
know I actually think most of the people


---------99:14----------
that are psychedelic therapists and who


---------99:16----------
call themselves a psychedelic therapist


---------99:18----------
out there don't understand what I just


---------99:19----------
said and I think it's really simple and


---------99:23----------
I think you know in the heart the hard


---------99:25----------
part is that culture is not empathic


---------99:28----------
right now right we don't live in a


---------99:29----------
society that's in topic and so if we can


---------99:32----------
actually heal society and just become


---------99:34----------
more empathic people we get rid of the


---------99:36----------
the need even for psychedelics right


---------99:38----------
because I think ultimately it's it's


---------99:41----------
this screwed-up culture that we've been


---------99:42----------
living in that caused all of these


---------99:45----------
discrepancies to begin with inability to


---------99:47----------
to express emotion well well so first of


---------99:51----------
all dude I'm with you 100% let me just


---------99:54----------
make sure I understand so it's sort of


---------99:56----------
like having kind of a mental sort of


---------100:00----------
experience of emotion the the bodily


---------100:02----------
experience of emotion and then having


---------100:04----------
empathy which I think you're right the


---------100:07----------
people here get it because I think so


---------100:09----------
the funny thing is that our tag for


---------100:12----------
healthy gamer like our tagline is AoE


---------100:14----------
healing and AoE means area-of-effect


---------100:17----------
and so there's this idea in videogames


---------100:21----------
can you hear me I lost you use an area


---------100:25----------
of effect


---------100:26----------
healing ah so there's this idea in video


---------100:29----------
games that when a character takes damage


---------100:31----------
like there are some characters that are


---------100:32----------
healers and some characters that take


---------100:34----------
damage and so what you do is you target


---------100:36----------
a particular character and then you cast


---------100:38----------
like a healing spell and then you heal


---------100:40----------
that person if they're like being


---------100:42----------
attacked by a monster and they're there


---------100:44----------
are some things there are some spells


---------100:46----------
that are area-of-effect so anyone within


---------100:48----------
a particular radius gets the benefit of


---------100:50----------
the healing spell and the interesting


---------100:53----------
thing about us is that like we're about


---------100:55----------
a Oh a healing because I think the


---------100:56----------
reason people find this helpful is


---------100:58----------
because they feel empathy for the people


---------101:00----------
that come on stream so when when I am


---------101:03----------
talking with an individual somehow


---------101:05----------
people feel they resonate with what they


---------101:09----------
see they resonate with like the


---------101:11----------
experiences of another human being and


---------101:13----------
they themselves I was really skeptical


---------101:15----------
about this and some people post about


---------101:17----------
this kind of stuff on Reddit and the


---------101:18----------
internet and they kind of say that oh


---------101:19----------
like the stream is like really changing


---------101:21----------
me and it's helping me and I'm confused


---------101:23----------
because I've never really thought that


---------101:25----------
you know I just find it hard to believe


---------101:27----------
that you can watch something on the


---------101:29----------
internet and be changed and the really


---------101:33----------
fascinating thing is if you like tunnel


---------101:34----------
down into it I think they're feeling


---------101:36----------
that empathic connection and and so it


---------101:39----------
makes a lot of sense to me and it's a


---------101:42----------
big part of I think what we what we try


---------101:44----------
to do here and what we're some sort of


---------101:46----------
fumbling our way through and the the


---------101:49----------
last thing will I just want to say cuz I


---------101:51----------
know I know you've got to get going and


---------101:52----------
I want to be respectful your good times


---------101:53----------
thank you so much for coming man I think


---------101:56----------
it's been awesome having you I think


---------101:58----------
you're able to really talk about this


---------102:00----------
stuff


---------102:01----------
in a way that very few people can sort


---------102:04----------
of from a scientific expert as well as


---------102:06----------
like personal experience as well as kind


---------102:09----------
of clinical practice about like


---------102:10----------
implementing with with actual people and


---------102:12----------
trying to see change and healing and one


---------102:17----------
of the things that I've come to realize


---------102:18----------
is so many people that I talked to who


---------102:20----------
claim to be analytical and logical or so


---------102:26----------
how can I say this so blunt with their


---------102:30----------
their beliefs about psychedelics right


---------102:32----------
it's not nuanced at all like people


---------102:33----------
haven't tried to tease apart the


---------102:35----------
equation of how healing works people


---------102:37----------
don't really think about the liminal


---------102:38----------
space and


---------102:40----------
and why is dosing important what is


---------102:41----------
dosing do the different spectrums of


---------102:43----------
different psychedelics so like I mean


---------102:45----------
you really blown my mind in terms of the


---------102:48----------
depth of your knowledge and just how


---------102:49----------
complicated this stuff is and it makes


---------102:52----------
sense to me that this is complicated and


---------102:55----------
if we understand this equation then like


---------102:56----------
that's really what brings about


---------102:58----------
transformative healing it's like really


---------103:00----------
understanding like how this whole


---------103:02----------
equation works so thank you so much


---------103:06----------
you're very welcome I do want to say


---------103:10----------
something back to actually both the the


---------103:12----------
things that you sort of said right now I


---------103:15----------
mean yes III totally think that


---------103:19----------
experiences as long as their


---------103:21----------
interpersonal can be empathic and


---------103:24----------
healing and you know I think that III


---------103:28----------
think of our current mental health


---------103:30----------
system was born out of a culture that


---------103:34----------
was already bad at empathizing and so


---------103:39----------
therefore the system that we created


---------103:41----------
within it the system of suppression


---------103:44----------
mimicked the culture and so we're not


---------103:47----------
getting the healing because the people


---------103:49----------
who built the system didn't get it and


---------103:52----------
so I think you know especially you know


---------103:55----------
I learned to trust myself right and I


---------103:57----------
can say I know my body I know my


---------103:59----------
emotions but at some level I always knew


---------104:02----------
that right like and so I would say well


---------104:05----------
listening right now that this resonates


---------104:07----------
with is trust yourself at its deepest


---------104:09----------
deepest level you know just because


---------104:11----------
someone has a medical degree or a PhD if


---------104:14----------
it's really not resonating with you like


---------104:17----------
they could be completely wrong you know


---------104:19----------
and so so really the healing is an


---------104:21----------
ultimate trust of yourself and you know


---------104:25----------
and just just Rhian and the other thing


---------104:27----------
you know I just think about in general


---------104:29----------
whether it's with psychedelics or not is


---------104:30----------
that the healer that you're working with


---------104:32----------
can only take you as far as he or she


---------104:36----------
has done their healing and so you know


---------104:39----------
and there's a lot of what we call


---------104:41----------
wounded healers out there meaning people


---------104:43----------
usually go into the healing fields


---------104:44----------
because they're wounded and many of


---------104:47----------
those have not put in the time and the


---------104:48----------
energy into their own work and so I


---------104:50----------
think yeah you'll find


---------104:53----------
people with or without the degrees and


---------104:55----------
the training that can be healers in your


---------104:57----------
life the last thing I wanted to say at


---------105:01----------
least was like it's interesting this


---------105:03----------
idea of the healer within the video game


---------105:05----------
because it almost makes me think maybe I


---------105:07----------
should react video games if there's a


---------105:09----------
healing avatar maybe I can go in there


---------105:11----------
Eren good enough we're gonna do we're


---------105:14----------
gonna do game extreme well in his 56k


---------105:17----------
connection and he's gonna get crushed


---------105:19----------
because he lags so hard


---------105:21----------
done but will on a very practical note


---------105:24----------
yes so like I think I'm I'm sure


---------105:26----------
everyone would love to see you play


---------105:28----------
video games but you know just in terms


---------105:31----------
of spreading your message if there's any


---------105:32----------
way we can practically support you all


---------105:33----------
I'll shoot you a quick email but in


---------105:35----------
terms of if you want to make videos and


---------105:36----------
things like that you know we figured a


---------105:38----------
little bit about how to do that I'm not


---------105:39----------
saying they're great but you know they


---------105:42----------
seem to have you know there we have a


---------105:45----------
lot of views and stuff on YouTube but in


---------105:47----------
terms of infrastructure and stuff like


---------105:49----------
that we're happy to support you because


---------105:50----------
I think you know will I've always


---------105:52----------
respected you but I think even with our


---------105:54----------
like last conversation that we had sort


---------105:56----------
of about reconnecting I mean it's just


---------105:59----------
so much of what you're saying I want to


---------106:01----------
like really really actively support


---------106:03----------
because it's so fascinating to hear


---------106:05----------
someone come to all of the same


---------106:07----------
conclusions like you'd be surprised like


---------106:08----------
I basically say all I mean I feel like I


---------106:12----------
say a lot of the things that you've said


---------106:13----------
on stream about so when people ask me I


---------106:15----------
talk a lot about alexithymia and and


---------106:18----------
sort of people not recognizing their


---------106:21----------
where their emotions are and like what


---------106:23----------
they're feeling and especially for men


---------106:25----------
like I start with the body first and


---------106:27----------
foremost because men understand emotions


---------106:29----------
very easily like they don't understand a


---------106:31----------
feeling of being rejected ashamed and


---------106:34----------
unlovable but they do feel yeah man she


---------106:37----------
like I asked her out and she kicked me


---------106:38----------
in the nuts like that's what it felt


---------106:40----------
like and even our language as men in


---------106:43----------
terms of expressing emotions is very


---------106:45----------
very physical and then all of the other


---------106:47----------
men that you're talking to know exactly


---------106:48----------
what you're feeling and so your emphasis


---------106:52----------
on sort of the body and and we do like


---------106:54----------
we do more meditation than yoga on


---------106:56----------
stream but sometimes we'll do yoga and


---------106:57----------
stuff like that so I just want to

---------108:21----------
it's interesting I think he has a


---------108:22----------
different impression of when I knew him


---------108:25----------
so I knew will in his final form which


---------108:27----------
is his current form I didn't really know


---------108:29----------
him so he's finished residency I think


---------108:31----------
in 2014 ages which is the year that I


---------108:33----------
started so I'm pretty sure he had


---------108:35----------
relatively long hair and some of those


---------108:37----------
piercings maybe not quite that many


---------108:40----------
piercings when I met him


---------108:42----------
so we'll kind of see ya so thank you


---------108:48----------
guys very much for coming you know there


---------108:50----------
are a lot of other guests that we can


---------108:51----------
think about having on in terms of


---------108:53----------
offering their expertise on mental


---------108:55----------
health and and stuff like that


---------108:57----------
and yeah so let's just think about a


---------109:01----------
couple of fascinating things that we can


---------109:03----------
do right like so oh my god so I'm


---------109:07----------
learning more about psychedelics and I


---------109:08----------
think it would be cool I would love to


---------109:10----------
see a clinical trial where people take


---------109:12----------
gamers and then give them psychedelic


---------109:15----------
assisted treatment and just see what


---------109:16----------
happens like in terms of their ability


---------109:18----------
to re-engage in life like that


---------109:20----------
very cool interview I mean uh sorry a


---------109:23----------
very cool trial because I think a big


---------109:27----------
part of you know what I believe is that


---------109:29----------
like you know at NASA Sarah is not gonna


---------109:31----------
fix your problem like an antidepressant


---------109:32----------
or anti-anxiety medication is not gonna


---------109:35----------
fix your problem it'll help if you have


---------109:37----------
depression or anxiety but you really


---------109:39----------
have to do this like like formative


---------109:42----------
grounding kind of work right you have to


---------109:44----------
like get through this stuff and talk


---------109:46----------
about your some scars talk about your


---------109:48----------
past Rama's come to terms with them


---------109:50----------
learn how to grieve learn how to face


---------109:52----------
shame this is a big part of Dharma and I


---------109:55----------
know we get a lot of questions about how


---------109:56----------
do I find my daughter about how do I


---------109:57----------
find my Dharma and I think the


---------109:59----------
fascinating thing from will is that like


---------110:00----------
you guys already know your Dharma like


---------110:02----------
you've taught yourself you've come to


---------110:06----------
believe because you have taught yourself


---------110:07----------
that you don't know what your daughter


---------110:08----------
Maya is because you the narrative is


---------110:12----------
that you were directionless and and if


---------110:16----------
we really think about it what will was


---------110:17----------
saying I think is really spot-on that


---------110:18----------
like what we can actually do is like


---------110:20----------
stop and think about you know when you


---------110:24----------
have a particular emotion or when you


---------110:26----------
try to do something and you feel


---------110:27----------
something like when you try to leave the


---------110:29----------
house and you feel ashamed about


---------110:31----------
yourself


---------110:32----------
what is that shame like where does that


---------110:35----------
chain come from like what why do you


---------110:37----------
want to leave the house like explore


---------110:38----------
those things and in that I think you


---------110:40----------
will find your daughter Bob yeah I also


---------110:47----------
really liked his point about like good


---------110:49----------
emotions and bad emotions right like


---------110:51----------
it's not shame has become something that


---------110:53----------
we avoid but like whether it makes it


---------110:55----------
good or bad and this is also a big point


---------110:57----------
behind Dharma is that like those


---------110:59----------
emotions are there right fear is there


---------111:02----------
it's just about whether you face it and


---------111:04----------
whether it it pushes you in the right


---------111:06----------
direction or the wrong direction so you


---------111:11----------
know I think it's like so much soft land


---------111:13----------
and it's fascinating to me personally to


---------111:15----------
hear that Will has come to so many of


---------111:17----------
the conclusions that like I felt like I


---------111:19----------
came to myself one is that I never


---------111:22----------
really thought of myself as a wounded


---------111:23----------
healer right but like if we think about


---------111:25----------
it like that actually makes a lot of


---------111:26----------
sense because for you know like a decade


---------111:28----------
of my life or more I was a [ __ ] just


---------111:32----------
socked at life like


---------111:33----------
game was a game that I was not winning


---------111:35----------
and and I think that like we


---------111:38----------
underestimate the value and this is we


---------111:41----------
underestimate the value of what that can


---------111:43----------
lead to and just the idea that like I'm


---------111:46----------
almost beginning to think that when we


---------111:48----------
think about a successful person and a


---------111:50----------
person who struggles we place more value


---------111:53----------
on the successful person the person


---------111:54----------
who's had always had a 4.0 GPA Lincoln


---------111:57----------
High School College med school whatever


---------111:59----------
right and we say that that life is


---------112:02----------
better than my life because I'm failing


---------112:05----------
but hearing will it's been fascinating


---------112:08----------
to think that because I've kind of


---------112:10----------
always thought this about myself that


---------112:11----------
the reason that I can help people is


---------112:13----------
because I've gone through it and and


---------112:15----------
I've never really realized until today


---------112:17----------
that like actually the best people to be


---------112:20----------
potentially psychiatrists or medical


---------112:22----------
doctors or whatever right are the people


---------112:24----------
who have struggled and that they have an


---------112:26----------
advantage over the people who are always


---------112:28----------
perfect and when I see you guys


---------112:31----------
struggling like it's so hard for me to


---------112:34----------
try to convey this I'd love to


---------112:35----------
transplant this thought from my mind to


---------112:37----------
your mind but you see your your struggle


---------112:40----------
as a failure and I see it as like part


---------112:42----------
of making you who you're supposed to be


---------112:44----------
and in it just has to happen that way


---------112:48----------
that's what gutter my is all about this


---------112:49----------
is your life and this is what's been


---------112:51----------
given to you and you're gonna live


---------112:53----------
through it and you're gonna be stronger


---------112:55----------
because of it like you can't be the


---------112:56----------
person that life needs you to be the


---------112:59----------
person that you are and it's hard to


---------113:02----------
describe but like you know when you


---------113:03----------
struggle with all the shame if let's say


---------113:05----------
you have emotionally neglectful parents


---------113:07----------
or tiger' parents or whatever like you


---------113:09----------
have to understand that like unless you


---------113:11----------
had those experiences you're not able to


---------113:14----------
be the parent that your child your


---------113:16----------
future child who has yet who is yet to


---------113:19----------
be born and you have to have sex in


---------113:20----------
order to do that at some point but you


---------113:22----------
know cross that bridge when we come to


---------113:23----------
it


---------113:24----------
but understand that like your


---------113:25----------
experiences turn you into the person


---------113:27----------
that the world needs you to be turns you


---------113:30----------
into the people that your child needs


---------113:32----------
you to be


---------113:34----------
and and whether it's like a friend or


---------113:36----------
your child or you know a random person


---------113:39----------
on the internet who your Steam friends


---------113:40----------
with and the one reason they don't kill


---------113:42----------
themselves today is because when they


---------113:44----------
like message you you respond when no one


---------113:46----------
else in their life responds like just


---------113:49----------
recognize that right it's not about your


---------113:51----------
GPA it's not about your income it's not


---------113:52----------
about any of that [ __ ] it's about the


---------113:55----------
person that you are and your true self


---------113:56----------
which no one can take you away from and


---------113:59----------
it was so fascinating to hear like we'll


---------114:01----------
say like oh it's so awesome that you're


---------114:03----------
vulnerable and he's like vulnerable to


---------114:05----------
what like what does that even like


---------114:07----------
he abandons that entire premise of


---------114:09----------
weakness because it's true it's false in


---------114:12----------
and I try to abandon that premise to you


---------114:15----------
guys like look at me and you say I'm


---------114:17----------
different from you but my whole point is


---------114:19----------
that I'm not right like there's no


---------114:21----------
difference between me and you like it's


---------114:24----------
it's abandoning the premise that I am


---------114:26----------
successful then you were a failure like


---------114:27----------
I don't think you guys get it like I'm


---------114:29----------
still the failure that I used to be like


---------114:30----------
and nothing has changed and and you're


---------114:33----------
that failure is kind of born out of like


---------114:36----------
the fertilizer success is born out of


---------114:39----------
and fertilizer or failure and you guys


---------114:41----------
are just earlier along I'm 37 and for


---------114:44----------
those of you feel old like we have to be


---------114:46----------
careful about comparison but you know


---------114:48----------
people say like oh I'm 21 and I'm not


---------114:49----------
going anywhere in life it's like yeah


---------114:51----------
and like that's that's fine that's okay


---------114:53----------
that's just part of your journey and


---------114:54----------
you'll get there you'll get there just


---------114:57----------
keep trying and listen to what we'll


---------114:59----------
said and listen to that inner voice and


---------115:02----------
when you feel shame recognize that it


---------115:06----------
belongs there that you have every right


---------115:08----------
to be ashamed and like will says you


---------115:10----------
have a choice between whether you make


---------115:12----------
that shame healthy or unhealthy shame


---------115:14----------
isn't bad right shame is what tells you


---------115:17----------
like oh if I if I was supposed to stream


---------115:19----------
today and I like overslept and was like


---------115:22----------
45 minutes late and then you guys only


---------115:24----------
got an hour and 15 minutes because we'll


---------115:26----------
as a patient right now a client like I


---------115:28----------
should feel shame absolutely and I


---------115:32----------
should use that shame to correct my


---------115:33----------
behavior and I used to be late to crap


---------115:36----------
and I know everyone jokes about me being


---------115:38----------
like three minutes late or five minutes


---------115:39----------
late or whatever but like that


---------115:41----------
punctuality came out of shame of being


---------115:43----------
like not respecting people's time


---------115:47----------
and so make it into healthy shame if you


---------115:51----------
feel a certain way like recognize you


---------115:52----------
feel that way for a reason recognize


---------115:55----------
that that's your internal compass like


---------115:57----------
telling you that something needs to


---------115:59----------
change and then listen to it and then


---------116:01----------
make the smallest possible change that


---------116:03----------
you can don't get confused about like


---------116:05----------
turning it into a grand transformation


---------116:09----------
that you're gonna fix yourself today


---------116:11----------
because will says that too he says it's


---------116:13----------
not like you take LSD and you're healed


---------116:15----------
he's like people work over the course of


---------116:17----------
one month or four months or three months


---------116:20----------
or whatever and they use psychedelics


---------116:22----------
like three times and every week they're


---------116:25----------
in therapy it's a gradual process and so


---------116:29----------
make one tiny step today like I don't


---------116:31----------
know what time it is where you guys are


---------116:33----------
but like do something for yourself today


---------116:34----------
like in the tiniest little thing so


---------116:38----------
someone says whom in Panda says what if


---------116:41----------
I have a shitty compass that that is


---------116:42----------
that exact exactly what will is saying


---------116:44----------
that is a false narrative that you


---------116:46----------
should construct for yourself you don't


---------116:47----------
have a shitty compass you have a good


---------116:50----------
compass you just think it's shape pay


---------116:53----------
attention to it and you'll realize like


---------116:55----------
oh it's like it's not that like it it


---------116:58----------
points it it always points the direction


---------117:00----------
that it's supposed to go it's just you


---------117:03----------
just don't realize that it's always


---------117:04----------
pointing East instead of pointing north


---------117:06----------
the compass works fine it's just not


---------117:08----------
doing exactly what you think it's doing


---------117:10----------
you can navigate just as well with a


---------117:12----------
compass that always points east but if


---------117:15----------
you think that a compass should always


---------117:16----------
point north and you don't recognize your


---------117:18----------
compass for what it is then you're gonna


---------117:20----------
have a lot of problems but all you need


---------117:23----------
to do is calibrate and recognize how my


---------117:25----------
compass always points east so if I


---------117:26----------
wanted to go north I can still go north


---------117:28----------
if I want to go east I can go east if I


---------117:29----------
want to go south or west it works just


---------117:31----------
as well it's just different


---------117:34----------
right so you so start start with the


---------117:39----------
idea that you're not [ __ ] up just like


---------117:41----------
entertain that notion for a moment Oh


---------117:43----------
like what if I actually know what I do


---------117:46----------
want to do what if I know exactly what I


---------117:48----------
want to do but because of society's


---------117:51----------
values right like so exactly I forget


---------117:54----------
exactly what we'll call them like true


---------117:56----------
values and like inherited values or


---------117:58----------
something like that instead of


---------118:01----------
like believing that you know what you


---------118:03----------
want you just what you want is different


---------118:05----------
from what you're inherited values are


---------118:07----------
it's different from what your parents


---------118:08----------
want you to be it's different from what


---------118:10----------
everyone at school was so impressed with


---------118:12----------
some people and you were not that thing


---------118:14----------
and so you decided Oh like I don't know


---------118:18----------
what I want because I don't want that no


---------118:20----------
you know what you want and like this


---------118:23----------
like this person who says I'm one of my


---------118:25----------
compasses busted no this is exactly what


---------118:27----------
was saying there's the part over here


---------118:29----------
where you believe that your compass is


---------118:30----------
busted and it hurts and then over here


---------118:33----------
your compass is right and you're killing


---------118:35----------
it and then in the middle is the idea


---------118:37----------
that oh my compass is actually


---------118:39----------
completely normal but I'm [ __ ] it up


---------118:41----------
anyway do you guys see that because if


---------118:44----------
you believe that your compass is busted


---------118:46----------
you've got an excuse you can retreat


---------118:49----------
from the pain its lidocaine


---------118:52----------
oh my compass is busted it's not my


---------118:56----------
fault it's so much harder to admit to


---------119:00----------
yourself that I know exactly what I want


---------119:02----------
and I'm just too weak to get it I


---------119:05----------
haven't been able to do it yet that's


---------119:07----------
exactly where you need to go is to say I


---------119:10----------
know what I want I've always known what


---------119:12----------
I want but I haven't been able to


---------119:13----------
accomplish it and also that weakness is


---------119:17----------
not like oh I'm weak don't use that as


---------119:19----------
an excuse to like get over here we're


---------119:21----------
like you're not capable of doing


---------119:23----------
anything understand that weakness is


---------119:26----------
something that you can own and that you


---------119:27----------
can change it's not an attribute on your


---------119:30----------
character sheet it's like an action that


---------119:32----------
you can take right if I roll a d20 and I


---------119:36----------
hit or I miss it's not like I'm a hit or


---------119:38----------
a miss er that's just on that roll it's


---------119:41----------
not an attribute on your character sheet


---------119:42----------
it's just a particular result of a


---------119:45----------
particular moment in time weakness is


---------119:48----------
not something that you are it's


---------119:49----------
something that you are in a moment it's


---------119:52----------
an outcome it's not an attribute so


---------119:57----------
don't have the courage to think for a


---------120:01----------
moment that your compass is not busted


---------120:03----------
have the courage to think for a moment


---------120:06----------
that you're not broken and you're


---------120:10----------
playing you oh but like I don't want to


---------120:11----------
be broken no you what you want to be is


---------120:14----------
like


---------120:14----------
broken and successful what you can't


---------120:17----------
tolerate it's beautiful


---------120:18----------
what you can't tolerate is that middle


---------120:20----------
state so if I am not broken and I'm a


---------120:23----------
failure I have no excuse because that's


---------120:26----------
where you like you have to understand


---------120:28----------
you can't make a change in your life


---------120:29----------
unless you fundamentally believe that


---------120:31----------
you have agency to make change and if


---------120:33----------
you have agency to make change that


---------120:34----------
makes you responsible if you're


---------120:37----------
responsible you can't hide behind


---------120:38----------
anything the problem is that you're


---------120:41----------
[ __ ] hiding you're hiding from your


---------120:43----------
power you don't want your power because


---------120:47----------
if you have power then it's your fault


---------120:49----------
yeah so like take your power admit it's


---------120:52----------
your fault and then do better


---------121:01----------
forgive yourself along the way that goes


---------121:03----------
a long way right okay


---------121:06----------
so thank you guys for coming I don't I


---------121:11----------
guess I should meditate I don't really


---------121:13----------
feel like meditating I'm riled up but


---------121:15----------
maybe I should anyway


---------121:22----------
okay so let's let's make a choice right


---------121:25----------
now let's choose to not give in to our


---------121:29----------
feelings of being riled up and not going


---------121:31----------
to meditate and let's exercise our


---------121:34----------
agency and do it anyway even if we don't


---------121:36----------
feel like it no no we're not going to


---------121:39----------
give in to that right that's exactly


---------121:40----------
what we want to do so our meditation


---------121:42----------
today is going to be different though I


---------121:45----------
want you to don't close your eyes I want


---------121:48----------
you to in this state think about where


---------121:52----------
the where your agency lies think about


---------121:54----------
what you're capable of think about the


---------121:56----------
thing that you are not doing that you


---------121:59----------
are capable of that you can absolutely


---------122:01----------
do


---------122:03----------
just take a moment and do it with your


---------122:04----------
eyes open


---------122:06----------
take a moment to think what is it that


---------122:10----------
I'm actually what is it that I like


---------122:11----------
avoid responsibility for that I actually


---------122:14----------
completely am responsible for it and I


---------122:17----------
want you guys if you guys have you can


---------122:18----------
open up notepad or grab a pen and a


---------122:21----------
paper and I want you to like physically


---------122:23----------
write it down


---------122:35----------
okay so I wrote something down now I


---------122:40----------
want you to close your eyes sit up


---------122:44----------
straight


---------122:49----------
and try to see that thing try to see


---------122:53----------
your agency


---------122:55----------
try to see your capability


---------122:59----------
and then try to see your judgment


---------123:04----------
that you blame yourself for not doing


---------123:06----------
that thing


---------123:11----------
you


---------123:16----------
and try to see your resistance is you


---------123:20----------
intend to do something what gets in the


---------123:22----------
way


---------123:28----------
you


---------123:36----------
and now notice how hard it is


---------123:40----------
notice that when you close your eyes and


---------123:42----------
breathe in and out


---------123:50----------
again and out


---------123:59----------
and then


---------124:01----------
and out one more time


---------124:09----------
notice how ethereal the judgment and the


---------124:13----------
resistance are in this moment maybe even


---------124:17----------
the goal is ethereal


---------124:22----------
if it feels real to you if it feels


---------124:24----------
heavy if it feels present then sit with


---------124:27----------
fat and give it the respect that it


---------124:31----------
deserves


---------124:33----------
give your weakness your fear your shame


---------124:38----------
the respect that it deserves that these


---------124:41----------
are powerful things within you


---------124:47----------
but I find myself and not feeling those


---------124:48----------
things


---------124:51----------
myself feeling that my resistance in


---------124:53----------
judgment


---------124:54----------
he's like a shadow on a wall and


---------124:59----------
projected to be much larger than it


---------125:01----------
actually is like a tiny figurine with a


---------125:08----------
light shining on it casting a gigantic


---------125:10----------
shadow


---------125:13----------
that when we stop and we look at the


---------125:15----------
things that hold us back they're far


---------125:19----------
smaller than they appear or as you look


---------125:24----------
you recognize that it is gigantic either


---------125:27----------
one is fine


---------125:32----------
you


---------125:35----------
you


---------125:37----------
and now prepare yourself to move forward


---------125:45----------
if your fears and shames and the things


---------125:48----------
that hold you back or in reality farce


---------125:51----------
pother laughs because it's [ __ ]


---------125:55----------
hilarious


---------125:55----------
you've been be you're held back by that


---------125:58----------
big [ __ ] hilarious look at how much


---------126:06----------
of a noob you are being held back by a


---------126:09----------
figment of your imagination and then


---------126:15----------
prepare yourself to take action and if


---------126:21----------
you're held by it backed by something


---------126:23----------
that is gigantic gargantuan massive if


---------126:30----------
the shame or trauma or fear is very real


---------126:34----------
and very powerful then respect it and in


---------126:39----------
that respect find forgiveness for


---------126:41----------
yourself because if it is a ray boss


---------126:45----------
you're gonna wipe respect that the


---------126:52----------
challenges and struggles that you face


---------126:53----------
are real and banya mentis and it


---------127:00----------
that make you weak to not be able to


---------127:01----------
climb Mount Everest it's just hard to


---------127:03----------
climb Mount Everest so find some


---------127:07----------
forgiveness for yourself


---------127:09----------
because not everyone climbing Everest


---------127:12----------
isn't easy doesn't mean that you're


---------127:15----------
going to give up it just means that you


---------127:18----------
need to be prepared


---------127:19----------
it's the final boss and so that little


---------127:22----------
thing that you think is so easy for you


---------127:25----------
to do that everyone else does so


---------127:28----------
effortlessly


---------127:29----------
whether it's eat a piece of fruit a day


---------127:33----------
or wake up on time or start that work


---------127:37----------
that you're procrastinating on recognize


---------127:39----------
that that is not avarice and that that


---------127:42----------
is the final boss and that what you need


---------127:47----------
to overcome it is not judgment towards


---------127:49----------
yourself not berating yourself for being


---------127:53----------
a piece of [ __ ] but that you need to


---------127:56----------
mentally prepare the way that you do for


---------127:58----------
a final boss check your inventory make


---------128:01----------

---------128:04----------
sure you're not lagging and then get


---------128:06----------
ready to Zone in new Zone in play your


---------128:11----------
