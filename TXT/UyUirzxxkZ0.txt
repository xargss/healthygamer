---------00:00----------
so then someone's asking how do we get


---------00:01----------
over that pain it's the wrong kind of


---------00:03----------
thinking that's that's the thought that


---------00:05----------
gets keeps you stuck you don't get over


---------00:07----------
the pain how can i do a dopamine detox


---------00:09----------
while having depression and porn


---------00:11----------
addiction


---------00:13----------
well that's the only time you can do


---------00:15----------
dopamine detox


---------00:17----------
um


---------00:19----------
what i would think is actually a harder


---------00:21----------
question to answer is how can i do a


---------00:22----------
dopamine detox when i'm meditating on at


---------00:24----------
a monastery on top of a mountain for 30


---------00:26----------
days like that's harder


---------00:28----------
so when thinking about what i do on a


---------00:30----------
daily basis i wake up watch porn go to


---------00:32----------
my computer play video games watch


---------00:33----------
youtube go to go to my bed scroll


---------00:35----------
through social media go back to my


---------00:36----------
computer play video games watch youtube


---------00:38----------
go to back to my bed watch porn and so


---------00:40----------
on


---------00:42----------
right


---------00:44----------
a a truly glorious life when i try to do


---------00:47----------
anything other than these highly


---------00:48----------
dopaminergic activities like meditation


---------00:50----------
yoga exercise socializing cooking


---------00:52----------
reading hiking all the healthy stuff


---------00:54----------
all i can think about is is this over


---------00:56----------
yet can i go back to my computer yet


---------00:59----------
because i find almost zero enjoyment in


---------01:01----------
these other activities it feels like i


---------01:03----------
have no competing interests that rival


---------01:04----------
youtube video games or porn i have zero


---------01:06----------
interest or desire in doing anything


---------01:08----------
besides these three things when i


---------01:10----------
attempt doing a dopamine detox i can't


---------01:11----------
last for more than a day


---------01:13----------
my life has been like this for years i


---------01:15----------
used to enjoy making art and i still


---------01:16----------
want to be an artist but i just don't


---------01:18----------
really enjoy making art anymore and i


---------01:20----------
find it boring and pretty much pointless


---------01:22----------
these last few years


---------01:23----------
i'm currently attending college right


---------01:25----------
now mainly to avoid having a job and it


---------01:27----------
feels like i'm only capable of doing the


---------01:29----------
absolute bare minimum it feels like i'm


---------01:31----------
trapped in these dopaminergic activities


---------01:32----------
and my brain won't let me do anything


---------01:34----------
else any advice


---------01:36----------
so


---------01:38----------
this is unfortunately a common problem


---------01:41----------
where people are stuck in a dopaminergic


---------01:43----------
cycle


---------01:44----------
of youtube pornography video games


---------01:46----------
social media sleep


---------01:48----------
sometimes addictions are thrown thrown


---------01:50----------
in marijuana use alcohol what have you


---------01:52----------
vaping you know


---------01:55----------
so a lot of people are in this situation


---------01:57----------
and so they're like i don't know how to


---------01:58----------
stop this


---------01:59----------
anytime i try to do this the healthy


---------02:01----------
stuff it's boring


---------02:03----------
all my mind thinks is i can't stop when


---------02:05----------
when is this going to be over when is


---------02:07----------
this going to be over when is this going


---------02:09----------
to be over when can i get back to the


---------02:10----------
dopaminergic stuff that kills my soul


---------02:13----------
but satisfies my brain


---------02:15----------
it's a big problem so this is what the


---------02:17----------
nyana yog approach will be okay so we're


---------02:19----------
going to take a different tac a


---------02:21----------
different approach to this question


---------02:23----------
so


---------02:24----------
what nyani yogi would say is like what


---------02:26----------
are you expecting


---------02:28----------
when you cook or you read or you go for


---------02:31----------
a hike or you socialize like what are


---------02:32----------
you looking for


---------02:34----------
what do you think that's going to feel


---------02:35----------
like


---------02:37----------
are you doing these activities expecting


---------02:39----------
it to do anything except for suck


---------02:43----------
because that's what's going to happen if


---------02:44----------
your brain is addicted to dopamine all


---------02:47----------
these activities are going to suck


---------02:49----------
they're gonna be awful


---------02:51----------
it's gonna be terrible


---------02:53----------
like that people will say like oh i


---------02:54----------
tried doing this stuff but it's not as


---------02:56----------
fun as youtube or


---------02:58----------
video gaming yeah it's never going to be


---------03:01----------
that's why youtube and video games are


---------03:04----------
like


---------03:05----------
you know pornography


---------03:07----------
are taking over the world


---------03:09----------
because they are by definition more


---------03:11----------
dopaminergic and more behaviorally


---------03:13----------
reinforcing than cooking


---------03:15----------
it's not like no one's like i'm addicted


---------03:17----------
to cooking


---------03:19----------
i'm addicted to hiking dr k help me i'm


---------03:21----------
addicted to hiking i just can't stop


---------03:23----------
every time i go for a hike


---------03:26----------
i rest for a little while and it's like


---------03:27----------
i gotta i gotta go out and buy celery


---------03:30----------
and make myself a salad oh my god i


---------03:31----------
can't stop


---------03:33----------
no one gets addicted to that stuff


---------03:36----------
right because it's not addictive so


---------03:38----------
first question is like what are you


---------03:39----------
expecting


---------03:41----------
like are you expecting this stuff to be


---------03:43----------
fun are you expecting it to like


---------03:45----------
give you instant gratification like


---------03:46----------
youtube or pornography like you think


---------03:49----------
talking to another human being is going


---------03:51----------
to feel anything like


---------03:52----------
pornography feels


---------03:56----------
and so the first thing you've got to


---------03:57----------
really ask yourself is what are you


---------03:58----------
expecting out of doing these activities


---------04:01----------
are you waiting because this is what i


---------04:02----------
oftentimes see is that people are like


---------04:04----------
waiting


---------04:05----------
to get the dopamine hit from the reading


---------04:08----------
they're like how many days do i need to


---------04:10----------
read


---------04:11----------
before i get the same dopamine hit that


---------04:13----------
i get from playing a video game


---------04:15----------
and then yana yogi would say you're


---------04:16----------
never gonna get the same dopamine head


---------04:19----------
so then the question then you're like


---------04:20----------
okay well if i'm never gonna get the


---------04:21----------
same dopamine hit like then what what do


---------04:23----------
i do and that's where nyanio comes in


---------04:25----------
again


---------04:26----------
and so then then the question is like


---------04:28----------
what do you want your life to be


---------04:31----------
right so if you want your life to be a


---------04:33----------
cycle of youtube video games and


---------04:34----------
pornography then by all means do what


---------04:37----------
you're doing


---------04:39----------
if you want your life to be something


---------04:40----------
else like having a fulfilling


---------04:41----------
relationship not being filled with shame


---------04:44----------
being able to go to sleep being proud of


---------04:46----------
the way that you look


---------04:47----------
if you want some of those things then


---------04:49----------
this is not going to be the pathway to


---------04:51----------
do it


---------04:52----------
and then you're going to say well like


---------04:53----------
those things are hard and it's like yeah


---------04:55----------
like that's the price


---------04:57----------
right so then at some point


---------04:59----------
you have to internally decide


---------05:01----------
what's more important to you


---------05:04----------
do you want to


---------05:06----------
have your mind be not bored on a daily


---------05:09----------
basis


---------05:10----------
is that the most important thing to you


---------05:11----------
then by all means continue living the


---------05:13----------
life you're living


---------05:14----------
or are you willing to tolerate


---------05:17----------
some boredom or a lot of boredom for the


---------05:19----------
sake of some of these other things and


---------05:21----------
really ask yourself the question don't


---------05:23----------
just default to yeah of course so that's


---------05:24----------
what i want to do it's what i should do


---------05:27----------
i think


---------05:28----------
it's what everyone else does if your


---------05:30----------
mind is producing answers like that you


---------05:31----------
don't actually want it it's just you


---------05:33----------
think it's better


---------05:35----------
right but that's not actually what you


---------05:37----------
want to and this is where dionyo comes


---------05:39----------
in so you really have to look at


---------05:40----------
yourself and ask yourself genuinely what


---------05:42----------
is more important to me


---------05:45----------
if i had a choice between having no


---------05:47----------
dopamine and being bored out of my mind


---------05:49----------
but i had made art at the end of the


---------05:50----------
year versus a year of like losing myself


---------05:53----------
in video gaming pornography and youtube


---------05:55----------
which one would i pick


---------05:57----------
and then if you say to yourself i would


---------05:59----------
pick the art and so okay interesting so


---------06:01----------
that means that you


---------06:03----------
have to be bored for a year so let's


---------06:04----------
start today and then what does your mind


---------06:06----------
say well i don't like this okay so like


---------06:09----------
that's the choice that you have do you


---------06:10----------
want to make choices that your mind


---------06:13----------
likes


---------06:14----------
or do you want to make choices that your


---------06:17----------
mind dislikes


---------06:19----------
this is the path of nyan yog


---------06:21----------
this is something that we work a lot on


---------06:23----------
in coaching you guys saw the you know we


---------06:26----------
even someone was asking about coaching


---------06:28----------
resources earlier


---------06:29----------
so we streamed one of our coach


---------06:31----------
trainings and one of our our important


---------06:33----------
coach trainings is about goal-setting


---------06:35----------
and motivation


---------06:36----------
to help people navigate this internal


---------06:39----------
struggle


---------06:40----------
because when people lack motivation like


---------06:42----------
you really have to look at yourself and


---------06:43----------
realize that you don't lack motivation


---------06:46----------
it's just pointed in the wrong direction


---------06:47----------
you're very motivated this person is


---------06:49----------
highly highly motivated


---------06:51----------
they're very motivated to watch


---------06:52----------
pornography play video games and and you


---------06:55----------
know watch youtube


---------06:57----------
to the exclusion of all these other


---------06:58----------
dimensions in their life when your life


---------07:00----------
is going to hell in all of these


---------07:02----------
different ways that's not a sign of a


---------07:04----------
lack of motivation it's a sign of very


---------07:06----------
very high motivation because you're


---------07:08----------
sacrificing so much


---------07:10----------
you're ruining every other dimension of


---------07:12----------
your life so like you have to be highly


---------07:14----------
highly like just think about how


---------07:15----------
motivated you have to be to like ruin


---------07:17----------
things that are important to you you


---------07:18----------
have to be really motivated


---------07:21----------
is it not healthy sure it's not healthy


---------07:24----------
no one's saying it's healthy but let's


---------07:26----------
be honest with ourselves about where our


---------07:27----------
motivation is actually pointed


---------07:32----------
this is the first problem that people


---------07:33----------
don't understand is they think i'm not


---------07:35----------
motivated misdiagnosis just think about


---------07:38----------
how successful you're going to be if you


---------07:40----------
diagnose yourself as a lack of


---------07:42----------
motivation when in fact what you have is


---------07:43----------
too much motivation how successful do


---------07:45----------
you think you're going to get at getting


---------07:46----------
out of that problem


---------07:48----------
it's like like the opposite diagnosis


---------07:52----------
right it's the exact opposite it's like


---------07:53----------
like if you're hungry


---------07:55----------
if you if you don't realize you're


---------07:57----------
hungry and you think you're full all the


---------07:59----------
time and you're wondering like what's


---------08:00----------
going on i'm full i'm full i'm full and


---------08:01----------
you're actually always hungry like


---------08:02----------
you're never gonna fix that problem


---------08:05----------
you're like i need to eat less i need to


---------08:06----------
eat less i need to eat less when


---------08:07----------
actually you're hungry the whole time


---------08:10----------
so everyone's like trying to figure out


---------08:11----------
how do i find motivation you don't need


---------08:13----------
to find motivation you need to get rid


---------08:14----------
of motivation


---------08:15----------
that's why everyone's so damn stuck all


---------08:17----------
the time


---------08:18----------
because you're so motivated for youtube


---------08:20----------
video games and pornography and then you


---------08:22----------
say but that's not what i want to be


---------08:23----------
motivated in there's the second problem


---------08:25----------
you run into


---------08:27----------
because if that were true you wouldn't


---------08:28----------
be doing it


---------08:31----------
you should the thing you should realize


---------08:33----------
is i'm highly motivated to do it


---------08:35----------
so it's like colossal misdiagnoses


---------08:38----------
lead to people being stuck


---------08:40----------
because you're solving a problem that


---------08:41----------
doesn't exist


---------08:44----------
instead of solving the one that does


---------08:46----------
and so this is what we try to you know


---------08:48----------
train our coaches to help people figure


---------08:50----------
out


---------08:50----------
is that it's not that there's like so we


---------08:52----------
have this drive matrix and things like


---------08:54----------
that where you explore with people like


---------08:55----------
okay what actually motivates you what


---------08:58----------
are the shoulds in your life and what


---------08:59----------
are the things that you actually want


---------09:01----------
what are you driven towards and what do


---------09:02----------
you think you should be doing let's


---------09:04----------
understand that those are two entirely


---------09:06----------
different things where does that come


---------09:07----------
from how do we work through that how do


---------09:09----------
we move things from the should column to


---------09:12----------
the things that you know i value or i


---------09:14----------
care about so there's a lot of reframing


---------09:16----------
and things like that that have to happen


---------09:19----------
but start off by recognizing like you


---------09:21----------
know what are you expecting from


---------09:23----------
not playing video games pornography


---------09:26----------
and youtube like what are you expecting


---------09:27----------
what do you think your life is going to


---------09:28----------
be like


---------09:30----------
the truth is it's going to suck


---------09:32----------
in a lot of different ways and there


---------09:34----------
will be a different kind of enjoyment so


---------09:35----------
i'll just explain this very quickly then


---------09:37----------
we're going to wrap up for the day


---------09:39----------
so when you have a dopaminergic life


---------09:43----------
it feels really good in your mind


---------09:46----------
and it's like


---------09:47----------
a desert for your soul you're gonna feel


---------09:51----------
like in the in the in between spaces


---------09:54----------
you're gonna feel like existential dread


---------09:56----------
feel like your life is moving in the


---------09:58----------
wrong direction feel ashamed of yourself


---------10:00----------
feel envious of others there's this


---------10:02----------
whole like pile of like negative


---------10:05----------
emotional demons that's like


---------10:08----------
hiding in the closet


---------10:10----------
and every once in a while like the door


---------10:12----------
of the closet will like open up and


---------10:14----------
they'll come rushing out


---------10:15----------
and then like it takes a lot of


---------10:17----------
pornography to like push them back in


---------10:19----------
right


---------10:20----------
because pornography is the antidote to


---------10:22----------
inner demons


---------10:25----------
and so


---------10:26----------
if you're in that situation like what


---------10:28----------
you're giving up the trade that you make


---------10:30----------
is the exact opposite


---------10:32----------
right it's like having fulfillment


---------10:35----------
and being proud of yourself


---------10:36----------
and all that kind of stuff like maybe


---------10:38----------
having a healthy relationship


---------10:40----------
but you're gonna give up like all the


---------10:41----------
benefits of the dopaminergic crap


---------10:44----------
so you're not gonna have fun you're


---------10:45----------
going to be bored at times it's going to


---------10:46----------
be hard you're going to feel negative


---------10:48----------
things you're going to feel good things


---------10:50----------
too


---------10:50----------
so you have to kind of choose between


---------10:52----------
like the brain and the soul


---------10:54----------
because if you want to choose the brain


---------10:55----------
then you're going to get constant


---------10:56----------
stimulation it'll be like sort of fun


---------11:00----------
but then you'll be raging at your


---------11:01----------
teammates


---------11:02----------
and feeling empty on the inside


---------11:05----------
and you can play video games as much as


---------11:06----------
you want to to feel fill up that


---------11:08----------
emptiness you can watch his pornography


---------11:09----------
as much as you want to to do away with


---------11:11----------
the feeling of loneliness and lack of


---------11:13----------
companionship


---------11:14----------
and you can you can you know watch


---------11:16----------
youtube as much as you want to to inform


---------11:18----------
yourself about things that are neat


---------11:20----------
instead of actually doing something in


---------11:21----------
the world


---------11:22----------
you can learn about what other people


---------11:24----------
are doing as much as you want to it's


---------11:25----------
never going to


---------11:26----------
fix the whole of not having done


---------11:27----------
anything yourself


---------11:30----------
the downside though is if you do things


---------11:31----------
yourself if you enter into a


---------11:33----------
relationship and you find fulfillment


---------11:35----------
it's like


---------11:37----------
your mind is gonna be in pain for parts


---------11:40----------
of that you're gonna have to make


---------11:40----------
sacrifice entering into a relationship


---------11:43----------
is not all just


---------11:45----------
you know get getting rid of your


---------11:47----------
loneliness it's like having to deal with


---------11:49----------
another human being's emotional needs


---------11:51----------
which can be incredibly exhausting


---------11:54----------
you know finding fulfillment in life and


---------11:56----------
being proud of what you do oftentimes


---------11:58----------
comes with blood sweat and tears


---------12:00----------
like the problem is like if you're in


---------12:02----------
this dopaminergic whatever like


---------12:05----------
the second that blood sweat or tears


---------12:06----------
starts to happen we just all fold we


---------12:08----------
cave


---------12:09----------
back


---------12:10----------
let me go back so the real question that


---------12:12----------
you should ask yourself this is the


---------12:13----------
essence of nyan yog is like what are you


---------12:15----------
expecting


---------12:16----------
and what do you want and what choice do


---------12:18----------
you want to make because the choice is


---------12:20----------
yours


---------12:20----------
you just need to make it and recognize


---------12:23----------
that the choice you have to stop picking


---------12:24----------
the good choice and start picking the


---------12:25----------
crappy choice you have to start picking


---------12:27----------
blood sweat and tears over


---------12:29----------
enjoyment relaxation


---------12:32----------
and hitting the fast forward button on


---------12:33----------
your life


---------12:37----------
so then someone's asking how do we get


---------12:39----------
over that pain it's the wrong kind of


---------12:40----------
thinking that's that's the thought that


---------12:42----------
gets keeps you stuck you don't get over


---------12:45----------
the pain


---------12:46----------
what you need to choose is the path to


---------12:48----------
not get over the pain


---------12:50----------
you need to accept the pain embrace the


---------12:51----------
pain it ain't going anywhere


---------12:53----------
this is the whole problem it's a


---------12:54----------
beautiful question how do i get over the


---------12:56----------
pain it's the exact question that that


---------12:58----------
causes failure over and over and over


---------13:00----------
again


---------13:02----------
because everyone's like when does this


---------13:04----------
end it doesn't end if you want to put


---------13:06----------
together your life it doesn't end


---------13:12----------
if you're waiting for the pain to stop


---------13:13----------
if you're waiting for like


---------13:15----------
a book to be as exciting as playing the


---------13:17----------
lost art beta


---------13:19----------
not gonna happen


---------13:21----------
maybe happened with harry potter book


---------13:22----------
four


---------13:23----------
it's the closest we're gonna get in our


---------13:25----------
lifetime


---------13:27----------
right so accept that you're not gonna


---------13:29----------
get over it and that's where you'll get


---------13:31----------
free from it


---------13:41----------
you
