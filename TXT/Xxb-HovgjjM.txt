bit about

your fear of falling behind

---------01:38----------
i've fallen behind


---------01:40----------
in terms of education uh my social


---------01:43----------
relationships with people


---------01:44----------
uh my love life essentially


---------01:47----------
yeah and i i think like i've also like


---------01:50----------
i i i think maybe like uh i felt like


---------01:53----------
shame from it


---------01:54----------
or like people have to have like uh


---------01:56----------
pointed it out that


---------01:58----------
like let's say like in terms of my


---------01:59----------
schooling my classmates like dude you're


---------02:01----------
20 already like


---------02:02----------
how are you still here or like like can


---------02:04----------
you like add your age and stuff like


---------02:06----------
that you know when i'm behind


---------02:07----------
like like when i'm talking to them and


---------02:08----------
stuff like that so yeah just like


---------02:11----------
yeah and it's just like sorry


---------02:15----------
yeah keep going oh um


---------02:18----------
is this that uh yeah i'm just like


---------02:20----------
constantly reminded that


---------02:22----------
i'm like following further behind and i


---------02:23----------
don't have like a lot of time left


---------02:25----------
if i want to like achieve like my goal


---------02:27----------
in life


---------02:28----------
okay so and how old are you jt


---------02:32----------
i'm 20 this year 20 this year okay


---------02:35----------
so i i'm i'm sort of getting the sense


---------02:38----------
that


---------02:39----------
you may be feeling desperate


---------02:43----------
uh i guess yeah that's right


---------02:46----------
okay and and so


---------02:50----------
what um what do you want to achieve


---------02:54----------
uh my life goal oh you said it


---------02:57----------
oh yeah sorry uh yeah okay so i'm just


---------03:00----------
gonna preface this by saying like okay


---------03:01----------
it sounds very


---------03:02----------
it's like very big okay but it's just


---------03:04----------
genuinely how it truly feels i'm just


---------03:06----------
gonna say it


---------03:07----------
okay like good i essentially plan to do


---------03:10----------
what


---------03:10----------
you are doing but in singapore and then


---------03:14----------
like uh i just wanna start like a mental


---------03:16----------
health startup that way and


---------03:17----------
like in order to do that you just have


---------03:18----------
to get like singapore is like a very


---------03:21----------
monotonic like society so like you have


---------03:22----------
to get like super good grades if you


---------03:24----------
want to like


---------03:25----------
do something big so yeah that's why like


---------03:27----------
uh


---------03:28----------
i i'm like uh working so hard to ensure


---------03:31----------
that i


---------03:32----------
at least like get into university okay


---------03:36----------
yeah so so um well so


---------03:39----------
i know this may be a little bit weird


---------03:41----------
but i'm


---------03:42----------
in a weird way like you know i wouldn't


---------03:44----------
have been able to do


---------03:46----------
what i did unless i had fallen behind


---------03:51----------
right because like like


---------03:54----------
you know so i think like in short


---------03:58----------
i mean so you know we'll talk a lot more


---------03:59----------
but like


---------04:01----------
like falling behind is like a core part


---------04:03----------
of who i am


---------04:05----------
and you have to if you want to help


---------04:07----------
other people like


---------04:09----------
you can't be someone who's at the top of


---------04:11----------
your class and like


---------04:12----------
tell someone hey like just you know this


---------04:15----------
is the road to success


---------04:16----------
you have to have actually failed if you


---------04:19----------
want to help people who have also failed


---------04:21----------
i'm not saying that i'm not recommending


---------04:23----------
it to anyone because it sucks


---------04:25----------
yeah it does you know so the first thing


---------04:27----------
is so i just want to kind of toss that


---------04:29----------
out there


---------04:30----------
i still want to learn a lot more about


---------04:31----------
you i think we're not really


---------04:33----------
you know i want to learn a lot more


---------04:34----------
about you but my first thought is that


---------04:37----------
you know if you want to start a mental


---------04:38----------
health


---------04:38----------
if you want to be the the singaporean


---------04:41----------
version of me


---------04:42----------
you're doing it perfectly and falling


---------04:45----------
behind is how you start so that's like


---------04:47----------
great


---------04:48----------
like that's the first step of your main


---------04:50----------
quest is to fall behind


---------04:54----------
and yeah okay yeah i guess that's true


---------04:57----------
but like


---------04:57----------
because like you've mentioned before


---------04:58----------
like you essentially have like a limited


---------05:00----------
time frame of


---------05:01----------
of like of like how you want to help


---------05:03----------
people because you feel like


---------05:04----------
there's going to be a time of age like


---------05:06----------
where you don't feel a sense of relation


---------05:07----------
to like the


---------05:08----------
young adults right so like i feel like


---------05:11----------
the


---------05:12----------
though if i keep falling behind further


---------05:16----------
like maybe like 10 years or like maybe


---------05:18----------
or like maybe like five years


---------05:20----------
maximum in terms of how i want to help


---------05:22----------
people yeah so


---------05:23----------
what i'm hearing is that there's a


---------05:24----------
certain amount of falling behind


---------05:26----------
that is on track and if you


---------05:30----------
fall behind too much you have fallen


---------05:33----------
you've missed that


---------05:34----------
sweet amount of falling behind and


---------05:36----------
you're worried about that


---------05:37----------
yes it is very okay cool we can we can


---------05:40----------
work on that okay so tell me a little


---------05:42----------
bit about um so it sounds like people


---------05:45----------
you know will will like point your


---------05:47----------
they'll tell you about your age and what


---------05:49----------
do they say


---------05:50----------
they'll say like oh you're 20 years old


---------05:52----------
and can you tell me about that


---------05:54----------
oh so like um i guess like


---------05:58----------
when i'm wrong people that i'm


---------05:59----------
comfortable with i tend to act like


---------06:01----------
immaturist right so like


---------06:02----------
sometimes i tend to annoy them and stuff


---------06:04----------
like that it's like my friends were like


---------06:05----------
oh my god can you just like


---------06:07----------
you're 20 and like we are 18 really you


---------06:08----------
know and and we're just like okay yeah


---------06:11----------
that just keeps me in check you know


---------06:12----------
like like grounded yes i'm supposed to


---------06:14----------
act like this


---------06:14----------
or like let's say like sometimes they


---------06:16----------
tell me like oh i forget that sometimes


---------06:18----------
you're 20 you know so like it makes me


---------06:20----------
think like


---------06:21----------
like damn they're like really so behind


---------06:23----------
because like these people like 18 and 20


---------06:25----------
already they're like


---------06:26----------
they're literally at the same pace that


---------06:27----------
i am and then like people like


---------06:30----------
like let's say like in my boxing gym


---------06:31----------
those people who are my age they're


---------06:33----------
already like serving their mandatory


---------06:34----------
like national service


---------06:36----------
orderly like in university like pursuing


---------06:37----------
the things that they want and i'm just


---------06:38----------
like


---------06:39----------
like in my second year of like like uh a


---------06:42----------
second year


---------06:43----------
college okay so is that not universal


---------06:46----------
can you help me understand what


---------06:47----------
university is and what second year


---------06:49----------
college is


---------06:50----------
oh okay so um so in terms of singapore


---------06:53----------
there's like


---------06:54----------
uh like we don't really go to like when


---------06:56----------
you go from high school you don't really


---------06:57----------
go to like a


---------06:57----------
a college for like a like just a general


---------07:00----------
college you get


---------07:01----------
there's like three like junior colleges


---------07:03----------
polytechnics


---------07:04----------
and uh ide so that's like uh like it's


---------07:07----------
just a


---------07:08----------
so like uh from when i was like when i


---------07:11----------
was 16 i went to


---------07:12----------
ite so that's the worst one essentially


---------07:15----------
it's a bit harsh but yeah uh so but in


---------07:18----------
order to get the university you actually


---------07:19----------
have to get to like the second tier in


---------07:20----------
order to get into university


---------07:22----------
right because the first year is not able


---------07:23----------
you only have to do it when you're 16.


---------07:24----------
if not


---------07:25----------
you you don't have the chance uh yeah so


---------07:28----------
so


---------07:29----------
second year is just like yeah this is my


---------07:31----------
second year in polytechnic because


---------07:32----------
there's like three years in


---------07:33----------
this college okay so what are most


---------07:36----------
people who are 20 doing in singapore


---------07:39----------
uh they're either serving their


---------07:41----------
mandatory national service or they are


---------07:43----------
in university


---------07:44----------
most of them like if they follow the


---------07:46----------
like the first day of path right


---------07:48----------
uh they they're already like in in


---------07:50----------
university


---------07:52----------
okay so how many years behind


---------07:55----------
are you uh


---------07:58----------
two three four five five four


---------08:02----------
five oh five okay okay so


---------08:05----------
yeah how does it feel to say that uh


---------08:09----------
i think like i've i've i think i've come


---------08:12----------
to come with


---------08:13----------
okay i've not come to terms with it but


---------08:14----------
i don't know it use


---------08:16----------
disheartening yeah yeah because


---------08:19----------
yeah i'm just constantly reminded about


---------08:21----------
it whenever i'm just interrupting people


---------08:23----------
because like


---------08:23----------
if i like new people that i'm trying to


---------08:25----------
interact with like for example


---------08:27----------
like they i tell them like i'm 20 in the


---------08:29----------
second year college isn't like


---------08:31----------
that after them then i'm the second i


---------08:34----------
mean like the second year college like


---------08:35----------
probably


---------08:36----------
10 and they're like oh are you like


---------08:37----------
graduating soon like oh no


---------08:39----------
i'm like in my second year then i oh


---------08:41----------
okay or if i tell them like


---------08:43----------
i was actually from the third tier


---------08:44----------
college that's why then there's like uh


---------08:46----------
there's a stigma there because like


---------08:47----------
in singapore like people tend to like


---------08:49----------
look down if you were in the third year


---------08:51----------
college


---------08:52----------
for example yeah there's like all this


---------08:54----------
like uh


---------08:55----------
factors okay and jt can you help me


---------08:59----------
understand


---------09:00----------
how you fell behind in the first place


---------09:04----------
uh just like mistake that i made like uh


---------09:08----------
i guess like uh when i was 16 15 like i


---------09:11----------
just


---------09:11----------
throughout my secondary school um and


---------09:13----------
like just in high school uh


---------09:15----------
i wasn't really very studious as a


---------09:17----------
person um


---------09:18----------
you know i didn't really work hard as


---------09:20----------
well uh like a lot of people keep


---------09:22----------
telling me like oh i'm smart you know


---------09:23----------
you


---------09:23----------
do it you know but like like yeah i just


---------09:26----------
can't i just couldn't study


---------09:27----------
and like i just stick to games all day


---------09:29----------
like every day just playing games even


---------09:31----------
like during


---------09:32----------
like exams like when it was exam period


---------09:34----------
like during the exam day i was playing


---------09:36----------
yeah i wasn't even studying yeah and


---------09:38----------
then that's how i got into


---------09:39----------
college and the only reason how i got


---------09:42----------
into like the second year college was


---------09:44----------
because often like a like a inter


---------09:46----------
attitude interview assessment


---------09:48----------
like they assess you like if you're in


---------09:50----------
the third year college and you want to


---------09:51----------
get the second year you can do this


---------09:52----------
interview where you can like soak


---------09:53----------
courses like also i wanted to stop


---------09:54----------
course from


---------09:55----------
like i.t like computer stuff to like


---------09:57----------
psychology like and drama and


---------09:59----------
i applied psychology and drama so like i


---------10:01----------
interviewed there and


---------10:02----------
like in the polytechnic and then they


---------10:04----------
gave it to me yeah then


---------10:07----------
how do you feel about that i think that


---------10:10----------
was like the happiest moment of my life


---------10:12----------
when like they sent me the like email


---------10:14----------
notifications and they say like


---------10:17----------
uh dear like dear jt congrats oh my then


---------10:20----------
i just


---------10:20----------
started freaking out like i was in a bus


---------10:22----------
my jaw dropped and everything i was so


---------10:23----------
happy


---------10:24----------
yeah because i was then i was like yes


---------10:26----------
finally like you know


---------10:27----------
one step like further i'm like at least


---------10:29----------
take one step you know i'm not as far


---------10:31----------
behind now


---------10:33----------
yeah and and so are you


---------10:36----------
moving on pace now that you're in the


---------10:38----------
polytechnic college


---------10:41----------
um like slowly yeah i i i think i'm


---------10:44----------
doing


---------10:45----------
quite quite well actually like maybe but


---------10:47----------
i need to be better


---------10:48----------
if not i just need to be like way better


---------10:51----------
a little bit but


---------10:52----------
okay so help me understand


---------10:55----------
when you say you're doing quite well how


---------10:57----------
do you determine whether you're doing


---------11:00----------
well or not


---------11:01----------
i guess through my grades like okay so


---------11:03----------
like the max in terms of gpa is like


---------11:04----------
four right and like 3.79 now


---------11:08----------
and so but in order to get like you like


---------11:10----------
poly university like


---------11:12----------
because from second tier day that's like


---------11:14----------
it's very very hard


---------11:15----------
to get in compared to if you're in a


---------11:16----------
first year college from four


---------11:17----------
universities


---------11:18----------
and only universities they're like they


---------11:20----------
have like psychology and they're like


---------11:21----------
more reputable


---------11:22----------
it's like only like two universities the


---------11:25----------
third one is like just like longer a


---------11:26----------
long way longer but uh


---------11:28----------
so like uh yeah it's like you need to


---------11:30----------
get like three point nine maybe


---------11:33----------
like three point like a high you want it


---------11:35----------
so like essentially


---------11:37----------
this semester i have to get everything a


---------11:38----------
but like sorry i'm


---------11:40----------
sorry like talking a lot by like just


---------11:42----------
giving more information but like i think


---------11:43----------
this is like elective


---------11:45----------
i like it oh okay i did this like


---------11:48----------
elective and i


---------11:49----------
and then like uh like uh


---------11:52----------
i got a b plus and i was like so sad


---------11:54----------
about it but like i'm trying to like


---------11:56----------
work on it like


---------11:57----------
it's something that like trying to work


---------11:58----------
on like uh it's like accepting the


---------12:01----------
oh sorry i'm just gonna you know because


---------12:03----------
good because this is i just


---------12:04----------
i just like note things that i've


---------12:06----------
improved on and like things i should


---------12:07----------
improve on


---------12:08----------
sorry so like uh focusing on the process


---------12:10----------
not the outcome


---------12:11----------
it's like i can't control getting an a


---------12:12----------
but you can be confident in my own work


---------12:14----------
done or like


---------12:15----------
i accept the outcomes gained by


---------12:17----------
validating the emotions of my outcomes


---------12:19----------
but like sometimes i feel like they


---------12:20----------
don't work as well


---------12:22----------
sure or like i don't think even though


---------12:23----------
i've been like working on it for like


---------12:25----------
a year now like i it's not as


---------12:28----------
it's not it there's not much improvement


---------12:31----------
i guess


---------12:32----------
okay


---------12:36----------
i i really like the level of detail


---------12:38----------
you're going into jt and by all please


---------12:40----------
pull out your phone whenever you want to


---------12:41----------
because i think it's really helpful


---------12:43----------
um can i just have a second to think yep


---------12:50----------
okay


---------12:52----------
can you um tell me a little bit about uh


---------12:55----------
you know


---------12:56----------
why you you want to why you want to be


---------13:00----------
the singaporean version of dr k like


---------13:02----------
help me understand what


---------13:03----------
what appeals to you about that why is


---------13:05----------
that your goal


---------13:07----------
um i think i think i literally found my


---------13:11----------
dharma because of you


---------13:13----------
okay yeah yeah okay i'm noticing that


---------13:15----------
how how whenever i say that


---------13:16----------
it sounds as though it feels my mind is


---------13:18----------
like liking me like that sounds


---------13:20----------
stupid you know okay but sorry uh yeah


---------13:23----------
yeah uh


---------13:24----------
yeah i you you helped me for my dharma


---------13:26----------
and i think this is just what i wanted


---------13:28----------
to do and like i think


---------13:29----------
like uh like singaporean society needs


---------13:31----------
it a lot


---------13:32----------
right because uh we are very


---------13:34----------
neurotographic and we are like go go go


---------13:35----------
go go you know we don't have time to


---------13:37----------
rest it's just


---------13:37----------
like drilling it in very technical


---------13:39----------
integration you know just like


---------13:40----------
i drill it in don't like don't stop you


---------13:42----------
know it's just this is how it is so like


---------13:44----------
i want like


---------13:45----------
like so like most people they feel like


---------13:47----------
they don't have anybody talking about


---------13:48----------
things and i


---------13:49----------
i want to offer that help to people and


---------13:51----------
also like how you're doing it like your


---------13:52----------
help yeah you're doing like peer-to-peer


---------13:53----------
coaching and stuff like that which is


---------13:54----------
really so i want to like


---------13:56----------
put people who are who know better than


---------13:58----------
me in like terms of like uh how like uh


---------14:00----------
like maybe like


---------14:01----------
x convicts fields like because they're


---------14:02----------
they will x-con convicts themselves you


---------14:04----------
know like then they can't be sure that


---------14:05----------
can't stop like i love that


---------14:07----------
yeah so let's do it here because and


---------14:10----------
also


---------14:10----------
because when i wanted to like be a


---------14:12----------
healthy gamer coacher


---------14:13----------
it was it was not it was not legal when


---------14:16----------
i tried to sign up


---------14:17----------
in singapore's i mean like like from


---------14:18----------
singapore so i guess


---------14:20----------
i just want to do it here cool okay so


---------14:23----------
so why do you want to help other people


---------14:26----------
like help me understand what what do you


---------14:28----------
want to help them


---------14:30----------
do or see differently from the way that


---------14:33----------
society is right now


---------14:38----------
um


---------14:41----------
like sorry can you just repeat the


---------14:42----------
question yeah so so like


---------14:44----------
so you said that the problem is that


---------14:46----------
singapore is like very like


---------14:47----------
a meritocracy and they like kind of


---------14:49----------
drill you to like you know


---------14:51----------
do this then do this then do this then


---------14:52----------
do this if you do all these things


---------14:55----------
then you are successful and you are a


---------14:56----------
good human being


---------14:58----------
and if you don't do those things you are


---------15:00----------
a bad human being


---------15:02----------
right that is that fair yep


---------15:05----------
so how do you want to change that


---------15:10----------
uh


---------15:13----------
i just want them to tell themselves that


---------15:18----------
there are other pathways it's just going


---------15:20----------
to take longer and you just have to


---------15:21----------
accept it


---------15:23----------
sorry so i just gave myself the answer


---------15:27----------
of like


---------15:27----------
my work sorry sorry


---------15:31----------
but you know but like but for me i have


---------15:33----------
limited oh crap


---------15:35----------
i'm saying like oh i have limited time


---------15:39----------
i don't know man oh or maybe i


---------15:41----------
shouldn't maybe i shouldn't do that


---------15:42----------
because i don't even know how to combat


---------15:43----------
that if i


---------15:44----------
yeah but i don't even know myself no no


---------15:47----------
but


---------15:48----------
good so you're doing you're doing great


---------15:49----------
jt right because like it starts with


---------15:51----------
noticing


---------15:53----------
you're like like the answer that you


---------15:54----------
want to give them is like the one that


---------15:55----------
you need to hear


---------15:56----------
and then like why is that funny because


---------15:59----------
then as soon as you say that you realize


---------16:00----------
okay this is the advice that i need to


---------16:02----------
follow


---------16:03----------
and then like your mind is like when i


---------16:04----------
try to follow that advice your mind


---------16:06----------
tells you


---------16:08----------
doesn't want to listen to it right yeah


---------16:11----------
so so what does your when you say


---------16:15----------
you know it takes time you have your own


---------16:17----------
path you know just keep persevering


---------16:19----------
and what does your mind tell you in


---------16:21----------
response when you try to tell that to


---------16:22----------
yourself you can tell to someone else


---------16:25----------
but when you tell it to yourself what


---------16:26----------
does your mind tell you


---------16:30----------
dude you're not gonna yeah you're not


---------16:33----------
gonna make it if you


---------16:34----------
if you slack over you don't study you


---------16:35----------
did but you're not gonna have time


---------16:37----------
like uh there's no way because if you


---------16:39----------
wanna do like like uh you can do like


---------16:41----------
the third university but you're gonna be


---------16:42----------
like


---------16:43----------
30 by the time you you even get out of


---------16:46----------
the university then what you're gonna do


---------16:48----------
like 30 to just just to get a bachelor's


---------16:50----------
i'm like okay


---------16:52----------
i don't know what i'm supposed to do and


---------16:54----------
then that that can happen to me because


---------16:56----------
like


---------16:56----------
okay this is very egotistic but like i


---------16:59----------
this goal is so big i


---------17:00----------
like all bigger than like the norm like


---------17:03----------
people like most people


---------17:04----------
like i hear like oh they just want to


---------17:05----------
earn money they want get rich so they


---------17:07----------
can do everyone


---------17:08----------
but like this goal of helping people


---------17:09----------
like i i need to get there faster


---------17:12----------
because


---------17:12----------
because i need to help those people and


---------17:14----------
if i don't help those people


---------17:16----------
in time then it's useless


---------17:19----------
like oh like my life is like worthless


---------17:22----------
okay because it all right yeah


---------17:30----------
okay


---------17:32----------
okay i'm gonna try one thing that's


---------17:34----------
probably gonna bounce off


---------17:36----------
so like how old do you think you need to


---------17:38----------
be to help people


---------17:41----------
um what how old is too late


---------17:47----------
i mean i can actually like like okay


---------17:49----------
when you say help people


---------17:51----------
like uh i can help people now honestly


---------17:53----------
in terms of volunteering and stuff like


---------17:54----------
that and i have done that


---------17:56----------
but it's just um like help people the


---------17:58----------
way i want like the way you're doing it


---------18:00----------
like in need like in terms of you need


---------18:02----------
like good like


---------18:03----------
successful like education and you need


---------18:04----------
to have like scholarships and stuff like


---------18:05----------
that


---------18:06----------
in order to like enforce change in terms


---------18:08----------
of like macro system levels like


---------18:10----------
in terms of society and stuff like in


---------18:12----------
singapore's like i i need to have good


---------18:13----------
grades if not they won't listen to me


---------18:15----------
right cause like i could like like like


---------18:18----------
someone like a second year


---------18:19----------
like a college person like with a


---------18:21----------
diploma and applied psychology telling


---------18:23----------
you oh this is how you're supposed to do


---------18:24----------
it when


---------18:25----------
like they're like people like in


---------18:27----------
universities with masters already


---------18:29----------
like i mean how how old


---------18:32----------
how old tell me what


---------18:36----------
what do you need how old do you need to


---------18:37----------
be and what kind of professional


---------18:39----------
certification do you need to be


---------18:41----------
i calculated it would be 28 for masters


---------18:44----------
and then hopefully i can work at the


---------18:46----------
same time and do my doctorate


---------18:48----------
i'll be like 34 or something 34


---------18:51----------
34 by the time i get my dog but


---------18:53----------
like 28 i can start helping people in


---------18:55----------
terms of my master in terms of getting a


---------18:56----------
milestone yeah


---------18:57----------
and and buy 30 are you on track by 34 to


---------19:00----------
get your doctorate


---------19:02----------
i hope so okay right yeah


---------19:06----------
so like i i mean do you know how old i


---------19:10----------
am


---------19:11----------
38 yeah do you know how old i was when i


---------19:14----------
finished training


---------19:16----------
uh no no


---------19:19----------
let me just make sure i have this right


---------19:21----------
i was 36 when i finished training


---------19:26----------
i don't know oh sorry uh i said


---------19:29----------
what wait you need i'm doing this for


---------19:31----------
two years from now


---------19:33----------
yeah well i thought you like seeing


---------19:35----------
patients for quite a while yeah so


---------19:37----------
so much like masters so i finished


---------19:39----------
medical school at the age of 32


---------19:41----------
but i finished residency at the age of


---------19:43----------
36.


---------19:47----------
huh go go


---------19:52----------
so like like i said like i said right so


---------19:55----------
so you're on track to be faster than me


---------19:59----------
what does your mind tell you


---------20:02----------
that i want to help people faster as in


---------20:04----------
i i yeah


---------20:06----------
or like like i have to be faster or like


---------20:08----------
i


---------20:09----------
i don't know it just does many to be


---------20:10----------
faster okay so like


---------20:12----------
you are already on track to be faster


---------20:15----------
than dr k


---------20:17----------
you're gonna be you're on track to be


---------20:19----------
two years faster than dr k and what does


---------20:20----------
your mind tell you in response to that


---------20:27----------
uh it's telling me nothing he's just


---------20:28----------
saying okay cool yep uh oh wait


---------20:32----------
um


---------20:34----------
uh yeah okay i don't know i feel


---------20:38----------
satisfied now


---------20:39----------
but i don't


---------20:42----------
my mind is like telling me like no it's


---------20:45----------
not enough because


---------20:46----------
i like i'm trying to my mind is trying


---------20:48----------
to discredit you by saying like


---------20:50----------
oh dude you are you're in the u.s


---------20:52----------
education system and i'm in the


---------20:53----------
singaporean education system it works


---------20:55----------
differently you don't have the same


---------20:56----------
amount of opportunities


---------20:57----------
i don't have the same amount of


---------20:58----------
opportunities that you have okay good


---------21:00----------
good so now so the first thing to


---------21:02----------
understand so i want you to notice


---------21:04----------
something okay when it comes to feeling


---------21:06----------
fallen behind and desperate the reality


---------21:09----------
the situation


---------21:10----------
does not matter at all


---------21:14----------
because here you are with your goal


---------21:17----------
and i'm telling you you are two years


---------21:19----------
ahead of me


---------21:20----------
you're two years faster than i am and


---------21:23----------
and your mind is gonna find


---------21:24----------
some way to like


---------21:28----------
set that aside and discredit what i say


---------21:30----------
do you see that


---------21:31----------
like it doesn't i i could tell you jt


---------21:34----------
you're doing great


---------21:35----------
and you'll find some way to tell me i'm


---------21:37----------
wrong


---------21:38----------
you'll find your mind will find some way


---------21:42----------
to keep you feeling desperate and


---------21:45----------
ashamed


---------21:47----------
does that make sense yeah


---------21:50----------
we're doing it again yeah but i'm just


---------21:52----------
trying to notice it so like it will go


---------21:54----------
away but like that's the problem because


---------21:56----------
like like


---------21:58----------
yeah i'm just like noticing it right but


---------22:00----------
like sometimes it will just already just


---------22:01----------
like fades and then


---------22:03----------
it comes back no like like oh god do you


---------22:05----------
know i did i did this like


---------22:07----------
like a few days ago when like my friends


---------22:08----------
were critiquing me about how i should


---------22:10----------
improve right so like


---------22:11----------
uh i i was trying to notice that because


---------22:13----------
i went to sleep by angry and i was just


---------22:14----------
trying to notice my anger


---------22:16----------
and just like kept coming back so i


---------22:17----------
couldn't sleep for like three hours


---------22:18----------
because i kept noticing it


---------22:19----------
it was like so hot yeah yeah so it's


---------22:22----------
it's really hard man


---------22:23----------
so i think you're doing a good job and


---------22:25----------
we're going to try to help you okay so


---------22:26----------
the the key thing


---------22:27----------
here though is that a lot of times when


---------22:29----------
we feel like we've fallen behind


---------22:31----------
we think that something in the outside


---------22:34----------
world will


---------22:35----------
make it better right like if i fix


---------22:38----------
something outside if i catch up if i get


---------22:40----------
a 3.79 if i get a 3.9


---------22:43----------
if i do this then it'll go away we think


---------22:45----------
that that the solution to falling behind


---------22:48----------
is changing something in the outside


---------22:49----------
world right


---------22:52----------
yeah your mind is telling you i will be


---------22:54----------
satisfied


---------22:55----------
when dot dot dot but what we can kind of


---------22:59----------
notice is that like


---------23:00----------
even though you got accepted and you are


---------23:02----------
super happy and you're getting a 3.79


---------23:05----------
you know and maybe it's not enough if


---------23:07----------
your mind is always going to tell you


---------23:09----------
it's not enough do you see that


---------23:13----------
yep even though you're making progress


---------23:16----------
sounds like you're going to be okay


---------23:17----------
actually but like your mind is like it's


---------23:20----------
not enough it's not enough so we have to


---------23:22----------
recognize is that an objective


---------23:25----------
achievement in the outside world


---------23:27----------
is not going to make you feel like


---------23:28----------
you've caught up


---------23:31----------
even if you're telling me that you want


---------23:33----------
to be dr k and that sounds grandiose


---------23:35----------
like fine whatever


---------23:36----------
and then dr k is telling you you're


---------23:37----------
doing it two years faster than i am like


---------23:39----------
that should be enough


---------23:41----------
right but it's not going to be which is


---------23:43----------
why i said it's going to bounce off


---------23:44----------
which is fine which is why i said it


---------23:46----------
just so we can appreciate that it


---------23:48----------
bounces off so this is where like the


---------23:50----------
work that you need to do has


---------23:51----------
nothing to do with your external


---------23:53----------
performance


---------23:54----------
it has everything to do with like the


---------23:56----------
feeling of falling behind and where that


---------23:58----------
comes from


---------24:01----------
because it sounds like you're doing okay


---------24:03----------
right like so it sounds like you weren't


---------24:04----------
a great student and then you've worked


---------24:06----------
your way up to a 3.79


---------24:08----------
you've got some work ahead of you and


---------24:10----------
you've got to shoot for a 3.9 will you


---------24:12----------
make it will you not make it like who


---------24:14----------
knows


---------24:14----------
but like you may you know sometimes


---------24:16----------
you'll get a lucky break in the future


---------24:17----------
too like you take enough shots


---------24:20----------
you open enough loot boxes and like


---------24:22----------
eventually you'll get


---------24:23----------
you know like some rare item


---------24:26----------
and and you'll like i'm not i'm not


---------24:29----------
worried about you jt


---------24:31----------
so because i i think that like you know


---------24:33----------
this is where you say you got lucky but


---------24:35----------
like


---------24:35----------
you also it sounds like you had an


---------24:36----------
interview right


---------24:39----------
yeah and and like sometimes in life like


---------24:42----------
we just have these opportunities where


---------24:43----------
we just


---------24:44----------
have to like you know crush it in a


---------24:46----------
moment and then we can catch a break


---------24:49----------
and and so i think if it's been my


---------24:51----------
experience that like people will catch


---------24:53----------
breaks


---------24:54----------
as long as you keep looking for them


---------24:57----------
like if you sit at home and like play


---------24:58----------
video games all day like


---------25:00----------
you're it's gonna be really hard to


---------25:01----------
catch a break but if you're out there


---------25:03----------
you're trying you're applying to stuff


---------25:04----------
you're taking classes


---------25:05----------
like someone somewhere will like notice


---------25:08----------
you and be like okay let's give this guy


---------25:10----------
a chance


---------25:12----------
right that's what happened like that's


---------25:13----------
how you got in because someone like saw


---------25:15----------
something and they were like oh like


---------25:17----------
this guy really is not in person he is


---------25:19----------
different


---------25:20----------
from what we see on paper


---------25:23----------
on paper he doesn't have much much merit


---------25:26----------
but this kid is a little bit different


---------25:27----------
so let's give him a chance


---------25:29----------
and i i do think that the world


---------25:31----------
functions like that and if you keep on


---------25:32----------
like


---------25:33----------
putting yourself out there that people


---------25:35----------
will notice that


---------25:36----------
and like value that


---------25:40----------
can i say the comments yeah uh because i


---------25:44----------
like uh recently okay so like our our


---------25:47----------
teachers like sometimes i do check-ups


---------25:48----------
during the holidays to see how we like


---------25:50----------
however in terms of mental health and


---------25:51----------
stuff


---------25:52----------
and like like just now when you stay


---------25:54----------
there like yo


---------25:55----------
you're the way you're gonna progress the


---------25:57----------
way how hard working on the way you do


---------25:58----------
this kind of things you you're gonna be


---------25:59----------
fine


---------26:00----------
but like my teacher told me like like if


---------26:03----------
you wanna like


---------26:04----------
do great things like for example my


---------26:05----------
friend he was doing like he wants to do


---------26:07----------
like policy making in singapore right


---------26:09----------
and like i started it but you need


---------26:10----------
scholarships and stuff it's like i


---------26:12----------
relate what i'm doing like in terms of


---------26:13----------
how


---------26:14----------
like how grandiose is his goal is to


---------26:16----------
mine so like equal


---------26:17----------
it's like and she said like like you


---------26:19----------
need to have scholarships if not


---------26:21----------
no one's gonna notice you if not like


---------26:23----------
like you're not gonna


---------26:24----------
you know you're gonna know where like


---------26:26----------
it's only because he volunteered


---------26:28----------
that they're doing so many volunteering


---------26:29----------
work right now they're like like


---------26:31----------
they're like working they're doing so


---------26:33----------
many things like all these kind of


---------26:34----------
things like all these big things


---------26:36----------
just so that they will get noticed like


---------26:38----------
and i'm here like i'm not even


---------26:40----------
i'm not not right now i'm not even


---------26:41----------
volunteering i'm just like studying


---------26:43----------
right but but my my peer my friend like


---------26:46----------
he has been volunteering


---------26:47----------
his gpa is like way higher and this way


---------26:51----------
he'll probably get it and i won't okay


---------26:53----------
yeah


---------26:54----------
oh i said yeah okay it's not that i


---------26:55----------
won't but like uh like i stand a lesser


---------26:57----------
chance


---------26:58----------
yeah so i think that makes sense


---------27:02----------
so jt i don't think you are your friend


---------27:04----------
you're not one of them


---------27:07----------
and and i think the harder that you try


---------27:09----------
to be


---------27:11----------
the more you will miss out on who you


---------27:13----------
are


---------27:17----------
what does that mean because like so so


---------27:20----------
this is where like i know it sounds


---------27:21----------
weird but like you don't need to be them


---------27:26----------
like you need to be you


---------27:28----------
[Music]


---------27:30----------
yeah sorry yeah go ahead


---------27:34----------
oh like yeah isn't like usually like i


---------27:37----------
need to be me but like


---------27:38----------
yeah i was in but i still need to


---------27:40----------
volunteer i still have to do this


---------27:41----------
stuff right if not i can't get the


---------27:43----------
scholarship i can't get noticed


---------27:44----------
according to the teacher


---------27:46----------
so so the we'll we'll get to that in a


---------27:48----------
second


---------27:49----------
right but like if you're not capable of


---------27:52----------
volunteering and studying at the same


---------27:54----------
time like can you do that


---------27:57----------
okay so okay so that's what i'm saying


---------28:00----------
if you're not good enough i know it


---------28:01----------
sounds kind of weird but like that's


---------28:03----------
where you need to start


---------28:04----------
right so like what are you capable of so


---------28:07----------
that


---------28:08----------
there are there are a lot of different


---------28:09----------
things here so let me like let me


---------28:11----------
say there's two different tracks here jt


---------28:14----------
one is that


---------28:15----------
your personal sense of shame and


---------28:17----------
desperation


---------28:18----------
is emotional and like if you want to


---------28:21----------
understand like so


---------28:22----------
i can say as much logical as i want


---------28:24----------
to and it's gonna bounce off every time


---------28:26----------
until you deal with that emotional thing


---------28:28----------
if someone feels like they're unlovable


---------28:32----------
someone else can try to love them as


---------28:33----------
much as they want to and it just won't


---------28:36----------
it will never land it'll never hit right


---------28:39----------
it'll just bounce off over and over and


---------28:41----------
over again


---------28:42----------
so if you want to like discover your


---------28:44----------
confidence you have to start by like


---------28:46----------
exploring where your shame comes from so


---------28:49----------
we can talk about your parents and stuff


---------28:51----------
like that


---------28:53----------
and like you know what it was like


---------28:54----------
growing up like where you started to


---------28:55----------
feel


---------28:56----------
fall behind like you know you can tell


---------28:58----------
me about how ashamed you felt and all


---------28:59----------
that kind of stuff


---------29:00----------
and as we start to see because you kind


---------29:02----------
of say that you know


---------29:03----------
the shame you you notice it and it comes


---------29:05----------
down and then it pops back up right


---------29:07----------
so where is it coming from where is it


---------29:09----------
popping from it's


---------29:10----------
it's because your mind has that


---------29:12----------
emotional energy


---------29:14----------
from being 16 years old and getting into


---------29:17----------
that


---------29:17----------
third college the ide and you felt so


---------29:20----------
ashamed and then you started to play a


---------29:22----------
video game


---------29:23----------
so where did all that shame go it got


---------29:25----------
buried


---------29:26----------
and now what it does is pop up and the


---------29:29----------
more you played the video game the more


---------29:31----------
you buried the shame you felt behind


---------29:33----------
other people you know then you were 17


---------29:35----------
and then your friends were 17 the


---------29:37----------
friends that you used to be with when


---------29:38----------
you were 12


---------29:39----------
they started to grow and now every time


---------29:41----------
you compare yourself to your friend


---------29:44----------
there's more shame building do you see


---------29:47----------
that


---------29:49----------
yep okay so like there's the getting rid


---------29:52----------
of the shame down below which has


---------29:54----------
means working through it the second


---------29:56----------
thing to point out is comparison


---------29:59----------
okay so comparison is a function of the


---------30:03----------
ego


---------30:05----------
and the ego arises when you're


---------30:08----------
experiencing negative emotion


---------30:11----------
so the more you compare yourself the


---------30:14----------
worse this is going to be


---------30:17----------
because if you think about it falling


---------30:19----------
behind can only


---------30:20----------
happen if you have a standard of


---------30:23----------
comparison


---------30:26----------
okay then the third thing and don't


---------30:28----------
worry jt


---------30:30----------
don't worry we're gonna calm your mind


---------30:31----------
down the third thing is there is a very


---------30:34----------
harsh reality


---------30:35----------
that you live in a country that is very


---------30:38----------
comparative


---------30:40----------
right we can say as much like dr k like


---------30:43----------
you can make me feel wonderful on the


---------30:44----------
inside


---------30:45----------
we can deal with all the shame i can


---------30:48----------
conquer my ego


---------30:49----------
and at the end of the day when i apply


---------30:51----------
for something they're going to look at


---------30:52----------
my resume they're going to look at my


---------30:54----------
scholarships they're going to look at my


---------30:55----------
volunteer


---------30:57----------
situations and they're going to say


---------30:59----------
screw this guy


---------31:00----------
and who they're going to listen to is


---------31:02----------
the guy who's got all that stuff and


---------31:04----------
that is the world that i live in


---------31:07----------
true so what do we do about


---------31:11----------
that right so like


---------31:17----------
right so like these are the different


---------31:21----------
topics we can talk about because i i do


---------31:23----------
think that we could have a discussion


---------31:24----------
about


---------31:25----------
growing up in a society that you say is


---------31:28----------
a meritocracy but it's not actually a


---------31:30----------
meritocracy


---------31:32----------
so like it's it's an artificial


---------31:35----------
measurement


---------31:36----------
of merit right it's it's a


---------31:39----------
measurementocracy


---------31:42----------
because it's not real merit it's like an


---------31:44----------
approximation so like


---------31:46----------
our society has become more and more


---------31:48----------
geared towards


---------31:50----------
what we can measure versus what is


---------31:52----------
valuable


---------31:53----------
and we've started to confuse the two so


---------31:56----------
like if you look at the stock market


---------31:57----------
like


---------31:58----------
if if a stock price is high that means


---------32:01----------
the company is doing well


---------32:03----------
right that's what we started to do we've


---------32:04----------
started to replace


---------32:06----------
merit and value with measurement


---------32:09----------
because it's easier so it's like hard


---------32:12----------
for people to like get


---------32:14----------
to know every student so what we do is


---------32:16----------
we give them a test


---------32:17----------
and we say based on the test we're going


---------32:19----------
to rank you


---------32:22----------
and that's just the way the world is


---------32:24----------
which i totally get


---------32:25----------
right and i think that there's


---------32:27----------
particular like strategies and stuff to


---------32:29----------
to navigate the meritocracy but like


---------32:32----------
you know i i think that if anything i


---------32:35----------
mean jt you're 20.


---------32:37----------
the question is what is singapore going


---------32:39----------
to be like 10 years from now


---------32:40----------
20 years from now 30 years from now and


---------32:42----------
40 years from now


---------32:46----------
right huh


---------32:49----------
you wouldn't know you wouldn't know


---------32:50----------
right so so and this is where i think


---------32:52----------
part of the problem here is that


---------32:54----------
some of your goals i think are very


---------32:55----------
artificial


---------32:57----------
like and this is where you can try to


---------33:00----------
be something that you can envision


---------33:04----------
but like i don't know if this makes


---------33:05----------
sense but like once again since you said


---------33:07----------
you want to be like me


---------33:08----------
at 20 years old what i thought i wanted


---------33:11----------
to be i was completely wrong about


---------33:17----------
right and and like the whole point of


---------33:20----------
like


---------33:20----------
you know like the way i became dr k is


---------33:23----------
by like ignoring


---------33:24----------
what the world was doing instead of


---------33:27----------
trying to live


---------33:28----------
up to the world standard


---------33:31----------
it's like being myself and the more i


---------33:35----------
started to be myself


---------33:36----------
instead of chasing after what other


---------33:39----------
people wanted like


---------33:41----------
that's how i became me


---------33:44----------
it's actually moving away from like


---------33:47----------
what everyone wanted like it's like you


---------33:50----------
know quitting


---------33:53----------
a good position at harvard


---------33:56----------
it's like that's what everyone wants


---------33:58----------
like you know when i graduated they were


---------34:00----------
like


---------34:00----------
you know because like even when you


---------34:02----------
finish you know there are tears right


---------34:04----------
there's like there's the good jobs


---------34:07----------
and they're the medium jobs and they're


---------34:09----------
the bad jobs


---------34:11----------
and since i did really well they offered


---------34:13----------
me the good job


---------34:15----------
and i was like no thank you so like like


---------34:19----------
that


---------34:19----------
that rat race that like that


---------34:22----------
you know that treadmill of like first


---------34:25----------
you have to do this and then you have to


---------34:26----------
do this then you have to do this you


---------34:27----------
absolutely have to play the game to a


---------34:28----------
certain extent like don't get me wrong


---------34:31----------
but like i wouldn't put i wouldn't get


---------34:33----------
it you know i would strongly encourage


---------34:35----------
you to like realize


---------34:36----------
that you don't you know affecting policy


---------34:40----------
like that may change


---------34:42----------
what you need to affect policy may


---------34:44----------
change


---------34:45----------
you know and this is the kind of thing


---------34:47----------
where it's like you know


---------34:50----------
anyway i mean you have no idea what the


---------34:52----------
world is going to send you like just


---------34:53----------
trust me on that one


---------34:54----------
you just you just have no idea


---------34:57----------
you know and and and this is where like


---------35:01----------
like this just to be blunt this is just


---------35:04----------
too bizarre


---------35:05----------
but like recently someone put me in


---------35:08----------
touch with someone


---------35:09----------
very high in the singaporean government


---------35:15----------
and and they're like they're like


---------35:18----------
interested in doing something around


---------35:20----------
mental health in singapore


---------35:22----------
right so like i have no i like it's just


---------35:24----------
a bizarre i don't know if anything is


---------35:26----------
going to happen to it


---------35:28----------
but like it's very possible that i have


---------35:30----------
no idea because


---------35:32----------
i don't know what comes next but like


---------35:34----------
it's very possible that like


---------35:36----------
some healthy gamer could move into


---------35:38----------
singapore and if healthy gamer moves


---------35:40----------
into singapore i would be like


---------35:41----------
hey i know a guy what do you guys think


---------35:46----------
my point is i have no idea if that works


---------35:47----------
i don't think we should rely on that


---------35:49----------
expectation


---------35:51----------
my point is that you just have no


---------35:53----------
 clue


---------35:54----------
like what the future holds and so trying


---------35:58----------
to build a life


---------36:00----------
based on like okay this is what i've got


---------36:02----------
to do and this is what i've got to do


---------36:03----------
and this is what i've got to do


---------36:04----------
so i wind up in this place and this is


---------36:08----------
what i want to achieve is like the wrong


---------36:09----------
way of thinking about it


---------36:11----------
just the whole the idea of falling


---------36:13----------
behind is a mental construction


---------36:16----------
it's not actually a real thing now i


---------36:19----------
mean there's some reality to it because


---------36:20----------
do you need like a good resume so that


---------36:22----------
people will listen to you sure


---------36:25----------
i'm not disputing that but you need to


---------36:27----------
be like fluid


---------36:28----------
in the way that you achieve your goal


---------36:32----------
and like if if you don't if you have a


---------36:34----------
3.79 the question


---------36:36----------
and if by all means go for the 3.9 like


---------36:38----------
work your ass off


---------36:40----------
study really hard learn how to study


---------36:42----------
because your friend learned how to study


---------36:43----------
when he was 15


---------36:44----------
or 12 and you like missed that part


---------36:47----------
right


---------36:50----------
i missed it too and and this is where


---------36:54----------
like i


---------36:54----------
i also think you don't you don't have to


---------36:56----------
be big


---------36:57----------
this is another big common misconception


---------36:59----------
like the most gratifying work that i do


---------37:02----------
isn't with like huge numbers well it's


---------37:05----------
not most it's all about even


---------37:07----------
but like this is why you know why do we


---------37:09----------
do this like i'm talking to you man


---------37:11----------
like what i care about is like talking


---------37:13----------
to one person at a time i


---------37:15----------
have to talk to thousands of people


---------37:16----------
that's not actually what's fun it's


---------37:18----------
talking to you like i want to help you


---------37:21----------
and whether the internet is watching or


---------37:23----------
not watching there may be an objective


---------37:24----------
difference in terms of the impact that i


---------37:26----------
make


---------37:27----------
but it doesn't that's why we stream but


---------37:30----------
like at the end of the day whether


---------37:31----------
in my office or we're on the internet


---------37:32----------
like it feels good either way dude it's


---------37:34----------
very fulfilling either way


---------37:36----------
does that make sense yep


---------37:40----------
it's yeah yeah i'm just i'm just like


---------37:42----------
processing everything you're saying and


---------37:44----------
i yeah i'm just like because every time


---------37:47----------
you try to talk right and sometimes


---------37:48----------
like my mind will like shoot up so i'll


---------37:50----------
just like try to notice it immediately


---------37:52----------
then like


---------37:52----------
it just goes and then you go to the next


---------37:54----------
point it comes up there i'll just like


---------37:55----------
notice it so just try my best


---------37:57----------
yeah it's just yeah i'm just thinking


---------37:59----------
because like uh you took


---------38:00----------
like uh so if i can't remember a lot of


---------38:02----------
information because i'm just trying to


---------38:04----------
like process it all


---------38:05----------
it's just um like you tell me like okay


---------38:07----------
dude you just


---------38:08----------
for example i give you like the example


---------38:10----------
like you told me like like studying


---------38:12----------
right i learned how to study and i i


---------38:13----------
have learned how to study actually


---------38:14----------
study quite well learn how to study


---------38:15----------
quite well because of the guides that


---------38:17----------
you put out


---------38:18----------
and uh but the thing is sometimes like


---------38:21----------
they they still get like it's still like


---------38:23----------
a plus or it's still like uh


---------38:25----------
stuff like so i think like something


---------38:26----------
like yeah still comparing where i think


---------38:29----------
like


---------38:29----------
oh if i do what you tell me to do i'll


---------38:32----------
i'll get the result that i want but it


---------38:35----------
doesn't add up


---------38:36----------
yeah so so and and that's that's where i


---------38:39----------
mean i i think you kind of like


---------38:41----------
like you know you're like you're going


---------38:42----------
to tell people some someday


---------38:44----------
right like let go of the result yeah


---------38:47----------
and and and that's where it's it's hard


---------38:49----------
man like don't get me wrong it's hard


---------38:51----------
but like you're you know you're growing


---------38:53----------
you're not in your final form yet


---------38:57----------
and and you know i i can try to reassure


---------38:59----------
you i think that's not going to work


---------39:01----------
very well like it's only going to work


---------39:02----------
so much but it's like


---------39:03----------
you know i mean you just you just never


---------39:06----------
know what's going to happen


---------39:07----------
like you just never know so i think


---------39:10----------
building a plan


---------39:11----------
so and this is i mean it's not really


---------39:13----------
your fault because you know you probably


---------39:16----------
you have been conditioned right your


---------39:18----------
mind has been taught


---------39:21----------
that unless you do a b c and d in this


---------39:24----------
order


---------39:25----------
you will not succeed that there's a


---------39:28----------
formula for success


---------39:31----------
right and you're you're not living up to


---------39:34----------
snuff therefore you will not succeed and


---------39:36----------
when like


---------39:38----------
90 of people are telling you that of


---------39:40----------
course you're gonna feel that way


---------39:44----------
yep and and this is where it's kind of


---------39:47----------
weird but like if you're talking about


---------39:49----------
you know changing policy like you have


---------39:50----------
to be the example


---------39:52----------
like you can't be you know like


---------39:57----------
you know like yeah yeah dude exactly


---------39:59----------
that is exactly why like i'm trying to


---------40:01----------
like


---------40:02----------
that's why like that's what i'm trying


---------40:03----------
to like buff myself up i mean i'm trying


---------40:05----------
to like make sure that i don't have any


---------40:06----------
of these kind of problems you know


---------40:08----------
because like okay like like uh yeah it's


---------40:11----------
just like


---------40:11----------
like this i'm trying to improve improve


---------40:13----------
improvement so that i can be the best


---------40:15----------
version so that i can help people you


---------40:16----------
know so that so that i don't have to


---------40:18----------
like


---------40:18----------
do this interview with you so you can


---------40:20----------
help me you know i'm saying


---------40:22----------
yeah so and this is where i mean i got


---------40:24----------
to tell you man like


---------40:26----------
that's the whole thing is like wrong


---------40:30----------
right because like what you're trying to


---------40:31----------
like you have this artificial


---------40:32----------
construction of like


---------40:33----------
one day i'm gonna be this thing and i'm


---------40:35----------
gonna be fixed


---------40:37----------
and once i'm fixed then i'm gonna go out


---------40:39----------
and i'm gonna help the world like it's


---------40:40----------
not how it works man like


---------40:43----------
you're never fixed you just gotta do the


---------40:45----------
work that you gotta do like there's no


---------40:47----------
like fixed is not a thing


---------40:51----------
right like the world may tell you it's a


---------40:53----------
thing like the world will


---------40:55----------
absolutely tell you that this is what a


---------40:57----------
fixed person looks like


---------41:02----------
and we can we our mind has been


---------41:04----------
conditioned towards that


---------41:06----------
but i think jt like honestly i think


---------41:08----------
you're doing great we'll we'll get to


---------41:10----------
some of the other emotional stuff in a


---------41:11----------
second but like i think you're doing


---------41:12----------
like you're doing the most that you can


---------41:14----------
which is great which is perfect


---------41:17----------
and this is where like i think you're


---------41:18----------
living your karma like you just weren't


---------41:20----------
born with like you know a high level of


---------41:23----------
conscientiousness it sounds like do you


---------41:25----------
know what that means


---------41:26----------
like the five factorial stuff yeah


---------41:29----------
yeah right so like some of us are just


---------41:31----------
not born with i wasn't born with a high


---------41:32----------
level of conscientiousness either either


---------41:34----------
i still


---------41:34----------
sort of don't have one which is fine


---------41:36----------
like you can still be successful


---------41:38----------
the problem is that the world believes


---------41:40----------
that a particular kind of person


---------41:42----------
is success but it's been my


---------41:45----------
overwhelming experience that


---------41:49----------
if you play the game like if you watch


---------41:52----------
someone who's like playing like let's


---------41:53----------
say wow


---------41:54----------
okay what do you play by the way uh


---------41:58----------
i read league of legends uh monster


---------42:00----------
until uh


---------42:03----------
okay all right so so like let's say like


---------42:05----------
overwatch right so like


---------42:06----------
if if i'm watching someone who's like an


---------42:08----------
awesome tracer


---------42:10----------
right and i'm like they're like giving


---------42:12----------
everyone right and left


---------42:14----------
and then i'm reinhardt and i try to play


---------42:17----------
a tracer style game and i keep losing


---------42:19----------
i'm like oh i need to like


---------42:21----------
i need to be faster right i don't know


---------42:24----------
why it's not working


---------42:26----------
so your friend is like tracer and you're


---------42:28----------
like reinhardt you just have to play who


---------42:30----------
you are


---------42:32----------
right and and i know it sounds kind of


---------42:33----------
weird because the world is going to tell


---------42:35----------
you like it's it's like back to like i


---------42:36----------
don't know if you watch pro overwatch


---------42:38----------
but


---------42:38----------
you remember back when there was like


---------42:39----------
the three tank meta


---------42:41----------
yep goats right so like like like so


---------42:44----------
like like the meta right now in


---------42:46----------
singapore is like a three tank meta


---------42:48----------
and you're trying to play a dps and so


---------42:51----------
you can look at the meta and you can say


---------42:53----------
this is what success is because that's


---------42:56----------
what the meta is the meta is the


---------42:57----------
meritocracy


---------42:58----------
you do this you do this you do this you


---------43:00----------
do this you do this


---------43:01----------
but over time the meta evolves and how


---------43:04----------
does a meta evolve


---------43:06----------
jt no


---------43:10----------
like i just i just


---------43:12----------
i went up because i would say i'm gonna


---------43:14----------
say like buff patches you know like


---------43:15----------
the the the company but then the company


---------43:17----------
means the government that means the


---------43:18----------
government


---------43:19----------
is they can change stuff and stuff like


---------43:20----------
that you're right


---------43:22----------
so the meta can change through policy


---------43:24----------
which means back to your original plan


---------43:26----------
you have to do really good someone has


---------43:27----------
to change something somewhere not so but


---------43:29----------
the meta doesn't only change due to buff


---------43:32----------
patches


---------43:34----------
how did the goats meta evolve that


---------43:37----------
wasn't through a patch


---------43:46----------
like reducing the champions ability so i


---------43:49----------
i i


---------43:49----------
so the point i'm making is that like


---------43:51----------
sure something got nerfed right but it's


---------43:53----------
a combination


---------43:55----------
of buffs uh patches plus player


---------43:58----------
innovation


---------43:59----------
because like it's not like someone you


---------44:01----------
know the patch happened and then


---------44:03----------
immediately people were like oh let's


---------44:05----------
start playing three tanks


---------44:07----------
someone was like oh let me try


---------44:10----------
something differently


---------44:11----------
based on the circumstance of the world


---------44:15----------
and then something becomes op but that


---------44:18----------
openness


---------44:19----------
is the circumstance that the world


---------44:21----------
creates


---------44:23----------
followed by the innovation of thinking


---------44:25----------
differently thinking outside of the box


---------44:30----------
so like let me say no


---------44:33----------
wait for like to like revolve around me


---------44:36----------
no


---------44:36----------
dude so this is what i'm saying so if


---------44:37----------
you look at healthy gamer's story


---------44:39----------
like the world was what it was right and


---------44:42----------
we innovated


---------44:43----------
within the balance balance patch system


---------44:46----------
of like the government


---------44:50----------
so like there was like and like


---------44:51----------
literally there's like policy stuff that


---------44:53----------
matters here so we've like


---------44:54----------
talked to attorneys and like things like


---------44:56----------
that we've said can we stream we talked


---------44:58----------
to twitch and we were like


---------44:59----------
i'm a psychiatrist can i talk to people


---------45:01----------
on the is that allowed


---------45:02----------
in the rules will the government can i


---------45:05----------
do this i talk to people


---------45:07----------
in like you know the medical community


---------45:09----------
and i'm like i have a license like what


---------45:10----------
do you guys think am i allowed to do


---------45:12----------
this


---------45:13----------
and then we innovated the point is


---------45:17----------
and now everyone's like you


---------45:20----------
you now you're just playing meta decks


---------45:22----------
you're like oh i'm going to be like dr k


---------45:24----------
now like following my meadow is my


---------45:25----------
innovation


---------45:27----------
but that's that's how the meta evolves


---------45:31----------
mm-hmm right so and this is where where


---------45:33----------
it's kind of weird but like i think that


---------45:34----------
the part of the thing and i know this


---------45:36----------
sounds


---------45:37----------
i'm going to say something kind of


---------45:38----------
random so i was once in a class that


---------45:40----------
looked at


---------45:41----------
nobel prize winning papers in biology


---------45:45----------
okay so all we did in the class was we


---------45:48----------
read


---------45:48----------
12 papers that won the nobel prize


---------45:51----------
like 12 experiments and the really


---------45:54----------
fascinating thing is like


---------45:55----------
like the you know what it takes to win a


---------45:57----------
nobel prize


---------45:59----------
is to like think off meta


---------46:03----------
that's like literally what it takes to


---------46:04----------
win a nobel prize


---------46:06----------
the whole meta is one way


---------46:09----------
and then someone is like oh wait


---------46:13----------
let me think off meta instead of doing


---------46:15----------
everything the way that things have been


---------46:17----------
done before


---------46:18----------
i'm gonna try something different


---------46:24----------
and so like that's what it takes to win


---------46:25----------
a nobel prize


---------46:28----------
so there's a part of you that's like


---------46:29----------
trying to chase


---------46:32----------
like what everyone else is doing


---------46:35----------
and that's fine for the plebs


---------46:41----------
right but like if you if you really want


---------46:43----------
to make an impact in the world


---------46:46----------
i think you've got to step away from


---------46:48----------
like what you


---------46:49----------
like forget about what you want to


---------46:51----------
accomplish


---------46:52----------
and just like focus on who you are and


---------46:54----------
where you are


---------46:56----------
and then like opportunities will come


---------46:58----------
like you'll have you know like it'll


---------46:59----------
click


---------47:00----------
i'm not worried about that for you it's


---------47:03----------
just about


---------47:03----------
convincing you that like you can just


---------47:05----------
like be who you are


---------47:07----------
and i i don't know how else to say it


---------47:08----------
because i think we've already said this


---------47:10----------
but like


---------47:10----------
i wouldn't be who i am without the


---------47:12----------
failure like it's such a


---------47:14----------
it's just as important as the harvard


---------47:17----------
what do you mean by like be who you are


---------47:19----------
like like or just accept that you are


---------47:21----------
like this like what does that mean


---------47:22----------
that's a good question so i think


---------47:24----------
especially in meritocrac


---------47:26----------
uh societies like singapore india is the


---------47:28----------
same way


---------47:29----------
everyone's like what the hell does that


---------47:31----------
even mean


---------47:33----------
right because like all we're taught is


---------47:35----------
like what we should be


---------47:38----------
does that make sense yeah


---------47:43----------
let me just think about how to answer


---------47:45----------
that because it's hard


---------47:47----------
oh sorry no no it's it's it's the most


---------47:50----------
important question um


---------47:56----------
so you know what you want to be right


---------48:01----------
yep what are you


---------48:05----------
i'm just a polytechnic student


---------48:08----------
yeah i'm just student and honey i'm not


---------48:11----------
there


---------48:13----------
no i'll get there i i just gotta like


---------48:16----------
keep this pace and if and


---------48:19----------
not up yeah so so i i think that's


---------48:23----------
actually like a pretty good answer so


---------48:24----------
like


---------48:25----------
you know islam is there's some emotion


---------48:28----------
there what's that


---------48:30----------
you feeling some emotion no not really


---------48:33----------
sorry okay no no so i i think that the


---------48:36----------
more that you kind of accept


---------48:38----------
that i'm a polytechnic student i i would


---------48:40----------
be a little bit careful about the word


---------48:41----------
just right so you said i'm just a


---------48:45----------
polytech


---------48:46----------
that's just what you are it's not better


---------48:48----------
or worse


---------48:49----------
than anything else which i know sounds


---------48:51----------
weird in a meritocracy society


---------48:53----------
but like i know it sounds weird but like


---------48:55----------
you can't be


---------48:56----------
anything but what you are


---------49:00----------
like how tall are you jt right


---------49:03----------
172 cm uh five foot eight okay


---------49:06----------
can you be five foot ten


---------49:09----------
uh with the proper shoes okay okay


---------49:13----------
can you can you be no no it's a good


---------49:15----------
answer can you be five foot six


---------49:18----------
uh i don't know right so like


---------49:22----------
so like when you when you go and buy


---------49:24----------
clothing


---------49:25----------
do you buy clothing for people who are


---------49:28----------
six foot


---------49:29----------
or five foot


---------49:32----------
um like yeah i guess like my size or


---------49:36----------
like maybe a little bit bigger


---------49:37----------
yeah right and so but what if you want


---------49:39----------
to be six foot


---------49:42----------
what if i came to united jt so imagine


---------49:44----------
you succeeded in your goal


---------49:46----------
and one day i come to you and i say i'm


---------49:48----------
five foot five


---------49:49----------
and i want to be six feet so i keep on


---------49:52----------
buying six foot clothing


---------49:56----------
and then why do you want to be six foot


---------49:59----------
all right because


---------50:00----------
six foot is better than five foot and


---------50:02----------
it's what i want to be so i'm i'm gonna


---------50:04----------
move towards that


---------50:07----------
uh


---------50:11----------
okay i'm just noticing the the metaphors


---------50:13----------
they're using and how it applies to me


---------50:16----------
so explain that it's just it's


---------50:19----------
a different ball game it's just a


---------50:21----------
different game you can't


---------50:23----------
be this thing because you're just on


---------50:25----------
that thing


---------50:26----------
or like you actually have to like show


---------50:28----------
appreciation that


---------50:29----------
the piper is not a bad thing you know


---------50:32----------
like you stupid


---------50:32----------
there's no things that you can't do but


---------50:34----------
like like women like dudes who are


---------50:36----------
taller so let's be


---------50:37----------
let's be clear right well let's just


---------50:39----------
assume that for a second i don't know


---------50:40----------
that's actually true but like


---------50:42----------
that's the way a lot of dudes think


---------50:43----------
right so even if we say that six foot is


---------50:45----------
better than five foot five


---------50:48----------
they're like there's studies that show


---------50:49----------
that height is correlated to


---------50:52----------
corporate advancement so the likelihood


---------50:55----------
of you being a ceo


---------50:56----------
is seems to be correlated with how tall


---------50:58----------
you are so let's even say that it's


---------51:00----------
better to be six foot than five five


---------51:05----------
what then uh


---------51:08----------
[Music]


---------51:11----------
i don't know there's like nothing you


---------51:12----------
can do actually because they're so


---------51:13----------
insistent on wanting to


---------51:15----------
be this thing even though they can't


---------51:18----------
okay sorry right so so so


---------51:21----------
and here's the thing is like if you want


---------51:23----------
to succeed right let's say i'm


---------51:24----------
a five foot five dude and i want to find


---------51:27----------
a girlfriend


---------51:28----------
then dressing in six foot clothing


---------51:32----------
is not gonna help


---------51:35----------
right i have to play to my strengths


---------51:39----------
like like if it's the goats meadow like


---------51:44----------
we're gonna get three tanks like and


---------51:45----------
forget about tracer like who cares


---------51:47----------
but we don't need a tracer right play to


---------51:50----------
your strengths


---------51:51----------
that's what it means to be who you are


---------51:53----------
is you may objectively be worse than


---------51:55----------
your friend like


---------51:56----------
i i know it's kind of weird but like we


---------51:58----------
live in this society where we say like


---------52:00----------
everyone's equal like no they're not


---------52:02----------
like does every human being have


---------52:05----------
is any human being worth more than


---------52:07----------
another human being no


---------52:09----------
i mean yes sorry wait wait hold on i'm


---------52:11----------
getting confused i think


---------52:12----------
in terms of intrinsic value they're


---------52:14----------
we're all the same


---------52:15----------
but in terms of like capability like


---------52:17----------
we're not


---------52:20----------
right like some people are just like


---------52:22----------
better at basketball


---------52:23----------
like some people are just like more


---------52:25----------
successful at life


---------52:28----------
and i think that like if you're someone


---------52:30----------
who's fallen behind


---------52:32----------
accepting that is the way that you


---------52:35----------
really start to shine


---------52:38----------
like you can still have a wonderful


---------52:40----------
loving relationship if you're five foot


---------52:41----------
five


---------52:42----------
you just have to stop worrying about


---------52:44----------
being six foot and just play to your


---------52:46----------
strengths and i think you'll be fine


---------52:49----------
you can still be a ceo at five foot


---------52:51----------
seven even though


---------52:53----------
height apparently is an advantage but


---------52:55----------
you just have to accept that like you're


---------52:57----------
playing life with a handicap


---------53:00----------
you can still win but as long as you


---------53:03----------
like


---------53:03----------
pretend to live a life where you're not


---------53:06----------
handicapped


---------53:07----------
and you get so caught up with the


---------53:08----------
handicap that you forget about the game


---------53:15----------
um what's your mind saying now


---------53:19----------
that um okay so like


---------53:22----------
you know like there's like peter kapha


---------53:24----------
and right so like i'm very pita right so


---------53:26----------
like


---------53:26----------
like uh like so you you mentioned like


---------53:29----------
many times like these


---------53:30----------
peta people are just like the ordinary


---------53:32----------
like just the average


---------53:34----------
kind of people right in terms of


---------53:35----------
statistics in class or whatever


---------53:37----------
and like the thing is like if i were to


---------53:39----------
like


---------53:40----------
play to my strengths like many people


---------53:42----------
are like average and stuff like that so


---------53:44----------
like how can i play to my average


---------53:45----------
strength


---------53:47----------
like if i want to like innovation and


---------53:49----------
like must be powerful right like in


---------53:51----------
terms of how you counter the ghost


---------53:52----------
method it must be


---------53:53----------
stronger than that meta right so how can


---------53:56----------
average


---------53:56----------
sorry sorry i'm putting down myself but


---------53:58----------
like in a way but like


---------54:00----------
like how can average stats be better


---------54:02----------
than like other statistics


---------54:04----------
so it's a good question so let's like


---------54:06----------
answer it in a weird way okay the first


---------54:08----------
thing is that


---------54:09----------
the reason you're average is because


---------54:11----------
it's an


---------54:12----------
amalgamation of different qualities


---------54:16----------
your total stat pool may be average


---------54:19----------
but there are some things that you're


---------54:20----------
going to be better at so one thing i'm


---------54:22----------
already noticing is you have a very


---------54:24----------
very high level of self-awareness


---------54:27----------
of awareness of your internal


---------54:28----------
environment you're like in the top one


---------54:30----------
to five percent of people i've ever


---------54:31----------
talked to


---------54:34----------
so like your problem is that you think


---------54:36----------
that like okay but how does that help if


---------54:38----------
i can't change it


---------54:39----------
which is a good question i haven't quite


---------54:42----------
figured that out yet


---------54:45----------
but i i would say that the thing that


---------54:46----------
makes me the thing that i'm really good


---------54:48----------
at


---------54:49----------
is also self-awareness like that's the


---------54:52----------
thing that i'm really the best at


---------54:54----------
and so if we think about my ability to


---------54:56----------
work with people like my ability


---------54:57----------
will work with people is all based on a


---------55:00----------
very very careful analysis of myself


---------55:05----------
the problem is that this is the kind of


---------55:07----------
thing that is not easily translatable


---------55:09----------
into external success like it took me a


---------55:13----------
while to


---------55:14----------
craft my life to be suited


---------55:17----------
to myself but i was able to craft it


---------55:22----------
because i was aware of what i was


---------55:25----------
does that make sense it's like playing


---------55:27----------
the long game definitely


---------55:29----------
because the world is not you have to


---------55:31----------
like craft the meta of your life


---------55:33----------
to suit your internal characteristics


---------55:38----------
my mind is telling me like oh my god i


---------55:40----------
gotta wait again


---------55:42----------
i don't like like uh like i just scared


---------55:46----------
that crafting is gonna take so long


---------55:49----------
yeah yeah yeah you know


---------55:52----------
yeah and so go ahead


---------55:55----------
yeah i'll just go behind further but if


---------55:58----------
i can okay if i try to innovate because


---------56:00----------
because like oh yeah because when you


---------56:01----------
mention like innovation i've always


---------56:02----------
tried to do that in terms of my projects


---------56:04----------
and assessments that they give


---------56:05----------
i always try to innovate but when i


---------56:07----------
innovate i get like


---------56:08----------
b pluses but and if i stick to the meta


---------56:10----------
i get like a's


---------56:11----------
so like so i'm like so scared now


---------56:13----------
because like if i try to innovate in


---------56:15----------
like that in that context as well i'm


---------56:17----------
scared that it won't work out


---------56:19----------
sure yeah no i mean that that's that's


---------56:22----------
the problem right that's the problem


---------56:23----------
with changing the meta


---------56:25----------
is that most people who try to change


---------56:26----------
the meta fail


---------56:34----------
oh this isn't like okay as in like


---------56:37----------
because if i fail take


---------56:38----------
it will take longer and i'll just have


---------56:39----------
to try try again okay so now we see


---------56:42----------
something really important now we're


---------56:43----------
actually going to help you okay


---------56:44----------
the rest of it was for everyone else but


---------56:46----------
do you see how no matter what i say


---------56:49----------
we're coming back to this yep yep i see


---------56:52----------
it


---------56:53----------
okay so so now the question is what


---------56:57----------
so how long have you felt like you're


---------57:00----------
falling be


---------57:00----------
uh let me put it this way actually it's


---------57:02----------
it's interesting because it's not just


---------57:04----------
falling behind i think we've actually


---------57:05----------
stumbled upon something else


---------57:06----------
how long have you felt like you can't


---------57:08----------
afford to fail


---------57:13----------
only recently actually or like maybe


---------57:16----------
it's like more prominent


---------57:17----------
when i actually when i actually got into


---------57:20----------
the second year college right


---------57:21----------
when i got when i got to do what i


---------57:23----------
wanted that was when i realized oh


---------57:26----------
crap yo like the universe has given me


---------57:29----------
something


---------57:30----------
and i'm gonna take it so i'm gonna use


---------57:32----------
it properly and i'll use this


---------57:33----------
like rng like 0.1 percent like luck that


---------57:37----------
i have and use it good


---------57:38----------
because i'm so unlucky that i'll never


---------57:40----------
like even in games i'm always very


---------57:42----------
unlucky so like


---------57:43----------
if i even when i get 0.1 i got to use it


---------57:45----------
to like the fullest potential if not


---------57:47----------
like i'm just wasting that you know


---------57:48----------
jt did you feel more


---------57:52----------
did you feel like you were more behind


---------57:54----------
before you got into polytechnic or after


---------57:56----------
you got into polytechnic


---------58:00----------
so how do you understand that because


---------58:03----------
um i guess in uh like in idea i was


---------58:07----------
still like


---------58:08----------
uh like i i didn't really care as to


---------58:11----------
what kind of direction i was going


---------58:13----------
it didn't mean that well i i mean my


---------58:14----------
grades were still okay like 3.56


---------58:16----------
but like um only when


---------58:21----------
i got into yeah only when i go into poly


---------58:23----------
there's many changes


---------58:25----------
so let's think about that what would you


---------58:28----------
expect


---------58:30----------
if you've fallen behind and you take a


---------58:32----------
step forward


---------58:33----------
would you expect that person to feel


---------58:35----------
like they're catching up


---------58:38----------
slowly yes right right yep but how did


---------58:42----------
you feel


---------58:42----------
when you got into polytechnic


---------58:46----------
um in terms of catching up uh


---------58:52----------
i was


---------58:56----------
okay sorry i'm just trying to fight my


---------58:57----------
my my inner thought because i'm like no


---------58:59----------
just just just just shut up yeah it's


---------59:02----------
it's like that was when i realized that


---------59:05----------
oh my


---------59:06----------
god i'm so far behind again or like i


---------59:09----------
like further behind i thought


---------59:11----------
okay so


---------59:15----------
you feel like you're super far behind


---------59:17----------
right oh my god the


---------59:19----------
the ipad of truth of knowledge


---------59:23----------
okay i used to watch your online


---------59:25----------
webinars with this so cool


---------59:27----------
okay hold on here's here's the problem


---------59:30----------
okay


---------59:30----------
so now let's say i'm


---------59:33----------
let me think about this okay so let's


---------59:35----------
say


---------59:36----------
um let me think about what these axes


---------59:40----------
are


---------59:41----------
so feeling


---------59:44----------
of falling behind


---------59:49----------
okay and progress


---------59:54----------
all right does that make sense


---------59:58----------
yes okay i see it so if we were to say


---------60:01----------
like let's say i'm behind right so my


---------60:03----------
progress is really low


---------60:05----------
and so how far behind do i feel do i


---------60:07----------
feel really far behind or do i feel not


---------60:10----------
very far behind


---------60:12----------
like fall behind i guess right so this


---------60:15----------
is where i am does that make sense


---------60:17----------
yeah i feel super super bad because i


---------60:19----------
haven't made any progress


---------60:21----------
and then as i make progress what should


---------60:24----------
happen to my feeling of falling behind


---------60:28----------
it should go lower right yes


---------60:34----------
with me right and then at some point


---------60:37----------
we're going to even cross the x-axis


---------60:40----------
this is what the curve should look like


---------60:43----------
okay so now let's talk about u


---------60:48----------
so let's call this


---------60:52----------
ide and let's call this polytechnic


---------60:58----------
okay when you were


---------61:01----------
at ide is ite sorry


---------61:06----------
yeah my bad okay i-t-e


---------61:10----------
so when you were it let's just start you


---------61:12----------
in the middle okay


---------61:14----------
how far behind did you feel when you


---------61:16----------
went to polytechnic


---------61:19----------
or increased


---------61:23----------
right so what can we deduce


---------61:27----------
about as you make progress how are you


---------61:29----------
going to feel


---------61:32----------
oh good sorry it's just going to stay


---------61:35----------
out


---------61:36----------
it's going to peak and gonna continue


---------61:38----------
forever


---------61:39----------
so i know this sounds kind of weird but


---------61:41----------
how far behind do you feel


---------61:43----------
right now where are you over here


---------61:48----------
right like let's say you're like over


---------61:50----------
here


---------61:52----------
but what what this means is along this


---------61:54----------
line the higher up you go on this axis


---------61:56----------
the worse you're going to feel i mean


---------61:59----------
like like


---------62:00----------
do you see like it's weird because it's


---------62:01----------
the opposite so what we can almost infer


---------62:04----------
is that the more behind you feel


---------62:07----------
the better you're doing


---------62:13----------
now i know i know it doesn't make any


---------62:14----------
sense but i'm just asking you to be


---------62:16----------
scientific i'll explain why in a second


---------62:19----------
why this happens but this is really


---------62:21----------
important for you to understand


---------62:24----------
this is why you were terrified and i am


---------62:26----------
not


---------62:28----------
because i understand this is what your


---------62:29----------
curve looks like


---------62:31----------
and that the higher up you go on over


---------62:33----------
here


---------62:34----------
actually what i'm paying attention to is


---------62:36----------
this and i see this for sure


---------62:38----------
that's why i'm not worried bro i'm


---------62:40----------
really not


---------62:41----------
the problem is this is the way that your


---------62:43----------
mind interprets progress


---------62:48----------
now we're gonna explain why this happens


---------62:51----------
but like does does this make sense to


---------62:53----------
you


---------62:54----------
yep it does okay so


---------63:00----------
now let's explain it okay i'm gonna


---------63:03----------
uh i'm gonna stop sharing okay we're


---------63:05----------
gonna go back


---------63:06----------
so it's a it's a really common problem


---------63:09----------
okay


---------63:11----------
uh and then i know i know it sounds


---------63:13----------
weird but


---------63:15----------
so when you're in


---------63:19----------
when you were at ite right you weren't


---------63:22----------
actually playing the game


---------63:24----------
yep that was it so it's impossible to be


---------63:28----------
behind


---------63:28----------
when you play when you're not playing


---------63:30----------
the game it's like


---------63:32----------
can't be behind if you're not you're not


---------63:34----------
trying


---------63:35----------
and so this is the really dangerous


---------63:37----------
thing about feeling like you've fallen


---------63:39----------
behind


---------63:40----------
as you start to catch up you begin to


---------63:43----------
realize like so if i'm at the bottom of


---------63:45----------
a mountain


---------63:46----------
and i'm not gonna climb it like i don't


---------63:49----------
have very far to go


---------63:51----------
there's a ten thousand foot mountain i'm


---------63:52----------
sitting at the bottom like yeah i'm just


---------63:54----------
gonna play games all day


---------63:56----------
like i don't i'm not gonna i don't need


---------63:58----------
to climb the mountain like it i


---------63:59----------
don't need a gold i'm just chilling


---------64:02----------
screw that like sure you're filled with


---------64:03----------
shame and stuff you're playing video


---------64:04----------
games all day


---------64:05----------
there's a land center that's at the base


---------64:07----------
of the mountain you're just kind of


---------64:08----------
hanging out there


---------64:09----------
it's no big deal something dangerous


---------64:12----------
really happens


---------64:12----------
as you start climbing the mountain then


---------64:15----------
you begin to realize oh crap


---------64:19----------
once you climb a thousand feet then you


---------64:21----------
look up and you say oh i have nine


---------64:23----------
thousand feet to go so this is really


---------64:26----------
really tricky


---------64:28----------
but if you have this some scar of


---------64:31----------
falling behind


---------64:32----------
as you make progress success


---------64:35----------
makes it harder


---------64:39----------
actually making progress makes the


---------64:41----------
mental feeling


---------64:42----------
so much worse it's really paradoxical


---------64:45----------
but once you understand it actually


---------64:46----------
makes perfect sense


---------64:48----------
we did an interview like over a year ago


---------64:50----------
with a guy named crucif


---------64:52----------
that i think is a really fantastic


---------64:54----------
interview i don't know if it's on our


---------64:55----------
youtube channel


---------64:56----------
but crucif is a guy who is really


---------64:57----------
overweight and he was like falling


---------65:00----------
behind like he was like


---------65:01----------
stuck in a lot of ways and he had this


---------65:03----------
really interesting thing where like he


---------65:05----------
would


---------65:07----------
like dig really deep fight his inner


---------65:09----------
demons and then would like start to lose


---------65:11----------
weight


---------65:12----------
and he would do good for a week or two


---------65:15----------
and then like


---------65:15----------
at the two-week point he felt like


---------65:18----------
really really bad


---------65:20----------
and we we almost called it like a rubber


---------65:22----------
band like he was attached to something


---------65:24----------
like with


---------65:24----------
with like a rubber band and then he


---------65:26----------
would run away from it


---------65:28----------
and the farther he ran away from it the


---------65:30----------
increase


---------65:31----------
the tension of the rubber band and he


---------65:32----------
would come snapping right back


---------65:35----------
does that make sense yep and so that's


---------65:38----------
kind of like what you're doing too is


---------65:40----------
like as you're actually making progress


---------65:42----------
in a weird way you feel like you're


---------65:44----------
falling behind


---------65:46----------
more and more and more and more


---------65:50----------
because now that you're in polytechnic


---------65:52----------
what do you do


---------65:53----------
you compare yourself to your friend


---------65:57----------
but when you were in ite you weren't


---------65:59----------
comparing yourself to him as much


---------66:02----------
and then what happens is like let's say


---------66:04----------
you get into university


---------66:06----------
and if you're not careful


---------66:09----------
and like you used to compare yourself to


---------66:11----------
the people in university


---------66:12----------
right or maybe but then once you become


---------66:15----------
one of them


---------66:16----------
you're going to find something else to


---------66:18----------
compare yourself to and then


---------66:20----------
as you move on you're going to find


---------66:21----------
something else even when you start


---------66:23----------
making policy


---------66:24----------
and you are have the same job title as


---------66:27----------
your friend


---------66:28----------
you're going to find someone else to


---------66:29----------
make a comparison to


---------66:33----------
this is why people like i'll work with


---------66:34----------
people in investment banking it's really


---------66:36----------
common in banking


---------66:38----------
because they get a promotion and they


---------66:39----------
want to get the next promotion you want


---------66:40----------
to get the next promotion you want to


---------66:41----------
get the next promotion


---------66:43----------
that feeling of falling behind jt you


---------66:45----------
carry


---------66:46----------
within you and your mind will find


---------66:49----------
whatever kind of comparison it needs to


---------66:52----------
make


---------66:52----------
it'll find like you know thousands of


---------66:54----------
people


---------66:56----------
why do you compare yourself to this


---------66:58----------
friend


---------67:00----------
because it reinforces the feeling of


---------67:02----------
falling behind


---------67:05----------
the feeling of falling behind is its own


---------67:07----------
entity


---------67:10----------
that will push aside any data


---------67:15----------
that makes it feel weak


---------67:18----------
and will latch on to any data that makes


---------67:21----------
it feel validated


---------67:24----------
does that make sense yep


---------67:27----------
they're just discrediting like my


---------67:28----------
achievements and just uh focusing on my


---------67:31----------
negatives and what you improve on


---------67:33----------
yeah yeah you do that right yeah


---------67:37----------
right so so so like you can and


---------67:40----------
yeah sorry yeah go ahead no no isn't it


---------67:44----------
because


---------67:44----------
because like i i i always thought that


---------67:46----------
it wasn't like a bad thing that i'm


---------67:48----------
trying to make improvement because i


---------67:49----------
always draw them down on my phone like


---------67:50----------
what i'm supposed to improve on


---------67:52----------
i yeah i don't know i guess i didn't


---------67:54----------
know it was like


---------67:56----------
male adaptive so so it it's not a bad


---------67:59----------
thing the question


---------68:00----------
so all of these things jt in your mind


---------68:02----------
are not bad


---------68:03----------
the only thing that's bad is is who is


---------68:06----------
in control


---------68:08----------
so like i'm not saying you should stop


---------68:10----------
trying to improve like


---------68:12----------
you should absolutely try to improve the


---------68:14----------
question is


---------68:15----------
is that desire for improvement coming


---------68:18----------
from a place of this is what i need to


---------68:20----------
do to catch up


---------68:22----------
or is it an improve is it about


---------68:26----------
is this what i need to do next right


---------68:28----------
these are two very different things so


---------68:30----------
i'm i'm gonna


---------68:31----------
bust out the ipad one more time okay so


---------68:34----------
now like here's the tricky thing


---------68:36----------
so right now when you think about


---------68:39----------
improvement


---------68:40----------
there are two ways to think about


---------68:42----------
improvement okay


---------68:44----------
one is a goal focus so this is like the


---------68:46----------
future


---------68:48----------
this is your goal this is this is your


---------68:51----------
friend


---------68:53----------
so when you think about improvement are


---------68:54----------
you trying to go from here to here


---------68:57----------
because this is a this is an improvement


---------68:59----------
out of a deficiency does that make sense


---------69:02----------
yep like so improving from here to


---------69:06----------
here is fine like ask like being in the


---------69:08----------
present and saying what is one thing i


---------69:10----------
can do to


---------69:11----------
make one step forward that is present


---------69:13----------
focus this is what you're looking at


---------69:15----------
this is where i am this is who i am


---------69:20----------
this is where i am i need to you know i


---------69:22----------
i have a 3.79


---------69:25----------
and i need to make it a 3.9 that i think


---------69:28----------
is a healthy improvement


---------69:30----------
because this has to do with your goal


---------69:32----------
right this is like


---------69:33----------
where i am this is the next step that i


---------69:34----------
need to take


---------69:36----------
but if your goal depends on this over


---------69:39----------
here


---------69:39----------
if this is where you are if you're in


---------69:41----------
the future


---------69:42----------
then what you're going to create is no


---------69:44----------
matter this is the only stuff you could


---------69:46----------
take dude this is how long your leg is


---------69:47----------
right


---------69:48----------
this is your leg you can only move this


---------69:49----------
much


---------69:51----------
and if this is your goal if you move


---------69:53----------
this much


---------69:54----------
this is going to be not enough


---------69:58----------
do you understand so every step


---------70:02----------
you take what is the thought in your


---------70:05----------
mind


---------70:07----------
not enough not enough


---------70:14----------
if your mind is over here so in a


---------70:16----------
bizarre way


---------70:18----------
the more you move forward the more


---------70:20----------
behind you feel


---------70:22----------
because what is the emotion that you're


---------70:23----------
reinforcing within yourself


---------70:25----------
what is the some scar you're building


---------70:27----------
not enough


---------70:28----------
it's never enough it's never enough


---------70:32----------
even though you're making progress


---------70:35----------
so what you need to do is like i know it


---------70:37----------
sounds like this is where we got like


---------70:38----------
people say this really simple stuff like


---------70:40----------
focus on the present


---------70:41----------
like yeah i would like why how like


---------70:44----------
what's the deal with this is why this is


---------70:46----------
important


---------70:47----------
because as long as you are thinking


---------70:48----------
about your end goal of being dr k it's


---------70:51----------
never going to be enough


---------70:54----------
right jt you will never be me nor should


---------70:57----------
you try to


---------70:59----------
because like the patch like the meta and


---------71:02----------
the patches like


---------71:03----------
i arose in a particular meta that meta


---------71:06----------
is gonna change


---------71:08----------
by the time like you're ready


---------71:11----------
so you shouldn't try to be me you


---------71:12----------
shouldn't try to be your friend you


---------71:14----------
shouldn't try to be


---------71:15----------
anything really just be who you are and


---------71:18----------
focus on the next step


---------71:20----------
and recognize that even though you're


---------71:22----------
moving forward you're gonna feel


---------71:24----------
like it's not enough


---------71:28----------
but like all of that i don't know


---------71:30----------
how to say this man like it's all


---------71:32----------
wrong it's all false it's all a


---------71:34----------
construction of the mind


---------71:36----------
based on this idea of falling behind


---------71:40----------
because here's the problem is like this


---------71:42----------
is where you are


---------71:44----------
like this is where you are that's it


---------71:47----------
there's no falling behind like this is


---------71:48----------
where i am like


---------71:50----------
that's it if i say i've fallen behind


---------71:52----------
this much now i've created


---------71:54----------
an artificial construction if i've


---------71:55----------
fallen behind this much now i've created


---------71:57----------
an artificial construction


---------72:00----------
right so you're 20 years old and you're


---------72:02----------
comparing yourself like you're hanging


---------72:04----------
out with 18 year olds


---------72:05----------
so maybe like that's the gap here


---------72:09----------
okay but like it doesn't matter like all


---------72:12----------
this stuff is false like this is just


---------72:13----------
where you are if you're 20 year old


---------72:15----------
in polytechnic with a 3.79 gpa your road


---------72:19----------
forward


---------72:19----------
is absolutely the same whether you fall


---------72:22----------
in behind or not


---------72:24----------
the big difference is that one of these


---------72:27----------
things


---------72:29----------
is going to help you anytime you take a


---------72:32----------
step forward


---------72:33----------
and one of these things is going to make


---------72:34----------
you feel worse every time you


---------72:36----------
take a step forward


---------72:40----------
yep i see it


---------72:45----------
then how do i combat that that some scar


---------72:48----------
i guess or like like how do i combat


---------72:50----------
that


---------72:51----------
that that that that fear of falling


---------72:53----------
behind off or like not or telling myself


---------72:55----------
that


---------72:56----------
actually i'll just go on my own pace you


---------72:58----------
know and stuff like that


---------72:59----------
like how do i combat the fact that i


---------73:01----------
tell myself that no enough


---------73:02----------
yeah okay so so good so the answer


---------73:06----------
is you don't combat it


---------73:09----------
so what you need is not to combat


---------73:12----------
yourself


---------73:13----------
you need compassion towards yourself


---------73:17----------
so what i want you to imagine is like


---------73:18----------
you've become successful okay so you're


---------73:20----------
dr jt and there's like a 20 year old


---------73:24----------
who's going to come to you and is going


---------73:25----------
to be like dr jt


---------73:26----------
i've fallen behind and like how


---------73:30----------
what are you going to tell him like


---------73:33----------
what have you fallen behind on okay sure


---------73:36----------
yeah so like ask yourself questions


---------73:38----------
right that's good and then what


---------73:43----------
like i guess like identify what i'm


---------73:46----------
falling behind on


---------73:50----------
and whether or not that that like factor


---------73:53----------
or falling behind is


---------73:55----------
is uh changeable in any way okay so


---------73:58----------
like so like in terms of my age or like


---------74:01----------
my height or like uh


---------74:02----------
or falling behind in in grades it it's


---------74:05----------
just like


---------74:06----------
it's just that it's just that you just


---------74:09----------
have that


---------74:11----------
yep you're you're that's


---------74:21----------
yeah my mind tells me that oh my then


---------74:23----------
i'm supposed to be happy with being


---------74:26----------
this way or like but what if i want to


---------74:28----------
aim higher you know


---------74:31----------
high standards so let's


---------74:34----------
roll reversal okay


---------74:37----------
but i i'm i'm 38


---------74:40----------
and i've fallen behind dr jt


---------74:45----------
what should i do


---------74:48----------
can you help me


---------74:52----------
i uh


---------74:55----------
sorry uh i'll i'll yeah i can uh


---------75:00----------
i don't know where to start but it's


---------75:02----------
just


---------75:04----------
what have you fallen behind on or like


---------75:07----------
let's say maybe like you're too late


---------75:08----------
no no yeah so i want to be i want to be


---------75:11----------
a professional dota player


---------75:12----------
but i've wasted the last 15 years of my


---------75:15----------
life becoming a


---------75:16----------
a doctor what a waste oh sorry uh


---------75:24----------
are you like taking any steps to improve


---------75:25----------
on it in terms of


---------75:27----------
like maybe you're playing a lot and


---------75:28----------
stuff like that no i actually


---------75:30----------
uninstalled dota a week ago


---------75:34----------
oh then why do you uh what do you have


---------75:37----------
this worry about


---------75:39----------
wanting to to like what do you just


---------75:42----------
worry about


---------75:43----------
falling behind when you're not like


---------75:44----------
taking steps to improve on it


---------75:47----------
that's a really good question i i i see


---------75:49----------
like that's that's good right like


---------75:51----------
that's that's great


---------75:52----------
so like like just inquire


---------75:56----------
right like and so i i could say but i i


---------76:00----------
want to be a dota player and then you


---------76:02----------
can point out that like if you want to


---------76:04----------
be a dota like a pro dota player like


---------76:06----------
you know install dota that's the first


---------76:08----------
step


---------76:11----------
right and that's what you would tell me


---------76:12----------
to do i i mean


---------76:14----------
maybe you're going to tell me that's not


---------76:16----------
going to be possible and you can't


---------76:17----------
become a dota pro at your age which i


---------76:20----------
probably can't


---------76:21----------
yeah right so so so if you it so like if


---------76:24----------
you would tell me that then like what


---------76:25----------
would you say to me like do you think i


---------76:26----------
could become a pro dota player at my age


---------76:30----------
when there's like such a bad


---------76:31----------
psychologist slash psychiatrist if i


---------76:33----------
tell you


---------76:34----------
do not but like realistically like no


---------76:37----------
right you can't you can


---------76:39----------
you can try you can always try your best


---------76:42----------
and see how it plans out for you


---------76:43----------
you know like and then offer them like


---------76:45----------
this these ways that they can help but


---------76:46----------
like


---------76:47----------
in the end if it doesn't work out you


---------76:48----------
just have to like accept it


---------76:50----------
or like yeah yeah right so i think you


---------76:53----------
know what you have to tell yourself and


---------76:55----------
this is the kind of thing where it's


---------76:56----------
like


---------76:57----------
you know when when you when that voice


---------76:59----------
comes up and says this is not enough


---------77:02----------
what i want you to recognize is that


---------77:04----------
like that voice is a part of you but it


---------77:07----------
is not the whole


---------77:07----------
you right and so what you need


---------77:11----------
in that moment is actually like some


---------77:13----------
degree of like validation


---------77:15----------
and reish like validation and faith


---------77:18----------
actually so you can say you're right


---------77:22----------
i am behind


---------77:25----------
and i'm gonna keep moving forward anyway


---------77:27----------
i don't need to catch up


---------77:29----------
i just need to move forward


---------77:32----------
and then the voice is going to tell you


---------77:33----------
but it's never going to be enough


---------77:36----------
and so then you're going to tell the


---------77:37----------
voice you're going to say you may be


---------77:38----------
right it may never be enough


---------77:41----------
so what should we do about that


---------77:46----------
right like talk like recognize like like


---------77:48----------
what are you gonna do like so


---------77:50----------
don't argue with it be like yeah you're


---------77:51----------
right like i can never


---------77:54----------
go back in time and be 15 and learn how


---------77:56----------
to study well


---------77:58----------
and therefore i will always be


---------78:01----------
two years behind my colleagues


---------78:05----------
or four years behind my colleagues i'm


---------78:07----------
gonna be behind for the rest of my life


---------78:11----------
now what


---------78:16----------
right so yeah what is your mindset


---------78:20----------
it's not you saying nothing yeah it's


---------78:22----------
like it doesn't have an answer for it


---------78:25----------
exactly that's how you disarm it


---------78:30----------
it's weird right


---------78:34----------
yeah i always thought awareness would be


---------78:36----------
good or like just noticing they would


---------78:38----------
disappear


---------78:38----------
oh yeah no no it is good it is good


---------78:42----------
you're chipping away at it


---------78:43----------
the problem is that every time like some


---------78:45----------
battles it wins and some battles you win


---------78:48----------
awareness is helping but every time you


---------78:50----------
make that comparison every time you take


---------78:51----------
a step forward


---------78:52----------
it actually gets reinforced because you


---------78:54----------
tell yourself it's not enough it's not


---------78:55----------
enough it's not enough


---------78:57----------
so you are you are shrinking it and also


---------79:00----------
feeding it at the same time


---------79:03----------
[Music]


---------79:04----------
no wonder there was no progress see no


---------79:07----------
there was problems


---------79:09----------
yeah i mean you've come a long way dude


---------79:13----------
right because like you use it sounds


---------79:15----------
like you used to play games all day


---------79:18----------
yes like all the yeah and


---------79:21----------
how many hours a week do you play now uh


---------79:24----------
now it's the holidays so like


---------79:26----------
but like obviously like because like i


---------79:28----------
studied in the morning right so like i


---------79:30----------
started like four hours or like two


---------79:31----------
two three hours and then i was just


---------79:33----------
starting because like


---------79:34----------
my mind doesn't attack me anymore so


---------79:36----------
yeah it's good yeah


---------79:38----------
yeah man like do you do you not get like


---------79:40----------
how enviable you are


---------79:42----------
to so many people who are watching right


---------79:44----------
now like they would kill for that


---------79:48----------
yeah but suddenly oh all right my


---------79:50----------
mind's gonna discredit me again but it's


---------79:52----------
just like


---------79:52----------
i have to do that if not i don't if not


---------79:55----------
i can't because like


---------79:56----------
normal people like the way i'm starting


---------79:58----------
right now is like i'm revising the


---------80:00----------
revising so like


---------80:01----------
like i'm triple revising so that when


---------80:03----------
the revision comes i might triple revise


---------80:04----------
so that i know because i'm not that


---------80:05----------
smart right


---------80:06----------
i can only rely on my hard work like


---------80:09----------
because that's why i need that thing


---------80:10----------
other people they don't really need to


---------80:11----------
study a lot like this a little bit


---------80:13----------
advocate


---------80:14----------
but like just yeah i need to do it


---------80:18----------
yeah good i i don't think that that's


---------80:21----------
bad at all i love that statement


---------80:23----------
you need to do jt what you need to do


---------80:29----------
that's how you will be successful


---------80:32----------
i need to do it because i need to do it


---------80:34----------
other people aren't that smart who the


---------80:36----------
 cares


---------80:37----------
whether you're smarter or they're dumber


---------80:39----------
that is irrelevant


---------80:42----------
what what matters is what you need to do


---------80:46----------
and every step of the way if you want a


---------80:48----------
step-by-step guide to being dr


---------80:50----------
k it's do what you need to do and don't


---------80:53----------
worry about what anyone else is doing


---------80:56----------
like you have to play the game right


---------80:58----------
like doing what you need to do it's not


---------81:00----------
like i just wake up one day and like


---------81:02----------
here i am no like i have to you know


---------81:04----------
have to work hard i have to decide like


---------81:05----------
okay i'm going to go to medical school


---------81:07----------
because it's what i want to do


---------81:08----------
when i when i went into medical school i


---------81:10----------
wasn't even going to be a psychiatrist


---------81:12----------
i wanted to do oncology and i wanted to


---------81:14----------
like save people's lives


---------81:15----------
who had cancer and then like when i


---------81:19----------
thought about being a psychiatrist like


---------81:20----------
my family was like


---------81:21----------
you're joking right


---------81:26----------
so they're like why would you want to be


---------81:28----------
like


---------81:29----------
you're joking right


---------81:34----------
so the world is going to tell you like


---------81:37----------
that oncologists and definitely


---------81:39----------
you know the world says this a lot that


---------81:41----------
oncologists are worth more than


---------81:43----------
psychiatrists


---------81:45----------
because cancer is real and if you want


---------81:47----------
to be a real doctor like that's like


---------81:49----------
helping people with cancer because how


---------81:51----------
much more of a doctor can you be


---------81:58----------
so forget about the world man and like


---------82:00----------
you just do you


---------82:02----------
and like walk your path every single day


---------82:05----------
and recognize that like


---------82:07----------
you know you're gonna feel behind and so


---------82:09----------
be it you are


---------82:10----------
what are you going to do about it you


---------82:12----------
got to start somewhere


---------82:15----------
don't fight that voice like you're doing


---------82:17----------
notice it


---------82:18----------
you know you can even like thank it in a


---------82:21----------
weird way right because


---------82:22----------
part of the reason that you've gotten to


---------82:24----------
where you are is because it has told you


---------82:26----------
that this isn't enough and it drives you


---------82:28----------
forward


---------82:31----------
so try like different things which is


---------82:34----------
just like


---------82:34----------
acknowledge right be like yeah like i've


---------82:37----------
fallen behind recognize that


---------82:39----------
so when you're like 35


---------82:43----------
and starting university


---------82:47----------
you know like like there's gonna be


---------82:49----------
there


---------82:51----------
how did you respond to that


---------82:55----------
shock i'm just like i'm just like maybe


---------82:58----------
it might be real dude


---------82:59----------
like yeah maybe right i'm just like that


---------83:01----------
what you're telling me now is like


---------83:03----------
acknowledge it and stuff like that right


---------83:04----------
because but like i think like similar to


---------83:06----------
a lot of interviews


---------83:07----------
interviews they've done right most of


---------83:08----------
them don't want to change this stuff


---------83:10----------
right


---------83:10----------
because like it's like it's like


---------83:12----------
productive for them even though it's


---------83:13----------
toxic in a way


---------83:15----------
i'm just scared that if like i debate it


---------83:18----------
right like talk to him and stuff like


---------83:19----------
that right


---------83:19----------
that won't give me the drive to do like


---------83:24----------
work as hard or like work super supply


---------83:26----------
yeah yeah so


---------83:27----------
so so that's why i'm saying once again


---------83:29----------
not don't get rid of it


---------83:30----------
you should be in control of it it should


---------83:32----------
not be in control of you


---------83:35----------
right so recognize that the feeling like


---------83:38----------
you've fallen behind


---------83:40----------
is like a temporary buff


---------83:44----------
that comes with like a long-term debuff


---------83:49----------
right so you do use it and you should be


---------83:52----------
grateful so like recognize that there's


---------83:53----------
like


---------83:54----------
a an 18 year old kid inside you


---------83:57----------
who's terrified that he's never going to


---------83:59----------
be enough and what i would encourage you


---------84:01----------
to do is


---------84:02----------
talk to yourself the way that you would


---------84:04----------
to a younger brother


---------84:07----------
who feels like they've fallen behind


---------84:08----------
right like you want to be encouraging


---------84:11----------
you also don't want to like lie to them


---------84:14----------
you don't want to say like oh no


---------84:15----------
everything will be okay like


---------84:17----------
you're beautiful and i love you like


---------84:19----------
everything will be fine no you're gonna


---------84:20----------
tell them like hey man


---------84:22----------
like you are behind but like you gotta


---------84:24----------
you gotta start somewhere


---------84:26----------
and i have faith in you you can do it


---------84:28----------
like you've shown me that you've come


---------84:29----------
this


---------84:30----------
far you went from like ite to


---------84:32----------
polytechnic


---------84:33----------
you have a 3.79 gpa almost 3.8


---------84:37----------
you need to shoot for a 3.9 so you got


---------84:39----------
to start working your ass off


---------84:40----------
i'm proud of you for even on your


---------84:42----------
holiday or whatever


---------84:43----------
like it sounds like you study two to


---------84:45----------
four hours a day


---------84:47----------
and you're revising things for the third


---------84:48----------
time which is awesome


---------84:51----------
and i don't know if you're ever gonna


---------84:53----------
catch up but


---------84:54----------
if you are i think revising things three


---------84:57----------
time is the way that it's gonna happen


---------85:02----------
what does what is your voice what does


---------85:04----------
your mind say to that


---------85:07----------
yeah i just have to keep going at it but


---------85:10----------
yeah i'm just thinking like when do i


---------85:12----------
like allow it to like like uh like uh


---------85:15----------
like buff me and when do i like i cause


---------85:18----------
it's very hard for me to notice when


---------85:19----------
it's a debuff and when it's above


---------85:21----------
because like sometimes i just think that


---------85:23----------
it's just a debuff and that debuff


---------85:25----------
kind of like creates a new buff of


---------85:28----------
moving forward


---------85:28----------
and then yeah that will make me how do i


---------85:30----------
identify that yeah so


---------85:32----------
it's generally speaking you want to get


---------85:34----------
rid of this


---------85:36----------
okay generally speaking but it's going


---------85:38----------
to take time


---------85:39----------
and i have to be really careful because


---------85:41----------
i'm trying to give you


---------85:43----------
so you keep on asking me questions about


---------85:44----------
the future and i'm trying to avoid


---------85:46----------
giving you


---------85:47----------
like answers about the future you're


---------85:49----------
like how do i tell you just you just


---------85:51----------
keep doing what you're doing man don't


---------85:52----------
worry about it basically


---------85:55----------
but generally speaking i do believe this


---------85:56----------
is a negative some scar


---------85:58----------
and in like just about everyone that


---------86:00----------
i've worked with where we've worked


---------86:01----------
through


---------86:02----------
falling behind when they no longer have


---------86:05----------
that mental complex


---------86:06----------
they start to do better now the problem


---------86:09----------
is that if i tell you that


---------86:12----------
you're gonna cr your mind is gonna


---------86:13----------
create a new goal and then you're gonna


---------86:15----------
start telling yourself oh i need to get


---------86:17----------
rid of falling behind i need to get rid


---------86:18----------
of falling behind i'm not getting rid of


---------86:20----------
it fast enough i'm not getting rid of it


---------86:21----------
fast


---------86:22----------
enough and it's just gonna the whole


---------86:23----------
 cycle is gonna start over again


---------86:26----------
but if you really want an answer like


---------86:27----------
you need to get rid of it


---------86:30----------
but just when i find that i'm scared


---------86:34----------
all right i mean so this is where


---------86:37----------
you know i think it's like it's a whole


---------86:39----------
other conversation but


---------86:40----------
you know i i'd say like it goes into how


---------86:43----------
long have you felt desperate


---------86:49----------
um actually forget about that we're


---------86:52----------
gonna go we're gonna go


---------86:53----------
try to speed run this okay so tell me


---------86:54----------
about your romantic relationships


---------86:58----------
uh i've only had one but it wasn't


---------87:01----------
really real


---------87:02----------
and it wasn't it wasn't really like like


---------87:05----------
uh


---------87:06----------
i mean like i don't really consider it


---------87:08----------
like like real stuff because it was


---------87:09----------
really toxic and bad


---------87:11----------
and that's it that was like six years


---------87:14----------
ago


---------87:15----------
i had like oh wait like four years ago


---------87:16----------
two years ago okay


---------87:18----------
and how do you feel about like have you


---------87:20----------
fallen behind in terms of like


---------87:23----------
girlfriends relationships you're


---------87:24----------
heterosexual


---------87:26----------
yes okay uh


---------87:29----------
rolling around that uh i don't know i


---------87:32----------
just go on my own pace i'm like


---------87:33----------
i mean it doesn't really affect me like


---------87:35----------
whether or not i'm singing a lot


---------87:37----------
great okay so like that's that's good so


---------87:39----------
so it doesn't seem to apply there


---------87:41----------
oh but sometimes it it comes up


---------87:44----------
just sometimes like it it will come up


---------87:46----------
like my


---------87:47----------
like my feeling of loneliness and stuff


---------87:49----------
now i'll try like notice that because


---------87:51----------
like sometimes it will


---------87:52----------
affect my actions and how i interact


---------87:53----------
with people


---------87:55----------
how do you mean like okay let's say like


---------87:57----------
okay my best friend right so like i'll


---------87:59----------
just like


---------88:00----------
like i'll just complain to him that i'm


---------88:02----------
single and i want to change it and stuff


---------88:04----------
like that


---------88:04----------
and they will give me solutions there


---------88:05----------
like then after once i notice it i'm


---------88:07----------
just like you know actually you know


---------88:08----------
it's just like is this how i feel


---------88:09----------
sometimes sometimes it comes out like


---------88:11----------
yeah it's just a thing it's not really


---------88:13----------
how i feel


---------88:14----------
it goes back down yeah cool so like


---------88:18----------
like over time are you feeling the


---------88:20----------
loneliness grow


---------88:22----------
or shrink or stay about the same


---------88:26----------
um


---------88:28----------
i guess now i would say it's drinking


---------88:30----------
actually yeah i'm quite like


---------88:32----------
okay with it yes so so i think the big


---------88:35----------
difference if we look at


---------88:36----------
falling behind right when it comes to


---------88:39----------
your professional


---------88:40----------
career academic stuff like that i think


---------88:42----------
you do a lot more things to feed the


---------88:45----------
samskar


---------88:46----------
which paradoxically is what we talked


---------88:48----------
about with like moving from


---------88:50----------
ite to polytechnic you felt so much


---------88:52----------
relief


---------88:53----------
and you were like oh crap i've fallen so


---------88:56----------
far


---------88:57----------
now i'm playing the game like i just


---------88:58----------
started the race like everyone else


---------89:00----------
started a few years ago


---------89:01----------
and i'm starting now right


---------89:04----------
and so i've like missed like the whole


---------89:06----------
everyone's like ahead of me and i'm


---------89:07----------
starting late


---------89:08----------
so so i think the relationship is


---------89:10----------
actually a really good example of like


---------89:12----------
how to do it


---------89:13----------
well right because like it's interesting


---------89:15----------
because you're doing all the stuff that


---------89:16----------
i'm telling you to do


---------89:17----------
professionally because you're saying oh


---------89:19----------
i'm just lonely like you don't tell


---------89:21----------
yourself


---------89:21----------
oh i shouldn't be lonely or i need to be


---------89:23----------
with someone you're just like


---------89:24----------
hey sometimes you feel lonely and like


---------89:26----------
the reason i feel lonely is because i'm


---------89:27----------
alone


---------89:30----------
that's okay like it'll work itself out


---------89:32----------
hopefully eventually


---------89:34----------
right you just kind of chill with it


---------89:37----------
it's just like there


---------89:39----------
you're like does it is it feel bad yeah


---------89:41----------
but like you don't your mind does not


---------89:43----------
feed off of that does that make sense


---------89:45----------
yeah yeah


---------89:46----------
whereas with falling behind your mind


---------89:48----------
like really feeds off of it right and


---------89:50----------
starts like


---------89:51----------
like oh my god then this is gonna happen


---------89:52----------
and this is gonna happen and then i'm


---------89:53----------
gonna do this and this is gonna have


---------89:55----------
never gonna be enough and look what that


---------89:56----------
guy's doing look at that like you don't


---------89:57----------
do that when it comes to loneliness you


---------89:59----------
just kind of acknowledge the feeling you


---------90:00----------
sit with it whereas there are definitely


---------90:02----------
people who have it reversed right


---------90:04----------
their professional career is like going


---------90:05----------
okay but when it comes to their romantic


---------90:07----------
life their life is like oh my god i've


---------90:09----------
fallen so far behind like


---------90:10----------
i know i'm okay like with my job it's


---------90:12----------
like yeah like i didn't get promoted


---------90:13----------
like who the cares


---------90:15----------
you know i'll get there eventually and


---------90:16----------
then when it comes to personal i feel


---------90:18----------
like i'm gonna be alone forever like no


---------90:19----------
one's ever gonna like me like i don't


---------90:21----------
know what to do


---------90:22----------
like let me i'll give you more realistic


---------90:24----------
thoughts it's not i'm gonna be alone


---------90:25----------
forever it's like


---------90:26----------
other people learned how to date in high


---------90:28----------
school and i did not


---------90:30----------
other people learned how to date in


---------90:32----------
college and now i'm 25 years old


---------90:34----------
and i don't even know how to date


---------90:37----------
like it's gonna be so hard for me to


---------90:39----------
ever find anyone because like


---------90:41----------
everyone has more experience than i do


---------90:44----------
and like i missed that boat


---------90:49----------
and now i'm screwed i've fallen so far


---------90:51----------
behind


---------90:54----------
right but your mind doesn't do that it


---------90:55----------
sounds like when it comes to dating i


---------90:57----------
was hoping it would and then we would


---------90:58----------
you know get an easy answer but in an


---------91:00----------
interesting way i'd say


---------91:02----------
do you see the difference between your


---------91:03----------
professional stuff and your dating stuff


---------91:05----------
and how you respond to your mind


---------91:08----------
yeah yeah


---------91:12----------
so yeah so i i would say


---------91:15----------
jt there are two ways to deal with the


---------91:18----------
some scar basically okay


---------91:20----------
one is to notice its action in the


---------91:22----------
present you actually don't need to go


---------91:23----------
digging into the past and you can just


---------91:25----------
work on it every time it arises


---------91:27----------
the second way is to dig into the past


---------91:30----------
usually what we do on stream


---------91:32----------
is actually digging into the past but


---------91:34----------
the reason that i


---------91:35----------
kind of went this way with you today is


---------91:37----------
because i think you're actually


---------91:38----------
genuinely really good at noticing in the


---------91:40----------
present


---------91:42----------
so this is something that most of the


---------91:43----------
guests that we come on i actually don't


---------91:44----------
know if they're capable or not but


---------91:46----------
it feels easier it feels like i have to


---------91:48----------
teach them so much more


---------91:51----------
to do what i did with you today


---------91:54----------
it's way easier to ask people like you


---------91:56----------
know


---------91:58----------
how their dad didn't get you know get


---------92:00----------
got their brother a


---------92:01----------
nintendo switch for their birthday and i


---------92:03----------
didn't get a nintendo switch and then


---------92:04----------
i felt a lot like it's easier that way


---------92:06----------
but


---------92:08----------
um i don't know that we're gonna have


---------92:10----------
time to really


---------92:11----------
open up that whole discussion and i also


---------92:13----------
don't want to lose


---------92:16----------
anything from what we've gained by like


---------92:18----------
moving on


---------92:21----------
how does that sound to you yeah i think


---------92:24----------
that sounds very fair i'm also gonna


---------92:26----------
like revise this later anyways like just


---------92:28----------
see it


---------92:28----------
any tips i can improve on later oh yeah


---------92:31----------
yeah


---------92:33----------
questions um


---------92:36----------
is there any like specific meditation to


---------92:38----------
like stop this because like sometimes


---------92:40----------
like


---------92:41----------
the meditation i do is like i don't


---------92:43----------
really think it addresses it as much


---------92:45----------
or like it just like like relieves my


---------92:48----------
it just released my neurotism for like a


---------92:50----------
period of time yep yep so let me let me


---------92:53----------
think about that that's a good question


---------92:54----------
um


---------92:58----------
would it be easier if i inform you of


---------93:00----------
the meditation that i do


---------93:01----------
sure uh okay sorry just let me put up my


---------93:05----------
thoughts


---------93:05----------
uh i do like yogic sleep on an


---------93:08----------
alternative day


---------93:09----------
and then another day i'll do like uh


---------93:12----------
like


---------93:12----------
the mantra that you gave and then also


---------93:15----------
the


---------93:16----------
uh rum sorry ram bam


---------93:20----------
bom rum thing yeah okay


---------93:24----------
okay so um


---------93:38----------
okay damn dude you're


---------93:41----------
you're a real tryhard bro yeah i'm sorry


---------93:44----------
i'm a smithy


---------93:45----------
sweaty neck i'm like a it's impressive


---------93:48----------
man


---------93:57----------
okay so let's talk about


---------94:00----------
okay so since you have some background


---------94:02----------
we're gonna this is great


---------94:03----------
okay


---------94:10----------
so i'm gonna give you advanced versions


---------94:12----------
of two of the practices that you're


---------94:14----------
doing


---------94:15----------
yes okay okay so the first is yoga nitra


---------94:19----------
so what you need to do is develop a sun


---------94:21----------
gulp


---------94:23----------
oh i have okay


---------94:27----------
i am capable


---------94:32----------
tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky oh so


---------94:36----------
okay so


---------94:43----------
okay tricky sorry tricky tricky so


---------94:46----------
this is going to be subtle okay


---------94:50----------
so the weird question


---------94:55----------
um so let's think about this okay


---------95:03----------
you are capable involves what


---------95:06----------
time


---------95:09----------
what does that mean so like capability


---------95:12----------
is about


---------95:13----------
what it's it's a


---------95:16----------
i don't even know how to ask this it's


---------95:18----------
it's so subtle but that


---------95:20----------
sun gulp is exactly incorrect so like


---------95:23----------
capability is about what you are going


---------95:25----------
to become


---------95:27----------
it's about catching up


---------95:30----------
does that make sense it's a potential


---------95:33----------
that is not realized but one day you


---------95:36----------
will be


---------95:39----------
right one day you'll catch it's like the


---------95:43----------
exact wrong thing


---------95:45----------
it and it's it's such a good i mean i


---------95:47----------
don't blame you for picking it i think


---------95:48----------
it's beautiful that you picked it


---------95:50----------
and that you shared it and that you were


---------95:53----------
like here's the things


---------95:54----------
it's like perfect it's like karmically


---------95:55----------
perfect but do you see how like that is


---------95:57----------
reinforcing the wrong thing


---------96:01----------
i did not realize that yeah and you're


---------96:03----------
not going to right this is why some


---------96:05----------
gulps are usually given by like teachers


---------96:07----------
right because like and this is like but


---------96:10----------
do you see like


---------96:10----------
and this is really why like this


---------96:12----------
meditation stuff is shouldn't be taught


---------96:14----------
over the internet but like


---------96:15----------
it's a good example of something that


---------96:16----------
seems really positive


---------96:18----------
i we can totally understand why your


---------96:20----------
mind generated it because it's like


---------96:24----------
exactly what your mind wants


---------96:26----------
right it's the dream that your mind is


---------96:28----------
attached to and it's saying


---------96:30----------
if i do this practice i will catch up i


---------96:32----------
will achieve my dream


---------96:33----------
i will get there one day i will climb to


---------96:36----------
the top of the mountain i am capable of


---------96:38----------
getting to the top of the mountain


---------96:40----------
but the eyes are still at the top of the


---------96:41----------
mountain instead of at the sep


---------96:44----------
the next step that you need to take


---------96:48----------
so let me just think about that for a


---------96:50----------
second so we gotta


---------96:52----------
remap your sun gulp


---------96:55----------
uh does that make sense you with me yeah


---------96:57----------
yeah yeah


---------96:59----------
um


---------97:04----------
i always thought it was so helpful


---------97:05----------
because it was such a good buff


---------97:08----------
like i've used it so much so yep


---------97:11----------
yeah so i think it is a good buff and a


---------97:14----------
debuff


---------97:15----------
yeah right so so so it's it


---------97:18----------
i think it's like it's hell like it's


---------97:20----------
there's no doubt in my mind that it's


---------97:21----------
helped you


---------97:22----------
and i think like time to let that go


---------97:27----------
um i think this is gonna be


---------97:32----------
too far for you but


---------97:35----------
one thought that comes into my mind


---------97:37----------
we're gonna find a different one this is


---------97:38----------
gonna create too much tension


---------97:40----------
i think if if you could replace it with


---------97:42----------
i don't need to be capable


---------97:46----------
okay i will try that but but how do you


---------97:49----------
how does your mind react to that


---------97:54----------
i think uh based on this interview i


---------97:55----------
think uh my my mind has kind of


---------97:58----------
accepted it okay i'll just try it


---------97:59----------
because it's like something new right


---------98:00----------
maybe my work


---------98:02----------
okay let me try to come up with


---------98:03----------
something better um


---------98:24----------
um so you can do


---------98:28----------
a mantra of soham


---------98:34----------
okay so so is gonna be


---------98:37----------
your inhalation if you close your eyes


---------98:41----------
and you just listen to it


---------98:44----------
you'll you may hear


---------98:47----------
something like and then the inhalation


---------98:50----------
and exhalation you may be able to hear


---------98:52----------
that


---------98:52----------
but what soha means is i am that which i


---------98:56----------
am so it it


---------98:59----------
you just you are you and like it sounds


---------99:01----------
kind of weird but like in your own


---------99:03----------
breath


---------99:04----------
you can like you know when you breathe


---------99:07----------
and you just like feel yourself like


---------99:09----------
that's all you are


---------99:10----------
so i would say you can use that as a uh


---------99:13----------
so the sun cult will be like


---------99:15----------
i am what i am period


---------99:20----------
okay um wait so do i change the mantra


---------99:22----------
as well because like i do the


---------99:23----------
because i think you gave it when you


---------99:25----------
were interviewing the


---------99:26----------
the russian asian something like that a


---------99:28----------
home brahmasmi


---------99:30----------
like me is not what you want


---------99:33----------
oh okay so okay so yep


---------99:37----------
yep so a ramos means a little bit


---------99:40----------
different


---------99:41----------
so um


---------99:44----------
uh yeah so like you're you're i would


---------99:46----------
say like if you're going to repeat


---------99:48----------
an english or i don't know what your


---------99:51----------
native language is but like a sun help


---------99:54----------
along the lines


---------99:55----------
of something like i'll get there


---------99:59----------
or what i am is good enough or i am what


---------100:01----------
i am


---------100:02----------
period like like you


---------100:05----------
like so if you like i


---------100:08----------
am what i am and then in terms of your


---------100:10----------
month or practice i would change that to


---------100:12----------
soham


---------100:14----------
so okay sorry oh sorry yeah go ahead


---------100:18----------
oh uh because like uh so like it's like


---------100:21----------
because i want to get this right because


---------100:22----------
i also use the beats right when yep


---------100:24----------
because you say like there's like buffs


---------100:25----------
and stuff


---------100:26----------
so like i i use my the pre beats and


---------100:28----------
like so i just


---------100:29----------
inhale and then like i say so hump and


---------100:32----------
then i


---------100:33----------
exhale and then i move on like to the


---------100:34----------
next yep so so this is where we're gonna


---------100:37----------
go to advanced practice okay


---------100:38----------
so so so hum so you can say soham


---------100:43----------
and then what i want you to do is with


---------100:45----------
each bead i want you to hear


---------100:48----------
soham within your breath


---------100:53----------
so close your eyes okay do i get the


---------100:57----------
beat sorry is it okay if i get the beat


---------100:59----------
yeah you can get the beats


---------101:10----------
okay all right all right okay so


---------101:13----------
close your eyes


---------101:17----------
okay can you hear me if


---------101:20----------
you have your headphones off yeah i have


---------101:23----------
i have you on speed


---------101:24----------
okay okay so


---------101:28----------
so close your eyes sit up straight


---------101:31----------
actually let me go get let me go get a


---------101:33----------
set of beads hold on


---------101:46----------
okay so we're gonna teach you guys japa


---------101:49----------
okay


---------101:50----------
so i gotta okay so let's do


---------101:54----------
a quick refresher this is the guru bead


---------101:57----------
okay the guru beat is like going to be


---------101:59----------
at the end


---------102:00----------
um and what we want to do is in


---------102:03----------
generally speaking your right hand


---------102:06----------
you want to hold the bead between


---------102:09----------
you don't want to use your pinky finger


---------102:11----------
or


---------102:12----------
your index finger so what we're going to


---------102:15----------
do is


---------102:16----------
rotate it between the fourth finger the


---------102:20----------
third finger


---------102:21----------
i know it looks hard


---------102:24----------
sorry try it like this


---------102:33----------
all right i'm just trying to copy it


---------102:36----------
fully


---------102:38----------
it i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------102:40----------
just move it


---------102:41----------
without using your index or your pinky


---------102:44----------
finger


---------102:45----------
okay i see it and then it's going to be


---------102:48----------
easy okay


---------102:49----------
so what we're going to do is


---------102:52----------
i don't know how many beads your mata


---------102:54----------
has but in the hindu tradition they have


---------102:57----------
108


---------102:58----------
so we're going to go all the way around


---------103:00----------
right one at a time i'll teach you how


---------103:01----------
to do this


---------103:03----------
and then once you hit the guru bead you


---------103:05----------
actually don't cross it


---------103:07----------
what you do is then you start going you


---------103:09----------
flip the m the mata around and you go


---------103:11----------
back the other way


---------103:13----------
okay so


---------103:17----------
you can absolutely chant soham


---------103:20----------
um i'm not going to chant it for


---------103:24----------
weird reasons but you can chant it


---------103:28----------
but what i would recommend is that you


---------103:31----------
try to hear it


---------103:33----------
okay so as you as you sit up straight


---------103:36----------
you know you've got your


---------103:36----------
your uh mara and then


---------103:40----------
breathe in and out


---------104:04----------
thank you


---------104:17----------
okay can you hear it


---------104:21----------
can you hear the soul and the hum


---------104:26----------
yeah it's very low


---------104:29----------
so you can increase the sound you can


---------104:32----------
increase the speed


---------104:34----------
of your inhalation and your exhalation


---------104:35----------
to increase the volume


---------104:39----------
oh of the of the oh okay


---------104:42----------
i was saying like lowest and low in


---------104:44----------
pitch yes


---------104:46----------
yeah it's gonna be yeah i think that


---------104:49----------
makes sense


---------104:49----------
it i never thought about pitch but i


---------104:52----------
think that'll make sense


---------104:53----------
um so


---------104:59----------
yeah so i'd say i'd say you know change


---------105:02----------
your sun gulp


---------105:03----------
and and alhambra masmi is like


---------105:10----------
yeah i don't think i don't think it's


---------105:11----------
where you are that too


---------105:13----------
is like aham brahmasmi means i am the


---------105:15----------
universe


---------105:17----------
and i think you're some people


---------105:20----------
need to be more connected to the outside


---------105:22----------
world


---------105:23----------
like um but i don't think that's your


---------105:27----------
problem


---------105:28----------
actually i think your problem is that


---------105:30----------
like your way to


---------105:33----------
your your sense of self is like


---------105:36----------
caught up in the outside world


---------105:39----------
right like you need to be less connected


---------105:42----------
not


---------105:42----------
more now i'm not saying you shouldn't


---------105:45----------
you know i don't think by all means


---------105:47----------
continue to study and stuff but like all


---------105:49----------
this stuff about the meritocracy and


---------105:50----------
what you have to be in what the world


---------105:51----------
wants you to be like you need to pull


---------105:52----------
away from all that


---------105:57----------
okay okay so quick reminder of java


---------106:00----------

---------106:02----------
