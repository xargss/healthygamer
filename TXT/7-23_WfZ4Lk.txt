---------01:14----------
right


---------01:15----------

---------01:20----------
yeah no i ended up getting unbanned


---------01:21----------
awesome dude


---------01:23----------
congratulations yeah and


---------01:29----------
uh i think it was jake that unbanned me


---------01:31----------
incorrect


---------01:33----------
who wasn't it was twitch at


---------01:36----------
twitch yeah you offered your case to


---------01:40----------
twitch and

---------01:45----------
yeah man i think we're we're we're


---------01:47----------
rooting for you danny


---------01:49----------
so yeah tell me a little bit about what


---------01:51----------
we're talking about today


---------01:54----------
well as far as my understanding goes


---------01:56----------
we're talking about


---------01:57----------
the uh because last time when i was on


---------02:00----------
the


---------02:00----------
ban appeal stream there was uh the the


---------02:03----------
issue came


---------02:04----------
up about whether or not i'm an in-cell


---------02:06----------
so


---------02:07----------
uh i guess it's about better


---------02:09----------
understanding what it means to be an


---------02:11----------
incel


---------02:11----------
or what uh whether or not i guess i


---------02:14----------
qualify as an insult and


---------02:16----------
what like what that's all about okay


---------02:19----------
yeah so uh can you tell can you just


---------02:22----------
recap for people like


---------02:24----------
and for myself like what what was the


---------02:26----------
reason that you were banned


---------02:28----------
i know we don't want to get too much


---------02:29----------
into that but well i was banned because


---------02:31----------
of some comments i made that were like


---------02:34----------
considered uh either insensitive or not


---------02:37----------
safe for work


---------02:38----------
or like offensive okay


---------02:42----------
and um and and so


---------02:45----------
what's your understanding of like you


---------02:48----------
know when you came


---------02:49----------
on the stream and you said hey this is


---------02:50----------
what happened do you have a sense of


---------02:52----------
like what twitch chat


---------02:54----------
resonated with in terms of like why they


---------02:56----------
thought you should be unbanned


---------02:59----------
well i think it's because they saw my


---------03:01----------
ability to look back at some of the


---------03:02----------
things i said and maybe reflect on them


---------03:04----------
and


---------03:05----------
i guess like some people i'm not sure if


---------03:06----------
everybody liked the fact that i laughed


---------03:08----------
at them but i think they


---------03:09----------
kind of were able to appreciate the fact


---------03:11----------
that at least i was able to find like at


---------03:14----------
least i was able to look back and


---------03:15----------
reflect on maybe


---------03:17----------
how uh the kind of things i said and


---------03:19----------
what that meant


---------03:20----------
yeah absolutely man i think that's a


---------03:22----------
great way to put it so i think we


---------03:23----------
you know appreciate people i think we're


---------03:26----------
as a community we're here to like grow


---------03:28----------
and learn from our mistakes right it's


---------03:30----------
not about being perfect it's about


---------03:32----------
learning from where you misstep and


---------03:35----------
and i think in that way again you


---------03:36----------
actually exemplify you know


---------03:39----------
what we want to build right is a place


---------03:41----------
where people


---------03:42----------
come and they learn something about


---------03:43----------
themselves and hopefully they grow from


---------03:45----------
it


---------03:46----------
so thank you very much for coming on


---------03:47----------
last time and just being a part of the


---------03:49----------
community and and hanging out on discord


---------03:51----------
i'm i'm really grateful to you man yeah


---------03:54----------
no problem man


---------03:56----------
so tell me a little bit about um i mean


---------03:58----------
this term incel do you think you fall


---------04:01----------
into that category yay nay


---------04:03----------
well i think by definition like if you


---------04:05----------
think about it as just somebody who's


---------04:07----------
involuntarily celibate somebody who


---------04:09----------
maybe wants to get a date or wants to be


---------04:12----------
able to be sexually active but isn't


---------04:14----------
i would say i fit in that category in


---------04:16----------
the sense that i mean i've tried many


---------04:17----------
things i've tried


---------04:19----------
like approaching girls i've tried doing


---------04:21----------
all sorts of things to try to get


---------04:22----------
get uh i guess girls to like like me but


---------04:25----------
none of it's really worked out it's


---------04:27----------
gotten rejected


---------04:28----------
a lot okay um and i think they're and i


---------04:30----------
think the part about insult the insult


---------04:33----------
terminology that


---------04:34----------
uh i guess a part of it is about


---------04:36----------
resentment towards women


---------04:38----------
okay and i think that in some ways i


---------04:41----------
harbor some sorts of resentment but i


---------04:43----------
don't i see that as more of a negative


---------04:45----------
thing i don't see it as like


---------04:47----------
uh i see it as like unproductive the


---------04:49----------
result man i think


---------04:50----------
sure so can you tell us a little bit


---------04:52----------
there's that word approach again


---------04:54----------
we had that word on friday used a lot um


---------04:57----------
and and so ganny do you mind if i ask


---------04:59----------
like ballpark of how old you are


---------05:02----------
i'm 19. okay and


---------05:07----------
and how old do you have a sense of like


---------05:09----------
how old you are


---------05:10----------
before you become an incel like do you


---------05:13----------
have to try for a certain amount of time


---------05:15----------
or is it just sort of like


---------05:18----------
well i think i've i've heard the number


---------05:20----------
24 thrown around but i'm not sure i mean


---------05:23----------
i'm not quite there yet


---------05:24----------
i have a few years but i think i i think


---------05:28----------
uh in some ways there are certain things


---------05:30----------
that are determined


---------05:31----------
like at a very young age like your


---------05:33----------
appearance or your social skills that


---------05:35----------
can also


---------05:36----------
affect your ability to uh attract women


---------05:40----------
i think your social skills are


---------05:42----------
determined at an early age


---------05:44----------
well by i think it depends on how you're


---------05:46----------
raised and depends on the environment


---------05:48----------
your


---------05:48----------
your you live in i think okay okay


---------05:52----------
and your appearance is determined when


---------05:53----------
you when you're born


---------05:56----------
yeah although i guess there can be


---------05:57----------
changes in appearance when you get older


---------05:59----------
like


---------06:00----------
uh if you work out or even if you don't


---------06:02----------
like sometimes your face changes you


---------06:04----------
grow into your face a little bit more so


---------06:06----------
sure i guess that's why some people


---------06:08----------
don't consider people who are like


---------06:10----------
teenagers or younger to be


---------06:11----------
in cells necessarily and and so if we're


---------06:14----------
talking about sort of what was


---------06:16----------
determined when you were born


---------06:18----------
um do you feel like you kind of got a a


---------06:21----------
particular


---------06:22----------
hand of cards dealt to you when you were


---------06:24----------
born


---------06:25----------
yeah for sure can you tell us about that


---------06:28----------
well i think uh as far as my appearance


---------06:31----------
goes like uh i'm not wearing a mask i


---------06:33----------
mean there may be


---------06:34----------
a couple reasons why i'm wearing a mask


---------06:35----------
but i think one of them is


---------06:37----------
uh insecurity about how i look and i


---------06:40----------
feel like


---------06:41----------
appearance for me at least recently has


---------06:42----------
been a pretty significant


---------06:44----------
issue when it comes to like


---------06:45----------
self-confidence and self-esteem i think


---------06:49----------
so i think that's one of the cards i was


---------06:51----------
dealt with when i was born


---------06:54----------
and i think uh i think that's i honestly


---------06:57----------
think that appearance plays a very big


---------06:58----------
role


---------06:59----------
in attraction just because like


---------07:02----------
i feel like i i feel like the way you


---------07:04----------
behave also does but


---------07:06----------
two two people with like varying levels


---------07:09----------
of attractiveness can behave the same


---------07:10----------
way and it'll be taken


---------07:11----------
a bit differently you know what i mean


---------07:13----------
sure absolutely


---------07:15----------
i remember seeing this uh cold i think


---------07:18----------
tinder profile or something where some


---------07:21----------
some


---------07:21----------
someone made like a profile of uh


---------07:25----------
like with like a male models picture and


---------07:28----------
basically said in


---------07:31----------
the the blurb that in the tinder profile


---------07:34----------
that he was either like a convicted sex


---------07:36----------
offender or a pedophile or something


---------07:37----------
really bad


---------07:39----------
and and he still got bunches of like


---------07:42----------
you know women swiping right is that


---------07:45----------
swiping right now


---------07:46----------
is accept or reject except yeah okay


---------07:50----------
yeah so you say you're insecure about


---------07:52----------
how you look


---------07:54----------
and appearance certainly plays a role um


---------07:59----------
how does how long have you been insecure


---------08:01----------
about how you look


---------08:04----------
i think well i've um i feel like i've


---------08:07----------
been insecure about it for maybe a few


---------08:09----------
years now


---------08:10----------
i think for a while i just didn't care


---------08:12----------
about it but that's because i wasn't


---------08:13----------
really concerned about like attracting


---------08:14----------
women that much


---------08:15----------
so i wasn't really super concerned about


---------08:18----------
how i looked


---------08:18----------
to me how i looked is just like a side


---------08:20----------
effect there was just something very


---------08:22----------
small


---------08:22----------
so i never really paid too much


---------08:24----------
attention to it because i didn't think


---------08:25----------
it was necessary


---------08:26----------
to pay attention to okay can you just


---------08:28----------
tell me a little bit about


---------08:30----------
um how you grew up


---------08:34----------
uh that's a bit like what specifically


---------08:37----------
i'm sorry i'm just curious like you know


---------08:39----------
what was what was it like growing up for


---------08:41----------
you who was at home


---------08:45----------
uh well i lived with my i i've lived


---------08:47----------
with my mom for most of my life


---------08:48----------
uh and i was mainly


---------08:51----------
i mean like are you talking about like


---------08:53----------
home life specifically or


---------08:55----------
sure yeah yeah no it was my mom and


---------08:58----------
she's had like


---------08:59----------
uh partners and stuff like boyfriends


---------09:02----------
and stuff


---------09:02----------
but my parents divorced and i was pretty


---------09:04----------
young


---------09:05----------
uh so yeah i was going on mainly and i


---------09:08----------
saw my dad on weekends and stuff


---------09:10----------
what was your relationship like with


---------09:12----------
your mom and dad


---------09:14----------
um my relationship with my parents


---------09:17----------
in some ways uh well in some ways my


---------09:21----------
relationship with my mom is


---------09:22----------
was kind of it was pretty close but um


---------09:27----------
it's also kind of complicated and my


---------09:29----------
relationship with my dad has been


---------09:30----------
a little bit distant but he's been there


---------09:32----------
like well i feel like when i've needed


---------09:34----------
him he's been there


---------09:35----------
some other times i think he's been there


---------09:38----------
some of the times


---------09:39----------
yeah and is there can you tell us what


---------09:42----------
you mean by when you've needed him


---------09:44----------
can you share like a like what's a time


---------09:47----------
like what's an example of that


---------09:51----------
well like um there's just been times


---------09:54----------
like i feel like when i was growing up


---------09:56----------
i i i never really


---------09:59----------
like i certain things like how to talk


---------10:02----------
to


---------10:03----------
like girls for instance or how to talk


---------10:05----------
to like other people i feel like


---------10:07----------
it's something that your dad can teach


---------10:09----------
you and my dad wasn't really like


---------10:11----------
talking to me about that stuff as much


---------10:12----------
or what if he did try to talk to me


---------10:14----------
about that i wouldn't really want to


---------10:15----------
talk about that


---------10:16----------
so i would listen so yeah


---------10:20----------
so i'm trying to get a sense of i mean


---------10:22----------
so if you weren't sort of taught how to


---------10:24----------
do this properly


---------10:25----------
is that because your dad kind of dropped


---------10:27----------
the ball there or is it


---------10:29----------
you almost mentioned like you maybe


---------10:31----------
didn't want to talk about it


---------10:33----------
well it's like a mix of both i just kind


---------10:35----------
of didn't care at that age i didn't


---------10:36----------
really start to care about like talking


---------10:37----------
to girls until i was like maybe 17.


---------10:40----------
okay and do you think where do you think


---------10:43----------
you know what a bell curve is


---------10:45----------
yeah what's where does that fall in


---------10:48----------
under the bell curve of when people get


---------10:50----------
interested in talking about girls


---------10:53----------
um i feel like that's pretty late


---------10:55----------
although like i was interested in girls


---------10:57----------
well also i was interested in girls in


---------10:58----------
like middle school


---------11:00----------
and then berlin throughout high school


---------11:01----------
throughout most of high school i just


---------11:02----------
wasn't interested in


---------11:04----------
girls really and can you tell me about


---------11:07----------
what school was like


---------11:09----------
well i went to a very small school so


---------11:12----------
there wasn't really a lot of like


---------11:14----------
different kinds of girls so i wasn't


---------11:15----------
really attracted to anybody at school


---------11:18----------
so i just to me like school was about


---------11:20----------
hanging out with my friends and like


---------11:23----------
like learning and stuff and it wasn't


---------11:25----------
really i never really thought too much


---------11:26----------
about girls because me the girls that i


---------11:28----------
was


---------11:28----------
uh grew up with were not very attractive


---------11:30----------
so i just


---------11:31----------
kind of didn't pay attention to them i


---------11:34----------
see


---------11:35----------
so it seems like the girls that are


---------11:37----------
worth paying attention to


---------11:39----------
are people that are attracted


---------11:42----------
well the kind of girls like i guess the


---------11:43----------
girls i was interested in dating like i


---------11:45----------
wasn't interested in dating anybody in


---------11:47----------
school until i was like 17.


---------11:49----------
okay and what happened when you were 17


---------11:53----------
well when i was 17 i started to get


---------11:55----------
attracted to this one girl who


---------11:57----------
i uh that at school that


---------12:00----------
kind of got me interested in girls again


---------12:03----------
and um i think that was when i started


---------12:07----------
thinking about like oh why don't i have


---------12:09----------
a girlfriend or


---------12:10----------
when can i get a girlfriend is when i


---------12:12----------
started like trying to


---------12:14----------
get this girl's attention or trying to i


---------12:16----------
guess get this girl to like me


---------12:18----------
can you tell us about her


---------12:22----------
uh yeah well i mean the thing about this


---------12:25----------
girl is like


---------12:26----------
at first uh i i talked to her and i


---------12:29----------
was pretty upfront with my uh intentions


---------12:32----------
like i told her i was into her and i


---------12:34----------
asked her like out on a date but she


---------12:36----------
said it was really weird because she


---------12:38----------
rejected me but then for like a week


---------12:39----------
straight she would like text me like


---------12:41----------
almost 24


---------12:42----------
7 and cut constantly keep in contact


---------12:44----------
with me


---------12:46----------
and then after that she just kind of


---------12:47----------
dropped off and stopped talking to me


---------12:50----------
how do you understand that


---------12:53----------
well i still i still it's still hard to


---------12:55----------
wrap my head around just because i don't


---------12:56----------
know why you give somebody so much


---------12:58----------
attention after rejecting them and like


---------13:01----------
why you would um like what i was like


---------13:04----------
was she kind of into me but then i was


---------13:06----------
thinking if she wasn't to me she


---------13:08----------
wouldn't have rejected me unless if


---------13:10----------
like she just i don't know like like i


---------13:13----------
i don't really know what that what she


---------13:15----------
was trying to communicate with that kind


---------13:17----------
of


---------13:17----------
interaction yeah that's it a damn


---------13:20----------
confusing situation


---------13:22----------
yeah can you tell me what you mean by


---------13:25----------
she rejected you


---------13:27----------
well she just said she wasn't ready for


---------13:28----------
a relationship so it wasn't straight up


---------13:30----------
but it was like it was kind of like


---------13:32----------
a little bit left in the air but it was


---------13:34----------
like uh


---------13:36----------
it was she just said she wasn't ready


---------13:38----------
for a relationship and she


---------13:40----------
didn't really want to date me


---------13:41----------
specifically because of that


---------13:43----------
uh but she didn't really straight up it


---------13:45----------
was hard to really tell she was saying


---------13:46----------
like i'm not interested in you or i'm


---------13:48----------
just not interested in a relationship


---------13:49----------
right now in general


---------13:51----------
so


---------13:55----------
okay so when she said she wasn't


---------13:57----------
interested


---------13:58----------
and and you like you like walk like can


---------14:00----------
you walk me through like what happened


---------14:01----------
like you just walked up to her and you


---------14:02----------
said


---------14:03----------
hey i'd really like to take like what'd


---------14:04----------
you what can you walk would do a


---------14:06----------
play-by-play of the interaction


---------14:08----------
so i think there's one message i


---------14:10----------
messaged her on


---------14:11----------
instagram i remember and uh


---------14:14----------
i i i think i at first i was just asking


---------14:16----------
how she was doing and then


---------14:18----------
i was asking like how she was like i was


---------14:20----------
just trying to start small talk but


---------14:22----------
i guess it's kind of weird to go right


---------14:24----------
from that so like oh i like you


---------14:26----------
uh i i can't remember the exact messages


---------14:29----------
but um


---------14:30----------
how much time between the small talk and


---------14:32----------
the


---------14:33----------
stating your intentions


---------14:36----------
uh i think i i don't as far as i


---------14:39----------
remember well there wasn't a lot of time


---------14:40----------
no are we talking like minutes hours


---------14:44----------
days or weeks i think minutes or


---------14:47----------
or minutes to like maybe like 10 minutes


---------14:49----------
i don't know


---------14:50----------
okay um


---------14:54----------
and what's your perception of like


---------14:57----------
what's in her


---------14:58----------
head like do women walk around and sort


---------15:01----------
of have


---------15:01----------
a kind of a conscious understanding of


---------15:03----------
like okay these are the three dudes i'm


---------15:05----------
willing to date


---------15:06----------
these are the seven dudes i'm not


---------15:07----------
willing to date like how does that work


---------15:10----------
well i mean what i i've been told in the


---------15:13----------
past that like a lot of the times girls


---------15:15----------
know whether or not they're attracted to


---------15:16----------
you like within like seconds of meeting


---------15:18----------
you


---------15:19----------
and that uh there are certain guys that


---------15:21----------
they are just


---------15:22----------
be attracted to and certain guys that


---------15:23----------
they'll just not be attracted to and


---------15:25----------
it's not


---------15:26----------
just looks but based off of certain


---------15:27----------
factors like looks or like


---------15:29----------
personnel like when you say you've been


---------15:32----------
told where


---------15:36----------
where i mean who told you that well i've


---------15:39----------
talked


---------15:40----------
people on the internet okay it's


---------15:43----------
actually a pretty good source of


---------15:44----------
information but what do you think about


---------15:46----------
it


---------15:46----------
kenny well i think it makes sense to me


---------15:49----------
because like usually i know who i'm


---------15:50----------
interested in


---------15:51----------
pretty quickly although it does take me


---------15:54----------
a little bit of time like i feel like


---------15:55----------
there are many girls that i'm like


---------15:56----------
attracted to like i think they're


---------15:58----------
attractive but i wouldn't necessarily


---------15:59----------
date so maybe


---------16:01----------
it does take a bit more time i don't


---------16:02----------
know okay


---------16:04----------
so it sounds like you know who you're


---------16:05----------
attracted to pretty quickly


---------16:12----------
okay um


---------16:15----------
and and what do you think could be


---------16:17----------
happening


---------16:19----------
when when you talk to someone and you


---------16:20----------
say hey


---------16:23----------
how's it going do you like the weather


---------16:25----------
small talk small talk


---------16:27----------
and then you're like hey i'm really


---------16:28----------
interested in going out with you


---------16:30----------
what do you think are the range of


---------16:32----------
possibilities


---------16:34----------
of what could be going on inside the


---------16:36----------
person that you're talking to


---------16:38----------
when you transition from small talk to


---------16:43----------
like letting someone know that you like


---------16:45----------
them


---------16:46----------
like the brains of sorry can you say


---------16:48----------
that again yeah like what are the range


---------16:50----------
of things that she could be experiencing


---------16:53----------
well maybe it could like take her by


---------16:55----------
surprise but i i guess it wouldn't


---------16:56----------
really take her by surprise because


---------16:58----------
a lot of girls kind of know if you just


---------17:00----------
start messaging them randomly like


---------17:02----------
a lot of girls kind of expect that


---------17:03----------
you're interested in them if you're


---------17:05----------
randomly sending them messages you know


---------17:06----------
what i mean how do you know what a lot


---------17:07----------
of girls expect


---------17:10----------
well because i i will i assume at least


---------17:12----------
that girls get messages a lot from like


---------17:14----------
guys


---------17:15----------
that are trying to hit them up because


---------17:16----------
they're like interested in them or


---------17:17----------
whatever


---------17:19----------
okay so it sounds like an assumption on


---------17:21----------
your part yeah no definitely an


---------17:23----------
assumption


---------17:24----------
okay um so you said that maybe she feels


---------17:27----------
surprised but then you sort of walked


---------17:29----------
that back and you thought maybe she


---------17:30----------
doesn't feel surprised so what do you


---------17:32----------
think


---------17:32----------
is surprise a possibility yeah it's just


---------17:35----------
a possibility but i'm not 100 sure


---------17:37----------
necessarily


---------17:38----------
sure so what else is a possibility the


---------17:41----------
possibility is maybe that she expects it


---------17:42----------
or she's just waiting for you to say


---------17:44----------
that because she kind of expects that


---------17:46----------
you're gonna say it


---------17:47----------
sure so she's waiting for you to ask her


---------17:48----------
out yeah


---------17:50----------
what else um


---------17:53----------
[Music]


---------17:55----------
well maybe she maybe she maybe the girl


---------17:58----------
might perceive it as being like


---------18:00----------
uh like there's something there's


---------18:03----------
something wrong with


---------18:04----------
kind of saying that like it's


---------18:05----------
uncomfortable like she might feel


---------18:07----------
uncomfortable with randomly being


---------18:09----------
like going from like small talk to like


---------18:11----------
being asked out i don't know


---------18:13----------
sure she could feel uncomfortable what


---------18:15----------
else could she feel


---------18:16----------
this is a great great hypothesis


---------18:18----------
generation ganny


---------18:21----------
um she might feel i don't know like i


---------18:24----------
can't think of anything else i'm gonna


---------18:25----------
be honest


---------18:26----------
okay so maybe she's feels fear


---------18:29----------
yeah right like maybe she's afraid of


---------18:32----------
what this means or something like that


---------18:34----------
maybe she feels


---------18:35----------
joy maybe she's like you said been


---------18:38----------
waiting for you to ask her out maybe she


---------18:40----------
feels


---------18:41----------
um valued or important


---------18:45----------
flattered absolutely yeah right um


---------18:48----------
maybe she feels confused


---------18:53----------
because maybe she feels like more than


---------18:55----------
one thing


---------18:56----------
right so maybe she's flattered and


---------18:58----------
confused maybe she's been waiting for


---------19:00----------
you


---------19:01----------
i i think what i'm kind of sensing


---------19:04----------
though is that there's just a lot of


---------19:05----------
different things that she could be


---------19:06----------
feeling


---------19:07----------
what do you think yeah no that makes


---------19:09----------
sense to me


---------19:10----------
okay and so if someone's feeling a lot


---------19:13----------
of different things and you ask them a


---------19:14----------
yes or no question like hey do you want


---------19:16----------
to xyz what do you think they'd say


---------19:20----------
um well it might be a complicated answer


---------19:22----------
just because of all the things they


---------19:23----------
could


---------19:24----------
possibly be thinking yeah so generally


---------19:26----------
speaking it's been my experience that


---------19:28----------
when people are


---------19:29----------
complicated and confused they tend to


---------19:31----------
say no


---------19:33----------
oh really yeah that makes sense to me


---------19:36----------
right so if i


---------19:37----------
called you on the phone and i'd say hey


---------19:39----------
like let's say i dmd like three days


---------19:40----------
from now hey ganny how you doing


---------19:41----------
you're like i'm doing well dr k and then


---------19:44----------
i said


---------19:45----------
ganny i have an amazing investment


---------19:47----------
opportunity for you


---------19:48----------
are you interested in hearing more oh i


---------19:51----------
thought you were gonna ask me out but


---------19:53----------
no no that i think you would expect


---------19:57----------
right yeah so i think sometimes people


---------20:00----------
just say no when they don't really know


---------20:02----------
what to think


---------20:04----------
what do you think about that i mean i


---------20:07----------
never really thought of it that way but


---------20:09----------
i mean that


---------20:09----------
that's a possibility like i could kind


---------20:11----------
of see how that logically follows


---------20:13----------
yeah because oddly enough ganny i i


---------20:17----------
you know i don't know how to say this


---------20:19----------
i'm just going to go ahead and say it


---------20:20----------
but like


---------20:20----------
i i think it sounds like she was


---------20:22----------
actually kind of interested in you but


---------20:24----------
much like yourself was like a confused


---------20:25----------
17 year old who didn't understand what


---------20:27----------
she was feeling


---------20:29----------
what do you think about that yeah i mean


---------20:31----------
it seemed kind of possible but then


---------20:33----------
afterwards she


---------20:34----------
said she rejected me because of religion


---------20:35----------
or something


---------20:37----------
so i don't know i don't know what that


---------20:38----------
was about but yeah i


---------20:40----------
i think that it sounds like she had some


---------20:43----------
so the interesting thing there is that


---------20:45----------
if we really tunnel down and look at the


---------20:47----------
reasons what are you hearing the reasons


---------20:49----------
that she said no


---------20:51----------
because she gave you two different


---------20:52----------
reasons yeah


---------20:54----------
what were the two reasons the two


---------20:56----------
reasons is


---------20:57----------
the religion and she just wasn't ready


---------21:00----------
for a relationship


---------21:01----------
what does that say about your


---------21:02----------
attractiveness


---------21:04----------
nothing what do you think about that


---------21:09----------
well i mean i'm i sometimes i'm under


---------21:11----------
the impression that like


---------21:14----------
even if she doesn't feel ready for a


---------21:15----------
relationship if she's like attracted to


---------21:17----------
you that


---------21:18----------
that the whoever it it is


---------21:21----------
will just kind of like especially when


---------21:23----------
some people are young


---------21:24----------
and like aren't necessarily thinking


---------21:27----------
ahead that much


---------21:28----------
like i feel like if they're attracted to


---------21:29----------
you they're less likely to think ahead


---------21:31----------
and less likely to think


---------21:32----------
oh i'm not ready for this they kind of


---------21:34----------
just want to get involved in it i don't


---------21:35----------
know


---------21:37----------
yeah i mean do you think what percentage


---------21:39----------
of the population do you think that


---------21:41----------
describes


---------21:42----------
well i i think it makes sense that it


---------21:44----------
would describe a lot of young people you


---------21:46----------
know what i mean like a lot of people


---------21:47----------
who


---------21:48----------
i think young people have less foresight


---------21:50----------
in general sure


---------21:52----------
and so what are we talking about are we


---------21:54----------
talking like 90 of young people


---------21:57----------
are willing to throw the future to the


---------21:58----------
wind fifty percent


---------22:00----------
thirty percent i don't know yeah so i


---------22:03----------
mean i


---------22:04----------
even if you say fifty percent it's like


---------22:06----------
she's maybe there's a coin


---------22:07----------
flip whether she's someone who's like


---------22:10----------
has bad judgment basically


---------22:13----------
yeah right i guess because what you're


---------22:15----------
sort of describing to me sounds like bad


---------22:16----------
judgment it's sort of like


---------22:18----------
yeah i don't give a [ __ ] about the


---------22:19----------
future i'm just gonna do


---------22:21----------
whatever i feel like because i'm


---------22:22----------
physically attracted to someone


---------22:25----------
yeah i know this sounds bizarre ganny


---------22:29----------
but in my experience


---------22:30----------
most people are not like that


---------22:35----------
yeah i mean that would make sense i


---------22:37----------
think i think there's a lot of


---------22:38----------
assumptions that are made about


---------22:40----------
i think specifically women a lot of the


---------22:41----------
times like about an attractiveness and


---------22:43----------
like what


---------22:43----------
women are willing to do if they're like


---------22:46----------
attracted to a guy i don't know


---------22:47----------
i i feel like where did those


---------22:49----------
assumptions come from


---------22:51----------
well i think a lot of i think a lot of


---------22:53----------
the like there's a


---------22:54----------
there's a lot of stuff i've read on the


---------22:57----------
internet like a lot of uh


---------22:59----------
that assume a lot about like i think


---------23:01----------
what women are thinking or how women


---------23:02----------
act or how women react to like i guess


---------23:04----------
like chads or like


---------23:06----------
guys that are considered like really


---------23:07----------
attractive or whatever yeah so what i'm


---------23:09----------
really curious about is where does that


---------23:11----------
stuff


---------23:11----------
come from


---------23:15----------
like where like i guess like redfield


---------23:17----------
the like uh


---------23:18----------
redfield community or no i i understand


---------23:21----------
that there are communities right but


---------23:22----------
like where does the original


---------23:24----------
information come from so i get that


---------23:26----------
there's like a bunch of people who


---------23:28----------
communicate with each other on the


---------23:29----------
internet they sort of describe


---------23:31----------
what female behavior is like but what


---------23:34----------
i'm curious is like where's the root


---------23:36----------
of this knowledge um


---------23:39----------
well i think it's a lot of it's from men


---------23:40----------
so i guess


---------23:43----------
i guess men's perception of like how


---------23:44----------
women behave i guess


---------23:46----------
okay and what do you think about that


---------23:52----------
well i think i i mean i think there's


---------23:53----------
there's value in like i guess men who


---------23:56----------
interact with a lot of women


---------23:58----------
and like maybe how they


---------24:01----------
their i guess their perception but at


---------24:03----------
the same time


---------24:05----------
i guess i guess there is a reason to


---------24:07----------
believe that maybe it's not the most


---------24:09----------
reliable source of information when it


---------24:11----------
comes to like


---------24:12----------
how women are i don't know yeah so i


---------24:15----------
mean let's let's just be critical for a


---------24:17----------
second so like on the one hand it makes


---------24:18----------
sense right because we have observations


---------24:21----------
right so men make observations about the


---------24:23----------
way that women respond to them agreed


---------24:25----------
yeah it makes sense and and so based on


---------24:28----------
my observations like you made an


---------24:30----------
observation so


---------24:30----------
so you've concluded you're kind of like


---------24:32----------
in soon to be in cell like if you hit 24


---------24:35----------
like you're concerned about appearance


---------24:36----------
you're you think women are not attracted


---------24:38----------
to you is that fair to say


---------24:40----------
yeah i think that's sort of thing and


---------24:43----------
and so what based on this experience


---------24:46----------
like you use the word rejected


---------24:48----------
yeah to describe this interaction with


---------24:50----------
this woman


---------24:53----------
whereas the weird thing is i'm not


---------24:55----------
hearing that you were actually rejected


---------24:58----------
really yeah it sounds like you asked


---------25:01----------
someone out on a date who


---------25:03----------
wasn't ready to be in a relationship


---------25:07----------
yeah i mean they did kind of more reject


---------25:09----------
me afterwards but i guess at first


---------25:11----------
that too i don't think she rejected you


---------25:15----------
i guess the beliefs i i had or yeah


---------25:19----------
i mean so so let me give you a different


---------25:20----------
interpretation ganny


---------25:22----------
i'm not saying mine is right it's just


---------25:24----------
there's a different way to look at the


---------25:25----------
story


---------25:26----------
so she is actually physically attracted


---------25:28----------
to you and she's taken by surprise that


---------25:30----------
like you're making small talk one second


---------25:32----------
then you ask her out


---------25:34----------
and then she kind of panics because like


---------25:35----------
a lot of times when you're you know when


---------25:37----------
you're taken aback by something you just


---------25:39----------
sort of like panic and you're like


---------25:40----------
oh i don't really know how to respond


---------25:44----------
um or she has her own anxieties


---------25:48----------
maybe she doesn't want to seem too easy


---------25:51----------
for example right because they're like


---------25:53----------
groups of women


---------25:54----------
who also will make assumptions about


---------25:56----------
men's behavior and one thing that


---------25:58----------
they'll tell each other is that like


---------25:59----------
you can't come across as too


---------26:01----------
enthusiastic otherwise


---------26:03----------
he'll use you and dump you does that


---------26:06----------
make sense


---------26:06----------
that women would propagate that right so


---------26:09----------
then she's like she's really confused


---------26:10----------
because actually she really likes ganny


---------26:12----------
and she's been


---------26:13----------
she she's excited but then she's like oh


---------26:15----------
like my friends have told me not to say


---------26:17----------
yes right away


---------26:18----------
so she says or maybe she's just not


---------26:20----------
ready for a relationship maybe she's 17


---------26:23----------
and she's not really sure what she wants


---------26:25----------
and then she starts


---------26:26----------
messaging you as you put it 24 7.


---------26:30----------
now that indicates to me that like she's


---------26:32----------
interested in you in some way because


---------26:34----------
why would she message you all the time


---------26:36----------
afterwards


---------26:38----------
and i'm not sure no so what you're gonna


---------26:40----------
say so so i'm not sure exactly what


---------26:42----------
how you responded to those messages but


---------26:44----------
then it sort of sounds like maybe she


---------26:45----------
was


---------26:46----------
interested in you but ultimately decided


---------26:48----------
that she didn't want a relationship with


---------26:52----------
someone who


---------26:53----------
maybe there was some kind of religious


---------26:54----------
conflict with


---------26:56----------
but even then that actually implies to


---------26:58----------
me that like if she's giving you that as


---------27:00----------
a reason it sounds like she was really


---------27:01----------
like considering pros and cons


---------27:04----------
and that actually what happened is like


---------27:06----------
if you cite that as a reason to turn


---------27:07----------
someone down


---------27:08----------
it usually means that there are actually


---------27:10----------
a lot of things in the pro column


---------27:13----------
like a week of deliberation followed by


---------27:15----------
hey i don't think it's going to work out


---------27:16----------
because of


---------27:17----------
religion sounds to me to be more the


---------27:19----------
result of deliberation


---------27:21----------
than like you know knee-jerk you're


---------27:24----------
ugly yeah


---------27:28----------
what do you think about that i mean


---------27:32----------
that makes sense i think it's i i think


---------27:34----------
that is a different way to


---------27:36----------
to look at this situation although i do


---------27:38----------
kind of recall


---------27:39----------
because we had a lot of mutual friends


---------27:41----------
and i do recall hearing something about


---------27:43----------
like


---------27:44----------
how she wanted to like let me down kind


---------27:45----------
of easy so


---------27:47----------
i don't know if that could be part of it


---------27:48----------
i'm great i'm so glad you brought that


---------27:50----------
up


---------27:51----------
so now we get to a really interesting


---------27:53----------
question right which is like


---------27:55----------
you could make the argument that you're


---------27:56----------
very unattractive and she's using the


---------27:58----------
religion as an excuse


---------28:01----------
yeah and then actually she thinks you're


---------28:02----------
just like ugly


---------28:05----------
has that thought crossed your mind yeah


---------28:08----------
it has many times


---------28:09----------
okay so now i've got a question for you


---------28:11----------
genie how do we know


---------28:15----------
right like let's say let's say let's say


---------28:18----------
i reject you


---------28:20----------
and then i give you a reason how do you


---------28:22----------
know if the reason is right or the


---------28:24----------
reason is wrong


---------28:26----------
um well you you would have to i guess


---------28:31----------
go go off of like the person's i guess


---------28:34----------
you you look at the person's behavior


---------28:35----------
like their history and like


---------28:37----------
how much the reason lines up with like


---------28:39----------
how consistent it is with how they


---------28:41----------
actually conduct themselves i guess


---------28:43----------
absolutely right so you can use


---------28:44----------
observation to determine if they were


---------28:46----------
[ __ ] you or not


---------28:47----------
right pulling your leg that makes sense


---------28:50----------
i think the tricky thing is that


---------28:52----------
you seem to be adopting in my mind an


---------28:54----------
unfalsifiable hypothesis


---------28:56----------
do you know what that means yeah no i


---------28:59----------
know what that means


---------29:00----------
can you explain it to us it's like a


---------29:02----------
hypothesis that can't be proven wrong or


---------29:04----------
that no matter what is


---------29:06----------
is going to be proven right i guess and


---------29:09----------
whether or not it actually is true or


---------29:11----------
not sure and and


---------29:13----------
do you have any sense of what could be


---------29:15----------
when i say i think you're adopting a


---------29:17----------
potentially unfalsifiable hypothesis


---------29:20----------
do you know what i'm referring to well i


---------29:22----------
guess that there's


---------29:23----------
there's no way to prove that she


---------29:25----------
necessarily is interested or there's no


---------29:27----------
way to prove


---------29:28----------
the fact that she isn't interested


---------29:29----------
necessarily wrong


---------29:31----------
right or that like like so she's giving


---------29:33----------
you reasons


---------29:35----------
and you're choosing to kind of hot


---------29:38----------
like supplant those reasons with your


---------29:40----------
own


---------29:42----------
yeah right and i think the interesting


---------29:45----------
thing is that the reasons that you're


---------29:46----------
using


---------29:47----------
are based on the insecurity about how


---------29:49----------
you look


---------29:52----------
yeah that makes sense so the funny thing


---------29:55----------
here is that what i'm hearing is like


---------29:56----------
your insecurity is actually what's in


---------29:58----------
the driver's seat


---------30:01----------
so yeah so let me put it to you this way


---------30:04----------
let's say i'm an attractive dude but i


---------30:06----------
don't believe i'm an attractive dude


---------30:09----------
and if someone tells me hey dude you're


---------30:11----------
you're pretty attractive


---------30:13----------
how do i respond does it change my mind


---------30:15----------
does it change my view


---------30:18----------
no not really what happens what do i say


---------30:21----------
in response


---------30:22----------
well you can you think they're lying or


---------30:24----------
they think you think they're saying that


---------30:25----------
to you to make you feel better


---------30:27----------
absolutely right so then like then


---------30:28----------
that's kind of tricky


---------30:30----------
like danny what do i do about that


---------30:32----------
because no matter


---------30:33----------
so some people and then what happens is


---------30:35----------
like when i ask someone out on a date


---------30:37----------
and they say no sorry i'm not interested


---------30:39----------
in a relationship right now what do i


---------30:41----------
think


---------30:42----------
you think oh it's because you're not


---------30:44----------
attractive or because you don't think


---------30:46----------
you're attractive basically


---------30:47----------
right yeah so now now how do i


---------30:51----------
come out of that


---------30:54----------
well you come out you come out of it


---------30:56----------
thinking you're even less attractive or


---------30:58----------
you come out of it


---------30:59----------
like with your hypothesis proven correct


---------31:01----------
or in your mind with your hypothesis


---------31:03----------
proven correct


---------31:04----------
yep so so i'm asking you if i'm stuck in


---------31:07----------
that position


---------31:08----------
how do i get out of that position how do


---------31:10----------
i change


---------31:12----------
i guess you could change by either


---------31:14----------
changing your hypothesis or i guess


---------31:16----------
making your hypothesis something that is


---------31:18----------
more reasonable i don't know


---------31:19----------
no but that's not going to happen right


---------31:21----------
because like like we just saw that


---------31:23----------
the two biggest reasons at least that i


---------31:27----------
can think of that would change my


---------31:28----------
hypothesis


---------31:29----------
one of which is people would disagree


---------31:31----------
with me


---------31:33----------
and try to explain to me how i'm wrong


---------31:35----------
or that i actually get evidence to the


---------31:37----------
contrary from another person


---------31:39----------
or not evidence but let's say they'll


---------31:41----------
say something else


---------31:43----------
and both of those i'm going to knock


---------31:45----------
what i'm kind of curious about is like


---------31:46----------
what


---------31:47----------
like how can i move out of that


---------31:51----------
um like move out of the i guess this is


---------31:53----------
that


---------31:55----------
i'm out of what again sorry move out of


---------31:57----------
the idea that i'm unattractive


---------32:01----------
um i don't know because that's what i've


---------32:03----------
been trying to do for like a long time


---------32:05----------
so it's i don't really i'm not really


---------32:06----------
shy


---------32:07----------
yeah i'm not sure either so let's say


---------32:08----------
something else so let's say you're


---------32:10----------
walking down the street


---------32:12----------
and and a woman who is incredibly


---------32:15----------
attractive


---------32:16----------
approaches you and says hey you're kind


---------32:18----------
of cute


---------32:19----------
do you want to buy me dinner what do you


---------32:22----------
think then


---------32:24----------
well i feel like then the you you would


---------32:26----------
be i would think i was attractive


---------32:28----------
because


---------32:29----------
like i feel like if i wasn't the girl


---------32:31----------
wouldn't approach me or say that to me


---------32:34----------
okay i disagree i don't think that's


---------32:36----------
what you would think


---------32:38----------
okay what do you think i would think i


---------32:41----------
would think that this is something


---------32:42----------
i i would think that you would think


---------32:44----------
that there's some kind of trick here


---------32:48----------
like i guess i would i would probably be


---------32:50----------
kind of


---------32:51----------
skeptical like i would be i would be


---------32:53----------
like what's her and what are in her


---------32:54----------
intentions i guess


---------32:56----------
yeah right because like she sure as hell


---------32:58----------
isn't gonna actually find you attractive


---------33:01----------
yeah right like you're not


---------33:05----------
it's not gonna change your mind like


---------33:07----------
your insecurity i don't think is going


---------33:09----------
to get wiped away


---------33:10----------
by a perfect 10 approaching you on the


---------33:11----------
street and


---------33:15----------
and sort of expressing interest in you


---------33:19----------
what do you think yeah probably not


---------33:24----------
right so i mean this is kind of just


---------33:26----------
tricky because i'm i'm not really sure


---------33:28----------
like how you can you know because it


---------33:30----------
sounds like even when people


---------33:32----------
tell you things that are contrary or


---------33:34----------
don't support


---------33:35----------
your view of things that for some reason


---------33:38----------
your mind


---------33:39----------
swats those those reasons away like


---------33:42----------
because of religion or whatnot


---------33:44----------
and and you substitute it with this idea


---------33:46----------
that i'm i'm unattractive


---------33:50----------
yeah i think so


---------33:53----------
hmm any thoughts about that or questions


---------33:59----------
well i think i think the fact that i'm


---------34:01----------
or the idea that i'm unattractive comes


---------34:03----------
from like more than just uh


---------34:05----------
i guess encounters with girls like i


---------34:07----------
feel like i feel like there have been


---------34:08----------
multiple encounters with


---------34:09----------
with girls that have like made me think


---------34:12----------
that not just that encounter with that


---------34:13----------
one girl and i feel like i feel like if


---------34:15----------
it's


---------34:16----------
i feel like if something keeps happening


---------34:17----------
over and over and over again you start


---------34:18----------
to see a pattern and you start to kind


---------34:20----------
of try to explain that pattern with some


---------34:22----------
sort of factor or you know i completely


---------34:24----------
agree


---------34:25----------
so so let's just run through that let's


---------34:27----------
just recap right so when you see a


---------34:29----------
pattern


---------34:30----------
you try to come up with a good reason


---------34:32----------
for that pattern


---------34:36----------
agree yeah yeah i agree now here's the


---------34:38----------
really tricky thing


---------34:40----------
is that i think this experience that you


---------34:42----------
described


---------34:43----------
you're saying is fitting the pattern


---------34:45----------
whereas i think your mind is


---------34:46----------
cramming it into the pattern


---------34:50----------
yeah i guess like we're talking about


---------34:52----------
the experience with the girl that i just


---------34:54----------
mentioned


---------34:54----------
yeah yeah i guess


---------34:58----------
in some ways my mind will make it fit


---------34:59----------
the pattern no matter what whether or


---------35:00----------
not it actually does


---------35:02----------
which is interesting because then the


---------35:03----------
pattern that you're developing


---------35:05----------
is not necessarily based in fact it's


---------35:07----------
based in like


---------35:09----------
your mind cramming a factual experience


---------35:11----------
into a particular interpretation


---------35:14----------
yeah i guess that isn't very productive


---------35:18----------
way of seeing it but i


---------35:19----------
i it's like uh i i can't remember


---------35:23----------
i'm trying to think of a word to to


---------35:24----------
describe this but it's like i guess


---------35:26----------
cognitive bias or like it's like when


---------35:29----------
you have


---------35:29----------
you have a hypothesis and everything


---------35:31----------
that you


---------35:32----------
you find a way to make everything that


---------35:34----------
you experience prove that


---------35:36----------
correct or yep exactly


---------35:39----------
so we all do that and like that's that's


---------35:41----------
normal it's called a confirmation bias


---------35:43----------
if if i remember correctly but


---------35:46----------
you know at the same time we don't want


---------35:48----------
to assume that this is just a


---------35:50----------
confirmation bias right like


---------35:51----------
like if you really believe the scanning


---------35:53----------
there's got to be like a decent reason


---------35:55----------
it's not like you started with a


---------35:56----------
confirmation bias


---------35:59----------
does that make sense a confirmation bias


---------36:00----------
only applies if you already have a


---------36:02----------
hypothesis


---------36:05----------
yeah that's true so then the next


---------36:08----------
question becomes


---------36:09----------
yeah go ahead i feel like


---------36:12----------
um oh sorry can you say that last thing


---------36:15----------
again that you were saying


---------36:16----------
yeah a confirmation bias only applies


---------36:19----------
once you


---------36:20----------
already have a hypothesis


---------36:23----------
so the idea that ganny is unattractive


---------36:26----------
can then be confirmed but it has to come


---------36:29----------
from somewhere


---------36:32----------
yeah i feel like that hypothesis comes


---------36:34----------
from like multiple rejections like i saw


---------36:36----------
the last game and the last guy had like


---------36:37----------
300 rejections i'm not quite there but


---------36:40----------
there are being like many girls that


---------36:41----------
have uh rejected me and i feel like


---------36:44----------
and like i've had a girl like okay some


---------36:47----------
of the rejections were like from irl


---------36:49----------
girls but there have been some from like


---------36:50----------
girls online


---------36:52----------
and people are online are a lot harsher


---------36:54----------
so i've had a girl literally say it's


---------36:55----------
because of my


---------36:56----------
lux there because i'm not attractive


---------36:57----------
like i've had like online girls will


---------36:59----------
like literally just say that like


---------37:01----------
straight up they won't even like mince


---------37:03----------
words


---------37:05----------
can you tell us about that


---------37:08----------
um well i i didn't actually ask this


---------37:11----------
girl out but somebody


---------37:12----------
said like somebody asked her oh would


---------37:14----------
you date


---------37:16----------
uh me or would you date this person and


---------37:18----------
she said no i wouldn't want to date a


---------37:20----------
guy who was that ugly


---------37:25----------
how did you feel when you heard that


---------37:28----------
well it kind of


---------37:29----------
it kind of upset me a lot because i was


---------37:32----------
uh i i


---------37:33----------
she was like pretending to be my friend


---------37:35----------
or she was talking to me like


---------37:36----------
as my friend for a long time and then


---------37:38----------
all of a sudden she's like oh no this


---------37:39----------
guy's ugly and i was like


---------37:41----------
i was kind of surprised that you would


---------37:42----------
say it so like


---------37:44----------
she would say it like that like i feel


---------37:46----------
like even


---------37:47----------
even if you don't find somebody


---------37:48----------
attractive if you're their friend you


---------37:50----------
wouldn't say they're ugly you would just


---------37:52----------
say oh and


---------37:52----------
i i i'm not personally attracted to them


---------37:56----------
sounds quite hurtful yeah very hurtful


---------38:01----------
what happened to that hurt in your heart


---------38:06----------
well i kind of yeah i kind of


---------38:08----------
internalized it and


---------38:09----------
um i kind of uh


---------38:13----------
i guess i really took it to heart


---------38:14----------
because i was thinking that this must be


---------38:16----------
what all girls think if this is what she


---------38:18----------
thinks i don't know


---------38:20----------
it started to become something that you


---------38:21----------
believed about yourself


---------38:23----------
yeah for sure so it sounds like her


---------38:26----------
opinion became truth


---------38:32----------
did you resent her


---------38:36----------
um in some ways i resented her but in


---------38:39----------
other ways i kind of it was like oh


---------38:41----------
figures like because it was already


---------38:43----------
lined up with my hypothesis


---------38:45----------
part of me found it very easy to believe


---------38:47----------
and it was very easy to digest so i just


---------38:49----------
thought of it


---------38:50----------
like i was very upset about it but in


---------38:52----------
another way


---------38:53----------
i was like go figure like of course she


---------38:54----------
thinks that


---------38:58----------
so it was sort of confirmed what you


---------39:00----------
already knew


---------39:01----------
yeah pretty much that sounds like real


---------39:04----------
evidence though


---------39:04----------
because we're talking about you know


---------39:08----------
interpreting certain words it doesn't


---------39:10----------
sound like you can interpret that a


---------39:11----------
bunch of ways


---------39:14----------
yeah it's pretty straightforward yeah


---------39:21----------
hmm can i think for a second yeah go


---------39:26----------
ahead


---------39:32----------
it's interesting i actually have an


---------39:34----------
alternate interpretation


---------39:36----------
yeah what is that right so


---------39:39----------
why do you call someone ugly


---------39:44----------
well i i would say you call them because


---------39:46----------
you think they're ugly but i mean i


---------39:47----------
don't know


---------39:48----------
incorrect if you think someone's ugly


---------39:51----------
what do you call them


---------39:53----------
well in many cases you'd call them


---------39:55----------
attractive to make them feel better


---------39:57----------
absolutely right or what you normally do


---------40:01----------
is is like you'll say like yeah i'm not


---------40:03----------
interested in that person


---------40:05----------
yeah when do you call someone ugly


---------40:12----------
uh well i guess i don't know if this is


---------40:14----------
what you're getting at but maybe the


---------40:15----------
person might be secretly attracted to


---------40:16----------
you in some way i don't know


---------40:18----------
not only secretly attracted i mean yeah


---------40:20----------
that's a real stretch buddy


---------40:22----------
although that can happen right so


---------40:23----------
sometimes people have


---------40:25----------
something called reaction formation


---------40:26----------
which is that they like


---------40:28----------
they denigrate that which they feel


---------40:30----------
embarrassed to want


---------40:32----------
or that which they cannot have


---------40:36----------
yeah right so that [ __ ] happens all the


---------40:38----------
time does that make sense


---------40:40----------
yeah no that makes sense so what if i


---------40:42----------
tossed out that if


---------40:44----------
the reason that people call other people


---------40:46----------
ugly is ugly is to hurt them


---------40:51----------
yeah that makes sense


---------40:56----------
and what if i were to say the most


---------40:58----------
powerful or common reason to call


---------41:00----------
someone ugly is to try to hurt some


---------41:03----------
yeah i mean that seems reasonable right


---------41:05----------
so all you have to do to test that


---------41:07----------
hypothesis is go to any third


---------41:09----------
third grade playground and you'll have


---------41:12----------
people calling each other ugly all the


---------41:14----------
time and what are those kids trying to


---------41:16----------
do


---------41:17----------
they're trying to offend the other kids


---------41:18----------
or make themselves feel better


---------41:20----------
absolutely so if you actually tunnel


---------41:22----------
down


---------41:22----------
i don't think most people like even if


---------41:24----------
you're not attracted to someone


---------41:25----------
i've very rarely heard or i cannot think


---------41:28----------
about many cases or any cases


---------41:30----------
where someone actually calls an ugly


---------41:32----------
person ugly to their


---------41:34----------
face unless there is an intention to


---------41:36----------
hurt them


---------41:38----------
yeah which is interesting


---------41:41----------
yeah sorry yeah go ahead nope go for it


---------41:43----------
i talked to her afterwards


---------41:45----------
it was kind of weird because it's like


---------41:46----------
she didn't even see what was wrong with


---------41:47----------
her saying that like she


---------41:49----------
she was like oh no uh i wasn't trying to


---------41:52----------
like say anything and she was but she


---------41:53----------
said like


---------41:54----------
oh i she said i was feeling entitled


---------41:56----------
like she said i


---------41:58----------
feel entitled to have every girl be


---------41:59----------
attracted to me and like i


---------42:01----------
am like wrong for saying that i i should


---------42:04----------
be insulted by somebody calling me ugly


---------42:10----------
yeah man so i don't know how else to ask


---------42:12----------
this question and i don't know


---------42:13----------
if this is gonna make any sense because


---------42:15----------
it's a [ __ ] abstract weird question


---------42:18----------
is that [ __ ] about you or is it about


---------42:20----------
her


---------42:22----------
i well i i feel like it's about me but


---------42:25----------
it's also partially about her because


---------42:27----------
buddy that's about her yeah


---------42:30----------
so like if she's on a social crusade to


---------42:33----------
put entitled men


---------42:34----------
into their place because men feel


---------42:37----------
entitled to


---------42:38----------
have all women be attractive to them


---------42:40----------
like i don't even know where she gets


---------42:41----------
that


---------42:42----------
is that something that you do did you do


---------42:45----------
something that she felt like she


---------42:46----------
had to put you into your place because


---------42:48----------
it sounds like someone else asked her


---------42:49----------
hey would you go out with


---------42:51----------
ganny or not yeah no i never even


---------42:54----------
expressed attraction to her or said i


---------42:55----------
was attracted to her at all


---------42:57----------
so i don't know how to say this gainey


---------42:58----------
but that has nothing to do with you that


---------43:00----------
has like


---------43:01----------
that has everything to do with her


---------43:02----------
issues yeah i can kind of see that


---------43:05----------
right like why on earth it just doesn't


---------43:08----------
does does that make sense like it that


---------43:10----------
doesn't make any sense to me


---------43:12----------
unless like there's some context i'm not


---------43:13----------
getting no that makes sense


---------43:16----------
and it's just weird because people don't


---------43:18----------
call like even if you're not attracted


---------43:19----------
to someone you don't call them ugly


---------43:23----------
yeah right i mean i've never that's


---------43:25----------
pretty rare like i haven't heard


---------43:26----------
somebody actually say that besides her


---------43:27----------
really


---------43:29----------
so it and so i mean if she's saying that


---------43:31----------
you feel entitled to have


---------43:32----------
all women be attracted to you like where


---------43:34----------
is she getting like where is she getting


---------43:36----------
that from


---------43:37----------
now we got to be careful because we got


---------43:38----------
to make sure there's no cognitive bias


---------43:40----------
here that you're


---------43:40----------
blinding yourself to something because


---------43:42----------
there are some people who are like in


---------43:44----------
cells or chads or i don't even know what


---------43:45----------
to call them now


---------43:47----------
where they do feel an entitlement


---------43:49----------
towards women


---------43:52----------
have you done anything that i think i do


---------43:54----------
kind of have a sense of entitlement just


---------43:56----------
by nature like i feel like there have


---------43:59----------
been times where i've gotten


---------44:01----------
pretty s like i well i felt pretty salty


---------44:04----------
towards women who rejected me and i have


---------44:07----------
like i i think i like one of the chat


---------44:09----------
logs like if you read it it said that


---------44:11----------
i don't really feel i think that like i


---------44:13----------
wouldn't go to a girl and say oh you're


---------44:15----------
like i'm entitled to you for you to like


---------44:17----------
me but i do feel like in general like


---------44:20----------
in a fair world everybody would have at


---------44:22----------
least like one person that's attracted


---------44:24----------
to them you know what i mean or one


---------44:25----------
person that


---------44:27----------
but i guess it's we don't live in a fair


---------44:29----------
world so no hold on a second but you do


---------44:31----------
have one person who's attracted to you


---------44:34----------
you think so yeah that first girl


---------44:37----------
yeah 17.


---------44:41----------
yeah maybe you're right


---------44:45----------
i mean she's like she sure as hell


---------44:47----------
didn't call you ugly


---------44:48----------
and it sounds like she was into you for


---------44:50----------
like a week while she was sorting


---------44:52----------
through her feelings


---------44:56----------
i anyway


---------45:01----------
uh yeah i mean yeah i i do hear a lot of


---------45:04----------
words that don't seem to be from your


---------45:06----------
mind coming out of your mouth


---------45:10----------
uh explain what you mean by that like


---------45:13----------
you see


---------45:13----------
it's like i hear like platitudes like oh


---------45:16----------
in a fair world there would at least be


---------45:17----------
one person


---------45:18----------
attracted to me but it's not a fair


---------45:21----------
world so [ __ ] me i guess


---------45:23----------
that sounds like the resentment of the


---------45:25----------
internet it doesn't sound like an act


---------45:28----------
like i think it resonates with you i


---------45:31----------
think that perspective


---------45:32----------
validates you i think that perspective


---------45:35----------
makes you feel not alone and not like an


---------45:38----------
idiot


---------45:40----------
which someone who's insecure is gonna


---------45:42----------
look for


---------45:43----------
a lot of ways to not feel like an idiot


---------45:47----------
and there's also a really subtle thing


---------45:48----------
there which is that if it's an unfair


---------45:50----------
world


---------45:51----------
ganny it's not your fault


---------45:54----------
you just drew the short end of the stick


---------45:57----------
it just feels like even though it's not


---------45:58----------
my fault it really sucks and it's and it


---------46:00----------
feels kind of like therapeutic sometimes


---------46:02----------
to complain about like how unfair


---------46:04----------
things are like i feel like i feel like


---------46:05----------
i do get something out of it


---------46:07----------
you're damn right i think you get a lot


---------46:08----------
out of it i think this whole community


---------46:10----------
gets a lot out of it


---------46:11----------
so i think this is a very confusing


---------46:13----------
thing where a lot of people assume that


---------46:14----------
like incels are dumb


---------46:17----------
like the chads and the stacy's think


---------46:18----------
that y'all are like dumb and losers and


---------46:20----------
rejects and all that kind of stuff


---------46:22----------
i don't think so i think that you guys


---------46:24----------
are you're definitely getting something


---------46:26----------
very important out of this


---------46:29----------
what do you think you get out of calling


---------46:30----------
yourself an insult


---------46:33----------
well i think it kind of shifts blame


---------46:34----------
away from you or it shifts


---------46:36----------
uh it kind of i guess says something


---------46:38----------
more about the world than it says about


---------46:40----------
your


---------46:41----------
yourself in some ways i guess yep and so


---------46:44----------
then what do you get to do if it's not


---------46:46----------
your fault


---------46:48----------
you get to i guess uh as they would say


---------46:51----------
like lie down and rot or not do anything


---------46:53----------
about it necessarily like just


---------46:54----------
waste time absolutely my dude


---------46:58----------
and boy don't we love that


---------47:01----------
if there is one thing that we love here


---------47:03----------
on twitch and in the gaming community


---------47:05----------
it is to lie down and do nothing


---------47:10----------
right we love to [ __ ] and complain


---------47:15----------
and do nothing


---------47:21----------
what do you think well i see some truth


---------47:24----------
in that but i


---------47:25----------
i do also see some some truth in the


---------47:27----------
fact that i am constantly trying to


---------47:29----------
improve


---------47:30----------
i think it's just about finding the


---------47:31----------
discipline to do to behave like that


---------47:33----------
consistently or to consistently do


---------47:35----------
things to improve


---------47:36----------
i'm really really happy and it gives me


---------47:39----------
hope that you


---------47:40----------
choose to disagree even something


---------47:44----------
yeah well thank you because i gave you


---------47:47----------
an excuse right i gave you the perfect


---------47:49----------
excuse


---------47:50----------
go ahead my dude ganny lay down and do


---------47:52----------
nothing bro


---------47:54----------
and what did you say


---------47:58----------
uh i said that i don't want to lay down


---------48:00----------
and do nothing i want to change myself


---------48:02----------
and get better


---------48:02----------
absolutely man and i'm behind you a


---------48:05----------
hundred percent


---------48:06----------
and i think that's why you came on


---------48:08----------
stream today


---------48:10----------
yeah and i i think you are gonna change


---------48:12----------
and i'm not trying to wrap up here but i


---------48:14----------
feel like it's an important point here


---------48:16----------
i think you are gonna change and i don't


---------48:18----------
think you're gonna be alone forever i


---------48:19----------
really don't


---------48:21----------
well thank you yeah i hope not i mean i


---------48:24----------
like


---------48:25----------
i like to think that maybe i have a


---------48:26----------
future maybe i have there is a


---------48:28----------
possibility for something more


---------48:30----------
yeah i don't know how else to say this


---------48:32----------
man like so i'm gonna sound like a real


---------48:34----------
boomer here so i hate that i'm about to


---------48:35----------
say this but i feel like it has to be


---------48:37----------
said


---------48:38----------
dude do you know how long five years is


---------48:43----------
i mean it feels long to me because i'm


---------48:45----------
pretty young but


---------48:46----------
it no dude it's such a long time


---------48:51----------
imagine just imagine how much you've


---------48:53----------
changed from 14 to 19.


---------48:56----------
yeah no it's crazy and five years is a


---------48:59----------
really


---------49:00----------
long time a lot of people don't get laid


---------49:02----------
in high school or even at the age of 19.


---------49:06----------
right like some people get laid after


---------49:08----------
college like it just


---------49:09----------
everyone's at their own pace


---------49:14----------
yeah the average age to lose virginity


---------49:16----------
isn't it like around 16 though like it's


---------49:18----------
uh at least in the united states i don't


---------49:22----------
know


---------49:22----------
i would be surprised if it's that young


---------49:25----------
yeah no it's like 16.


---------49:27----------
and even then i would be careful about


---------49:29----------
the phrase average


---------49:31----------
because a mean is biased towards


---------49:33----------
outliers i think the important question


---------49:34----------
is what's the median age


---------49:37----------
yeah because i guess the like if there's


---------49:40----------
a lot of people or a fair amount that


---------49:42----------
are like


---------49:43----------
losing it super young or super old that


---------49:46----------
like inflates the average right


---------49:47----------
yep so that's why the important is the


---------49:50----------
median not the mean


---------49:52----------
because there could be like 13 year olds


---------49:53----------
out there having sex and they're gonna


---------49:55----------
really lopside things


---------49:57----------
or even the another important thing


---------49:59----------
would be what's the mode


---------50:01----------
so what's the most common age to lose


---------50:04----------
your virginity


---------50:07----------
right that's the most yeah


---------50:10----------
so anyway statistics fog


---------50:14----------
yeah so i i'd be careful about


---------50:17----------
average because i think averages can


---------50:19----------
oftentimes be misleading


---------50:22----------
yeah no i've been told that before and i


---------50:23----------
think it makes sense i mean


---------50:25----------
an average is really just a number


---------50:27----------
that's made up of like other numbers


---------50:28----------
really


---------50:30----------
that is correct


---------50:34----------
it's a real five head [ __ ] right there


---------50:35----------
man well thank you


---------50:40----------
um okay so let's go back can we go back


---------50:43----------
to sort of the sense of like


---------50:44----------
getting rejected online and resentment


---------50:48----------
and entitlement


---------50:51----------
um i think with the resentment yeah sure


---------50:54----------
i think the resentment and and


---------50:56----------
entitlement


---------50:57----------
comes from i think this idea that


---------51:01----------
i'm special or that i mean that i i need


---------51:03----------
like validation from others to feel


---------51:06----------
uh to feel important or to feel


---------51:09----------
i guess uh adequate


---------51:13----------
so do you think the resentment and


---------51:15----------
entitlement are


---------51:16----------
related to each other do they kind of


---------51:20----------
yeah because my entitlement isn't being


---------51:21----------
fulfilled or isn't being uh satisfied


---------51:24----------
and where did you get the sense when


---------51:26----------
what do you feel like you're entitled to


---------51:29----------
i feel like i'm entitled to a lot a lot


---------51:31----------
like i feel like i'm entitled to


---------51:34----------
uh a better like a a life that's better


---------51:36----------
than most people or a life that is


---------51:38----------
maybe not easier but that is like um


---------51:42----------
more fulfilling or that is more


---------51:44----------
interesting i guess


---------51:46----------
and and where do you get the idea that


---------51:48----------
you're entitled to a life that's better


---------51:50----------
than most


---------51:50----------
people well i feel like i i feel like


---------51:55----------
there is this idea that um


---------51:58----------
that i'm special or that there's still


---------52:00----------
something about me that's like


---------52:02----------
i don't know just different from other


---------52:04----------
people


---------52:05----------
how long have you felt special kenny


---------52:08----------
ever since i was like really young i


---------52:10----------
think


---------52:12----------
can you tell me about that


---------52:16----------
well like i'm cons like i i took an


---------52:19----------
intelligence test when i was very young


---------52:21----------
and i scored like pretty well on it in


---------52:22----------
certain areas like i


---------52:23----------
scored high in certain areas and low in


---------52:25----------
other areas


---------52:26----------
but i i was like called gifted or i was


---------52:30----------
given the gifted classification and then


---------52:32----------
i was


---------52:32----------
sent to like a special school for it


---------52:34----------
which i didn't contributed that's not


---------52:35----------
the only reason


---------52:37----------
but i feel like that contributed to it


---------52:39----------
being told that you're different or


---------52:40----------
special or


---------52:41----------
like sounds like you actually were


---------52:43----------
special objectively


---------52:45----------
yeah i was


---------52:48----------
and do you feel


---------52:52----------
like you've lived up to your potential


---------52:54----------
definitely not i think i feel like if


---------52:57----------
i'm supposed to be smart like


---------52:58----------
i feel like in many ways i'm supposed to


---------53:00----------
be smart because of like what the


---------53:02----------
test told me but i feel like my life


---------53:03----------
hasn't really lived up to that potential


---------53:05----------
lived as to what it means to be smart


---------53:08----------
and what does it mean to be smart


---------53:11----------
well in my opinion like people who are


---------53:13----------
smart usually get good grades or


---------53:15----------
successful


---------53:16----------
or have a lot of things going for them


---------53:18----------
in life when it comes to like


---------53:20----------
success and either money or grades or


---------53:23----------
something that makes them stand out like


---------53:25----------
some sort of status usually and do you


---------53:28----------
stand out


---------53:31----------
i think i stand out but for the wrong


---------53:32----------
reasons


---------53:36----------
so i i was that insensitive i thought


---------53:38----------
that was no no no i i


---------53:40----------
i understand yeah why do you stand out


---------53:45----------
well i think i stand up partially


---------53:47----------
because of like mental illness


---------53:48----------
and partially because of uh


---------53:52----------
like um i think sometimes i oh my god


---------53:56----------
this


---------53:56----------
i guess i could go i can go into a lot


---------53:58----------
but i feel like i


---------53:59----------
there are certain behaviors that i do


---------54:01----------
that make me stand out just because i


---------54:03----------
try to stand out like i think in


---------54:04----------
some ways i've inhibited


---------54:07----------
attention-seeking behavior in the past


---------54:09----------
or behavior that


---------54:10----------
where i want to be like at the forefront


---------54:12----------
of like whatever's going on


---------54:14----------
and what makes you want to be at the


---------54:15----------
forefront of whatever's going on


---------54:18----------
because i feel like if people


---------54:19----------
acknowledge me i feel more validated and


---------54:21----------
i feel more adequate i think


---------54:25----------
do you remember that's a very analytical


---------54:27----------
answer


---------54:28----------
do you remember was there a certain kind


---------54:31----------
of acknowledgement that you wanted


---------54:33----------
growing up


---------54:37----------
um well growing up i'm gonna be honest


---------54:39----------
when i was really young i


---------54:41----------
i didn't really need that much


---------54:42----------
acknowledgement from my peers because i


---------54:44----------
was


---------54:44----------
kind of off doing my own thing so i feel


---------54:47----------
like this has been a recent thing like


---------54:48----------
when i was really young


---------54:50----------
um for the most part i was i i got most


---------54:53----------
of the validation for myself from


---------54:55----------
most of the validation internally


---------54:57----------
whereas now i feel like a lot of it


---------54:59----------
when did that change i think it changed


---------55:02----------
like


---------55:02----------
late teenage years or yeah i think like


---------55:05----------
late teenage years


---------55:12----------
do people tell you that you haven't


---------55:13----------
lived up to your potential


---------55:17----------
um not necessarily not directly but i


---------55:20----------
feel like there's in


---------55:21----------
their indirect uh ways that people say


---------55:24----------
that or whatever


---------55:28----------
can you give me an example well i think


---------55:31----------
it's communicated sometimes


---------55:32----------
through like uh if i get a bad grade i i


---------55:35----------
usually think to myself oh


---------55:37----------
like uh i should i should have gotten a


---------55:39----------
better grade just because of my


---------55:40----------
potential or


---------55:41----------
like what did i do what am i doing wrong


---------55:44----------
or why am i not getting the sort of


---------55:45----------
success in school that i expect


---------55:50----------
why don't you think you're getting the


---------55:52----------
success that you expect


---------55:55----------
well i think i just have a lot going on


---------55:57----------
in my life and a lot on my plate that


---------55:58----------
kind of distracts me from


---------56:00----------
being able to affect work effectively at


---------56:03----------
school and i think it's not just um


---------56:06----------
it's not just that i have a lot on my


---------56:07----------
plate as far as mental health is


---------56:08----------
concerned but also because i get pretty


---------56:10----------
distracted like i have problems with


---------56:12----------
uh focus and paying attention and


---------56:16----------
i have like adhd and stuff like that


---------56:25----------
can i think for a second yeah sure go


---------56:28----------
ahead


---------57:01----------
kenny you know what i think the biggest


---------57:02----------
problem is


---------57:05----------
what your confidence in what you know


---------57:12----------
okay explain what you mean by that


---------57:15----------
so i ask you a lot of questions and you


---------57:17----------
give me a lot of answers


---------57:19----------
and you give a lot of really good


---------57:20----------
answers yeah


---------57:23----------
right well thank you yeah it's it's kind


---------57:26----------
of interesting but i think it's actually


---------57:28----------
kind of a burden and it's sort of


---------57:30----------
screwing you over


---------57:31----------
because what i'm not hearing isn't i i'm


---------57:33----------
not hearing a 19 year old who hasn't


---------57:35----------
figured it out


---------57:36----------
what i'm hearing is a 19 year old who's


---------57:38----------
figured everything out


---------57:40----------
oh my god what do you mean by that well


---------57:43----------
so like i i'll i'll


---------57:45----------
ask you questions right we're talking


---------57:46----------
about women we're talking about being an


---------57:48----------
insult we're talking about


---------57:50----------
your views and how people treat you and


---------57:52----------
stuff like that and you have answers for


---------57:53----------
everything


---------57:55----------
i get rejected i'm ugly


---------57:58----------
you know the world is unfair


---------58:01----------
it's not my fault answers answers


---------58:04----------
answers i'm smart i was gifted


---------58:09----------
i was tested i haven't lived up to my


---------58:11----------
potential i'm handicapped


---------58:13----------
i have adhd the world feels really like


---------58:17----------
a definitive place to me


---------58:19----------
when i listen to you speak like i


---------58:22----------
already have an idea of like what's


---------58:24----------
going on


---------58:24----------
or i already haven't i think i know it's


---------58:27----------
like


---------58:28----------
i think i know everything yeah right


---------58:31----------
it's


---------58:31----------
you have way more than an idea you have


---------58:34----------
piles and piles of evidence


---------58:36----------
you're way past the hypothesis


---------58:38----------
generation phase


---------58:40----------
you're even way past the the testing


---------58:42----------
phase


---------58:44----------
your you conclusions have already been


---------58:47----------
made


---------58:48----------
does that make sense yeah no it makes


---------58:50----------
sense


---------58:51----------
right but at the end of the day like you


---------58:53----------
know i don't mean to sound like a boomer


---------58:55----------
but like you're 19.


---------58:57----------
and i don't mean to say that your


---------58:58----------
experience doesn't have value


---------59:01----------
what i what i'm trying to say is that


---------59:03----------
there are still more experiences


---------59:05----------
which need to happen and the biggest


---------59:07----------
concern that i have for you


---------59:08----------
is that your mind is not letting


---------59:11----------
evidence


---------59:12----------
change your view it's letting your view


---------59:14----------
change the evidence


---------59:18----------
yeah that makes sense and so


---------59:22----------
i'm concerned for you because i i think


---------59:24----------
you know i think there are a lot of


---------59:25----------
alternate hypotheses so i too


---------59:28----------
theoretically was


---------59:29----------
gifted i was never tested or anything so


---------59:33----------
i don't


---------59:33----------
really know and then i also


---------59:36----------
struggled a lot i probably could have


---------59:38----------
been diagnosed with adhd when i was 19


---------59:40----------
years old or younger


---------59:42----------
uh certainly didn't have good grades i


---------59:44----------
had like a you know like a


---------59:46----------
1.5 gpa or something after one year of


---------59:49----------
college


---------59:52----------
and i hadn't lived up to my potential


---------59:56----------
and also had a lot of sense of


---------59:58----------
entitlement i also had a lot of reaction


---------60:00----------
formation personally where i


---------60:02----------
hated a lot of the things that i was


---------60:04----------
jealous of


---------60:06----------
yeah i feel that completely right


---------60:10----------
like like i can't have it so [ __ ] that


---------60:12----------
[ __ ] i hate you yeah


---------60:15----------
because you are everything what are some


---------60:17----------
examples of that


---------60:18----------
tell me like in your life like what are


---------60:21----------
some examples of like


---------60:23----------
things that you were jealous of or


---------60:24----------
things that were like uh upsetting to


---------60:26----------
you


---------60:29----------
uh so i devalued school and education


---------60:32----------
because i felt like i wasn't good at it


---------60:34----------
and it wasn't an accurate representation


---------60:36----------
of my intellect


---------60:40----------
i felt like they were plebs just reading


---------60:43----------
[ __ ] textbooks instead of thinking


---------60:45----------
for themselves


---------60:47----------
oh wow yeah i think i actually for me


---------60:49----------
it's like the office that i feel like


---------60:51----------
education


---------60:52----------
is very important or education is like


---------60:55----------
very concrete and i feel like i'm


---------60:57----------
inadequate because i don't live up to


---------60:58----------
the expectations of education


---------61:01----------
yeah so i felt that too i think it's


---------61:03----------
actually the same feeling it's one coin


---------61:05----------
with two faces


---------61:07----------
yeah so deep down i felt exactly the way


---------61:09----------
that you did


---------61:11----------
and then my ego constructed a defense


---------61:13----------
against it


---------61:16----------
which is that i don't have to feel bad


---------61:18----------
about myself if i put


---------61:19----------
them down yeah


---------61:23----------
if they call me ugly i don't have to


---------61:25----------
listen to them if they're the ones that


---------61:26----------
rug me


---------61:29----------
hmm it protects me to put other people


---------61:32----------
down


---------61:34----------
yeah it also helps me not take


---------61:37----------
responsibility


---------61:38----------
because then i get to do nothing about


---------61:39----------
it right because if i'm truly


---------61:41----------
enlightened and they're all plebs


---------61:43----------
i don't have to listen to them i don't


---------61:45----------
have to value what they say


---------61:47----------
and their rejection of me which is like


---------61:50----------
f's on my report card


---------61:52----------
doesn't have to touch me if i devalue


---------61:54----------
them


---------61:55----------
and what they represent i guess that's


---------61:58----------
like how i view rejection in some way or


---------62:00----------
how


---------62:00----------
my attitude towards women in some ways


---------62:03----------
what do you mean by that like i see the


---------62:06----------
rejection as


---------62:08----------
like an inadequate or like as


---------62:11----------
oh my god i kind of lost my train of


---------62:13----------
thought here


---------62:14----------
uh i i guess that's how i interpret


---------62:17----------
their rejection of me in general like as


---------62:19----------
and how i


---------62:20----------
like i feel like i'm not good enough but


---------62:22----------
in some ways i like getting i


---------62:23----------
i think there's something wrong with


---------62:24----------
them and not necessarily something wrong


---------62:26----------
with me


---------62:27----------
if that makes any sense and it's kind of


---------62:29----------
confusing right because there's a part


---------62:31----------
of you that thinks that and there's a


---------62:32----------
part of you that


---------62:33----------
clearly thinks there is something wrong


---------62:34----------
with you yeah


---------62:36----------
something that's wrong with you that is


---------62:38----------
just so wrong with you that it's


---------62:39----------
unfixable


---------62:41----------
yeah even the word incel


---------62:45----------
right so it's like it's not even virgin


---------62:47----------
anymore


---------62:48----------
it's like virgin is like someone who


---------62:50----------
hasn't gotten laid yet


---------62:52----------
virgins have become incels celibate is


---------62:55----------
like a choice


---------62:56----------
it's like something that happens you


---------62:58----------
know in life it's like a long time span


---------63:01----------
and somewhere along the way either like


---------63:03----------
a bunch of virgins who now call


---------63:04----------
themselves themselves


---------63:08----------
i think it's the idea that like as you


---------63:10----------
said that it's just never going to


---------63:12----------
happen or that


---------63:13----------
something has happened to you or things


---------63:15----------
have happened to you that makes you


---------63:16----------
believe that there's just nothing you


---------63:18----------
can do about it


---------63:19----------
yeah so what happened to you that made


---------63:21----------
you feel like there's nothing you can do


---------63:22----------
about


---------63:24----------
i think just like constant rejection and


---------63:26----------
constant uh feedback from like other


---------63:28----------
people


---------63:29----------
when you say constant tell me what


---------63:31----------
constant rejection means


---------63:33----------
well like when i was in uh university


---------63:35----------
like during my first year i had this


---------63:37----------
kind of idea


---------63:38----------
that if i were to approach like one girl


---------63:40----------
a week or if i approached a certain


---------63:41----------
amount of girls that


---------63:42----------
at least one of them would find me


---------63:43----------
attractive so i was like i was kind of


---------63:45----------
playing the numbers game


---------63:47----------
but like every girl that i approached


---------63:49----------
just wouldn't seem interested in either


---------63:50----------
talking to me or didn't really


---------63:52----------
seem interested in uh in me at all or


---------63:55----------
they straight up rejected me or like


---------63:57----------
said they would rather be friends or


---------63:59----------
something else


---------64:00----------
and what does that mean and how do you


---------64:03----------
understand that


---------64:05----------
well i just understand it as like it is


---------64:09----------
i'm just they're just not attracted to


---------64:11----------
me in general and i feel like because of


---------64:12----------
how many girls have rejected me


---------64:14----------
i feel like i can make a state like i


---------64:16----------
could use that as like a sample size to


---------64:18----------
kind of


---------64:19----------
think of like what girls in general


---------64:21----------
would think i think


---------64:24----------
how did you talk to these women


---------64:28----------
usually i just try to approach them or


---------64:29----------
try to like start up a conversation or


---------64:31----------
whatever and see if they were interested


---------64:32----------
in talking


---------64:38----------
sorry again i just got a little bit


---------64:40----------
frustrated


---------64:44----------
i gotta think about what's frustrating


---------64:45----------
but okay


---------64:47----------
can i talk at you for a little bit can i


---------64:50----------
go ahead


---------64:51----------
okay so the first thing is if you're


---------64:54----------
approaching women


---------64:55----------
don't that's not a thing i don't know


---------64:58----------
what that is


---------65:00----------
but like here's okay so here's what i'm


---------65:02----------
gonna say first thing to understand


---------65:04----------
ganny and you're allowed to disagree


---------65:07----------
with any of this okay i'm just gonna


---------65:08----------
rant is that cool


---------65:10----------
yeah go ahead okay you ready for it bro


---------65:12----------
yeah i'm ready for it


---------65:15----------
issue number one people are stupid


---------65:18----------
okay what that means is that like a lot


---------65:20----------
of times men are stupid and women are


---------65:22----------
stupid


---------65:23----------
issue number two people don't know


---------65:25----------
themselves these are like universal


---------65:27----------
facts about humanity


---------65:29----------
i don't understand what's going on


---------65:30----------
inside myself


---------65:32----------
and a lot of times i suspect that you


---------65:34----------
don't understand what's going on inside


---------65:36----------
yourself and the women that you talk to


---------65:37----------
don't understand what's going on in them


---------65:40----------
so like like that's the first thing so


---------65:42----------
if you know like i think your


---------65:44----------
your example is fantastic that you know


---------65:46----------
sometimes when you ask a girl out she


---------65:48----------
doesn't know what to think or she thinks


---------65:50----------
shockingly more than one thing that


---------65:53----------
there are reasons she is attracted to


---------65:54----------
you


---------65:55----------
and their reasons that she's not


---------65:56----------
interested in you


---------66:00----------
second thing is that if you're basing


---------66:02----------
your idea that you're celibate


---------66:04----------
or an incel based on approaching random


---------66:07----------
women on the street and striking out


---------66:09----------
over and over and over again


---------66:11----------
there's a difference between your worth


---------66:13----------
as a human being and the strategy that


---------66:15----------
you're employing to ask women out


---------66:18----------
what do you mean by that like if i'm a


---------66:21----------
surgeon


---------66:22----------
and i go in and start hacking at people


---------66:25----------
willy-nilly


---------66:26----------
and then i say oh [ __ ] i'm a terrible


---------66:28----------
surgeon i will never be able to save a


---------66:30----------
life


---------66:31----------
there's a huge difference between the


---------66:33----------
way in which i perform surgery


---------66:35----------
and my capacity to perform surgery well


---------66:39----------
right there's like a method here you're


---------66:41----------
interpreting your value as a human being


---------66:44----------
based on what sounds to me like a


---------66:46----------
terrible way to approach


---------66:48----------
women like you're not treating them like


---------66:51----------
humans


---------66:52----------
you're treating them like objects to be


---------66:54----------
approached and i'm not surprised that


---------66:56----------
you get rejected


---------66:57----------
over and over and over again has nothing


---------66:59----------
to do with the fact that you're ugly has


---------67:01----------
everything to do with the fact that


---------67:02----------
you're probably like


---------67:03----------
like you're not it's not like a normal


---------67:05----------
interaction


---------67:07----------
right because people don't hit each


---------67:09----------
other up on the street


---------67:10----------
and then like start asking each other


---------67:12----------
out that


---------67:13----------
happens rarely it happens in the movies


---------67:16----------
and we think that chads do that and


---------67:19----------
sometimes some people can get away with


---------67:21----------
that [ __ ]


---------67:22----------
but that also has nothing to do with


---------67:24----------
like that person being a chad


---------67:26----------
it has everything to do with the fact


---------67:27----------
that an interaction between you and


---------67:30----------
another person


---------67:31----------
ganny involves you and another person


---------67:34----------
there's a whole


---------67:35----------
other person there with thoughts


---------67:36----------
feelings insecurities


---------67:38----------
their own issues case in point lady who


---------67:42----------
called you ugly because she felt like


---------67:43----------
you were entitled to the attractiveness


---------67:45----------
of all women i have no idea where she


---------67:46----------
gets that


---------67:48----------
i mean maybe you were a toxic [ __ ]


---------67:49----------
and you said that to her so that's fine


---------67:51----------
but it sounds like you weren't


---------67:53----------
it sounds like you didn't even hit on


---------67:54----------
her in any way shape or form and that


---------67:56----------
you were just


---------67:56----------
generally around and that she chose to


---------67:59----------
call you out as ugly because she felt


---------68:01----------
like you were entitled


---------68:02----------
to the attractive attraction of all


---------68:04----------
women i


---------68:06----------
does that make sense like that has


---------68:07----------
nothing to do with you man


---------68:09----------
yeah that makes sense so like people are


---------68:12----------
stupid and they don't know what they


---------68:13----------
feel


---------68:15----------
the other thing is that like there are


---------68:17----------
some differences i suppose in terms of


---------68:19----------
gender dynamics in terms of like


---------68:21----------
when um you know how men and women


---------68:25----------
treat each other and find each other


---------68:27----------
attractive and stuff like that there may


---------68:28----------
be differences there


---------68:29----------
but i'm telling you like as a scientist


---------68:34----------
the in-group variability far outweighs


---------68:38----------
the between group variability


---------68:41----------
that's a tricky sentence do you know


---------68:42----------
what that means


---------68:44----------
not really no okay so if you look at


---------68:46----------
like intelligence


---------68:49----------
amongst ethnicities what you'll find is


---------68:52----------
that


---------68:53----------
basically people from all over the world


---------68:55----------
on average are the same amount of


---------68:57----------
intelligent


---------68:59----------
so it's not like indian people are


---------69:01----------
smarter than german people


---------69:03----------
or that german people are smarter than


---------69:05----------
indian people


---------69:06----------
the variability in intelligence within a


---------69:10----------
community


---------69:11----------
far outweighs the difference between


---------69:13----------
communities


---------69:15----------
they're really smart indian people and


---------69:16----------
they're really stupid indian people


---------69:18----------
they're really smart german people and


---------69:20----------
really stupid indian people


---------69:21----------
does that make sense yeah no it makes


---------69:24----------
sense


---------69:24----------
that's also true of genders so there are


---------69:28----------
women who are attractive and confident


---------69:30----------
and picky and [ __ ] and there are men


---------69:33----------
who are attractive and confident and


---------69:34----------
picky and [ __ ]


---------69:36----------
they're also men who are attractive and


---------69:37----------
confident and nice and there are women


---------69:39----------
who are attractive and confident and


---------69:40----------
nice


---------69:42----------
there are women who will judge a man


---------69:44----------
based on his appearance within 30


---------69:45----------
seconds and then decide


---------69:46----------
to date them or not date them and there


---------69:48----------
are also women who won't do that


---------69:51----------
and who will get sub take some time to


---------69:53----------
like


---------69:54----------
note get to know people before they


---------69:56----------
decide whether they want to date them or


---------69:58----------
not


---------69:58----------
what do you think about that yeah now


---------70:01----------
that makes sense


---------70:03----------
okay


---------70:07----------
so here's the next thing


---------70:11----------
i think that a lot of your


---------70:15----------
a lot of what they could be responding


---------70:17----------
to is not your looks


---------70:19----------
but your insecurity about your looks


---------70:22----------
what do you think about that well i feel


---------70:25----------
like it is a mix of both but if you are


---------70:27----------
confident in how you look i think you


---------70:29----------
are more likely


---------70:30----------
to get women or feel attractive okay so


---------70:32----------
let me ask you something annie


---------70:34----------
when you come on stream with a mask on


---------70:37----------
yeah what do you think that does to your


---------70:39----------
insecurity


---------70:41----------
i think it gives it it gives it like uh


---------70:44----------
weight or


---------70:45----------
it like um i feel like it's


---------70:49----------
it uh it validates it or gives it oxygen


---------70:53----------
absolutely i love that last part it's


---------70:56----------
not validating it gives it oxygen


---------70:58----------
it helps it grow


---------71:02----------
and what do you think that insecurity


---------71:03----------
every time you let your insecurity get a


---------71:05----------
little bit bigger and a little bit


---------71:07----------
bigger


---------71:08----------
what happens the next time you talk to a


---------71:10----------
girl


---------71:12----------
it's uh i come across as insecure or


---------71:15----------
anxious yeah right and they don't know


---------71:18----------
and it's it's not that they like don't


---------71:20----------
they're not like they're not like


---------71:22----------
knocking you off of a list permanently


---------71:24----------
i think a lot of times what it'll do is


---------71:27----------
it'll probably confuse women


---------71:32----------
what do you think about that sorry say


---------71:35----------
that last part again


---------71:36----------
i think it confuses women


---------71:40----------
what confuses women the combination


---------71:43----------
between you approaching them random and


---------71:45----------
randomly in the street and being a


---------71:46----------
gigantic pile of insecurity


---------71:49----------
yeah it's probably really weird to have


---------71:51----------
somebody especially somebody who's


---------71:52----------
anxious


---------71:53----------
or we or like nervous to just randomly


---------71:56----------
start talking to you out of nowhere


---------71:57----------
absolutely and then if you're anxious


---------71:59----------
how do you think


---------72:00----------
they feel they probably feel even more


---------72:03----------
anxious or like uncomfortable


---------72:04----------
absolutely because we're empathic


---------72:06----------
organisms


---------72:08----------
so they're not i don't think they're


---------72:09----------
looking down on you like you're a piece


---------72:11----------
of [ __ ] and they're judging you because


---------72:13----------
they're the superior sex


---------72:15----------
i think they're really confused and


---------72:16----------
anxious and generally speaking when


---------72:18----------
someone is confused and anxious and you


---------72:20----------
ask them if they want to go out with you


---------72:21----------
what are they going to say


---------72:23----------
probably no even if you're dr chad


---------72:26----------
thundercock


---------72:30----------
you think so pretty sure bro


---------72:39----------
i yeah i mean i i i think like


---------72:42----------
so yeah any thoughts about what i've


---------72:45----------
said so far


---------72:47----------
i mean it makes sense to me i've been


---------72:49----------
kind of told versions of this before but


---------72:51----------
i think the way you say makes it


---------72:52----------
makes a bit more sense like i feel like


---------72:55----------
um


---------72:57----------
probably my insecurity is playing a big


---------72:59----------
role in like how i'm perceived or


---------73:01----------
i guess my attractiveness overall like


---------73:04----------
especially if i'm randomly approaching


---------73:05----------
people out of nowhere


---------73:07----------
right i mean like so most of the people


---------73:09----------
that that i


---------73:10----------
you know most of the successful


---------73:11----------
relationships that i've seen


---------73:13----------
don't start with anyone approaching


---------73:16----------
anyone


---------73:18----------
yeah it's like usually like people


---------73:22----------
get into relationships when there are


---------73:25----------
unplanned repeated interactions plus


---------73:28----------
attractiveness this is the biggest thing


---------73:30----------
that people tend to miss out on


---------73:32----------
unplanned repeated interactions is


---------73:35----------
seriously the foundation of most


---------73:36----------
well this has changed since online


---------73:37----------
dating but like if you look at prior to


---------73:40----------
online dating


---------73:41----------
unplanned repeated interactions are like


---------73:43----------
most of how people


---------73:44----------
like find someone to date


---------73:48----------
and that's why people date like their


---------73:50----------
co-workers and fellow students you don't


---------73:52----------
date people off the street


---------73:54----------
you date your co-workers because like


---------73:56----------
you go to work every day they go to work


---------73:58----------
every day you guys like kind of chit


---------73:59----------
chat a little


---------74:00----------
bit you crack a joke they laugh they


---------74:02----------
crack a joke you laugh


---------74:06----------
and then like it's sort of like an


---------74:07----------
organic kind of thing


---------74:10----------
now online dating is a little bit


---------74:11----------
different i think that certainly does


---------74:13----------
sound like more of a numbers game


---------74:15----------
right and people swiping right and


---------74:17----------
swiping left and whatnot but even then


---------74:19----------
there seems to be some amount of like


---------74:20----------
organicness to the more successful


---------74:23----------
relationships


---------74:25----------
yeah and what i'm hearing from you is


---------74:28----------
that a lot of your interactions are not


---------74:30----------
organic or natural at all


---------74:33----------
maybe i'm forcing it and trying like way


---------74:35----------
too hard or making people feel


---------74:37----------
uncomfortable because of my


---------74:38----------
uh the way i'm approaching them


---------74:40----------
partially too


---------74:42----------
yeah i mean i certainly think so


---------74:46----------
but i i encourage you to really just


---------74:49----------
kind of look at yourself because i don't


---------74:51----------
think


---------74:52----------
i mean i you know i can understand


---------74:56----------
everything that you've said i think it


---------74:57----------
makes sense like i think it makes sense


---------74:59----------
that you felt like you were rejected by


---------75:01----------
that girl at the age of 17


---------75:03----------
but i think the really tricky thing


---------75:05----------
again is that


---------75:06----------
with each of those rejections the


---------75:08----------
confirmation bias grows


---------75:10----------
and the more you give oxygen to your


---------75:12----------
insecurity the more


---------75:14----------
it finds confirmation biases does that


---------75:17----------
make sense


---------75:18----------
yeah no it makes a lot of sense so oddly


---------75:21----------
enough i think that


---------75:22----------
much like the other insults that i've


---------75:24----------
spoken to i think your [ __ ] is a bunch


---------75:27----------
of confirmation bias


---------75:29----------
piled on top of a faulty assumption


---------75:35----------
okay yeah that that sort of makes sense


---------75:37----------
what do you think the faulty assumption


---------75:39----------
is


---------75:40----------
that i'm ugly or either that you're ugly


---------75:44----------
or i'd say even in a broader sense that


---------75:46----------
you're


---------75:46----------
you're not worth valuing


---------75:50----------
damn right and we hear


---------75:53----------
subtle tones of that i think ugliness is


---------75:56----------
just the face of it


---------75:59----------
but we hear subtle tones of it when you


---------76:01----------
when you said that you used to


---------76:02----------
acknowledge yourself


---------76:04----------
and then at some point you started


---------76:06----------
needing acknowledgement from other


---------76:08----------
people


---------76:09----------
and you noticed that you needed


---------76:10----------
acknowledgement from other people in


---------76:12----------
high school


---------76:13----------
but i think that that sense of that's


---------76:15----------
when you already needed acknowledgement


---------76:18----------
the hunger was already there in high


---------76:20----------
school so the question is where did the


---------76:21----------
hunger start


---------76:22----------
i think it started earlier


---------76:25----------
and if i had to put my my money on a


---------76:27----------
couple of things and we'd have to talk


---------76:29----------
more so oftentimes


---------76:30----------
these hypotheses it's not that this


---------76:32----------
hypothesis has a high likelihood of


---------76:34----------
being correct


---------76:35----------
but this is the best that i can come up


---------76:37----------
with may have something to do with your


---------76:38----------
parents


---------76:39----------
may have something to do with your mom's


---------76:41----------
boyfriends may have something to do with


---------76:43----------
your dad


---------76:45----------
may have something to do with school and


---------76:47----------
you feeling like you didn't live up to


---------76:49----------
your potential


---------76:51----------
and the more that you don't feel like


---------76:53----------
you lived up to your potential


---------76:55----------
the more you need other people to


---------76:57----------
confirm for you that you have potential


---------76:59----------
or that you have value because you don't


---------77:02----------
get it from it here


---------77:03----------
so you need it from outside and if you


---------77:06----------
needed it from outside in high school


---------77:08----------
i think you started losing that


---------77:10----------
confidence in yourself probably around


---------77:12----------
middle school


---------77:14----------
and we even hear like a couple of tones


---------77:16----------
of that right because you were


---------77:17----------
interested in girls in middle school


---------77:18----------
then you stopped in high school which is


---------77:20----------
a little bit strange


---------77:24----------
yeah so i i don't know if this is like


---------77:28----------
one of those stories of like you know


---------77:30----------
and we kind of heard a couple of


---------77:31----------
different tones of this from your dad


---------77:33----------
where it sounds like


---------77:34----------
there's a part of you that feels like


---------77:36----------
your dad should have done better


---------77:39----------
but then you also accept blame


---------77:42----------
yeah i found it hard to just blame


---------77:44----------
somebody absolutely because i know


---------77:46----------
people are complicated and it's hard to


---------77:47----------
just


---------77:48----------
it's not it's not except women you can


---------77:50----------
blame them absolutely very easily


---------77:54----------
yeah i guess i guess i bet i think like


---------77:57----------
i mean blaming individuals like uh


---------78:00----------
blaming people and likes a specific


---------78:02----------
person


---------78:03----------
sure so here's here's a pro tip okay


---------78:06----------
so here's how you move forward you have


---------78:09----------
any idea


---------78:11----------
uh no no okay first thing is stop


---------78:14----------
treating women as a class


---------78:15----------
and start treating them as individuals


---------78:18----------
okay what do you think about that i mean


---------78:22----------
it's something i've been told before but


---------78:23----------
i think


---------78:24----------
i mean it makes sense in general yeah


---------78:26----------
okay


---------78:27----------
so and and some of them are going to be


---------78:29----------
[ __ ] right so like


---------78:31----------
you shouldn't you you don't want to go


---------78:33----------
like white knight


---------78:35----------
and like milady them to death that's


---------78:38----------
also treating them like a class by the


---------78:39----------
way


---------78:41----------
it's still dehumanizing them and not


---------78:43----------
treating them as individuals


---------78:47----------
i'd say that's the first thing second


---------78:50----------
thing is give yourself some time


---------78:52----------
because i i know it can be frustrating


---------78:54----------
to hear but you're young


---------78:55----------
and what i mean by time and you're young


---------78:58----------
is give yourself


---------78:59----------
some opportunity for new experience


---------79:05----------
give yourself the opportunity to change


---------79:07----------
your thinking


---------79:09----------
i'm not saying just like change your


---------79:10----------
thinking because your thinking is wrong


---------79:12----------
if it's your thinking it's your thinking


---------79:13----------
there's no reason that my thinking


---------79:15----------
should be better than your thinking


---------79:17----------
so if there's a part of you that's still


---------79:18----------
convinced that women are going to reject


---------79:20----------
you because you're [ __ ] ugly then


---------79:21----------
that's


---------79:22----------
fine you can think that


---------79:25----------
what i'm saying is that give yourself


---------79:27----------
the opportunity to change your mind


---------79:30----------
give yourself the opportunity for an


---------79:32----------
interaction


---------79:33----------
watch that thought process give you a


---------79:36----------
reason to explain


---------79:37----------
any interaction with a woman from this


---------79:38----------
day forward


---------79:40----------
you're gonna like have like you're gonna


---------79:41----------
dm a woman and then she's gonna say


---------79:43----------
something to you


---------79:44----------
and then that part of your mind that


---------79:45----------
programming that incel is gonna start


---------79:47----------
giving you reasons and answers


---------79:50----------
oh see she this is because i'm ugly it's


---------79:52----------
like dude the lady hasn't even seen you


---------79:54----------
yet


---------79:55----------
but she knows i'm ugly because i have


---------79:56----------
not i don't show my face


---------79:58----------
on voice calls it's that unfalsifiable


---------80:00----------
hypothesis kind of reasoning


---------80:02----------
you see that yeah


---------80:06----------
and then so give yourself the


---------80:08----------
opportunity to learn or have a different


---------80:10----------
kind of experience


---------80:13----------
and the last thing is you know let the


---------80:16----------
women


---------80:16----------
come if you want it they'll come in time


---------80:20----------
ganny what you should really focus on is


---------80:22----------
yourself


---------80:23----------
because right now i don't think you're a


---------80:25----------
dude that's like worth


---------80:26----------
being in a relationship with and i don't


---------80:29----------
mean that like personally to make you


---------80:30----------
feel bad i just don't think most 19 year


---------80:32----------
olds are


---------80:34----------
and give yourself like the benefit to


---------80:35----------
like grow exactly as you are doing and


---------80:37----------
actually you've made huge strides on


---------80:39----------
that


---------80:40----------
over the last couple weeks that i've


---------80:41----------
gotten to know you continue


---------80:43----------
working on yourself and then like you


---------80:46----------
know give yourself a chance to like feel


---------80:48----------
good about yourself so think about what


---------80:49----------
it is that you want to accomplish


---------80:51----------
and don't make it too high it's not


---------80:53----------
about living up to your genius iq


---------80:57----------
it's about like you know setting things


---------80:58----------
setting small goals for yourself that


---------81:00----------
you can actually set yourself to do


---------81:03----------
and try to do them start small


---------81:07----------
how do you climb a mountain ganny well i


---------81:10----------
guess one step at a time


---------81:12----------
absolutely and just because you're an iq


---------81:15----------
and have a bunch of potential


---------81:17----------
that just means you're trying to cl


---------81:19----------
mount everest instead of mount


---------81:20----------
kilimanjaro


---------81:23----------
so don't get confused because oddly


---------81:25----------
enough i think intelligence is a burden


---------81:27----------
it makes your life harder not easier


---------81:30----------
what do you think about that


---------81:32----------
yeah i know i've seen that in my life


---------81:34----------
for sure


---------81:36----------
right so one of my supervisors once told


---------81:38----------
me that


---------81:39----------
giftedness is a special need you should


---------81:42----------
treat gif


---------81:43----------
treat gifted children like special needs


---------81:45----------
children


---------81:46----------
and generally speaking we think about


---------81:47----------
special needs children as handicapped in


---------81:50----------
some way


---------81:51----------
but i don't think that that's a fair way


---------81:53----------
to put it


---------81:54----------
i think giftedness is a special need and


---------81:57----------
those kids do need to be treated


---------81:58----------
differently


---------82:00----------
they need to be challenged differently


---------82:01----------
they need to be supported differently


---------82:04----------
they oftentimes get into this issue of


---------82:06----------
like having way too much potential


---------82:08----------
because they're told


---------82:09----------
like you're a five-year-old who's told


---------82:11----------
like hey you have a bunch of potential


---------82:14----------
and then just imagine what that does to


---------82:16----------
a five-year-old psyche


---------82:20----------
how does a five-year-old live up to its


---------82:22----------
potential


---------82:24----------
yeah when you say yeah what does that


---------82:27----------
mean


---------82:28----------
i'm asking because it's a it's a lot to


---------82:30----------
expect from somebody especially at such


---------82:32----------
a young age and it's a lot to put on


---------82:33----------
their plate like a lot but what are you


---------82:34----------
even putting on their plate how do they


---------82:36----------
live up to their potential


---------82:38----------
i guess they have to live up i guess


---------82:40----------
that to be kind of a bit more patient


---------82:41----------
and not expect everything to come


---------82:43----------
immediately but how does a five-year-old


---------82:45----------
understand any of that [ __ ]


---------82:47----------
i guess the point is the five-year-old


---------82:49----------
doesn't absolutely it is impossible to


---------82:51----------
live up to your potential as a


---------82:52----------
five-year-old


---------82:53----------
because you don't even know what that


---------82:54----------
means all you know is that you have


---------82:56----------
potential you have no idea how to live


---------82:57----------
up to it


---------82:58----------
and your parents don't even know how to


---------82:59----------
move on to it but the burden gets placed


---------83:02----------
on you then


---------83:03----------
and your five-year-old little brain


---------83:05----------
doesn't know what it's supposed to be


---------83:07----------
doing


---------83:07----------
all it knows it is that it's supposed to


---------83:09----------
be doing more than everyone else


---------83:12----------
that's all a five-year-old understands


---------83:14----------
about living up to their potential


---------83:18----------
and so you were placed on an impossible


---------83:21----------
road at a very young age


---------83:22----------
and you found yourself not walking it


---------83:28----------
and so then you became insecure about


---------83:29----------
yourself


---------83:31----------
because you feel like a failure like you


---------83:34----------
haven't lived up to your potential


---------83:38----------
and then your insecurity finds something


---------83:40----------
oh looks


---------83:41----------
at least that's something we can wrap


---------83:43----------
our head around


---------83:45----------
the cosmic potential of your life is


---------83:47----------
like i don't even know


---------83:48----------
how to wrap your head around that and so


---------83:50----------
your mind finds looks


---------83:52----------
and it finds women and ah see how


---------83:54----------
insecure we are


---------83:55----------
now everything makes sense because we


---------83:57----------
have a system


---------83:59----------
we have a system to understand our


---------84:00----------
insecurity we have an explanation for


---------84:03----------
our weakness


---------84:05----------
because the world makes sense if you're


---------84:07----------
an incel


---------84:10----------
and you have a bunch of people on the


---------84:11----------
internet


---------84:13----------
telling you things and it fits


---------84:16----------
it feels good it resonates with your


---------84:20----------
experience of life


---------84:22----------
and that's the saddest [ __ ] thing


---------84:23----------
because it's actually not true


---------84:27----------
you indoctrinate yourself to believe


---------84:28----------
that you're unattractive


---------84:30----------
and like not valuable to women


---------84:33----------
and the really sad thing is that's just


---------84:35----------
not true man


---------84:39----------
you seem to be a guy who like cares a


---------84:41----------
lot about growing as a human being and i


---------84:44----------
can guarantee you that that's what makes


---------84:46----------
a good partner


---------84:48----------
i know a lot of people want to just get


---------84:50----------
laid and whatnot and chads and stacys


---------84:52----------
and plates and all that kind of good


---------84:53----------
stuff but


---------84:53----------
if you're talking about actually


---------84:55----------
building a relationship


---------84:56----------
the hard thing about a successful


---------84:58----------
relationship is that you start as two


---------85:00----------
people


---------85:00----------
and then you change because if you dart


---------85:04----------
it started dating someone tomorrow


---------85:05----------
ganymede like


---------85:07----------
in five years you would be a completely


---------85:09----------
different person and she would be a


---------85:10----------
completely different person


---------85:13----------
and then five years after that you would


---------85:16----------
change again


---------85:19----------
and so the most important thing i think


---------85:21----------
for a healthy and successful


---------85:22----------
relationship


---------85:23----------
is someone who's willing to change


---------85:26----------
not like become what your partner wants


---------85:29----------
you to become but become


---------85:30----------
what your partner needs you to be


---------85:33----------
and what you need yourself to be and so


---------85:36----------
give yourself the opportunity to do that


---------85:44----------
yeah that makes sense i guess in some


---------85:45----------
ways like if


---------85:47----------
if the opportunity presents itself to be


---------85:50----------
in a relationship and i'm not prepared


---------85:51----------
mentally that could probably


---------85:53----------
like the consequences for that could be


---------85:55----------
pretty bad too absolutely so does that


---------85:57----------
mean you should be in the relationship


---------86:00----------
not not quite i guess not incorrect


---------86:06----------
oh


---------86:10----------
why is that incorrect dude man go for it


---------86:14----------
if you have the opportunity to engage in


---------86:15----------
a relationship


---------86:17----------
yeah i guess because you still learn to


---------86:18----------
get something out of it absolutely man


---------86:22----------
right and at the end of the day like i'm


---------86:24----------
one of these old school noobs who


---------86:25----------
believes in love


---------86:27----------
and i still like i have a pretty you


---------86:29----------
know like i think i


---------86:31----------
i'm a believer in one itis i don't think


---------86:34----------
that is a bad thing


---------86:36----------
so you know i definitely do think that


---------86:38----------
people can get overly obsessed with one


---------86:40----------
human being and sometimes that can be


---------86:42----------
harmful but i don't think it's like one


---------86:44----------
itis is a class of stuff is bad


---------86:47----------
right love can definitely be like


---------86:49----------
awesome and it can also be devastating


---------86:53----------
one itis if you pick the wrong person


---------86:55----------
and you're not willing to let them go


---------86:57----------
or you should invest in people who are


---------87:00----------
willing to invest in you


---------87:02----------
and if one itis means investing i think


---------87:04----------
a lot of times what it


---------87:05----------
ends up meaning when they kind of talk


---------87:07----------
about it in a negative way is it's


---------87:08----------
essentially investing in a relationship


---------87:10----------
that's that isn't reciprocated


---------87:11----------
that i think is unhealthy but it all


---------87:14----------
depends on the person and ganny i think


---------87:18----------
if you have the opportunity for a


---------87:20----------
relationship


---------87:20----------
even if you're not ready i'd say give it


---------87:22----------
a shot


---------87:24----------
and then learn because oftentimes we're


---------87:28----------
not


---------87:28----------
we don't become ready before we do


---------87:31----------
things


---------87:32----------
i don't know how else to put that does


---------87:34----------
that make sense


---------87:37----------
not not quite what do you mean by that


---------87:39----------
so is anyone ready to be a parent


---------87:42----------
not not quite now how do you become a


---------87:46----------
competent parent


---------87:47----------
you have to parent you have to have


---------87:49----------
experience absolutely bro


---------87:52----------
so you may never be ready for a


---------87:53----------
relationship don't let that stop you man


---------88:00----------
yeah i guess that's the way to think


---------88:02----------
about it yeah


---------88:04----------
just fail magnificently you shouldn't


---------88:06----------
avoid failure just fail magnificently


---------88:08----------
just go for it man


---------88:10----------
well you're the normal part of learning


---------88:12----------
i mean if you don't fail


---------88:13----------
what are you what are you gonna do right


---------88:15----------
you're gonna lay on the ground and do


---------88:17----------
nothing which is exactly what we love to


---------88:18----------
do


---------88:19----------
that's us man now we come full circle


---------88:22----------
so i think we're done for today because


---------88:25----------
that's it


---------88:25----------
right yeah


---------88:29----------
you can blame the world and do nothing


---------88:30----------
or you can fail magnificently


---------88:33----------
but don't get don't confuse yourself


---------88:35----------
because success is not an option


---------88:37----------
take success off of your plate your two


---------88:40----------
options are to do nothing or fail


---------88:42----------
magnificently


---------88:43----------
your life will transform overnight


---------88:46----------
if you internalize this idea


---------88:50----------
do not attach yourself to the outcomes


---------88:52----------
of your actions


---------88:53----------
devote yourself to the action themselves


---------88:58----------
i guess don't go into things with a


---------89:00----------
specific expectation about what you want


---------89:01----------
out of it but just


---------89:02----------
do just do what you need to do yeah and


---------89:05----------
it's okay to want something right it's


---------89:07----------
okay to have an expectation but just


---------89:09----------
acknowledge that that's an expectation


---------89:10----------
and don't hold yourself to it


---------89:18----------
questions uh i don't have any questions


---------89:22----------
right now i can't think of anything


---------89:23----------
right off the bat so


---------89:25----------
so i have a very challenging meditation


---------89:27----------
exercise for you if you want to try it


---------89:29----------
okay sure okay can you turn your camera


---------89:32----------
back on


---------89:33----------
well i was gonna ask you to take your


---------89:35----------
mask off or at least think about taking


---------89:37----------
your mask off


---------89:38----------
and i wanted you to notice the


---------89:40----------
insecurity that arises within you


---------89:47----------
what do you think about that i can take


---------89:49----------
it off anyways


---------89:50----------
yeah but you have to do it on camera


---------89:52----------
that's the whole point


---------89:53----------
oh [ __ ] well i'm sorry about that that's


---------89:56----------
okay


---------89:58----------
so see if you can get your phone


---------89:59----------
charging


---------90:02----------
that's okay okay so this


---------90:05----------
this is what i want you to do again so


---------90:06----------
sit up straight


---------90:08----------
okay it's not the same unless you're on


---------90:10----------
camera you know what i'm saying


---------90:12----------
yeah i know i get i get what you're


---------90:13----------
trying to go for what am i trying to go


---------90:15----------
for


---------90:16----------
you're trying to get me to kind of


---------90:18----------
accept the way i look or not be so


---------90:20----------
no good god no holy [ __ ] that's hard


---------90:25----------
i'm not trying to get you to accept


---------90:26----------
anything


---------90:28----------
what i'm trying to get you to do sorry


---------90:30----------
for cutting you off


---------90:33----------
but no no no none of that none of that


---------90:34----------
feel good except yourself [ __ ]


---------90:38----------
what i want you to do is face your


---------90:39----------
overwhelming fear


---------90:46----------
yeah i guess


---------90:50----------
i'm going to see if i can find because


---------90:51----------
i'm going to see if i can


---------90:53----------
uh try a different chord and see if it


---------90:55----------
charges hold on


---------90:56----------
good look at the balls on this one to a


---------91:00----------
chat


---------91:02----------
oh god i hate all this positivity stuff


---------91:06----------
except who i am is it ugly [ __ ]


---------91:11----------
embrace your ugliness


---------91:14----------
no man it's it's it's not about that


---------91:18----------
it's not about are you still around yeah


---------91:21----------
i know i'm here but


---------91:22----------
it might take a little while to charge


---------91:23----------
okay take your time bro


---------91:26----------
chad chad is willing to wait for the big


---------91:28----------
reveal


---------91:30----------
gotta keep us in suspense for education


---------91:33----------
and entertainment purposes zone


---------91:37----------
so here's here's the idea behind the


---------91:38----------
practice


---------91:41----------
so earlier uh again i'm just going to


---------91:43----------
talk about you in the third person while


---------91:44----------
you


---------91:45----------
look for it because i don't know if


---------91:46----------
you're here or not okay okay sure go


---------91:48----------
ahead


---------91:49----------
okay so here's the thing so


---------91:52----------
ganny has a belief about himself i love


---------91:54----------
i love your phrasing by the way reel


---------91:56----------
500 iq play there it gives it oxygen


---------92:00----------
right so the interesting thing that i


---------92:01----------
want you to do today in meditation


---------92:03----------
is don't worry about like whether you're


---------92:05----------
actually ugly or not that's not the


---------92:07----------
point


---------92:08----------
the point is if i ask you to take off


---------92:09----------
the mask


---------92:11----------
the insecurity is gonna like awaken


---------92:13----------
awaken like like a slumbering dragon


---------92:16----------
and it's gonna wake up and it's gonna be


---------92:18----------
like no no no no don't do it


---------92:20----------
what i want you to do and even you can


---------92:22----------
fail at taking the mask off you can stop


---------92:24----------
yourself from doing it that's fine too


---------92:27----------
it's not really about whether you take


---------92:28----------
the mask off or not but it kinda is


---------92:31----------
it's about noticing that within yourself


---------92:34----------
there is a force that tries to control


---------92:36----------
you


---------92:38----------
right and that's the force of insecurity


---------92:41----------
and literally like think about what the


---------92:43----------
force of


---------92:44----------
insecurity is doing to you


---------92:47----------
if we think about the actual physical


---------92:49----------
action of taking a mask off it's nothing


---------92:54----------
right it's just like i can think of


---------92:56----------
another thing to do here if this


---------92:58----------
takes too long i have a laptop that has


---------93:00----------
a webcam on it it's kind of shitty but


---------93:02----------
good enough can i troll you for a second


---------93:06----------
kenny


---------93:07----------
yeah sure if you're ugly is it better to


---------93:10----------
have a shitty webcam or a good


---------93:12----------
webcam i should you i can


---------93:17----------
alright boot up your laptop bro okay


---------93:22----------
so anyway well i hope you guys


---------93:23----------
understand what i'm saying so we're


---------93:24----------
gonna see


---------93:26----------
the the feeling of insecurity so like


---------93:28----------
notice that


---------93:29----------
you know the the physical action of


---------93:31----------
taking a mask off is just you know you


---------93:33----------
just pluck out the little


---------93:34----------
strings and then it's off right it's


---------93:35----------
like five seconds


---------93:37----------
but you can't do it you can't do it it


---------93:40----------
won't let you do it


---------93:42----------
right your mind won't let you do that


---------93:45----------
thing


---------93:46----------
she was pretending he ghosted me that's


---------93:48----------
okay


---------93:50----------
if ganny ghosts us so be it isn't


---------93:52----------
security one out which is okay


---------93:54----------
remember it's not about so it's not


---------93:56----------
about saying no thank you i don't feel


---------93:58----------
comfortable doing it


---------93:59----------
if you're gonna fail do it magnificently


---------94:01----------
and leave twitch chat waiting for like


---------94:03----------
30


---------94:04----------
minutes while you never show up jabaited


---------94:08----------
right yeah so did you guys catch that


---------94:13----------
don't put it in the


---------94:15----------
this guy who's this guy he caught it


---------94:18----------
somebody caught it the insecurity dragon


---------94:20----------
faced itself don't put it in the


---------94:22----------
thumbnail did you guys catch that


---------94:24----------
so you guys see how it like it's so


---------94:26----------
quick


---------94:27----------
so what you guys got to do is is like


---------94:29----------
look at yourself


---------94:31----------
right not if you're ugly though okay now


---------94:33----------
we're gonna do this okay


---------94:35----------
so what i want you to do um


---------94:39----------
is so close your eyes


---------94:42----------
yanny close your eyes and sit up


---------94:44----------
straight and i want you to just notice


---------94:47----------
yourself


---------94:49----------

---------94:50----------
head


---------94:53----------

---------95:18----------
where do you feel that anxiety


---------95:20----------
physically in your body


---------95:24----------
uh mainly in my back and uh in my


---------95:27----------
shoulders


---------95:29----------
okay good eyes closed


---------95:33----------
okay good okay so now i want you to


---------95:36----------
think about taking the mini skull


---------95:38----------
gimme and i want you as i if i as i tell


---------95:41----------

---------95:56----------

---------96:21----------
now so now i i want you to just notice


---------96:24----------
that like


---------96:25----------
there are going to be forces within you


---------96:27----------
that are concerned


---------96:28----------
right so you asked us before it sounds


---------96:31----------
like you're


---------96:32----------
thinking about taking your mask off so


---------96:34----------
that's fine but you mentioned don't put


---------96:36----------
it in the thumbnail


---------96:38----------
so that's a good example yeah that's


---------96:40----------
just like uh


---------96:41----------
yeah tell us about it it's an anonymity


---------96:43----------

---------96:44----------
okay that's fine so so by the way if you


---------96:48----------
want to stay


---------96:49----------
anonymous then you can do that


---------96:52----------
don't i don't want i don't want to


---------96:53----------
pressure you into not being anonymous


---------96:56----------
if you i feel like this is a good


---------96:57----------
example of


---------96:59----------
depriving the insecurity of oxygen and


---------97:02----------
that's why i'm asking you to do this


---------97:04----------
does that is that distinction clear


---------97:08----------
yeah no it makes sense okay do you want


---------97:10----------
to try to deprive your


---------97:11----------
insecurity of oxygen


---------97:15----------
yeah sure okay so then take the mascot


---------97:20----------
eyes closed


---------97:25----------
okay and now how do you feel


---------97:30----------
i feel a little bit exposed now okay


---------97:33----------
good what is the feeling of exposed look


---------97:35----------
feel like


---------97:39----------
uh well i feel kind of uh tense and i


---------97:41----------
don't i know it sounds weird but kind of


---------97:43----------
naked like i feel like there's nothing


---------97:44----------
to


---------97:45----------
cover my uh shame yes good


---------97:48----------
okay so now let let's just look at that


---------97:51----------
for a second can you look at it with me


---------97:53----------
again are you with me buddy did i open


---------97:55----------
my eyes no no no no


---------97:57----------
no no don't open your eyes but just


---------98:00----------
can you listen to the words that i'm


---------98:02----------
saying or does that sense of being


---------98:04----------
exposed overwhelm you


---------98:07----------
no i can listen so now let me ask you


---------98:10----------
something


---------98:12----------
why does someone okay need to


---------98:15----------
not show like when we think about


---------98:17----------
exposing exposing


---------98:19----------
involves seeing what


---------98:24----------
uh well it depends what you're exposing


---------98:26----------
right right but like when we use the


---------98:28----------
word expose we're sort of talking about


---------98:30----------
something unsavory right


---------98:32----------
that's the presumption yeah like if if i


---------98:36----------
you know if i if i go get some flowers


---------98:39----------
from outside i don't expose them in a


---------98:42----------
vase right i display them


---------98:45----------
yeah but displaying and exposing are


---------98:48----------
both


---------98:48----------
showing you with me


---------98:52----------
yeah i know i'm with you so what is it


---------98:54----------
that we expose


---------98:55----------
like it's something unsavory


---------98:59----------
yeah or something that you don't want


---------99:01----------
people don't want to see


---------99:02----------
so wait wait you don't want people to


---------99:05----------
see or people don't want to see


---------99:08----------
something that peop that i that i think


---------99:10----------
both like you don't want people to see


---------99:12----------
in something


---------99:12----------
very good right because now notice this


---------99:15----------
comes from you ganny


---------99:18----------
you don't know what people want to see


---------99:20----------
but you are afraid


---------99:22----------
that if they see it then what's going to


---------99:24----------
happen


---------99:27----------
that they're gonna judge me they're


---------99:29----------
gonna think badly poorly me like


---------99:31----------
like look down on me okay and what what


---------99:34----------
and what judgments are they gonna have


---------99:35----------
for you


---------99:39----------
uh they're they're probably gonna think


---------99:41----------
i'm ugly like that's what i think people


---------99:42----------
are gonna think


---------99:44----------
okay


---------99:47----------
so now do you feel like people are


---------99:49----------
thinking no looking


---------99:51----------
no peeking at twitch chat okay sorry do


---------99:54----------
you feel ugly


---------99:58----------
kind of yeah okay so now i want you to


---------100:02----------
focus on your breath for a second so


---------100:05----------
notice that there's a feeling of


---------100:06----------
ugliness like what the [ __ ] is that even


---------100:11----------
like ugliness is not yeah it's hard to


---------100:13----------
explain it's weird right because like we


---------100:15----------
think about ugliness as a physical


---------100:17----------
attribute correct yeah


---------100:21----------
but like it's not


---------100:24----------
it's a feeling what holds you back is a


---------100:27----------
feeling


---------100:28----------
it's not a truth does that make sense


---------100:32----------
yeah i know it makes sense okay so just


---------100:35----------
notice that feeling of ugliness lynn


---------100:37----------
like


---------100:37----------
tell me a little bit about it


---------100:42----------
uh well it's it's i mean it's obviously


---------100:45----------
a negative feeling and i feel i i don't


---------100:47----------
know i kind of feel it in my gut right


---------100:48----------
now like


---------100:49----------
i feel like i'm making a mistake i don't


---------100:51----------
know good okay good


---------100:53----------
right so this is it's it's a protective


---------100:55----------
mechanism something in your body is


---------100:57----------
warning


---------100:58----------
yeah do you see that


---------101:03----------
so now i'm going to ask you a couple


---------101:05----------
questions ganny


---------101:06----------
what has happened in the past when you


---------101:09----------
have shown


---------101:10----------
yourself to other people i was about to


---------101:13----------
say exposed but that would be weird


---------101:15----------
negative negative things to say about it


---------101:18----------
and when was the first time you felt


---------101:20----------
this way


---------101:23----------
uh the first time i felt this way was um


---------101:25----------
[Music]


---------101:26----------
i can't even remember like probably not


---------101:29----------
too long ago


---------101:31----------
we're not not not too long probably like


---------101:32----------
a little while ago


---------101:34----------
okay this feeling of being exposed


---------101:38----------
and fear of judgment


---------101:42----------
that's a feeling that's new to you


---------101:47----------
uh um


---------101:50----------
no not really okay how long is has that


---------101:55----------
feeling been familiar


---------101:58----------
for like a few years now okay


---------102:01----------
and so would it be fair to say i'm gonna


---------102:03----------
try to put words to it okay you let me


---------102:05----------
know if


---------102:05----------
i'm not trying to lead you but you let


---------102:07----------
me know if i'm right or wrong


---------102:08----------
okay are you afraid of what other people


---------102:12----------
will see you as


---------102:15----------
definitely yeah okay how long


---------102:18----------
have you been ashamed of what's inside


---------102:25----------
like what's i feel like i'm more ashamed


---------102:26----------
of what's outside than what's inside


---------102:28----------
honestly


---------102:28----------
okay how long have you been ashamed of


---------102:30----------
it


---------102:33----------
uh i think for like a few years now okay


---------102:37----------
so now i want you to pause for a second


---------102:39----------
and think about this


---------102:41----------
you've already exposed yourself


---------102:44----------
it's done you've taken your mask off


---------102:52----------
what do you think about that


---------102:55----------
i'm not sure if i'm gonna regret this


---------102:57----------
but i mean i already did it there's


---------102:58----------
nothing i can do about it now


---------102:59----------
yeah do you regret it right now


---------103:03----------
a little bit okay good tell me about


---------103:06----------
that feeling of regret


---------103:09----------
um


---------103:12----------
i don't know i just feel uh


---------103:16----------
i i feel like like like now kind of like


---------103:19----------
uh


---------103:19----------
it's like i've opened paint doors box


---------103:21----------
and i don't know what's gonna happen as


---------103:22----------
a result of me showing my face


---------103:24----------
here like right now in this moment good


---------103:27----------
do you know


---------103:28----------
so i want you to just take a snapshot of


---------103:30----------
how you feel


---------103:31----------
is there any feeling besides the


---------103:33----------
pandora's box


---------103:36----------
uh well part of me feels like at least


---------103:38----------
at least out there like at least now i


---------103:40----------
don't have to hide or


---------103:41----------
i'm not hiding to the same extent


---------103:42----------
anymore yep


---------103:45----------
so i want you to take a snapshot of how


---------103:47----------
you feel right now


---------103:49----------
do you know what we call how you feel


---------103:51----------
right now there's a word for this


---------103:53----------
emotion


---------103:54----------
can you guess what it is what is that


---------103:56----------
should we ask twitch chat or security


---------103:58----------
nope incorrect just tell me


---------104:01----------
this is what we call courage


---------104:05----------
oh really yeah how does courage feel


---------104:10----------
well when you put it like courage i feel


---------104:12----------
a little bit better like i feel like i'm


---------104:14----------
at least


---------104:14----------
making a good decision rather than a bad


---------104:16----------
one


---------104:17----------
uh it could be a bad decision right


---------104:20----------
pandora's box and all that


---------104:21----------
yeah here's the crazy yeah here's the


---------104:24----------
crazy thing about courage courage


---------104:26----------
doesn't feel good


---------104:27----------
we make it sound like a good emotion


---------104:29----------
yeah but it's not a good emotion


---------104:31----------
courage is awful what do you think about


---------104:35----------
that yeah


---------104:37----------
no it makes sense yeah


---------104:41----------
and so now i want you to try to


---------104:44----------
appreciate yourself for a moment


---------104:47----------
right that like you did it


---------104:51----------
and you decided to take a chance


---------104:54----------
and it could end up terribly


---------105:00----------
i don't i don't think it's going to


---------105:02----------
really


---------105:03----------
i don't think it is danny yeah but


---------105:07----------
facing the fear is actually the hardest


---------105:09----------
part


---------105:13----------
right it it's it's the insecurity that


---------105:16----------
holds us back from


---------105:17----------
acting that's the hard part


---------105:20----------
we're controlled by like these feelings


---------105:23----------
on the inside


---------105:24----------
ugliness is not even a thing there's no


---------105:26----------
there's no like it's not a thing


---------105:28----------
you're just i'm just talking to a guy on


---------105:30----------
stream


---------105:32----------
if we had never had this conversation


---------105:34----------
and we talked about what your favorite


---------105:35----------
video game was for an hour and a half


---------105:37----------
you would be the same exact person


---------105:38----------
twitch wouldn't know anything about you


---------105:40----------
being afraid that you were ugly


---------105:45----------
it's all coming from you man it's not


---------105:47----------
that the world judges you in a


---------105:48----------
particular way it's not that some woman


---------105:50----------
sure people can call you ugly from time


---------105:52----------
to time like that one particular woman


---------105:54----------
called you ugly


---------105:54----------
but that's because she's got her own


---------105:56----------
social justice [ __ ] that


---------105:58----------
is going on or whatever yeah


---------106:02----------
right you are what you are nothing can


---------106:04----------
change that


---------106:06----------
and the world can judge you but any kind


---------106:09----------
of judgment if you give into it is going


---------106:11----------
to be damaging


---------106:12----------
and here's the crazy thing the white


---------106:14----------
world judged you for being brilliant and


---------106:16----------
what did that do to you


---------106:20----------
it it i mean it kind of the correct word


---------106:23----------
is


---------106:23----------
[ __ ] you it [ __ ] you yeah


---------106:28----------
and that's such a but who wouldn't want


---------106:30----------
to be judged is brilliant


---------106:32----------
or beautiful all judgment [ __ ] you


---------106:36----------
that's what judgment does


---------106:39----------
big truth that buddha discovered


---------106:42----------
all judgment is bad you are what you are


---------106:45----------
ganny whether you're ugly or you're


---------106:46----------
attractive or whatever


---------106:47----------
you have no idea it's not my place to


---------106:50----------
say


---------106:51----------
what i can say is that you're courageous


---------106:54----------
what i can say is that you haven't


---------106:56----------
figured everything out yet and thank god


---------106:58----------
for that


---------106:59----------
because if you had figured everything


---------107:00----------
out then your conclusions mean that your


---------107:02----------
life would suck


---------107:04----------
all it takes is courage


---------107:08----------
courage and an open mind


---------107:11----------
and give yourself the chance to change


---------107:16----------
okay how do you feel right now


---------107:20----------
uh a little bit nervous i don't know


---------107:23----------
good


---------107:24----------
see i'm i'm telling you all these really


---------107:26----------
inspiring words


---------107:28----------
and what's happening inside you well i


---------107:32----------
feel a little bit better about it but


---------107:33----------
it's still i don't know i'm gonna need


---------107:35----------
sometimes


---------107:36----------
a few days to think about what just


---------107:37----------
happened fantastic that's what we want


---------107:39----------
you to do but what's happening inside


---------107:41----------
you see that little thing it's like an


---------107:42----------
animal


---------107:44----------
yeah i can say as much as dr k inspiring


---------107:47----------
[ __ ] as i want to that animal is still


---------107:49----------
there do you see how it has a life of


---------107:50----------
its own


---------107:53----------
yeah but that's not you man


---------107:56----------
that's it can you see that it is


---------107:59----------
separate from you


---------108:03----------
kind of yeah okay so now i want you to


---------108:05----------
try something


---------108:06----------
one last thing put the mask back on


---------108:10----------
okay i don't know if this is on straight


---------108:14----------
so that doesn't matter is that the beast


---------108:17----------
talking again


---------108:19----------
now the mask is on do you feel safe yeah


---------108:23----------
a little bit yeah okay


---------108:26----------
i feel like it's already been exposed so


---------108:28----------
it's like what can i do now


---------108:30----------
exactly but still so despite the fact


---------108:32----------
that that


---------108:33----------
what can you do now you still feel a


---------108:34----------
little bit safer now take it off again


---------108:43----------
do you feel feel re-exposed


---------108:46----------
yeah i do it's weird right but even then


---------108:50----------
like nothing has changed people have


---------108:51----------
seen your face already


---------108:54----------
it doesn't make any sense it's just this


---------108:56----------
thing inside you that has a life of its


---------108:58----------
own it's not logical it's not


---------109:01----------
true in any way shape or form does that


---------109:03----------
make sense it's just like


---------109:04----------
it like mask is on oh i feel better mask


---------109:07----------
is off again oh i feel worse again like


---------109:08----------
what the [ __ ]


---------109:09----------
you've had it off for the last five


---------109:10----------
minutes like what difference does it


---------109:11----------
make


---------109:13----------
that insecurity doesn't care it's not


---------109:15----------
logical


---------109:17----------
and it'll find whatever reasons it can


---------109:19----------
to justify its existence and convince


---------109:21----------
you otherwise


---------109:23----------
so practice not listening to it


---------109:27----------
practice courage


---------109:30----------
and then one day you'll be ready to talk


---------109:33----------
to a woman


---------109:36----------
