---------02:39----------
available to you but you don't seem to


---------02:41----------
take advantage of it yes and what I'm


---------02:44----------
hearing from you is that you'd like to


---------02:45----------
understand why that is and maybe start


---------02:49----------
changing that yeah okay let's go with


---------02:53----------
that okay you say let's go with that is


---------02:58----------
that what you were actually looking for


---------03:00----------

---------03:25----------
so tell me what-what would you like to


---------03:27----------
do


---------03:34----------

---------03:39----------
moment or like what do I want to be in


---------03:42----------
the future let's do all three oh boy


---------03:51----------
well I always wanted to be good at


---------03:54----------
something absolutely I also want to feel


---------04:01----------
fulfilled which I haven't had in a long


---------04:04----------
time


---------04:05----------
okay or fell flat in a long time I've


---------04:08----------
wanted to get into better shape okay


---------04:11----------
that's why I got the exercise bike


---------04:15----------
and


---------04:20----------
I want the career in something related


---------04:22----------
to electronics less computers but okay


---------04:28----------
that's that's it I guess that's it


---------04:32----------
that's funny man


---------04:34----------
uh-uh that's it that's it's like it's a


---------04:37----------
small thing yeah yeah so so what's


---------04:41----------
getting in the way of you are


---------04:43----------
accomplishing all of those things


---------04:48----------
me how that's a very zen answer what


---------04:52----------
does that mean


---------04:53----------
I mean


---------04:58----------
you


---------05:00----------
me as in


---------05:04----------
my thoughts okay I guess what does that


---------05:07----------
mean your thoughts


---------05:13----------
well for example today I


---------05:20----------
it's a curtain that we needed to get


---------05:21----------
groceries


---------05:24----------
I acknowledged this and I mean like that


---------05:26----------
yes I could go well not I thought that I


---------05:29----------
could go that going there would be easy


---------05:31----------
okay that I could do it


---------05:35----------
it's in my possibilities in my


---------05:40----------
capabilities to do it


---------05:42----------
but I proceeded to just stay and just


---------05:47----------
like still on in


---------05:51----------
I mean while I'm thinking like yeah it's


---------05:56----------
just you on it and eventually like it


---------06:00----------
just go away because I kind of gave up


---------06:02----------
on it okay so give me one moment so I'm


---------06:07----------
gonna pull twitch chat real quick and


---------06:09----------
I'm gonna ask you to draw up what I want


---------06:12----------
to know is do you want to talk about do


---------06:15----------
you want to approach this from a


---------06:16----------
neuroscience perspective a psychology


---------06:20----------
perspective or a spiritual perspective


---------06:22----------
because we can do all three and let's


---------06:26----------
see what twitch chat wants to


---------06:29----------
you


---------06:33----------
what do you think Jorah what do you want


---------06:40----------
[Music]


---------06:51----------
that had to pick Nero and psychology but


---------06:55----------
okay I'm I'm fine with all okay so


---------07:05----------
when was the last time you had a good


---------07:07----------
day


---------07:13----------
you


---------07:16----------
you


---------07:19----------
a good day


---------07:27----------
actually there was a


---------07:31----------
there's one day it was two weeks ago


---------07:39----------
it was


---------07:45----------
it's like everything I lined up like


---------07:49----------
I didn't have to do like I was alone at


---------07:53----------
home my mom was a Dean of the town my


---------07:56----------
dad was at work and


---------08:01----------
just flowed and like okay there's like


---------08:05----------
no there was no like


---------08:07----------
stops in what I was going to do that day


---------08:11----------
okay


---------08:14----------
very very important observation right so


---------08:17----------
what you're saying is that you went from


---------08:19----------
the first productive thing to the second


---------08:20----------
productive thing to the third productive


---------08:22----------
thing to the fourth yes if this okay yes


---------08:25----------
I'm the same way so the question becomes


---------08:27----------
which one of those things is the most


---------08:30----------
important


---------08:37----------
you


---------08:48----------
mmm


---------08:51----------
you


---------08:56----------
what do you think do you understand my


---------08:58----------
question I think


---------09:03----------
I might have forgot what I said okay


---------09:15----------
I think the


---------09:18----------
kourin part would be just


---------09:29----------
like that there's no interruptions in it


---------09:33----------
okay like excellent right


---------09:35----------
so when is the most critical


---------09:37----------
interruption


---------09:41----------
I know it's kind of a weird quite


---------09:42----------
hardened huh pardon so like it sort of


---------09:47----------
it read my mind question so I think like


---------09:49----------
the first thing that I want you to think


---------09:51----------
of is when you wake up in the morning


---------09:53----------
that's the most important interruption


---------09:59----------
right so you're kind of like the first


---------10:01----------
thing that you do in the day is going to


---------10:02----------
set the tone for the remainder of your


---------10:04----------
day


---------10:07----------
right so you're saying that like like


---------10:09----------
once you did one flick if you've done


---------10:11----------
nothing and you try to do something


---------10:13----------
that's really hard yeah if you've done


---------10:16----------
something is it easier or harder to do


---------10:19----------
something else


---------10:20----------
easier absolutely right so like if


---------10:24----------
you've done two things is it easy or


---------10:26----------
hard to do the third thing


---------10:30----------
easier most of their privacy at the time


---------10:32----------
right so if we think about the fourth


---------10:34----------
thing like at some point we're gonna hit


---------10:35----------
some kind of limit and we'll understand


---------10:37----------
what that is we're like the ten thing


---------10:39----------
may be hard


---------10:40----------
the eleven thing may be really hard the


---------10:42----------
twelfth thing may be really hard but the


---------10:44----------
second thing is easier than the first


---------10:45----------
one the third one is maybe about as easy


---------10:49----------
as the second one does that make sense


---------10:50----------
yes so let me get you what is the


---------10:52----------
critical thing


---------10:55----------
the first absolutely so I don't want you


---------10:59----------
to think about your inability to do so


---------11:02----------
when you look at your life you think


---------11:04----------
about okay like I am unable to do ten


---------11:06----------
things today I can't exercise on the


---------11:08----------
bike I don't use the walking path we


---------11:11----------
didn't talk some about career things


---------11:12----------
like that that's you and so what happens


---------11:15----------
at the end of the day like you feel bad


---------11:17----------
about yourself because you [ __ ] up ten


---------11:20----------
things there were a thousand things you


---------11:22----------
didn't do


---------11:23----------
first thing you need to understand is


---------11:24----------
that you have one battle to win every


---------11:26----------
day


---------11:29----------
that battle is the first one


---------11:32----------
so like if we look at strategically the


---------11:36----------
days that you've done a good job like


---------11:38----------
what was it it's just somehow you


---------11:39----------
magically so we're gonna forget about


---------11:41----------
two three four five six seven eight nine


---------11:44----------
and two something magical happened that


---------11:46----------
allowed you to do the first thing and


---------11:48----------
the cool thing is like once you do the


---------11:49----------
first thing it becomes easier to do


---------11:51----------
number two three and four so what we're


---------11:53----------
gonna try to figure out is how can we


---------11:54----------
structure your life so that like doing


---------11:57----------
stuff is easy for you instead of doing


---------11:59----------
stuff as hard for you


---------12:00----------
does that make sense yeah what I want to


---------12:03----------
start to get into now is like what is


---------12:06----------
the difference we're gonna define a


---------12:07----------
couple of terms okay okay what is


---------12:11----------
motivation


---------12:13----------
[Music]


---------12:19----------
[Music]


---------12:21----------
how are we going to define motivation


---------12:24----------
and twitchchat can help I mean for me it


---------12:29----------
kind of blends in together with


---------12:31----------
willpower some wife okay let's talk


---------12:33----------
about that so blends together so define


---------12:36----------
motivation for me


---------12:49----------
okay so feral cat is saying what keeps


---------12:52----------
you doing tasks even if you don't want


---------12:54----------
to but need to


---------12:59----------
I'd say like the mmm like the source of


---------13:04----------
energy that you used to push through


---------13:06----------
things okay so let me ask you something


---------13:10----------
if I need to use the restroom and I go


---------13:16----------
and use the restroom would you say that


---------13:18----------
that is motivation


---------13:20----------
would you say I'm motivated to use the


---------13:22----------
rest yes yes okay if I need to use the


---------13:25----------
restroom and I don't use the restroom


---------13:28----------
what would you call that


---------13:34----------
he do you see okay that's good but in


---------13:38----------
terms of language like so the first


---------13:41----------
thing that I want people to understand


---------13:42----------
is like motivation is what we're


---------13:44----------
naturally inclined to do right like


---------13:46----------
that's that's what it means


---------13:47----------
motivation is an internal drive that is


---------13:50----------
pushing us in a particular direction


---------13:53----------
like like if I want to if I'm hungry and


---------13:58----------
I have a choice between a hamburger and


---------14:00----------
a salad like what am i motivated towards


---------14:03----------
eating


---------14:08----------
like what do you think


---------14:10----------
I guess the hamburger probably right so


---------14:15----------
I want you guys to understand that like


---------14:16----------
motivation is like when you did numbers


---------14:18----------
two three four and five


---------14:20----------
you felt motivated to do them that day


---------14:22----------
right


---------14:24----------
you didn't actually have to try very


---------14:26----------
hard to do numbers two three four and


---------14:28----------
five you felt like doing it yeah so


---------14:32----------
motivation comes from within and


---------14:34----------
willpower is actually the exact opposite


---------14:38----------
what is willpower


---------14:41----------
you


---------14:46----------
you


---------14:49----------
conscious effort conscious effort yes to


---------14:52----------
do what


---------14:56----------
they do the thing you weren't motivated


---------14:59----------
to do absolutely


---------15:01----------
right


---------15:04----------
so now we've been a couple of different


---------15:06----------
options we can increase your willpower


---------15:10----------
or we can cultivate your motivation


---------15:17----------
those are two different things do you


---------15:19----------
understand that jor oh yeah oh yeah


---------15:23----------
what are you thinking you look like


---------15:25----------
you're thinking a lot


---------15:26----------
yeah


---------15:31----------
I'm thinking which one is more


---------15:33----------
beneficial yeah so we'll get to that


---------15:35----------
right which one do you think is more


---------15:37----------
beneficial


---------15:44----------
I mean we


---------15:46----------
with the motivation part if I have if I


---------15:52----------
get that first step then in that case it


---------15:55----------
would be


---------15:56----------
better but with willpower it would be


---------15:59----------
easier to get to the first step


---------16:01----------
sometimes yeah absolutely so we're gonna


---------16:02----------
talk about both of those now we're gonna


---------16:04----------
talk about a couple of other things


---------16:06----------
what is discipline


---------16:15----------
so cruel yes okay so that's very good


---------16:19----------
self-rule implies that there is a part


---------16:23----------
of you that so self rule implies that


---------16:26----------
you are not one thing right your mind is


---------16:29----------
actually a couple of different things


---------16:31----------
that are fighting against each other so


---------16:33----------
the way that we're gonna try to help you


---------16:35----------
out is by understanding what those


---------16:36----------
different things are and what are the


---------16:38----------
ways that you can like end up creating


---------16:41----------
action so one way is motivation one ways


---------16:44----------
willpower


---------16:45----------
so a lot of gamers feel like they're not


---------16:48----------
motivated do you feel like you're not


---------16:50----------
motivated


---------16:58----------
you


---------17:01----------
when the first thing that came to mind


---------17:03----------
is yes God


---------17:05----------
what's the second thing that came to


---------17:07----------
mind my friend


---------17:10----------
you


---------17:13----------
kind of


---------17:15----------
so it's like first first thing I thought


---------17:19----------
was yes but then it started to like okay


---------17:22----------
am i so let's think about this for a


---------17:25----------
second when you when you had this


---------17:27----------
thought that like you need to get


---------17:28----------
groceries from the grocery store you


---------17:30----------
call that a lack of motivation right


---------17:32----------
what do you do instead


---------17:38----------
they at home yeah and do what be


---------17:41----------
specific


---------17:47----------
they under computer yeah and do what on


---------17:49----------
the computer play a video game watch


---------17:51----------
YouTube what is it


---------17:54----------
cut


---------17:55----------
oh okay so the first thing I want you


---------17:58----------
understand is that like what is that


---------17:59----------
what is it that keeps you at the


---------18:01----------
computer


---------18:10----------
keeps me yeah is it motivation is it


---------18:13----------
discipline is it willpower


---------18:18----------
is it laziness


---------18:25----------
I think it's laziness what is yeah so


---------18:29----------
we're gonna redefine laziness right


---------18:30----------
because all gamers think they're lazy


---------18:32----------
you're not lazy you're motivated to stay


---------18:34----------
at the computer that's what I want you


---------18:35----------
to understand you have a natural


---------18:38----------
internal Drive that is keeping you in


---------18:40----------
your computer chair right that's why we


---------18:42----------
have to start by defining things you


---------18:44----------
have a desire to sit in the computer


---------18:46----------
chair you have a you're motivated to


---------18:47----------
actually sit in the computer chair so


---------18:49----------
the first thing that people need to


---------18:50----------
understand is that you don't lack


---------18:52----------
motivation your motivation is just in a


---------18:54----------
direction that you don't want it to go


---------18:59----------
does that make sense and if we really


---------19:01----------
think about how stuck you are cuz you


---------19:03----------
sound stuck to me like if I had to


---------19:06----------
diagnose you with its stuckness very


---------19:10----------
much so if we think about like stuckness


---------19:13----------
is actually hard to attain because


---------19:16----------
there's a certain like stubbornness it


---------19:18----------
requires a lot of energy to move you


---------19:21----------
away from this place


---------19:23----------
which tells me that there's a lot of


---------19:26----------
gravity pulling you towards this place


---------19:30----------
does that make sense let you have to


---------19:32----------
think about like the mind sort of


---------19:34----------
mathematically and if I like so for


---------19:38----------
example I love my wife I'm motivated


---------19:41----------
towards being in the marriage so it's


---------19:44----------
gonna take a lot for me to like think


---------19:46----------
about divorcing her does that make sense


---------19:49----------
yes like the harder it is to pull you


---------19:52----------
away from something the more motivated


---------19:54----------
you are towards it so the first thing


---------19:56----------
we've got to understand is that like


---------19:58----------
it's not that you're lazy it's actually


---------20:00----------
that some part of you is highly


---------20:02----------
motivated to stay where you are right


---------20:04----------
now and until we like understand and


---------20:07----------
realize what that is and how it works


---------20:09----------
it's gonna be really hard to move


---------20:10----------
forward you can use willpower and by the


---------20:14----------
way I would define discipline is a


---------20:17----------
consistent use of willpower over time


---------20:23----------
does that make sense yeah okay


---------20:26----------
what's a habit


---------20:33----------
you


---------20:41----------
use of discipline nope actually the


---------20:44----------
exact opposite so when something becomes


---------20:46----------
a habit


---------20:47----------
motivation discipline and willpower are


---------20:50----------
all separate from habit so habit is


---------20:53----------
something that you do automatically


---------20:54----------
without being motivated without being


---------20:59----------
disciplined without using willpower it's


---------21:02----------
a habit right so like just as an example


---------21:04----------
like when I use the restroom I wipe


---------21:07----------
myself right that's like it's habitual


---------21:10----------
when I brush my teeth I have a


---------21:12----------
particular pattern when I wake up in the


---------21:14----------
morning I brush my teeth before I go to


---------21:16----------
bed I brush my teeth it's a habit it


---------21:17----------
doesn't require willpower for me to do


---------21:19----------
or not much does that make sense


---------21:22----------
so once we get to the place of habit


---------21:26----------
things are gonna become relatively easy


---------21:28----------
because it's sort of like autopilot ok


---------21:32----------
so now I'm gonna ask you what do you


---------21:35----------
think it is where do you think


---------21:36----------
motivation comes from


---------21:40----------
where does motivation come from


---------21:48----------
um


---------21:53----------
through the need of something okay


---------21:56----------
that's part of it so let me ask you this


---------22:00----------
what do you need to have a job in


---------22:02----------
computers right now


---------22:06----------
a job yeah but none necessarily why do


---------22:09----------
you need a job


---------22:15----------
rather have a job and get-get disposable


---------22:18----------
income okay


---------22:21----------
eventually move up but okay so so hold


---------22:24----------
on let's let's let me understand you'd


---------22:27----------
rather have a job but is does that mean


---------22:29----------
you need a job


---------22:32----------
well No


---------22:36----------
okay yes hold on let's think about this


---------22:40----------
for a second do you need a job


---------22:43----------
you


---------22:47----------
yes why


---------22:54----------
you


---------23:00----------
what's going to change tomorrow if you


---------23:02----------
have a job


---------23:04----------
you


---------23:06----------
depending on the job I'm I


---------23:09----------
have a type of shirt routine so what's


---------23:14----------
the consequence tomorrow if you don't


---------23:16----------
have a job


---------23:20----------
a job yeah okay so that's like so we're


---------23:23----------
gonna replace the word job with the word


---------23:25----------
yacht you know what a yacht is yes okay


---------23:28----------
I need a yacht do you agree or disagree


---------23:34----------
yes


---------23:36----------
I agree you I need a yacht I need a


---------23:39----------
yacht the way that you need a job which


---------23:41----------
means that I'd rather have a yacht than


---------23:43----------
not having yacht the consequence for me


---------23:46----------
not having a yacht tomorrow's that I


---------23:47----------
don't have a yacht


---------23:51----------
right do you have a place to sleep


---------23:53----------
tonight tomorrow if you don't have a job


---------23:57----------
yeah do you have food to eat tomorrow if


---------24:00----------
you don't have a job


---------24:02----------
yeah you have something to occupy your


---------24:05----------
time that you find mentally engaging if


---------24:07----------
you don't have a job


---------24:11----------
yeah why do you need a job I'm confused


---------24:19----------
to get a sense of fulfillment okay


---------24:25----------
yeah so like is that something that's


---------24:27----------
gonna happen tomorrow


---------24:30----------
no okay necessarily when does


---------24:33----------
fulfillment happen


---------24:38----------
you


---------24:42----------
sometimes when I do things ok right so I


---------24:46----------
want you to understand what's going on


---------24:47----------
in your brain Joro


---------24:49----------
your brain is way smarter than you are


---------24:53----------
your brain recognizes what you need


---------24:56----------
right your brain says hey money we need


---------24:59----------
some food right now our blood sugar is


---------25:01----------
low why don't you go eat something hey


---------25:05----------
buddy we need a toilet right now we have


---------25:07----------
a bladder full of urine let's go take a


---------25:09----------
piss your your brain is telling you hey


---------25:12----------
buddy we don't need a job because we


---------25:15----------
have everything that we need right here


---------25:17----------
what do we need nothing you don't need a


---------25:20----------
job and then what happens is like


---------25:23----------
there's a part of your brain that weighs


---------25:25----------
how important things are like so like


---------25:27----------
your brain is always like trying to


---------25:29----------
weigh different things against it it's


---------25:30----------
like different options right like do I


---------25:33----------
wanna so for example like this bottle of


---------25:36----------
water like I can be thirsty and the


---------25:40----------
thirstier I get the more that I want to


---------25:42----------
drink the bottle of water if the bottle


---------25:44----------
of water is outside of my room I'm gonna


---------25:46----------
have to be thirstier for me to walk


---------25:48----------
outside and get my bottle does that make


---------25:50----------
sense like a little balloon exactly


---------25:53----------
availability right so like when we think


---------25:55----------
about behavior in motivation the


---------25:58----------
availability of things the internal


---------26:01----------
drive towards things and the expected


---------26:03----------
reward all factor into whether I do


---------26:06----------
something or I don't do something yeah


---------26:09----------
like if I


---------26:12----------
if if the if I walked outside and I


---------26:15----------
didn't know where to find water like I'm


---------26:17----------
not gonna go down the street and start


---------26:19----------
knocking on random people's houses and


---------26:21----------
ask them for a glass of water why not


---------26:23----------
because the expected reward is really


---------26:26----------
low right like it's stupid like there is


---------26:29----------
no way there's no reason why I would


---------26:31----------
walk down the street and ask random


---------26:34----------
people for glasses of water because the


---------26:35----------
expected reward is like so hard to


---------26:38----------
fathom does that make sense


---------26:40----------
yeah yeah so what do you think the


---------26:43----------
expected reward of finding fulfillment


---------26:45----------
is like how do you think your brain


---------26:47----------
computes that


---------26:55----------
you


---------27:09----------
not sure absolutely either is your


---------27:12----------
[ __ ] brain your brain doesn't know


---------27:15----------
what the [ __ ] that means


---------27:18----------
like what is full like you don't even


---------27:21----------
know


---------27:21----------
so how you're here you are yours kind of


---------27:23----------
telling yourself hey brain we need


---------27:25----------
fulfillment in your brains like your


---------27:26----------
brain like figures a lot of stuff out


---------27:28----------
for you


---------27:28----------
and your brain is like I don't know and


---------27:30----------
then so then you wake up and then this


---------27:33----------
is the part of your mind that says hey


---------27:34----------
brain we need to do something today and


---------27:37----------
then your brain says why do we need to


---------27:38----------
do something well we need a job for


---------27:42----------
independence but he's like you don't


---------27:43----------
need independence like you've got


---------27:44----------
independence right here you can sleep


---------27:46----------
when you want to you can eat when you


---------27:47----------
want to you can play games when you want


---------27:49----------
to this is actually the perfect


---------27:51----------
lifestyle and then you say no brain but


---------27:53----------
we need fulfillment and your brain says


---------27:56----------
what is that and then you say I don't


---------27:58----------
know and the brain says well if you


---------28:02----------
don't know what it is then like why do


---------28:05----------
we need it like why would you want


---------28:07----------
fulfillment when we can like play like


---------28:09----------
what do you play


---------28:12----------
recently Wow okay so like why do you


---------28:15----------
need fulfillment when you can like do


---------28:17----------
raids on Wow


---------28:19----------
like what like the brain understands in


---------28:21----------
the brain understands who allow is there


---------28:23----------
like this is Wow like this is fun we can


---------28:25----------
do this or we can go knocking on random


---------28:27----------
doors to find fulfillment because how do


---------28:29----------
you find fulfillment right so it's like


---------28:37----------
it's like it's like where can I dig for


---------28:40----------
gold and find gold like that's why brain


---------28:42----------
is gonna be like that's a [ __ ] waste


---------28:44----------
of our time finding fulfillment is a


---------28:46----------
[ __ ] waste of our time


---------28:48----------
okay mm-hmm so the first thing that I


---------28:51----------
want you to understand Joro is that the


---------28:53----------
reason that you're not doing any of


---------28:54----------
these things is because you don't need


---------28:56----------
to


---------28:58----------
why do you want to be healthy what does


---------29:00----------
that mean


---------29:07----------
to


---------29:08----------
[Music]


---------29:09----------
feel better do you feel bad better about


---------29:12----------
myself I mean not all the time


---------29:18----------
Yeah right your brain is like you start


---------29:22----------
feeling bad and then you tell your brain


---------29:24----------
you're like hey brain we need to go


---------29:25----------
exercise so that we can feel good about


---------29:27----------
ourselves our brain says you know what's


---------29:29----------
better than walking back to like I'm at


---------29:33----------
my office right now and my brain says


---------29:34----------
you know what's better than walking -


---------29:36----------
you're off walking back to your house


---------29:38----------
which is three miles away for a glass of


---------29:40----------
water is walking right outside or


---------29:42----------
grabbing this bottle because you can


---------29:44----------
walk three miles away for a glass of


---------29:46----------
water or you can drink the water in


---------29:47----------
front of you


---------29:48----------
so you tell your brain I want to


---------29:51----------
exercise and the brain says why should


---------29:53----------
you do all that effort to feel better


---------29:54----------
when I can make you feel better you


---------29:56----------
playing Wow


---------29:58----------
like why do you want like you can just


---------30:00----------
play wow and like if you get that robe


---------30:02----------
dagger that you want you're gonna feel


---------30:05----------
great your brain is like that's true why


---------30:09----------
I don't understand why you're trying to


---------30:12----------
make my life hard that's what your brain


---------30:13----------
is saying


---------30:21----------
right yeah what do you need


---------30:25----------
what are you motivated towards what do


---------30:36----------
you need Jorah roll all right Matt all


---------30:37----------
right right now I don't know yeah I'll


---------30:40----------
tell you the answer is [ __ ] nothing


---------30:43----------
you don't need anything


---------30:44----------
what do you need tonight


---------30:51----------
I'm like kind of already age yeah so I


---------30:54----------
sound like you're in Europe or something


---------30:55----------
Scandinavia I don't know where are you


---------30:57----------
Finland okay so you already ate so like


---------31:01----------
what are you going to do tomorrow


---------31:05----------
you


---------31:09----------
wake up ma'am


---------31:12----------
wake up eat


---------31:17----------
to the dishes and income here yeah okay


---------31:20----------
why do you do the dishes


---------31:24----------
so try to okay now we're getting


---------31:28----------
somewhere right because for a moment I


---------31:30----------
got excited because I thought maybe if


---------31:32----------
you didn't do the dishes no one would


---------31:35----------
and that's why we see why you do the


---------31:37----------
dishes


---------31:39----------
but it sounds like someone does the


---------31:41----------
dishes if you don't do them that's


---------31:45----------
that's correct right and that's why you


---------31:48----------
try to do the dishes you try because you


---------31:51----------
tell your broom you're like hey brain


---------31:52----------
let's do these dishes and then your


---------31:55----------
brain says why the [ __ ] do you should we


---------31:57----------
do these dishes we don't do them someone


---------31:59----------
else is going to do them why are you


---------32:01----------
making me walk five miles for a glass of


---------32:03----------
water when we don't have to we don't


---------32:05----------
have to do the dishes and the dishes


---------32:07----------
will do themselves


---------32:10----------
your brain is an incredibly efficient


---------32:12----------
organ incredibly efficient you're trying


---------32:18----------
to just it's like you're just like hey


---------32:20----------
brain like let's just let's do all of


---------32:22----------
these really difficult things that are


---------32:24----------
completely useless and your brain is


---------32:25----------
like why the what are you talking about


---------32:27----------
man


---------32:28----------
I don't have to do dishes all I have to


---------32:31----------
do is go and play Wow like I don't


---------32:33----------
understand why you're trying to like


---------32:35----------
ruin this lifestyle that I've built for


---------32:36----------
you you enjoy whitening we hang out so


---------32:41----------
now we're gonna come to earlier I asked


---------32:44----------
you like what what do you want right and


---------32:46----------
you said I want a career you want to


---------32:50----------
exercise you want to move out one day


---------32:55----------
those are desires


---------32:59----------
you understand that so we're gonna talk


---------33:02----------
for a second about desires and I know


---------33:03----------
you guys were asking for psychology so


---------33:05----------
we'll get to that and I mean I'm sorry


---------33:07----------
I'm doing spirituality in neuroscience


---------33:08----------
because that's what I feel like doing


---------33:10----------
today yeah but what is it desire where


---------33:13----------
does it come from


---------33:16----------
you


---------33:23----------
so like what's an example of a desire


---------33:32----------
one thing something absolutely so what's


---------33:35----------
something that you want it's like I want


---------33:37----------
a young money right we're talking about


---------33:41----------
yachts and twitch at once yachts - where


---------33:44----------
does the desire of wanting a yacht come


---------33:46----------
from where does that originate


---------33:51----------
you


---------33:55----------
you


---------33:57----------
it's a thing of value yes it is a thing


---------34:00----------
of value where does the desire for a


---------34:02----------
yacht originate when did I first desire


---------34:05----------
to have a yacht


---------34:09----------
it's kind of a weird question yeah it's


---------34:13----------
really basic but it's really hard


---------34:18----------
okay so we've got we've got an answer


---------34:21----------
from lucky death which is this when I


---------34:24----------
saw someone have one so I'll give you


---------34:26----------
guys the answer right so let's think


---------34:27----------
about it this way have you guys ever


---------34:29----------
been walking down the street and you


---------34:31----------
smell something like the smell of like


---------34:33----------
someone frying something or like the


---------34:35----------
smell of grilled meat and you're like


---------34:37----------
man I want to eat that


---------34:40----------
that ever happened to you where you


---------34:42----------
smell something cooking and you're like


---------34:43----------
that's up yes sounds delicious I want to


---------34:47----------
eat that


---------34:48----------
so where does that desire come from yeah


---------34:51----------
like cookies if you're baking cookies


---------34:53----------
right where does that desire come from


---------34:55----------
where does it originate ah driving past


---------34:59----------
restaurants okay so so like when you're


---------35:04----------
driving past a restaurant or you smell


---------35:06----------
something where is that desire


---------35:08----------
originating from this is really


---------35:09----------
important to understand


---------35:16----------
hunger is incorrect


---------35:19----------
doesn't originate from hunger


---------35:22----------
you


---------35:25----------
okay what do you think Jorah well if


---------35:29----------
in hunger they need this in the form of


---------35:32----------
me so yeah so hunger comes from within


---------35:35----------
so we're gonna talk about hunger in a


---------35:36----------
second right but a desire to satisfy


---------35:38----------
your hunger in a particular way is


---------35:40----------
separate from the feeling of hunger you


---------35:42----------
with me


---------35:45----------
okay so where does where does my desire


---------35:48----------
originate from


---------35:56----------
okay


---------35:59----------
are you are you looking at to a chat


---------36:03----------
look have you open on my other


---------36:05----------
okay look at it look at it scroll


---------36:08----------
through it and then let me know what you


---------36:09----------
think sounds sounds good we're going to


---------36:15----------
make this a group session today


---------36:22----------
you


---------36:27----------
right just the experience of having it


---------36:30----------
okay that's one that's one place have I


---------36:33----------
ever owned a yacht though


---------36:36----------
No ah right so it can't just be the


---------36:40----------
experience of having it so like this is


---------36:43----------
the thing like to twitch at you Joro I


---------36:45----------
think the biggest problem that people


---------36:47----------
have is they don't understand how this


---------36:49----------
[ __ ] stuff works like what is the


---------36:52----------
difference between motivation desire


---------36:53----------
willpower discipline habit


---------36:55----------
where do desires come from why do I want


---------36:58----------
to do something one day and I don't want


---------37:00----------
to do something the other way like you


---------37:01----------
guys have to understand how this stuff


---------37:03----------
works and it works it's like it's like


---------37:05----------
math its scientific so you're absolutely


---------37:08----------
correct that sometimes a desire comes


---------37:10----------
from a memory that's one of the origins


---------37:12----------
of desire right because if I've eaten a


---------37:15----------
chocolate-chip cookie once I can


---------37:17----------
remember what that tasted like and I can


---------37:20----------
want one again but in the case of a


---------37:24----------
yacht I've never had a yacht but I still


---------37:27----------
want one when


---------37:30----------
let me put it this way you know there


---------37:32----------
are there are people in like Papua New


---------37:35----------
Guinea who are like tribes that have not


---------37:37----------
like interacted with civilization dead


---------37:40----------
right like these Aboriginal people do


---------37:42----------
they want yachts


---------37:46----------
maybe no they don't because they don't


---------37:49----------
know what a [ __ ] yacht is


---------37:51----------
okay okay so like


---------37:56----------
when do they when can one day the


---------37:59----------
aboriginal person like what has to


---------38:01----------
happen for the aborigine to want to yah


---------38:06----------
to know it exists and how does that


---------38:09----------
happen


---------38:11----------
Susy absolutely right so now I'm gonna


---------38:14----------
go through twitch chat and I'm gonna


---------38:16----------
show you guys something okay so digital


---------38:21----------
dude says when I saw other people had a


---------38:23----------
yacht


---------38:23----------
yes cookies how do we want cookies


---------38:26----------
right


---------38:28----------
one person says outside sense of smell


---------38:34----------
wanting something that you know you


---------38:35----------
don't have past memories


---------38:41----------
okay you see it with your eyes


---------38:45----------
so where do desires come from


---------38:53----------
you


---------39:00----------
when was the first time that someone


---------39:02----------
wanted a chocolate-chip cookie like I


---------39:03----------
imagine like there's a five-year-old kid


---------39:05----------
what has to happen for them to want a


---------39:08----------
chocolate-chip cookie


---------39:15----------
sure absolutely right or smell it


---------39:20----------
or taste it like I have a two-year-old


---------39:22----------
and she doesn't want things until I put


---------39:24----------
them in her mouth so like if I give her


---------39:26----------
a bite of chocolate of cookie she's like


---------39:28----------
oh that's delicious can I have more but


---------39:30----------
she doesn't want it until she has a


---------39:33----------
sensory experience of it


---------39:35----------
so the first didn't understand is that


---------39:37----------
desires come from the census the yogi


---------39:41----------
said that the India's which are the


---------39:43----------
sense organs are the origin of desire so


---------39:46----------
you cannot have a desire without a


---------39:48----------
sensory experience or a memory of a


---------39:52----------
sensory experience but the root of


---------39:53----------
desire comes from your senses so I think


---------39:57----------
you are and do desires so the other


---------40:00----------
thing about desires is that they're not


---------40:02----------
powerful motivators because desires like


---------40:07----------
availability is like very very important


---------40:10----------
for desires to affect our motivation


---------40:14----------
like the simplest way to put it is like


---------40:16----------
I will eat a freshly baked chocolate


---------40:17----------
chip cookie every day


---------40:19----------
why don't I eat freshly baked chocolate


---------40:21----------
chip cookies every day Joro


---------40:24----------
cuz you don't have them everyday right


---------40:27----------
and there there are a lot of work to


---------40:29----------
make I will put a freshly baked


---------40:32----------
chocolate chip cookie made from scratch


---------40:34----------
in front of me every day I will probably


---------40:36----------
eat it but even though I want to eat the


---------40:40----------
chocolate chip cookie it doesn't affect


---------40:42----------
my motivation enough to like bake them


---------40:44----------
every day


---------40:46----------
does that make sense sir yeah so then


---------40:49----------
the question becomes if our desires are


---------40:51----------
not like a good source of motivation


---------40:53----------
what is a good source of motivation like


---------40:57----------
if I can't even motivate myself to do


---------40:59----------
something enjoyable like eat like I'm


---------41:02----------
not even willing like even though a


---------41:03----------
chocolate-chip cookie is good why do I


---------41:08----------
even though it brings me pleasure why do


---------41:11----------
I not like get up off my ass and do it


---------41:14----------
like it's a positive reward right you


---------41:17----------
with me but it's hard to do so let me


---------41:20----------
give you another example like what is


---------41:23----------
what is the one of the most like give me


---------41:25----------
some examples of some of the most


---------41:27----------
unpleasant stuff that you've done


---------41:33----------
I've done or experienced that you've


---------41:35----------
done


---------41:41----------
you


---------41:44----------
I mean does pain count like


---------41:46----------
physical like actual like something that


---------41:48----------
going through or so so is there any pain


---------41:52----------
that you've undergone that you would do


---------41:54----------
again


---------41:57----------
like have you ever experienced yeah it


---------41:59----------
pain in your life that if you had to go


---------42:01----------
back in time and you could choose to do


---------42:03----------
it or not do it you would choose to do


---------42:05----------
it again


---------42:06----------
yes give me an example


---------42:11----------
you


---------42:14----------
you


---------42:15----------
you


---------42:33----------
it's like on second thought maybe not


---------42:36----------
okay


---------42:37----------
is anything ever unpleasant happened to


---------42:40----------
you that if you could go back in time


---------42:42----------
you would choose to do that again


---------42:50----------
yeah like what


---------42:56----------
I got a spinal fluid like taken out look


---------43:00----------
like with a needle of course unpleasant


---------43:03----------
yeah why would you do it again


---------43:08----------
as it helped me get a


---------43:11----------
okay why is that important


---------43:15----------
because otherwise I wouldn't have known


---------43:17----------
why is it important to know


---------43:21----------
because it's not nice to know


---------43:24----------
okay nice to not know yeah so I get that


---------43:28----------
in in theory okay so let me put a let me


---------43:30----------
put it to you this way so a couple weeks


---------43:33----------
ago my kid was sick and she threw up on


---------43:36----------
me do you think that I like being thrown


---------43:40----------
up on


---------43:43----------
do you think I regret her throwing up on


---------43:46----------
me


---------43:50----------
it's kind of a weird question right


---------43:52----------
maybe yeah so like I didn't want it to


---------43:55----------
happen but if I had to do it again I


---------43:57----------
would absolutely let let her throw up on


---------43:59----------
me again right like I was holding her I


---------44:02----------
was rocking her to sleep and she threw


---------44:04----------
up on me so if I had to go back in time


---------44:07----------
I would choose it again


---------44:08----------
why


---------44:13----------
you


---------44:17----------
I mean what would be the other option


---------44:21----------
yeah so so okay yeah so touch 20:21 part


---------44:25----------
it looks like I lost you guys so like


---------44:27----------
sometimes in life we do unpleasant


---------44:29----------
things right we do things that like so


---------44:32----------
if we think about a cookie the reward


---------44:34----------
from that cookie is like a positive


---------44:36----------
thing like it's a pleasant thing yeah


---------44:38----------
and even though the outcome is positive


---------44:40----------
we still can't find the motivation to do


---------44:42----------
it what I'm trying to suggest is that


---------44:45----------
sometimes we do things that are actually


---------44:48----------
like negative rewards and we're able to


---------44:52----------
find the energy or motivation to do it


---------44:55----------
do you have siblings Europe yes - how


---------44:59----------
old are they uh two and four years older


---------45:03----------
than me okay so let me ask you this if I


---------45:07----------
pointed a gun at you Jorah what would


---------45:09----------
you do run absolutely if I pointed a gun


---------45:16----------
at your sibling what would you do


---------45:24----------
problem


---------45:26----------
like try to help them out of this


---------45:29----------
situation


---------45:30----------
why what's different a gun is a gun why


---------45:35----------
don't you run away


---------45:42----------
because an important


---------45:45----------
thing is on the line absolutely


---------45:50----------
absolutely right


---------45:53----------
so now we get to the crux of it which is


---------45:57----------
what matters to you Jorah


---------46:05----------
you


---------46:13----------
you


---------46:26----------
my life


---------46:29----------
okay


---------46:32----------
I think that makes sense what else


---------46:34----------
matters to you


---------46:41----------
close relationships okay are any of


---------46:44----------
those in jeopardy


---------46:51----------
you


---------46:54----------
no so Joro you're a pretty thoughtful


---------46:58----------
guy so I think you think a lot before


---------47:00----------
you answer which is fantastic at the


---------47:03----------
same time I think the basic problem that


---------47:05----------
you have is that everything that met


---------47:07----------
like there's nothing that matters to you


---------47:09----------
that coincides with what you want like


---------47:12----------
so you want to move out of the house you


---------47:13----------
want to get a good job but you don't you


---------47:15----------
know it doesn't matter to you like


---------47:18----------
you're not willing to put yourself in


---------47:19----------
the path of a gun


---------47:21----------
for any of those things


---------47:25----------
does that make sense good


---------47:28----------
so like the problem here is that like


---------47:30----------
you're willing to it's hard enough to to


---------47:33----------
bake cookies just to eat a cookie even


---------47:35----------
though that's a positive reward but real


---------47:37----------
strength comes not from desires but from


---------47:41----------
values desires come from our indriyas or


---------47:45----------
our sense organs they come from the


---------47:46----------
outside values like if we think about


---------47:51----------
like why you would try to help out your


---------47:53----------
siblings if a gun was pointed at them


---------47:55----------
that has nothing to do with the census


---------47:57----------
in your relationship with your your


---------47:59----------
siblings is not like it's not like one


---------48:01----------
day you saw them like you see them and


---------48:03----------
then you kind of like know who they are


---------48:05----------
but your your relationship with them is


---------48:06----------
not like based on an isolated sensory


---------48:09----------
experience in fact like if you think


---------48:12----------
about love love is not like it doesn't


---------48:14----------
come from the inner ears it doesn't come


---------48:16----------
from the sense organs


---------48:17----------
where d where does love come from


---------48:23----------
you


---------48:25----------
like mathematically


---------48:30----------
you


---------48:33----------
where do you feel love


---------48:39----------
you


---------48:43----------
you


---------48:44----------
my brain okay yeah that's a scientific


---------48:47----------
answer the answer I'm looking for is


---------48:49----------
like within right there's some feeling


---------48:52----------
right yeah yeah it's like like so if we


---------48:54----------
think about the indriyas the indriyas or


---------48:56----------
the way in which the outside world


---------48:59----------
enters us and those are not a good


---------49:02----------
that's where desires come from they come


---------49:04----------
from the outside world but values come


---------49:07----------
from within and values are what can


---------49:10----------
overcome all of the negative stuff like


---------49:14----------
I would walk and knock on every door in


---------49:17----------
my neighborhood if my daughter was


---------49:20----------
thirsty and I had no water


---------49:23----------
I would do that in a heartbeat


---------49:26----------
right if I if I ran out of water and she


---------49:29----------
like hadn't had anything to drink for 24


---------49:31----------
hours then I would go and do that so I


---------49:34----------
think your basic problem Joro is that


---------49:37----------
you don't have anything to care about


---------49:39----------
you don't care about it you want stuff


---------49:42----------
but you don't care


---------49:45----------
it doesn't mean anything to you


---------49:48----------
because your needs are met


---------49:52----------
what are you feeling right now


---------50:00----------
you


---------50:03----------
a chair


---------50:05----------
I can't tell because of your glasses but


---------50:07----------
are you tearing up


---------50:10----------
maybe


---------50:12----------
slightly


---------50:14----------
so what are you feeling tell me what you


---------50:15----------
feel in your body it started when I said


---------50:18----------
you don't care about anything


---------50:26----------
you


---------50:42----------
I don't know if it's


---------50:44----------
[Music]


---------50:50----------
it's guilt or shame yeah


---------50:56----------
what are you ashamed of


---------51:02----------
you


---------51:13----------
look at me Jorah


---------51:16----------
what are you shamed up


---------51:21----------
you


---------51:37----------
kind of myself yeah


---------51:42----------
you know what what if I had to guess


---------51:45----------
what was in your mind right now the best


---------51:49----------
word I can think of is everything


---------51:54----------
everything


---------51:59----------
how did you get to be this way


---------52:05----------
you


---------52:08----------
when did this happen to you


---------52:14----------
you


---------52:20----------
how long have you felt this way


---------52:26----------
you


---------52:34----------
because for a while yeah


---------52:37----------
it's been so long since like I would


---------52:40----------
even guess that you don't even really


---------52:41----------
remember what it feels like to not feel


---------52:44----------
like this it's been so long and you've


---------52:48----------
been stuck for a really long time and


---------52:50----------
you don't know how to get out


---------52:58----------
you


---------53:07----------
we're gonna help you twitch ad and I are


---------53:11----------
gonna help you do you believe you can be


---------53:13----------
helped


---------53:16----------
really


---------53:22----------
so some time ago you said it's been a


---------53:25----------
long time since I felt like I had


---------53:28----------
purpose in my life


---------53:32----------
when was the last time you remember


---------53:33----------
having purpose in your life


---------53:41----------
you


---------53:45----------
kantham remember okay


---------53:49----------
so you have a lot of work


---------53:51----------
to do Jorah


---------53:55----------
right


---------53:56----------
yeah and it's got to start with


---------54:00----------
reflection it's got to start with


---------54:03----------
understanding yourself it's got to


---------54:05----------
understand with what the [ __ ] do you


---------54:07----------
want to do with your life


---------54:10----------
right the basic problem here is that you


---------54:12----------
have no reason to get on the exercise


---------54:14----------
bike


---------54:16----------
you have no reason to go out and walk


---------54:20----------
you have no reason to go get groceries


---------54:25----------
so you really need to spend some time


---------54:27----------
thinking about like what do you want


---------54:29----------
like what what do you want to be like


---------54:31----------
why why get a job


---------54:40----------
you


---------54:48----------
so jor-el I think your most basic


---------54:52----------
problem is I asked you what do you care


---------54:53----------
what matters to you in life do you


---------54:56----------
remember what your answer was


---------55:02----------
it was I guess myself and that's the


---------55:06----------
problem


---------55:10----------
right so this is the one thing that I


---------55:12----------
just love about gamers is you [ __ ]


---------55:16----------
guys will do anything for anyone else


---------55:20----------
if someone asks you for help like I am


---------55:24----------
like 99% sure Giroud that if I was in


---------55:27----------
Finland and I was stranded and I sent


---------55:29----------
you a text message and I said hey jor-el


---------55:31----------
can you come help me out you would drop


---------55:33----------
whatever you were doing and come and


---------55:35----------
help me


---------55:36----------
there is no doubt in my mind that you


---------55:40----------
would do that I can tell I can tell just


---------55:41----------
by looking at you


---------55:45----------
and I think the basic problem here is


---------55:47----------
that like you feel shame and guilt for


---------55:50----------
yourself and you feel like you don't


---------55:52----------
have you're not worth a whole lot


---------55:54----------
because you haven't done a whole lot so


---------55:56----------
you're not worth helping


---------56:00----------
but somehow we have to connect to that


---------56:02----------
part of you that is like good and like


---------56:05----------
helps people like you know get their


---------56:07----------
gear and Wow


---------56:10----------
right


---------56:12----------
because like I think you're a good


---------56:14----------
person and Wow like


---------56:16----------
let's you be a good person and the


---------56:20----------
problem that I see is that like I don't


---------56:22----------
see an opportunity in your life for you


---------56:25----------
to be a good person


---------56:28----------
so it's got to start there


---------56:30----------
you've got to stop living for yourself


---------56:33----------
and start living for something else for


---------56:36----------
someone that you love or people who need


---------56:39----------
your help


---------56:42----------
you


---------56:45----------
right so I ate a [ __ ] salad for lunch


---------56:47----------
I don't like salads


---------56:50----------
but I'm getting old and I have kids and


---------56:53----------
I have to be around like I want to watch


---------56:55----------
them graduate like I'm not gonna eat a


---------56:57----------
salad I'm gonna eat a [ __ ] quesadilla


---------56:59----------
but Mike because of my kids I'm gonna


---------57:01----------
eat a salad so you're talking about


---------57:04----------
motivation we're talking about willpower


---------57:05----------
talking about discipline we're talking


---------57:07----------
about desire what we're not talking


---------57:10----------
about is Dharma Dharma is the son script


---------57:13----------
word for duty or responsibility and you


---------57:18----------
can we can spend as much time as we want


---------57:20----------
to helping you psychologically by


---------57:23----------
talking about your shame and stuff like


---------57:24----------
that and we can do that if you guys want


---------57:26----------
but I think the basic problem here is


---------57:28----------
that you don't have a reason to get on


---------57:32----------
the exercise bike


---------57:35----------
so this is what I want you to imagine I


---------57:37----------
don't know if this is gonna work or not


---------57:39----------
because I don't know you that well but


---------57:41----------
jor-el I want you to understand that


---------57:43----------
like you're an individual and that in


---------57:45----------
your life they're going to be people


---------57:47----------
that you meet and that someday like the


---------57:51----------
people that you meet are gonna need your


---------57:52----------
help you don't know who it's gonna be


---------57:54----------
you don't know when it's gonna be


---------57:57----------
that there are people out there that in


---------57:58----------
the grand scheme of time are completely


---------58:00----------
irrelevant but that one day you're gonna


---------58:02----------
be walking down the street and someone


---------58:04----------
is about to step in front of a car and


---------58:06----------
you're gonna like pull them back onto


---------58:09----------
the sidewalk so they don't get hit this


---------58:11----------
kind of random [ __ ] is gonna happen


---------58:12----------
someone's gonna be hungry someone's


---------58:14----------
gonna lose their car keys someone's


---------58:16----------
gonna need to use your phone that the


---------58:18----------
world exists in is full of humans and


---------58:20----------
you need to help them because if you


---------58:22----------
don't pull that person off off the


---------58:23----------
street they're gonna get hit by a car


---------58:27----------
and the problem is that like you need to


---------58:29----------
prepare yourself for those moments


---------58:33----------
you don't know what kind of help you


---------58:35----------
need to provide you don't know when it's


---------58:37----------
gonna be or who it's gonna be but you


---------58:39----------
have to prepare yourself as I do believe


---------58:43----------
that there are some people in this world


---------58:44----------
only you can help


---------58:48----------
so that make sense so how are you gonna


---------58:51----------
prepare


---------58:57----------
you


---------59:07----------
I'll tell you


---------59:10----------
so you're going to wake up tomorrow


---------59:11----------
morning


---------59:12----------
you're gonna go for a walk


---------59:14----------
that's how it starts


---------59:18----------
the first thing you do take a piss brush


---------59:21----------
your teeth before you eat anything go


---------59:23----------
for a walk


---------59:25----------
if you eat first thing in the morning


---------59:27----------
grab something and then take it with you


---------59:28----------
eat outside how cold is it is it really


---------59:31----------
cold


---------59:32----------
okay okay I like cold you're gonna start


---------59:35----------
by doing that


---------59:37----------
you going to do that tomorrow


---------59:40----------
okay the other thing that I want you to


---------59:43----------
do is message me on discord


---------59:46----------
after you do it tell me before you leave


---------59:48----------
and when you get back I may be offline


---------59:50----------
but message me anyway and what I'm gonna


---------59:53----------
do on Sunday I'm gonna stream again on


---------59:54----------
Sunday and I'm either going to praise or


---------59:57----------
shame you in front of the Internet


---------59:59----------
I'm gonna say Joro I got a message from


---------60:01----------
Joro he went for his [ __ ] walk


---------60:06----------
and then you're gonna do the next thing


---------60:10----------
and you're gonna understand that you


---------60:11----------
were put on this earth for a reason and


---------60:13----------
it wasn't a play [ __ ] World of


---------60:15----------
Warcraft that's just a shame


---------60:19----------
the problem here is that you don't


---------60:20----------
realize like the biggest problem here


---------60:22----------
Joro is that you think you're worthless


---------60:25----------
like there's no point in doing anything


---------60:28----------
if you're worthless but if you actually


---------60:30----------
have the capacity to help people and


---------60:32----------
make a difference like you've got to


---------60:35----------
you know like you can't stop a gun if


---------60:38----------
you're made of paper like there's no


---------60:39----------
point but you have flesh and blood and


---------60:43----------
bone which means that you can step in


---------60:45----------
front of a gun and you can like save


---------60:46----------
your your siblings you can do that if


---------60:49----------
you're made of paper it doesn't [ __ ]


---------60:51----------
matter right now the problem is you


---------60:52----------
think you're made of paper you don't


---------60:54----------
think you can make a difference that's


---------60:56----------
your problem


---------60:57----------
second problem is you don't know what


---------60:59----------
you want we talked about desires but


---------61:02----------
like you don't know what you care about


---------61:02----------
like what do you care about


---------61:05----------
right so this is like we have this


---------61:07----------
exercise in discord which i think is


---------61:09----------
brilliant I don't know if you guys have


---------61:10----------
read this stuff but like can I just read


---------61:14----------
this for a second I want to read some of


---------61:18----------
the stuff to you guys this stuff is


---------61:21----------
great


---------61:26----------
oh you posted beautiful


---------61:31----------
Jerome Oni this is you yeah okay now


---------61:38----------
we're talking okay you ready


---------61:40----------
jor oh yeah okay we're gonna talk about


---------61:44----------
this oh ma what is wrong with the world


---------61:48----------
so good job Joro dude this is [ __ ]


---------61:50----------
fantastic there's an increased amount of


---------61:54----------
misinformation in the modern world which


---------61:56----------
causes people to make misinformed


---------61:58----------
decisions and have long lasting effects


---------61:59----------
on themselves and sometimes many others


---------62:01----------
related to this misinformation as


---------62:03----------
people's lack of purpose being drawn


---------62:07----------
into bubbles of comfort and believing in


---------62:10----------
conspiracy theories without thinking


---------62:12----------
about them sound like anyone you know


---------62:14----------
Joro bubbles of comfort and lacking


---------62:17----------
purpose


---------62:19----------
that sound familiar buddy yeah people


---------62:23----------
fight over each other's political views


---------62:25----------
and religious beliefs which is in my


---------62:27----------
opinion not a fight worth having society


---------62:30----------
is not caught up with the technology of


---------62:32----------
or social climate copyright Roz's


---------62:34----------
screwing companies and artists over the


---------62:36----------
security and the privacy of civilians


---------62:38----------
has worsened in the online age even


---------62:40----------
though there are very simple fixes to


---------62:42----------
many of the problems only to be declined


---------62:44----------
by incompetence or greed


---------62:47----------
the way media portrays so many things


---------62:50----------
violence sexuality body economy


---------62:52----------
technology incorrectly is harmful to


---------62:54----------
younger adults and even children


---------62:56----------
companies use every way they can to get


---------62:59----------
into a consumers pocket oftentimes even


---------63:02----------
taking immoral or illegal means as well


---------63:05----------
public health care is a joke in many


---------63:07----------
countries with long queue times and


---------63:08----------
insane costs causing even more people to


---------63:11----------
avoid professional health care entirely


---------63:13----------
mental health isn't taking serious isn't


---------63:15----------
taken seriously do you take your mental


---------63:17----------
health seriously


---------63:19----------
yeah I've been in therapy for six years


---------63:21----------
okay not sleeping is seen as bragging


---------63:24----------
rights


---------63:25----------
I stayed up all night playing Wow


---------63:27----------
humanity is not taking enough action to


---------63:30----------
prevent or slow down climate change in


---------63:33----------
global warming in some even deciding to


---------63:35----------
deny it and not believe the overwhelming


---------63:37----------
evidence that is presented to them comes


---------63:39----------
back to misinformation right the ocean


---------63:42----------
is filled with plastic not literally so


---------63:44----------
many species have already gone extinct


---------63:45----------
thanks to pollution and bad recycling


---------63:47----------
there's still Wars being fought people


---------63:49----------
are still forced to leave their home


---------63:51----------
countries due to conflict or corrupt


---------63:53----------
governments threatening their well-being


---------63:55----------
lives and often leaving many people to


---------63:57----------
their own devices and a possible


---------63:59----------
eventual death okay Joro so now comes


---------64:04----------
the last question what are you gonna do


---------64:07----------
about it


---------64:10----------
this when I read this that when I read


---------64:13----------
this I think that the world there's so


---------64:15----------
many problems that are so big that it


---------64:17----------
can't be fixed and you know why these


---------64:22----------
problems seem so big


---------64:24----------
because people like you are [ __ ]


---------64:26----------
sitting at home playing wow it's not a


---------64:29----------
joke


---------64:30----------
I mean I meant it to be funny and also


---------64:33----------
harsh right now so I think that there's


---------64:36----------
something my sense is that this is this


---------64:38----------
is like there's something here that you


---------64:40----------
can actually do I don't know if you can


---------64:42----------
bring extinct species back to life I


---------64:44----------
don't know if you can fix healthcare


---------64:45----------
that sounds like a very different


---------64:47----------
trajectory but I do think there's


---------64:50----------
something about misinformation and


---------64:52----------
misinformed decisions that you can over


---------64:54----------
the course of the next year actually do


---------64:58----------
what do you think


---------65:05----------
you


---------65:07----------
yeah yeah right and if you don't do it


---------65:10----------
who's going to do it


---------65:18----------
you


---------65:32----------
you leave it up to [ __ ] twitch at the


---------65:35----------
chat is gonna do it can we count on baby


---------65:40----------
maybe I mean it's either either somebody


---------65:45----------
else or most likely nobody yeah


---------65:50----------
right so Mahatma Gandhi said be the


---------65:53----------
change that you want to see in the world


---------65:54----------
like people quote that [ __ ] all the time


---------65:57----------
but I think like that's like a very


---------65:59----------
positive way of saying if you don't do


---------66:01----------
it no one will


---------66:04----------
like I got into this because I saw that


---------66:06----------
there are a lot of mental health there


---------66:08----------
gamers are struggling with their mental


---------66:09----------
health people don't know what what to do


---------66:12----------
right so like I woke up one day and I


---------66:16----------
said I'm gonna start talking to gamers


---------66:18----------
over the Internet and my lawyer said you


---------66:21----------
could get sued


---------66:22----------
because someone is gonna think that this


---------66:25----------
is therapy and you don't have a


---------66:26----------
doctor-patient relationship and one day


---------66:28----------
someone is going to kill themselves and


---------66:29----------
their family's going to see you because


---------66:31----------
you were pretending to be a doctor they


---------66:34----------
said that this would be easier if you


---------66:35----------
actually weren't a medical professional


---------66:37----------
because you have a license and you have


---------66:38----------
obligations but if I don't do it who is


---------66:43----------
you


---------66:46----------
right


---------66:48----------
like it's Friday on November 15th 423 in


---------66:53----------
in Eastern Time


---------66:57----------
and like you're stuck


---------67:00----------
if I don't talk to you right now Joro


---------67:03----------
who's going to talk to you


---------67:08----------
like it's me that's it right when I said


---------67:11----------
one day you're gonna walk down the


---------67:13----------
street and someone is about to step in


---------67:15----------
front of a car and if you're not there


---------67:17----------
to save them no one else will be you're


---------67:20----------
that person for me I'm walking down the


---------67:22----------
street and I see you and I see you


---------67:24----------
stepping in front of a car and if I


---------67:25----------
don't help you no one else will and it's


---------67:29----------
Friday at 4 p.m. I'm not working I'm not


---------67:31----------
with my kids right now they're getting


---------67:33----------
home from school I want to be with them


---------67:35----------
I want to play with them for a couple of


---------67:37----------
hours you know why I want to play with


---------67:38----------
them for a couple of hours so that four


---------67:41----------
hours from now when I want to play dota


---------67:43----------
I can do so with a clean conscience so


---------67:46----------
that I can say to myself I spent time


---------67:48----------
with my kids I'm a good father so now I


---------67:50----------
deserve to relax because the thing that


---------67:53----------
tears me up more than anything is when I


---------67:55----------
want to play dota more than I want to


---------67:56----------
hang out with them and it would have


---------67:59----------
been easy cuz I could have played dota


---------68:01----------
if I was like you know if I was with


---------68:02----------
them does that make sense


---------68:04----------
but instead I'm talking to you


---------68:08----------
and that's worth it because if I don't


---------68:11----------
do it who will and this is the thing


---------68:14----------
like Jorah like the world is not gonna


---------68:17----------
fix itself just like you said it's a


---------68:20----------
bleak [ __ ] place man


---------68:23----------
and there's misinformation and like but


---------68:26----------
that's that's like a so buddy of mine


---------68:28----------
this is kind of random but you know


---------68:31----------
there's like a lot of like if anyone's


---------68:33----------
in the u.s. I don't know if you guys


---------68:34----------
like have been to the dentist but like


---------68:36----------
dentists make a lot of money and there's


---------68:39----------
like no price transparency in dentistry


---------68:41----------
this is gonna be kind of completely


---------68:43----------
random and so he decided that what he


---------68:44----------
was gonna do is like try to compare


---------68:46----------
dental prices so that people could like


---------68:48----------
understand what they're getting billed


---------68:50----------
for and understand what a dentist costs


---------68:53----------
do he ended up getting sued and shut


---------68:56----------
down because dentists didn't like that


---------68:57----------
they didn't like it that someone was


---------68:59----------
publishing how much they charge but he


---------69:03----------
was saying that people are just getting


---------69:04----------
[ __ ] ripped off


---------69:06----------
and he just started a website because


---------69:08----------
you can do that now you can do that yeah


---------69:12----------
and so Jorah what I want you to really


---------69:15----------
do so I want you to start tomorrow by


---------69:17----------
taking a walk and then I want you to


---------69:20----------
think about like concretely like there's


---------69:22----------
a problem of misinformation and try to


---------69:24----------
break it down to the smallest thing you


---------69:27----------
can like what is this


---------69:28----------
like what what about misinformation


---------69:30----------
we're gonna talk about it now for five


---------69:31----------
minutes like what can you do about


---------69:34----------
misinformation like what's the tiny


---------69:35----------
thing what's what's the misinformation


---------69:37----------
that bothers you the most


---------69:44----------
you


---------69:46----------
you


---------69:52----------
climate he


---------69:54----------
climate climate misinformation


---------69:58----------
yeah okay


---------70:01----------
so what are you gonna okay so like


---------70:04----------
are there websites out there like so


---------70:06----------
what do you how do you think we address


---------70:08----------
that


---------70:09----------
that's a tough one


---------70:18----------
informing okay okay this is what I want


---------70:24----------
you to do Jorah I think the other


---------70:26----------
problem here is that part of your


---------70:28----------
motivation is because you don't have


---------70:29----------
your environment or environment isn't


---------70:31----------
good I don't know who you spend your


---------70:33----------
time with so this is what I'd like you


---------70:36----------
to do after you go for a walk I want you


---------70:39----------
to look up organizations that are that


---------70:41----------
are fighting or advocating for climate


---------70:44----------
change like do a Google search and then


---------70:47----------
try to find like a dozen organizations


---------70:48----------
and see if any of them have do you have


---------70:53----------
any like programming skills or web


---------70:54----------
developing skills


---------70:56----------
oh yeah okay so what I want you to do is


---------71:00----------
is look at those organizations and reach


---------71:06----------
out like find which ones you like okay


---------71:09----------
and let me know if what I'm asking you


---------71:11----------
is getting too difficult because I'm


---------71:13----------
gonna ask you for more and more okay so


---------71:16----------
like let me know when I hit the limit do


---------71:19----------
and I want you to reach out to them and


---------71:20----------

---------71:39----------
can contact HR or things like that


---------71:42----------

---------71:46----------
but even if they don't make the world a


---------71:48----------
better place don't tell them you'll work


---------71:50----------
for free by the way


---------71:52----------
