---------00:00----------
so now we're going to get started so


---------00:01----------
we'll just start with the list so


---------00:02----------
kangaroo we were talking a little bit so


---------00:05----------
I guess let's just start with this or


---------00:06----------
you dating someone right now no not


---------00:08----------
currently


---------00:09----------
okay and is that how do you feel about


---------00:12----------
that kind of sucks okay yeah that's a


---------00:16----------
very honest answer what sucks about it


---------00:21----------
I think it's that


---------00:23----------
[Music]


---------00:25----------
my days I'm spending either working


---------00:27----------
learning something studying


---------00:31----------
it's kind of like always doing something


---------00:32----------
alone huh even when I'm you even I'm


---------00:35----------
working it's usually things like I'm


---------00:37----------
following a doctor around or I'm seeing


---------00:40----------
a patient but it's still just me hmm on


---------00:43----------
my own doing all that come home and I


---------00:45----------
study every room alone you know get


---------00:48----------
online I'm still alone in the room even


---------00:49----------
if I talk to friends or something like


---------00:50----------
that still mean on my own okay so and


---------00:54----------
I've never had that experience of like


---------00:55----------
having a real girlfriend but I always


---------00:57----------
seeing people you know really seem to


---------00:58----------
enjoy it


---------00:59----------
there's kind of that I do not feel like


---------01:01----------
I'm missing something out but not and


---------01:03----------
and so it I mean it sounds like most of


---------01:06----------
what you feel is lonely yeah yeah and so


---------01:10----------
what do you think it is that's gotten in


---------01:13----------
the way of you finding kind of what you


---------01:15----------
see other people have


---------01:20----------
I always thought it was just kind of


---------01:22----------
where I was hmm


---------01:26----------
at Rice back when I'm in college that


---------01:28----------
was definitely gaming but to my way to


---------01:30----------
minigames and aqua did not meet anyone


---------01:31----------
hmm


---------01:32----------
after that it was just mostly just felt


---------01:34----------
like work you know once I got into the


---------01:35----------
master's program into med school it's


---------01:37----------
like I didn't have time even consider


---------01:40----------
anything we're all so I fell out of


---------01:41----------
classes just oh it was tough yeah yeah I


---------01:45----------
mean I think um you know that's really


---------01:46----------
true at school is pretty intensive do


---------01:51----------
people date in med school they do yeah


---------01:53----------
okay how does that work and no idea yeah


---------01:57----------
it's kind of interesting right I mean


---------01:59----------
you're saying that here you are in med


---------02:00----------
school and it's like it's hard right


---------02:01----------
they can learn a lot and the pace is


---------02:04----------
really intense and so if we kind of


---------02:09----------
think a little bit about what is it that


---------02:11----------
prevents you from dating your answer as


---------02:13----------
well I work too much but then there's a


---------02:16----------
part of me that kind of pauses and


---------02:17----------
thinks about that because you know a lot


---------02:20----------
of people work a lot right and they find


---------02:22----------
relationships I think the way I see it


---------02:24----------
usually is that


---------02:26----------
in med school you either come in with a


---------02:27----------
relationship that you continue or you


---------02:29----------
find one within your own class listens


---------02:32----------
with other doctors or maybe we meet on


---------02:35----------
the job mmm


---------02:37----------
I just didn't think I found anyone like


---------02:39----------
that okay so you haven't found the right


---------02:42----------
person yeah


---------02:46----------
so when you're thinking about having a


---------02:49----------
relationship your idea is that basically


---------02:52----------
someone is going to come along and then


---------02:53----------
it's gonna click not exactly not what


---------02:57----------
kind of I guess I think it's the idea


---------03:00----------
that


---------03:01----------
I have to meet multiple people but there


---------03:04----------
will be someone there will be some


---------03:06----------
people have mesh with a lot more than


---------03:07----------
other people I said meant a lot of those


---------03:09----------
types eeeh


---------03:10----------
okay so you just haven't been able to


---------03:12----------
meet someone that you mesh with yes okay


---------03:17----------
why do you think that is


---------03:20----------
what goes into meeting people at measure


---------03:24----------
new things that the way that other


---------03:27----------
people will be doing at the same time


---------03:28----------
okay you do that I started to like what


---------03:37----------
conventions which con coming up anime


---------03:39----------
conventions gaming conventions also


---------03:42----------
putting a lot more Medical conventions


---------03:43----------
again travel for fourth year and meeting


---------03:47----------
different people interpret hospitals has


---------03:48----------
been and other medical students outside


---------03:51----------
of my own class hmm I think that's been


---------03:54----------
actually helping a lot when was the last


---------03:56----------
time you asked someone out actually how


---------04:04----------
can you tell us a little bit about that


---------04:05----------
well interesting laughs it wasn't I


---------04:08----------
didn't expect to ask them out on a date


---------04:11----------
uh-huh it just felt like after the night


---------04:13----------
was over we did end up going out okay


---------04:15----------
yeah wheel 2 movie went to dinner hang


---------04:17----------
out for a bit and after than I was over


---------04:18----------
I looked back I was like telling a


---------04:20----------
friend of mine okay I'm at school person


---------04:22----------
oh so you went on a date and it kind of


---------04:24----------
went oh yeah I went on a date did you


---------04:27----------
ask her out


---------04:29----------
I asked her to go hang out but I didn't


---------04:31----------
ask her as like as specifically as a


---------04:32----------
date okay I just didn't think of that


---------04:36----------
dink oh no I was like hey you want to go


---------04:37----------
hang out for a bit what makes you think


---------04:40----------
that was a day um I think it was


---------04:45----------
maybe just how much I enjoyed it how


---------04:48----------
much and like how seem like we both


---------04:50----------
enjoyed it we wanted to hang out again


---------04:53----------
is dear so I could but so you're gonna


---------04:56----------
see her again


---------04:57----------
I don't know if she's in San Antonio


---------04:59----------
okay it'll be depending on how the next


---------05:02----------
couple weeks ago so I'm curious um you


---------05:05----------
know just just twitch that chat think


---------05:07----------
that that qualifies as a date or not


---------05:10----------
let's see so let's kind of come back to


---------05:17----------
so you I mean but you're saying that you


---------05:19----------
kind of didn't really ask her out right


---------05:20----------
well I'll just you just asked to hang


---------05:22----------
out yeah so unclear whether it was a


---------05:24----------
date or not a date so sometimes when it


---------05:27----------
comes to finding a romantic partner like


---------05:28----------
it can be sometimes I think a big piece


---------05:33----------
of it is not understanding exactly what


---------05:35----------
your relationship is with other people


---------05:36----------
like in terms of his dating or not they


---------05:38----------
agree as friends photonic are you


---------05:40----------
getting friend-zoned that is hard to fry


---------05:43----------
it's hard for me to hear I've never been


---------05:44----------
able to get that distinction unless I'm


---------05:46----------
very explicit about it okay and usually


---------05:48----------
that's never turned out positively for


---------05:50----------
me


---------05:50----------
look if I have someone hey do you want


---------05:52----------
to go on a date they're gonna pause in


---------05:54----------
response for that uh-huh


---------05:55----------
how many times have you asked but okay


---------05:58----------
and so you know I would think that if


---------06:02----------
someone has been we're just talking


---------06:05----------
about negative emotion yeah if you put


---------06:07----------
yourself out there and you've gotten


---------06:08----------
burned five times that it would make it


---------06:10----------
very hard for you to ask a sixth girl


---------06:13----------
out on it it definitely should be looked


---------06:15----------
at yeah I think the more that I start


---------06:17----------
realizing I don't I want a relationship


---------06:20----------
and I'd only care if someone says no


---------06:22----------
because I can try it again it's the more


---------06:26----------
I'm starting to do it more ask more


---------06:28----------
people out like I think it was high


---------06:31----------
school asked up two people two girls


---------06:33----------
didn't go well at all


---------06:34----------
I didn't ask anyone until my master's


---------06:38----------
program because it's five years later


---------06:40----------
okay


---------06:43----------
that didn't wind up working out and then


---------06:45----------
the next time I did it was my first year


---------06:46----------
of medical school


---------06:47----------
after that I think about a big one


---------06:51----------
how did you feel about the one in


---------06:56----------
that one harshly worked out we semi


---------07:01----------
dated for a bit and I got cheated on so


---------07:03----------
that didn't work out very well so ya


---------07:04----------
know the reason I asked that question


---------07:05----------
and so this is great that this is on


---------07:07----------
camera I wish we could rewind on twitch


---------07:09----------
chat and your facial expression was


---------07:12----------
subtly very very different okay for the


---------07:14----------
one in that school so like the system so


---------07:17----------
I I think you know I wonder if there's


---------07:19----------
value in sort of going back and


---------07:20----------
rewinding and even cutting but I want


---------07:23----------
you to watch it okay there's just a tiny


---------07:25----------
tiny flicker of something that suggested


---------07:27----------
that that one was more emotionally


---------07:29----------
painful


---------07:29----------
mmm-hmm so if you got cheated on I guess


---------07:32----------
that make sense it was not good yeah so


---------07:36----------
and and so okay so you've asked out a


---------07:39----------
couple of girls so I think one of the


---------07:41----------
things that could be kind of I mean I


---------07:43----------
I'm kind of curious about is we think


---------07:45----------
about you know what happened in high


---------07:47----------
school you asked about two girls like


---------07:49----------
what do you think it was that kept you


---------07:51----------
from asking out girls in college


---------07:54----------
girls ecologist I just seemed oh I'd


---------07:56----------
meet any I was playing video games


---------07:58----------
old-time friends yeah so I think that's


---------08:00----------
a typical answer that is probably a


---------08:03----------
little bit incorrect that my members do


---------08:05----------
right so what I'm imagining is like so


---------08:08----------
let's assume I mean maybe you didn't go


---------08:11----------
out and meet idea I'm sure you gained a


---------08:13----------
lot when I was gaming a lot in college


---------08:14----------
do I still ask out girls and got her job


---------08:16----------
did a fair amount I mean they're


---------08:19----------
everywhere


---------08:19----------
right like you're going to class and


---------08:21----------
they're a girl writer and you could have


---------08:23----------
asked them out


---------08:24----------
yeah if I guess I waited I don't I don't


---------08:27----------
buy that over four years of college you


---------08:30----------
did not encounter and have interactions


---------08:32----------
with girls that you did not find


---------08:33----------
attractive


---------08:38----------
I did but I remember there were three


---------08:40----------
girls callers I found attractive all my


---------08:43----------
boyfriend's couldn't really ask them out


---------08:45----------
okay so just to kind of think through


---------08:49----------
this a little bit like so in medicine


---------08:51----------
you know we talked about differential


---------08:52----------
diagnosis right so it's if there's a


---------08:54----------
particular symptom what are all the


---------08:56----------
things that could be causing the symptom


---------08:58----------
so in this case I'm just thinking a


---------09:00----------
little bit about the symptom of not


---------09:01----------
asking anyone out in college so so far


---------09:04----------
we've gotten two answers right because


---------09:06----------
the first one I push back on and now


---------09:07----------
Simon tells us oh it wasn't so the first


---------09:10----------
his first answer was oh I didn't have


---------09:12----------
time to ask any when I was playing too


---------09:13----------
many videos and when I press you your


---------09:15----------
answer changes sure do you guys see that


---------09:17----------
like you see that how that happened so


---------09:19----------
and his answer is oh I I wanted to ask


---------09:22----------
them out but they had boyfriends so I


---------09:25----------
did now that's like a very different


---------09:26----------
answer it's not that I wasn't attracted


---------09:28----------
to people oh yeah it's that they weren't


---------09:31----------
available but the what you tell us and


---------09:34----------
probably seduce them to be what you tell


---------09:35----------
yourself is that it's because they it's


---------09:41----------
because I was playing - in video games


---------09:42----------
and so the interesting thing is that you


---------09:44----------
know I see this a lot with gamers when I


---------09:46----------
sort of we start to dig in and kind of


---------09:48----------
really think a little bit about dating


---------09:51----------
and why you ask girls out why or you


---------09:53----------
know the case it sounds like it's


---------09:54----------
sclusively girls um but when you're sort


---------09:58----------
of interested in someone and like we


---------10:00----------
come up with answers but I would imagine


---------10:02----------
I can just like put myself in in my own


---------10:05----------
shoes and just thinking a little bit


---------10:07----------
about you know if I asked two girls out


---------10:09----------
in high school like high school is a


---------10:10----------
pretty pretty psychologically fragile


---------10:12----------
time and you know if I'm asking two


---------10:16----------
girls out and they say no I think it's


---------10:19----------
gonna be very difficult from a


---------10:20----------
confidence perspective to be able to ask


---------10:23----------
girls out in college like it's gonna


---------10:25----------
take time or energy or effort or


---------10:28----------
something is really gonna have to change


---------10:30----------
for me to overcome that huh


---------10:32----------
and the really tricky thing about that


---------10:34----------
is that I'm not getting that sense for


---------10:37----------
me like I'm not getting any I mean


---------10:40----------
whether it was true or not true in your


---------10:42----------
case we're not really sure but what I'm


---------10:44----------
definitely not getting is any awareness


---------10:45----------
of that fact right that that what it was


---------10:48----------
is maybe a lack of confidence like there


---------10:50----------
were three girls you were trying


---------10:51----------
do you know it's you know not to say


---------10:55----------
that you should try to interfere with


---------10:56----------
someone's relationship but sometimes


---------10:58----------
people ask out people who are in


---------11:01----------
relationships yeah right and I'm not I'm


---------11:04----------
not trying to put a value judgment on


---------11:06----------
whether that's a good idea or a bad idea


---------11:09----------
um but maybe it's disrespectful but so


---------11:14----------
it's kind of interesting and then the


---------11:16----------
other thing that I kind of want to


---------11:17----------
fast-forward to is you said something


---------11:19----------
pretty interesting which is that like


---------11:20----------
recently you stopped caring and you


---------11:23----------
should share a little bit about that I


---------11:25----------
think it's it goes to the competence


---------11:27----------
idea um I feel like I'm at a point where


---------11:32----------
I guess I'm a good catch is why well I'm


---------11:34----------
in my mind I'm pretty decent catching up


---------11:36----------
pretty good pretty good guy overall


---------11:38----------
decent education decent background good


---------11:42----------
really nice family


---------11:46----------
very nice oh sorry definitely so I just


---------11:50----------
I don't feel like


---------11:53----------
I don't feel like anyone would be


---------11:54----------
missing anything


---------11:56----------
dating me yes


---------11:59----------
you guys notice how he didn't comment on


---------12:01----------
his physical appearance


---------12:04----------
so so what we can imply from that is


---------12:07----------
that you may be he may have some


---------12:08----------
concerns about his physical and it's


---------12:10----------
right because when when kangaroo is


---------12:12----------
talking about why he's a catch he


---------12:15----------
doesn't say anything about its physical


---------12:17----------
appearance


---------12:20----------
how did you sit thing down a lot really


---------12:22----------
but I didn't have a great self-image


---------12:24----------
I think it's been improving that's


---------12:26----------
probably not where I want you to be good


---------12:32----------
so the other thing is would you feel


---------12:35----------
comfortable talking about that or is


---------12:37----------
that yeah what do you think about how


---------12:40----------
you look


---------12:42----------
honestly I think I'm a little overweight


---------12:44----------
from playing around in the face little


---------12:48----------
pushier that I'd like to be then I used


---------12:50----------
to be


---------12:53----------
I think that's the main main idea okay


---------12:55----------
and


---------12:58----------
what do you say used to be so view is


---------13:00----------
there been some since there's been a


---------13:03----------
change do you feel like that's come with


---------13:04----------
a change in your confidence too


---------13:10----------
I'm actually not sure


---------13:12----------
[Music]


---------13:13----------
most of the change happen second to


---------13:17----------
third year college so I'm not I think I


---------13:19----------
already had some poppin issues that then


---------13:22----------
that weren't related to the way it


---------13:23----------
looked and they may be evolved into or


---------13:26----------
maybe


---------13:28----------
the lock was pulled into that eventually


---------13:29----------
yeah so you know that's a really


---------13:32----------
interesting idea


---------13:35----------
because you're almost suggesting that


---------13:39----------
lack of confidence is the origin and it


---------13:42----------
kind of it's almost like a monster that


---------13:44----------
like gobbled some concerns around your


---------13:47----------
appearance and so it's not necessarily


---------13:50----------
that your appearance leads to a lack of


---------13:54----------
confidence it's that your lack of


---------13:56----------
confidence is almost like this


---------13:57----------
psychological entity within you that


---------13:59----------
latches on to your appearance and that's


---------14:02----------
actually a really common way that the


---------14:05----------
mind works is that we tend to have


---------14:07----------
feelings and then what happens is our


---------14:10----------
feelings will come up for justifications


---------14:14----------
to make them feel more real so for


---------14:17----------
example you know there's some people


---------14:18----------
that I work with that are quite


---------14:20----------
attractive but feel like they're not


---------14:22----------
attractive at all and what happens is


---------14:25----------
they'll zero in on the tiniest most


---------14:27----------
irrational thing about their appearance


---------14:29----------
because and it doesn't matter how much


---------14:32----------
you argue with them and you can say like


---------14:33----------
oh yeah your nose looks fine it's not


---------14:35----------
too big it's not too small as fine yeah


---------14:37----------
and that doesn't that doesn't enter into


---------14:40----------
them if it doesn't like coat so kind of


---------14:43----------
sink into their head in any way in my


---------14:45----------
you know a lot actually I get that a lot


---------14:46----------
from my sister what do you get from that


---------14:49----------
she's like oh well I hate taking


---------14:51----------
pictures of myself I hate being in


---------14:52----------
pictures I don't like having things


---------14:53----------
taken to me and it's usually because


---------14:56----------
like you know I don't think I look good


---------14:57----------
in pictures yeah like I don't think I


---------14:58----------
look like on video sometimes and I gain


---------15:01----------
from I say she's like no you're you're


---------15:02----------
decent looking guy before how do you


---------15:04----------
keep worrying about that so you know you


---------15:05----------
look fine stop it yeah no I promise they


---------15:07----------
tell me that like I understand out like


---------15:09----------
a rational level but I don't get it


---------15:12----------
you just it doesn't take in yes so on


---------15:14----------
what level do you not get it's emotional


---------15:18----------
right


---------15:21----------
case in point yeah so this is where the


---------15:23----------
tricky thing is that you know we've


---------15:24----------
talked a little bit about like rational


---------15:26----------
versus emotional so now I think we're


---------15:29----------
going a little bit off topic but


---------15:31----------
hopefully this is okay so now the


---------15:33----------
question becomes okay so like you don't


---------15:35----------
feel so speaking of what let me just tie


---------15:38----------
things together so I do believe that


---------15:40----------
part of the reason that you have not


---------15:42----------
asked out girls is because you're


---------15:44----------
concerned about your appearance right


---------15:46----------
and I think that like the more we talk


---------15:48----------
about it the more clear it seems to me


---------15:51----------
yeah that you're concerned about your


---------15:52----------
appearance and the funny thing is you've


---------15:54----------
made lots of like rationalizing


---------15:55----------
statements like you've said like oh yeah


---------15:57----------
you know I listen used to look better


---------15:58----------
but I would guess that even if I had


---------15:59----------
talked to you when you cornered what


---------16:01----------
looked better that you probably felt the


---------16:02----------
same way that you do now that material


---------16:05----------
yeah so the interesting thing is that if


---------16:07----------
we really pause and look at that even


---------16:09----------
though there was an objective difference


---------16:11----------
in the way that you look you're feeling


---------16:13----------
about the way you look is exactly the


---------16:15----------
same okay


---------16:16----------
so now we come to another problem that a


---------16:18----------
lot of gamers add which is that you know


---------16:21----------
you think that there's a problem which


---------16:22----------
is that you don't look good enough and


---------16:24----------
so you try to improve your appearance


---------16:25----------
and there's definitely value to working


---------16:28----------
out and taking care of yourself as a


---------16:30----------
confidence booster but I would argue


---------16:32----------
that the root of the problem actually


---------16:34----------
has nothing to do with the way you look


---------16:36----------
but has more to do with the way you feel


---------16:40----------
you look


---------16:43----------
yeah


---------16:44----------
and so then the question becomes okay so


---------16:46----------
like if we can see that what do we do


---------16:49----------
about


---------16:52----------
I've been pretty much telling myself


---------16:54----------
it's not true over and over again how's


---------16:56----------
that working for you it's hopping a


---------16:58----------
little bit okay hopping that's why I've


---------17:00----------
been able to ask more people at


---------17:00----------
essentially the more times I'm like up


---------17:02----------
stopping you're being dumb like every


---------17:04----------
time that thought entered my head


---------17:07----------
I think it's weird because sometimes


---------17:09----------
it's like yeah that is like you know I'm


---------17:13----------
a lot flatter than easy but yeah that is


---------17:14----------
true but doesn't really matter okay so


---------17:19----------
now there's a subtle difference in that


---------17:21----------
state right there's a subtle difference


---------17:24----------
between arguing with yourself in terms


---------17:26----------
of invalidating the way that you feel so


---------17:29----------
if we think about this like let me just


---------17:30----------
tunnel down and try to make this into


---------17:32----------
like a math equation from a


---------17:33----------
psychological perspective so one is that


---------17:36----------
I feel unattractive and then I can argue


---------17:39----------
with myself right I can say like oh but


---------17:41----------
I've worked out and I like I got this


---------17:43----------
new shirt and I like about this like


---------17:45----------
hundred dollar haircut you can argue


---------17:48----------
with yourself and that can help a little


---------17:50----------
bit but it doesn't seem to help very


---------17:51----------
much and I would argue that most people


---------17:54----------
who are watching sometimes have negative


---------17:57----------
thoughts about themselves and that


---------17:58----------
they're actually pretty good at arguing


---------18:00----------
against them but despite arguing against


---------18:03----------
them that they still struggle with those


---------18:06----------
those thoughts the interesting thing


---------18:09----------
though that I think the reason it's


---------18:11----------
become easier for you is because


---------18:12----------
somewhere along the way you didn't start


---------18:14----------
you didn't convince yourself that you're


---------18:16----------
wrong you stopped caring yeah right so


---------18:20----------
if we really let tunnel down into what's


---------18:21----------
idle I mean a kangaroo said he said I


---------18:24----------
stopped caring or it doesn't matter it


---------18:26----------
doesn't matter yeah and so there's a


---------18:28----------
part of you that's actually if you


---------18:30----------
really think about it like you know so


---------18:31----------
you didn't mention appearance when


---------18:33----------
you're talking about your positive


---------18:35----------
qualities but I think somewhere along


---------18:37----------
the way and I'd be curious kind of how


---------18:38----------
you came to this conclusion and we can


---------18:40----------
sort of see that he's come to this


---------18:41----------
conclusion because he's started to


---------18:43----------
realize that like okay even if I'm not


---------18:45----------
the most attractive guy which he kind of


---------18:47----------
accepts it doesn't mean that I can't


---------18:49----------
find a relationship that I still have a


---------18:52----------
lot of things to offer someone I can be


---------18:54----------
funny I can be engaging I'm intelligent


---------18:56----------
I'm a catch I'm doctor know so like that


---------19:00----------
apparently is supposed to attract a lot


---------19:03----------
of women


---------19:05----------
not everything that's cracked up to be


---------19:06----------
common as if you guys are in med school


---------19:10----------
you'll learn that lesson the hard way


---------19:11----------
it's allowed to be a decent human being


---------19:13----------
yeah and what do you think about that


---------19:18----------
what do I think about what do you think


---------19:20----------
about like


---------19:22----------
actually what's changed in you is not


---------19:23----------
your perception of how you look but that


---------19:26----------
you stop you sort of accepted that you


---------19:28----------
may not be the most attractive guy and


---------19:29----------
it actually doesn't necessarily affect


---------19:32----------
how we are going to find relationship or


---------19:35----------
whether you're going


---------19:39----------
I think it's been nice like it's kind of


---------19:42----------
freeing way just not just like its


---------19:46----------
weight sitting on my mind anymore mm-hmm


---------19:48----------
I mean it's still there just because I


---------19:49----------
do see like my best friend just got


---------19:51----------
married like don't want a girlfriend


---------19:54----------
well thanks going on but I think it's


---------19:57----------
just have so many things I'm doing right


---------19:59----------
now that are going positively I'm like


---------20:00----------
that I feel like it will come it will


---------20:03----------
happen


---------20:03----------
okay do you think that um


---------20:09----------
so when your girlfriend I mean when your


---------20:11----------
your best friend gets married and you


---------20:12----------
kind of think to yourself I still don't


---------20:14----------
have a girlfriend do you also have the


---------20:16----------
thought that maybe it's because I'm not


---------20:18----------
attractive enough


---------20:20----------
no not in that case room okay all right


---------20:23----------
it's not I don't know if that would be


---------20:24----------
is in the past not anymore


---------20:28----------
what do you think it is that kinda keeps


---------20:31----------
you from having a girlfriend man


---------20:33----------
I think it's just the amount of


---------20:35----------
traveling about to do over the last year


---------20:36----------
and then once same city from more than


---------20:39----------
maybe month or two mm-hmm though if I


---------20:43----------
meet someone it's like yeah hey well


---------20:44----------
hang out for a bit and then unconscious


---------20:46----------
another to another state sure by then I


---------20:49----------
keep talking them acute accent but it's


---------20:50----------
just it doesn't feel a thing


---------20:52----------
as you know it's an actual relationship


---------20:53----------
yeah I mean I think that that that is


---------20:56----------
really hard if we really think about


---------20:57----------
relationships you know a lot of times


---------20:59----------
they have to start you can do


---------21:01----------
long-distance but you know usually


---------21:03----------
there's a pretty solid foundation before


---------21:06----------
you kind of transition


---------21:10----------
I think I've just been moving around so


---------21:11----------
much that even if I place I found


---------21:12----------
someone Santoni I was only there for


---------21:14----------
four weeks and I met them the last week


---------21:16----------
I was there at that point I was like all


---------21:18----------
right hi nice to see you hopefully we'll


---------21:19----------
keep talking he's still texting with ya


---------21:23----------
how's that coming oh well we're both


---------21:26----------
doing a lot though she's on third-year


---------21:30----------
rotations so she's always running around


---------21:32----------
and so you know do I get texts much but


---------21:34----------
we do text when was it that you started


---------21:39----------
or I guess I should say kind of stopped


---------21:42----------
caring as much about her


---------21:45----------
or maybe a better way to put us when did


---------21:47----------
it that start to impact you less in


---------21:50----------
terms of you recognizing your value for


---------21:53----------
a relation


---------21:55----------
probably over the last six months


---------22:00----------
I guess mostly after step two is over


---------22:01----------
okay those are the real big event yes


---------22:05----------
can you explain a little bit about what


---------22:07----------
step two so step two is our second


---------22:10----------
licensing exam for a medical school and


---------22:13----------
get your degree without it and one of


---------22:15----------
the biggest exams with my life so I


---------22:17----------
think yeah so I had a lot a lot of just


---------22:22----------
a tough time with that exam overall hmm


---------22:23----------
long I was studying you know again


---------22:26----------
loneliness it again because in a room by


---------22:28----------
myself for 16 hours a day


---------22:31----------
not my favorite time favorite six weeks


---------22:34----------
yeah and so it sounds like the feelings


---------22:38----------
of loneliness were pretty Abbey burn


---------22:40----------
during that time step one as well but


---------22:42----------
first license Museum same thing


---------22:47----------
I think a lot of it got a little better


---------22:49----------
during med school because I started


---------22:50----------
studying with people before that I did


---------22:53----------
like a master's program and again I have


---------22:54----------
that same issue only I was studying by


---------22:57----------
myself


---------22:57----------
didn't really enjoy that


---------23:00----------
do you think I mean do you remember


---------23:04----------
feeling lonely in college


---------23:07----------
I don't know not in college I don't know


---------23:10----------
that was because I was just I was like


---------23:12----------
always had core framework around me like


---------23:14----------
you know always had at least one or two


---------23:16----------
people around at some point or the other


---------23:17----------
playing video games or just hanging out


---------23:18----------
reading or something no I don't think I


---------23:21----------
called you I was probably


---------23:23----------
so interesting right because now if we


---------23:26----------
child down into college a little bit


---------23:27----------
more it sounds like you were hanging out


---------23:28----------
with people yeah


---------23:29----------
and yet I guess never encountered a girl


---------23:32----------
it was usually the same group of people


---------23:34----------
okay


---------23:35----------
I didn't go a lot like club activities


---------23:36----------
very much I didn't do a lot of sports in


---------23:38----------
college


---------23:40----------
I went to classes most of the time


---------23:44----------
sample since I went four of us well I


---------23:48----------
didn't look I didn't go to parties I


---------23:50----------
didn't really was a big drinker I didn't


---------23:51----------
like those big big parties


---------23:56----------
you think that not being a big drinker


---------23:58----------
his impact of your ability to find


---------24:01----------
I never really considered how important


---------24:04----------
in any way I enjoy may become lots of


---------24:07----------
red wine so I don't really if someone's


---------24:08----------
not okay if someone has problem with not


---------24:10----------
drinking I feel like that's already


---------24:12----------
someone I'm not going to be yeah with


---------24:13----------
general sure so what was it that changed


---------24:16----------
after step two that sort of started to


---------24:20----------
stop I mean you felt like you had no


---------24:23----------
value like you got a confidence


---------24:27----------
I think it was that like I had career


---------24:28----------
bath I had a goal and I have stuff I'm


---------24:30----------
working towards and there's nothing


---------24:32----------
that's gating me from that anymore


---------24:33----------
I'm not kid anymore I don't think that


---------24:35----------
was the biggest things like I will have


---------24:37----------
a good decent career you know I can make


---------24:40----------
my own success from here on and I'm not


---------24:42----------
worried I'm worried about


---------24:45----------
to support basic sporty muscle okay so


---------24:49----------
it sounds like you got some degree of


---------24:50----------
Independence yes Barroso and with


---------24:53----------
independence comes some degree of like


---------24:55----------
confidence in who you are as a person


---------24:58----------
um yeah so I mean I think that makes a


---------25:01----------
lot of sense so let's kind of like track


---------25:03----------
through and try to see what we can learn


---------25:05----------
from kangaroos kind of perspective and


---------25:07----------
experience so the first is that you know


---------25:11----------
kangaroo has had some feelings of


---------25:13----------
loneliness and hasn't been able to


---------25:16----------
really have a serious relationship if we


---------25:20----------
really think it have yeah so if we if we


---------25:24----------
think oh man I just want to rewind I


---------25:27----------
wish there's like no because I was


---------25:29----------
frustratingly it was during the odd one


---------25:32----------
a polygon midterm exams - huh it was


---------25:34----------
right after spring break or during


---------25:36----------
spring break we were fine until spring


---------25:38----------
break she went abroad found some guy


---------25:41----------
there I didn't hear about this for four


---------25:43----------
weeks afterwards like cake she came back


---------25:44----------
ignored me for my three weeks I was like


---------25:47----------
what the heck's going on like I don't


---------25:48----------
have no idea what just happened and I'm


---------25:50----------
here for week sent from her friend that


---------25:51----------
she has a boyfriend that Spring Break


---------25:54----------
and like you know it wasn't the problem


---------25:57----------
of her getting the boyfriend I go fine


---------25:59----------
you know he found someone sure didn't


---------26:01----------
want me it was that I didn't hear for


---------26:03----------
four weeks she didn't have the decency


---------26:05----------
to tell me for that long how do you feel


---------26:07----------
about that I think that that would that


---------26:09----------
infuriated me really bad infuriate yeah


---------26:11----------
in anger anger anger right that's the


---------26:13----------
yeah yeah and so the you know the


---------26:18----------
interesting thing if we're just thinking


---------26:20----------
about this is like right like I


---------26:22----------
purposely have been waiting for kangaroo


---------26:24----------
to tell me more about that relationship


---------26:25----------
not a ski right so like this is where


---------26:29----------
you know for a lot of a lot of gamers


---------26:31----------
like their emotions that are pent up but


---------26:33----------
like you know it just takes some on the


---------26:36----------
one hand it takes some amount of like


---------26:37----------
opening up to get getting kind of a


---------26:39----------
space to talk about it but the other


---------26:41----------
thing is that I actually don't have to


---------26:42----------
ask you yeah that's true it just wants


---------26:44----------
you know it just it just wants to come


---------26:45----------
out and the funny thing is if we if we


---------26:47----------
track back to the beginning of the


---------26:48----------
conversation we asked and grew like why


---------26:51----------
don't you have a girlfriend is like oh


---------26:52----------
I'm too busy but the truth of the matter


---------26:54----------
is like that kind of stuff sits with you


---------26:56----------
right like that affects like there's no


---------26:59----------
way I mean and I hopefully the people on


---------27:01----------
stream caught this there's like there's


---------27:02----------
no way that that is that still yeah it


---------27:05----------
does it's still e right and people can


---------27:08----------
see it and the crazy thing is when it


---------27:09----------
comes to dating


---------27:11----------
like you don't even you're not even


---------27:13----------
aware that that's there mm-hmm but


---------27:15----------
there's so much there it's like we pop


---------27:17----------
does it the anger just comes right out


---------27:19----------
and it's like it's you know this is what


---------27:21----------
happened in like you remember the


---------27:22----------
details right she's gone for this many


---------27:24----------
weeks three weeks she was ghosting me I


---------27:25----------
heard from her friend that he had a boy


---------27:28----------
like you know you remember all the


---------27:29----------
details and it's like seared in your


---------27:30----------
machina and that kind of stuff is gonna


---------27:33----------
affect right it's it's gonna weigh on


---------27:35----------
things like your confidence yeah


---------27:37----------
which then once your your feeling of


---------27:39----------
like lack of confidence like is there


---------27:42----------
then it's gonna sort of latch on to


---------27:44----------
other things and what kind of talk a


---------27:45----------
little bit more than that about you know


---------27:47----------
how that works in terms of your


---------27:49----------
psychology but before I get to questions


---------27:52----------
so let's just kind of recap you know so


---------27:54----------
I think a couple of things for people


---------27:55----------
who are watching streams so the first


---------27:57----------
thing is Kangoo thank you for for you


---------27:59----------
know opening yourself up in a vulnerable


---------28:01----------
way you know if there are people who are


---------28:04----------
who are watching stream and want to


---------28:07----------
share something about their own lives


---------28:09----------
like we'd love to have you on you know


---------28:11----------
it can be anonymous or whatever we can


---------28:12----------
do it over voice chat and if you guys


---------28:15----------
are in the Boston area and want to come


---------28:16----------
to my office you're welcome to do that


---------28:18----------
so thank you very much for sharing that


---------28:20----------
I think a couple of things that we can


---------28:22----------
just think a little bit bit about in


---------28:23----------
terms of what's relevant for gamers the


---------28:26----------
first thing is that if we think about


---------28:28----------
how kangaroos mind works you know he he


---------28:31----------
comes up with the most sterile reason


---------28:34----------
first in terms of why he doesn't have a


---------28:37----------
girlfriend and it's because I don't have


---------28:38----------
time and then you know as things kind of


---------28:43----------
evolved we begin to see that they're


---------28:44----------
like different reasons why he doesn't


---------28:48----------
have a girlfriend there's like more to


---------28:49----------
it right there's a sense that he's


---------28:51----------
actually like not a catch which is


---------28:54----------
changing now and we'll dig a little bit


---------28:55----------
more into like where confidence comes


---------28:58----------
from and how you get confident right


---------29:00----------
because the big thing is that when you


---------29:01----------
were in college and like you know when


---------29:03----------
you were asking people out and stuff


---------29:04----------
like that like you weren't confident


---------29:06----------
something has changed within you and the


---------29:07----------
funny thing is it's it's not that you


---------29:09----------
combated and overcame your idea that


---------29:12----------
you're not like you're an unattractive


---------29:14----------
dude which is what most people think


---------29:16----------
needs to be done right if you think to


---------29:17----------
yourself oh like I'm not confident


---------29:19----------
because I'm unattractive the gamers


---------29:22----------
solution is that I need to go to the gym


---------29:23----------
and guess who and once I'm


---------29:25----------
let then the women will like yeah or a


---------29:27----------
lot of what also happens is is like


---------29:29----------
gamers that go to play so I saw this in


---------29:30----------
med school where people think one time a


---------29:32----------
doctor once I make a ton of money like


---------29:34----------
the women are gonna lend it not how it


---------29:36----------
works not oversell and and so if we


---------29:40----------
really dig down into it we begin to see


---------29:42----------
that there's there's some degree of like


---------29:43----------
a lack of confidence and also that you


---------29:47----------
know there's there's some hurt right


---------29:48----------
like there's there's even like you can


---------29:50----------
almost think about it like trauma in


---------29:52----------
terms of you know you ask someone out


---------29:55----------
and put you put yourself out there and


---------29:57----------
you get burned and then if you kind of


---------29:59----------
think about like a behavioral


---------30:00----------
perspective as you get burned that's


---------30:03----------
going to change your behavior and you're


---------30:04----------
not going to ask someone out again right


---------30:06----------
because you just don't want to get


---------30:08----------
exposed to that hurt


---------30:11----------
and the other thing that we can kind of


---------30:12----------
think a little bit about is he had this


---------30:13----------
experience where you know after all of


---------30:16----------
like you know lack of confidence and not


---------30:20----------
having direction in life and all that


---------30:21----------
good stuff


---------30:22----------
you still managed to find someone and


---------30:24----------
then what's it like when you manage to


---------30:26----------
find someone and then they betrayed yeah


---------30:29----------
and so that too is gonna also like I


---------30:32----------
mean what impact do you think it has


---------30:33----------
when when someone gets cheated on your


---------30:36----------
relationship we're sure you feel anger


---------30:37----------
but what do you think it does to your


---------30:38----------
confidence oh it takes it Thanks right


---------30:40----------
and so the cool thing is that that


---------30:43----------
kangaroo is sort of starting to come out


---------30:45----------
of it in terms of starting to recognize


---------30:47----------
that even if he does have feelings that


---------30:50----------
are negative towards his self-image the


---------30:52----------
really cool thing I think here is that


---------30:54----------
he somehow managed to figure out it's


---------30:56----------
not that he's realized that those are


---------30:58----------
wrong it's that he's he's he's starting


---------31:01----------
to wait those less so in the variable'


---------31:04----------
of the equation of am i a good boyfriend


---------31:07----------
or in my boyfriend material


---------31:09----------
something has happened where kangaroo


---------31:11----------
physical appearance is started to become


---------31:13----------
like weighted less let's be kind of


---------31:15----------
become a fraction of what it was


---------31:17----------
I think it's I've seen interest in me


---------31:20----------
even if it's people I'm not I'm not


---------31:22----------
interested in


---------31:22----------
I've seen people are you know start


---------31:25----------
approaching me more Orton or respond


---------31:27----------
like if I'm talking to more something


---------31:28----------
and I think I guess it's a poem they


---------31:30----------
actually do want to talk to me more okay


---------31:33----------
babe well maybe this is not so bad yeah


---------31:36----------
I think that's so we can dig into more


---------31:40----------
unclear whether we're doing this again


---------31:42----------
but we may have someone else but if


---------31:45----------
kangaroo comes back maybe we can dig in


---------31:46----------
a little bit further into you know how


---------31:50----------
I think the funny thing is that if you


---------31:51----------
just look statistically people that have


---------31:54----------
been expressing interest in you since


---------31:55----------
high school that's just true but most


---------31:58----------
human beings don't go seven or eight


---------31:59----------
years without no-one expressing interest


---------32:02----------
I think what happens with a lot of


---------32:04----------
gamers is that they're so wrapped up in


---------32:06----------
their own head that they're unable to


---------32:07----------
see it and so I think what could be


---------32:09----------
going on with you is it you know it's


---------32:11----------
sort of like it's a little bit of like a


---------32:13----------
chicken or the egg thing where someone


---------32:15----------
expresses interested in you you gain a


---------32:16----------
little bit of confidence you get less


---------32:18----------
concerned about your appearance and then


---------32:20----------
since you're you know your head is less
