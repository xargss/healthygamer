---------00:00----------
today's talk is really about


---------00:03----------
how addictions are tied into who you are


---------00:07----------
there's no playbook for addictions and


---------00:09----------
so what happens is addictions kind of


---------00:11----------
prey


---------00:11----------
on our particular psychological


---------00:13----------
vulnerabilities


---------00:15----------
and our own issues that we can


---------00:16----------
accumulate throughout life


---------00:18----------
and so if you really want to understand


---------00:20----------
how to take control of your addiction


---------00:23----------
it's not about watching a video about


---------00:25----------
addictions it's about


---------00:26----------
learning about yourself and as you grow


---------00:29----------
as a person


---------00:30----------
as you develop as a person as you


---------00:33----------
understand who you are that's going to


---------00:36----------
be ultimately the most important thing


---------00:38----------
that will help you become


---------00:39----------
sober and stay sober


---------00:43----------
um with that first of all thanks for


---------00:44----------
coming on


---------00:46----------
thank you and um can you tell me a


---------00:48----------
little bit about uh


---------00:49----------
you know like what what what i should


---------00:51----------
call you today


---------00:52----------
my name is noah noah okay and then


---------00:56----------
um and noah what and what what


---------00:59----------
what do you want to talk what are we


---------01:00----------
talking about today or or anything i can


---------01:02----------

---------01:04----------
um i don't know if there's anything you


---------01:06----------
can help me with but


---------01:07----------
honestly i'm trying to come in here and


---------01:10----------
honestly


---------01:11----------
it's an honor to contribute to your to


---------01:13----------
your i guess you would call it a


---------01:14----------
movement right now


---------01:15----------
so i'm just trying to talk about


---------01:16----------
whatever might be relevant to


---------01:19----------
other people dealing with substance


---------01:20----------
abuse okay


---------01:22----------
uh i guess we could start because i'm


---------01:24----------
really curious about


---------01:26----------
how one would determine if they are


---------01:28----------
addicted to something or not


---------01:30----------
okay sure yeah


---------01:33----------
um and what how do you tell if you're


---------01:35----------
addicted to something or not no


---------01:38----------
i don't [ __ ] sorry can i swear i think


---------01:40----------
so


---------01:41----------
okay i don't [ __ ] know dude so i have


---------01:44----------
in my story uh there's three primary


---------01:47----------
substances


---------01:47----------
nicotine like cigarettes pouches the


---------01:50----------
like


---------01:51----------
uh cannabis and alcohol


---------01:54----------
okay and the problematicness


---------01:59----------
of each of those is always different um


---------02:03----------
and so medicinal i have my medicinal


---------02:06----------
cannabis card


---------02:07----------
and that is a substance where i really


---------02:10----------
struggle to know


---------02:12----------
am i getting medicinal benefits from


---------02:14----------
this or


---------02:16----------
am i an addict rationalizing this


---------02:18----------
through a government paywall


---------02:20----------
does that make sure absolutely man so


---------02:23----------
like i'm


---------02:24----------
very curious about that okay can you


---------02:26----------
tell us a little bit about


---------02:28----------
um can you just tell me


---------02:31----------
okay let me just think about this for a


---------02:33----------
second how to approach this conversation


---------02:38----------
so do you um do we ask about background


---------02:42----------
first or do we


---------02:45----------
yeah let's talk about background for a


---------02:46----------
minute and then we'll we'll get to that


---------02:48----------
get back to that question okay


---------02:49----------
so um can you help me understand a


---------02:51----------
little bit about


---------02:52----------
uh you know have you had problems with


---------02:54----------
any of these substances in the past


---------02:57----------
yeah they've all kind of caused problems


---------03:01----------
but with me personally i'm not sure if


---------03:04----------
it's the substances


---------03:05----------
that are causing problems or if i am


---------03:07----------
just a glutton


---------03:09----------
you know what i mean can you help us


---------03:11----------
understand that


---------03:12----------
well i i recently sorry my jacket is


---------03:15----------
like messing with me


---------03:16----------
i recently hit rock bottom if you could


---------03:19----------
call it that


---------03:20----------
with alcohol and um i reached out to a


---------03:23----------
lot of my family


---------03:24----------
who i come from a family of alcoholics


---------03:27----------
let me tell you and they had


---------03:29----------
beautiful advice one of them being


---------03:32----------
hey noah watch out but during your first


---------03:34----------
week of uh


---------03:36----------
withdrawal from alcohol you're gonna get


---------03:38----------
a sweet tooth like a mofo so


---------03:40----------
uh i mean i was


---------03:44----------
eating a lot of sweets in the past


---------03:45----------
couple weeks or so but


---------03:47----------
even before i discovered alcohol before


---------03:49----------
i discovered cannabis


---------03:50----------
or nicotine um i was a huge spender


---------03:54----------
like going and getting dozens of donuts


---------03:57----------
and just eating them all myself


---------03:59----------
just chasing that dopamine kind of thing


---------04:02----------
and so that's what makes me think


---------04:03----------
perhaps this isn't a substance thing


---------04:05----------
maybe this is something in me so it


---------04:08----------
almost sounds like you're kind of


---------04:09----------
referring to like an addictive


---------04:10----------
personality


---------04:12----------
yes yes oh one second


---------04:15----------
no problem hello


---------04:20----------
yeah sure okay


---------04:23----------
can you noah can you center your camera


---------04:27----------
oh yeah


---------04:32----------
i i think maybe they're talking about


---------04:34----------
height


---------04:36----------
is there some way to to yeah yeah there


---------04:39----------
we go


---------04:40----------
perfect yeah okay let me just


---------04:43----------
yeah i'm not gonna check my discord


---------04:45----------
messages is is that good


---------04:48----------
okay seems like it's good because he


---------04:50----------
hung up um


---------04:52----------
so and and what what


---------04:55----------
what do you mean by rock bottom


---------04:59----------
it's hard to say because i was black out


---------05:00----------
drunk when i hit it man


---------05:02----------
um what do i mean by rock bottom


---------05:09----------
so my rock bottom was on a sunday okay


---------05:13----------
and before this sunday there was a


---------05:16----------
thursday where i also got really drunk


---------05:19----------
um on this thursday


---------05:23----------
i had a really good night with you know


---------05:26----------
me and my roommate and we were just


---------05:28----------
chilling and she wasn't drinking


---------05:30----------
but maybe 9 p.m rolls around and i start


---------05:33----------
drinking


---------05:34----------
and i drink a little too much and so out


---------05:37----------
of nowhere


---------05:38----------
i'm just vomiting in the bathroom and


---------05:42----------
i'm super embarrassed


---------05:43----------
and my roommate has to like look out for


---------05:46----------
me and it's this horrible thing


---------05:48----------
and the next day i'm like yo i'm so


---------05:51----------
sorry i promise you i'm not an alcoholic


---------05:53----------
like i just got a little


---------05:55----------
twisted yesterday and i i hope you know


---------05:58----------
that this is not something that's going


---------05:59----------
to happen again


---------06:00----------
because last year i also had problems


---------06:02----------
with alcoholism


---------06:04----------
so that's what happened thursday and


---------06:06----------
then my rock bottom


---------06:08----------
on sunday man i don't even remember


---------06:12----------
because i took i i remember getting home


---------06:16----------
from the liquor store


---------06:18----------
and then the next morning waking up


---------06:20----------
still drunk


---------06:22----------
while i'm at work i text my roommate


---------06:24----------
like hey what happened last night


---------06:26----------
and she just responds with you need help


---------06:30----------
and that oh man oh man


---------06:34----------
it's a hard thing to digest because you


---------06:36----------
don't even know what you're digesting


---------06:40----------
i'll tell you though i never cried as


---------06:41----------
hard in my life as i did that day


---------06:44----------
because i did what what did what made


---------06:47----------
you


---------06:48----------
cry why were you crying i i'm not one to


---------06:52----------
reach out for help


---------06:53----------
um i'm a very figure it out myself kind


---------06:56----------
of guy


---------06:58----------
but um that monday i


---------07:03----------
texted everyone i texted my mom


---------07:06----------
my older brothers that both dealt with


---------07:08----------
this


---------07:10----------
my dad and it's not weird for me to come


---------07:13----------
out and be like hey i think i have a


---------07:14----------
drinking problem


---------07:16----------
it's not weird for me to do that


---------07:17----------
especially given the fact that


---------07:19----------
literally everyone even my little


---------07:21----------
brother has this


---------07:22----------
issue but reaching out


---------07:25----------
and saying hey i have a problem and i


---------07:28----------
want to stop this


---------07:30----------
that was hard to admit to myself i feel


---------07:34----------
what made it hard to admit to yourself i


---------07:37----------
never thought i would have this problem


---------07:39----------
i didn't start drinking until i was 19


---------07:41----------
now i'm almost 24


---------07:43----------
24 in 13 days and um


---------07:47----------
here i am dealing with alcoholism


---------07:50----------
okay um what makes you think you have a


---------07:56----------
problem


---------08:00----------
with alcohol in particular it is that


---------08:06----------
that's an amazing question why do i


---------08:09----------
think i have a problem


---------08:11----------
with alcohol because the way it makes me


---------08:14----------
feel i never drink and feel


---------08:17----------
proud of it as a matter of fact i drink


---------08:19----------
and then i want to drink more


---------08:21----------
and then i'm constantly trying to drink


---------08:24----------
more and i never really


---------08:26----------
got a grasp on the concept of moderation


---------08:30----------
especially with alcohol because alcohol


---------08:32----------
turns you into a person that doesn't


---------08:34----------
moderate things


---------08:36----------
i i had to recognize that me personally


---------08:39----------
i


---------08:40----------
i can't get carried away by that and how


---------08:43----------
do you feel when you have a drink


---------08:46----------
the first drink is always relieving um


---------08:49----------
what does it relieve


---------08:53----------
it does two things it makes me feel cool


---------08:55----------
and


---------08:56----------
it relieves me of anxieties and


---------08:59----------
responsibility i guess i would say


---------09:02----------
because i'm gonna drink


---------09:04----------
when it's either in the face of this


---------09:07----------
essay i gotta do


---------09:08----------
i'm too stressed out so i'm just gonna


---------09:10----------
down a shot and then boom i got


---------09:13----------
the looseness to engage in this activity


---------09:16----------
yeah i rationalized it now i


---------09:19----------
i don't do nicotine or alcohol but i do


---------09:22----------
continue with my medicinal cannabis


---------09:23----------
but my rule is i don't do it when i work


---------09:26----------
not when i'm doing essays not nothing


---------09:27----------
not right now


---------09:29----------
um and i've liked that that's really


---------09:32----------
vibed with me


---------09:34----------
okay


---------09:37----------
noah so i'm going to ask you kind of a


---------09:39----------
quick question about um


---------09:40----------
so just what you want to get out of this


---------09:43----------
conversation


---------09:45----------
and every time you know we have someone


---------09:47----------
on stream i know that a lot of people


---------09:48----------
kind of come on to help our community


---------09:50----------
and


---------09:50----------
movement or whatever and that's


---------09:53----------
wonderful that's why we


---------09:54----------
do this on stream but i i know it sounds


---------09:56----------
kind of weird but in my mind i actually


---------09:58----------
don't think about helping our community


---------10:00----------
when i talk to an individual


---------10:02----------
what i really focus on is helping that


---------10:04----------
one person because this is


---------10:06----------
one chance that we have over the course


---------10:08----------
of our lives


---------10:09----------
where you know two human beings are


---------10:12----------
meeting for like an hour or two


---------10:14----------
and what i'd really like to understand


---------10:16----------
is like


---------10:17----------
how i can help you in this moment


---------10:20----------
and i kind of have two thoughts


---------10:23----------
okay um one is that like we can have


---------10:26----------
sort of


---------10:26----------
a personal conversation where i ask you


---------10:29----------
about your history


---------10:30----------
you know we kind of dig into like why


---------10:32----------
you're a figure it out myself kind of


---------10:34----------
person i think that's going to be a


---------10:35----------
really important


---------10:36----------
part of your personal journey you know


---------10:38----------
your self-reliance how it's like


---------10:40----------
difficult to


---------10:41----------
reach out for help i think it'll be like


---------10:43----------
a more standard sort of stream maybe


---------10:46----------
a little bit emotional catharsis maybe a


---------10:48----------
little bit of tears


---------10:49----------
you know like all the the standard stuff


---------10:51----------
that you know


---------10:52----------
people will feel connected to you you'll


---------10:55----------
you know there's kind of that standard


---------10:56----------
stuff


---------10:56----------
the other thing that i'm noticing is


---------10:58----------
that you know it seems like you have


---------10:59----------
particular


---------11:00----------
questions and experiences and so the


---------11:02----------
other direction that we could do is a


---------11:04----------
little bit more academic


---------11:06----------
um so so like for example we could talk


---------11:09----------
a little bit about


---------11:10----------
here just the the things that we could


---------11:12----------
talk about so like you know the


---------11:13----------
biological nature of addiction


---------11:15----------
and it's like hereditary kind of nature


---------11:18----------
um


---------11:19----------
you know addictive personalities how do


---------11:21----------
you know if you have a problem and like


---------11:23----------
what makes an addiction


---------11:25----------
it's all these are also gonna be like


---------11:26----------
semi-personal conversations


---------11:28----------
but i'll have basically like some


---------11:30----------
teaching to do


---------11:31----------
um you know like this idea of addiction


---------11:34----------
and moderation being like an


---------11:36----------
alien thing uh this idea of like


---------11:39----------
you know the first drink is about relief


---------11:42----------
and loosening yourself so that you can


---------11:44----------
be normal


---------11:46----------
and then the problem arises because


---------11:48----------
that's never where it stops


---------11:50----------
um you know i think that word looseness


---------11:53----------
that you said is a beautiful word


---------11:55----------
because it really encapsulates like what


---------11:57----------
a lot of people experience


---------11:59----------
there are also kind of these things


---------12:01----------
about like it's not going to happen


---------12:02----------
again


---------12:03----------
i'm not an alcoholic the rules that we


---------12:06----------
come up for ourselves so what are the


---------12:07----------
things that our mind does


---------12:09----------
there's this broader issue of like you


---------12:11----------
know


---------12:12----------
yeah so so i think that there's a lot of


---------12:15----------
stuff that you've gone through that i


---------12:17----------
think is like widely applicable and if


---------12:20----------
you


---------12:20----------
and it really comes down to you like


---------12:22----------
what do you want do you want to try to


---------12:23----------
do


---------12:24----------
a more emotional exploration of your


---------12:26----------
past or do you want to try to


---------12:28----------
map out like what addiction could


---------12:30----------
potentially look like and see what boxes


---------12:32----------
you check


---------12:34----------
yeah well there is something i do want


---------12:36----------
to get out of it but i'm


---------12:38----------
really scared okay i'm


---------12:41----------
really scared can you i think yeah yeah


---------12:44----------
yeah yeah


---------12:45----------
um help me understand that oh


---------12:48----------
here's what i'm afraid of dr k i'm


---------12:51----------
afraid of coming on here


---------12:53----------
being honest about my history


---------12:56----------
my habits and i'm afraid of you


---------13:00----------
telling me that i might have a bigger


---------13:02----------
problem than i realize


---------13:04----------
okay when i say things like oh i'm still


---------13:07----------
using medicinal cannabis


---------13:09----------
but i don't know if i'm addicted or not


---------13:10----------
to that you know so


---------13:12----------
things like that are in my head and i'm


---------13:14----------
really scared to talk about it but i


---------13:16----------
think we should


---------13:17----------
i think we should okay so let's okay so


---------13:19----------
let's talk about it


---------13:20----------
so what would it mean to you


---------13:23----------
if i said noah i think you have a bigger


---------13:26----------
problem than you realize


---------13:35----------
i don't know why it's a little relieving


---------13:37----------
to hear you say that actually


---------13:40----------
is that weird no that's why i asked the


---------13:42----------
question


---------13:43----------
yeah because like i was searching like


---------13:46----------
oh man do i feel


---------13:47----------
yeah sorry so so let me just illustrate


---------13:50----------
what we just did there okay so you have


---------13:51----------
a fear


---------13:52----------
okay so like sometimes in life like


---------13:55----------
we're afraid that someone is gonna say


---------13:57----------
no or someone is gonna say yes like


---------13:59----------
we're afraid of a particular outcome


---------14:01----------
and so our mind instinctively like


---------14:03----------
withdraws from it right and we don't


---------14:05----------
face it we run away from it


---------14:07----------
so the the first thing to do is not to


---------14:09----------
answer the question


---------14:11----------
or not to say noah you have a problem


---------14:12----------
and push you into that fear


---------14:15----------
if we want to overcome this what we


---------14:16----------
really have to do is understand


---------14:18----------
what it is that you're afraid of what is


---------14:20----------
the impact


---------14:21----------
what does it mean for your life if i say


---------14:24----------
noah


---------14:25----------
you gotta give up cannabis you are


---------14:27----------
addicted


---------14:28----------
right like what is the impact like any


---------14:31----------
time there's a hypothetical in our mind


---------14:33----------
that we're trying to avoid


---------14:34----------
the first step to facing it is figuring


---------14:37----------
out what is it truly that we're trying


---------14:39----------
to avoid


---------14:40----------
so what if i told you no i i think you


---------14:42----------
have


---------14:44----------
a bigger problem than you realize what


---------14:45----------
would that mean for you


---------14:50----------
it would mean that you are affirming


---------14:54----------
something that i had suspected


---------14:56----------
for a long time and what do you suspect


---------15:01----------
i suspect that i gotta be totally clean


---------15:04----------
straight edge


---------15:05----------
no substances not even caffeine you know


---------15:08----------
that that's always like been my ideal


---------15:11----------
and yeah


---------15:12----------
strength that idealized it's always hurt


---------15:14----------
me kind of


---------15:16----------
yes so i know this sounds kind of weird


---------15:20----------
noah but


---------15:21----------
i don't need to hear anything else


---------15:23----------
because i i agree with you


---------15:26----------
and here's the reason why i think you


---------15:28----------
probably need to be totally sober


---------15:30----------
that's my instinct right now and the


---------15:31----------
reason is because i trust you


---------15:34----------
it's not about what i say it's about the


---------15:37----------
things that


---------15:37----------
you kind of know like it sounds to me


---------15:40----------
like you know


---------15:41----------
huh i don't trust me i know i understand


---------15:44----------
that you don't trust you but i trust you


---------15:49----------
how does that work because i don't trust


---------15:51----------
myself


---------15:52----------
to make the right i don't trust myself


---------15:55----------
to identify my characteristics


---------15:57----------
accurately


---------15:59----------
i understand that you don't trust you


---------16:01----------
but what i'm saying is


---------16:02----------
i trust you but that sounds like a


---------16:04----------
fallacy how could you possibly trust me


---------16:06----------
you don't know me


---------16:09----------
do you know yourself no no


---------16:12----------
no okay so then why why would you say


---------16:15----------
that that


---------16:17----------
then neither of us knows you and so why


---------16:19----------
would you weigh


---------16:20----------
yourself i mean then it's a wash right


---------16:24----------
okay okay so


---------16:28----------
just as valid for you to trust me as it


---------16:30----------
is for me to distrust myself


---------16:32----------
yeah and here's here's the reason i


---------16:34----------
trust you because i think that like


---------16:36----------
generally speaking i understand how


---------16:38----------
minds work


---------16:39----------
and i think that you are going through


---------16:41----------
this process


---------16:43----------
of coming to terms with what you have to


---------16:45----------
do but deep down you know what i hear is


---------16:47----------
not that you're


---------16:48----------
ignorant it's that you believe something


---------16:51----------
and you're resistant to that belief your


---------16:53----------
resistance


---------16:55----------
to the consequences of what you already


---------16:57----------
know that's what i'm hearing from you


---------17:00----------
consequences of what i already know


---------17:03----------
okay now i'm curious now i'm thinking


---------17:07----------
about


---------17:07----------
why am i so resistant against this


---------17:11----------
exactly that's the right question so


---------17:13----------
then the question becomes what does it


---------17:15----------
mean to you to give up everything


---------17:20----------
to give up everything that's a difficult


---------17:24----------
yeah yeah yeah go for it okay


---------17:27----------
sorry i'm like trying to think you're


---------17:29----------
not my regular therapist so i'm trying


---------17:31----------
not to like get tunnel visioned in on


---------17:33----------
you i want to like keep this uh


---------17:35----------
like uh applicable to other people


---------17:39----------
but could you repeat the question


---------17:42----------
sorry yeah so what like when you say


---------17:45----------
there's a part of you that's like if i


---------17:46----------
tell you you have a bigger problem than


---------17:48----------
you realize


---------17:49----------
then what are you afraid of you're


---------17:51----------
afraid that you have to give up


---------17:52----------
everything right like you have to give


---------17:54----------
up marijuana you have to give up


---------17:55----------
caffeine like


---------17:56----------
you have to give it all up and then the


---------17:58----------
question becomes


---------17:59----------
what's what does that mean for you like


---------18:02----------
what is that


---------18:03----------
practically why you know obviously it's


---------18:05----------
going to be difficult but like


---------18:08----------
what what do you resist about doing that


---------18:12----------
oh i i resist


---------18:17----------
i resist the the pleasure that it all


---------18:20----------
brings me


---------18:21----------
and caffeine is an interesting one


---------18:23----------
because


---------18:25----------
caffeine is the wrench in the in the


---------18:27----------
system because


---------18:28----------
i tell myself like out i'll get a red


---------18:31----------
bull in the morning


---------18:32----------
and i'll hate myself for it but then a


---------18:35----------
part of my mind will be like why are you


---------18:37----------
beating yourself


---------18:37----------
up so much about this you're crazy for


---------18:40----------
being so


---------18:40----------
anti-caffeine and then that makes me


---------18:44----------
question


---------18:45----------
the validity of wanting to quit anything


---------18:48----------
because i'm like oh i'm this is just my


---------18:50----------
social anxiety this is just my


---------18:52----------
self-deprecation


---------18:53----------
being like oh you gotta be a junkie


---------18:55----------
because you're just a shitty person


---------18:57----------
and like do i need to quit caffeine


---------19:01----------
and therefore do i need to quit alcohol


---------19:02----------
do i need to quit nicotine


---------19:04----------
does that make sense yeah what kind of


---------19:06----------
person would you be if you had to quit


---------19:09----------
substances


---------19:14----------
this isn't gonna make sense this is like


---------19:18----------
a personal thing i'm saying to me


---------19:19----------
but i would be the man i imagined when i


---------19:22----------
was a good


---------19:23----------
christian little boy uh


---------19:26----------
i i was incredibly religious up until


---------19:28----------
freshman year of high school


---------19:30----------
and um i mean


---------19:34----------
i i think these feelings of wanting to


---------19:37----------
be straight


---------19:38----------
edge are coming from this little sixth


---------19:40----------
grader that thinks he's gonna get


---------19:42----------
all his answers from the bible uh does


---------19:45----------
that make sense


---------19:47----------
sure makes wonderful sense


---------19:50----------
yeah but to answer your question even


---------19:52----------
better i think i would be a


---------19:53----------
pretty decent person um


---------19:56----------
okay what's wrong with having a red bull


---------19:59----------
in the morning what do you say to


---------20:00----------
yourself when you have a red bull in the


---------20:02----------
morning


---------20:03----------
my heart's gonna hate me in a couple


---------20:05----------
years for this


---------20:06----------
you know and and also there is validity


---------20:10----------
to it because i drink red bull


---------20:12----------
and then i feel the palpitations in my


---------20:14----------
heart and i'm like i know i shouldn't


---------20:16----------
feel my heartbeat right now


---------20:18----------
this is not good for me so


---------20:22----------
you know i i do feel valid in saying


---------20:24----------
things like that


---------20:26----------
so i'm kind of hearing you noah being a


---------20:29----------
little bit stuck


---------20:32----------
yeah boy so so let me ask you something


---------20:35----------
how do you feel about not being


---------20:36----------
religious anymore


---------20:40----------
i think i made the right decision i


---------20:42----------
think um


---------20:43----------
yeah so i think indoctrinated


---------20:46----------
so i i kind of see like i think this is


---------20:49----------
becoming actually a little bit clearer


---------20:51----------
to me so like


---------20:52----------
i want to just point out to you


---------20:55----------
this is going to be hard but so let's


---------20:57----------
just think about using a substance so if


---------20:59----------
you quit substances


---------21:01----------
in a sense you're going back to like


---------21:03----------
your pre-ninth grade self


---------21:05----------
like you're a good little christian boy


---------21:08----------
and there's a part of you that


---------21:09----------
recognizes that leaving be like letting


---------21:12----------
that good little christian boy go


---------21:13----------
is part of your growth so in a sense


---------21:16----------
quitting substances


---------21:17----------
is going back taking a step backward


---------21:19----------
like you become


---------21:21----------
back into the indoctrinated sort of


---------21:22----------
thing because when i asked you like


---------21:25----------
you know how would you feel if you gave


---------21:27----------
up substances and you're like


---------21:28----------
i feel like i'm a good little christian


---------21:30----------
boy again


---------21:32----------
and there's a part of you that doesn't


---------21:34----------
want to be that inappropriately so right


---------21:36----------
like you kind of grew out of it


---------21:37----------
so the first thing is that and this is


---------21:39----------
where there are a lot of things that


---------21:40----------
your mind kind of conflates and mixes


---------21:42----------
together


---------21:43----------
and then so that's one side where where


---------21:45----------
you know you almost


---------21:46----------
go back to being a good little christian


---------21:48----------
boy which is something that it sounds


---------21:50----------
like you probably had to work hard


---------21:51----------
to get away from that place in the first


---------21:53----------
place


---------21:55----------
and then there's also you know all the


---------21:56----------
christian motifs of things like


---------21:57----------
alcoholics anonymous and


---------21:59----------
and things like that which can kind of


---------22:00----------
reinforce um


---------22:03----------
you know some of that thinking and then


---------22:04----------
the other problem is that


---------22:06----------
you know if you continue doing


---------22:07----------
substances you kind of


---------22:09----------
you know if you if you give up


---------22:10----------
substances you also sort of like give up


---------22:13----------
some of your personal growth


---------22:14----------
in a weird way like that's what i'm


---------22:16----------
hearing oh


---------22:19----------
that's so true yeah yeah what do you


---------22:21----------
mean by that what's so true about that


---------22:24----------
i mean i'm i'm thinking back to all the


---------22:25----------
ways i used substances to help me


---------22:28----------
especially in um i'm a linguist i i


---------22:32----------
study spanish


---------22:33----------
and especially in uh my


---------22:36----------
social anxiety and learning spanish and


---------22:39----------
exposing myself to different


---------22:41----------
ways of being marijuana has really


---------22:44----------
helped me


---------22:45----------
in amplify certain anxieties that


---------22:49----------
under the influence of cannabis i was


---------22:51----------
able to finally grab


---------22:53----------
and then understand and then in my sober


---------22:55----------
life i was able to process them better


---------22:58----------
um so it was a very growthful


---------23:03----------
thing uh these substances


---------23:06----------
alcohol and nicotine though and so i


---------23:09----------
think on the other side of the equation


---------23:11----------
you know it sounds like


---------23:12----------
you are very um judgmental towards


---------23:15----------
yourself


---------23:16----------
for using substances


---------23:19----------
so how do you feel about drinking red


---------23:21----------
bull


---------23:24----------
i think it's not necessary i think i do


---------23:26----------
it for the identity


---------23:27----------
when what identity is that i used to be


---------23:31----------
really into parkour like stuntman kind


---------23:33----------
of stuff


---------23:34----------
so i all throughout high school i would


---------23:37----------
like


---------23:38----------
steal mats from the gymnastics team and


---------23:40----------
like


---------23:41----------
practice my roundabouts with a red bull


---------23:43----------
that i got from the local gas station


---------23:45----------
and [ __ ]


---------23:45----------
it was like very nostalgic memories i


---------23:47----------
have with red bull in particular


---------23:50----------
um so yeah that kind of thing i i guess


---------23:53----------
i'm kind of like


---------23:54----------
missing that ambitious little kid that


---------23:56----------
was doing backflips in the gym when no


---------23:58----------
one was looking


---------24:02----------
let me just okay yeah so i i know


---------24:06----------
what i'm really hearing from you is that


---------24:07----------
substances are like


---------24:10----------
tangled up with your identity right


---------24:13----------
not just the red bull but also like sort


---------24:15----------
of like the being the good little


---------24:16----------
christian boy that there are a lot of


---------24:18----------
like


---------24:18----------
parts of you that even anxiety i mean


---------24:21----------
marijuana helped you understand about


---------24:23----------
yourself so like


---------24:24----------
it feels to me like substances and who


---------24:26----------
you are


---------24:27----------
kind of get tied together what do you


---------24:30----------
think about that


---------24:32----------
i i think you're exactly right there's


---------24:34----------
also i have a thought that's very loud


---------24:36----------
in the back of my head that i'd like to


---------24:37----------
voice


---------24:38----------
about the good christian boy thing uh


---------24:41----------
because maybe this can


---------24:43----------
enlighten you about my addictive


---------24:45----------
personality


---------24:46----------
but my first this is embarrassing


---------24:50----------
this is embarrassing but kind of


---------24:51----------
innocent because i was in middle school


---------24:53----------
my first ever addiction was to


---------24:54----------
masturbation and


---------24:57----------
uh it was essentially that you know


---------25:00----------
hating myself


---------25:01----------
so much for watching porn because i was


---------25:03----------
a good christian boy right


---------25:05----------
that uh my struggles with dealing with


---------25:09----------
what i felt like was a masturbation


---------25:10----------
addiction that's


---------25:12----------
why i renounced god as a freshman in


---------25:15----------
high school


---------25:16----------
and it's so silly to say


---------25:19----------
out loud wait wait help me understand


---------25:21----------
that what you renounced god


---------25:23----------
because you're jerking off dude i was


---------25:26----------
so beaten down by the guilt of jerking


---------25:30----------
off that i was like


---------25:30----------
[ __ ] these rules man like i i don't


---------25:33----------
believe in this god [ __ ] it's gonna


---------25:35----------
allow me to jerk off and


---------25:39----------
that that was that okay


---------25:42----------
i stopped going to church so what i'm


---------25:45----------
sort of hearing is that you figured it


---------25:47----------
out yourself


---------25:48----------
you know you're not going to play by


---------25:50----------
anyone else's rules that's not the


---------25:52----------
response i expected


---------25:53----------
why do you say that i figured it out


---------25:56----------
because i felt like that would be a bad


---------25:58----------
thing what i did


---------25:59----------
what would be a bad thing i perceived


---------26:03----------
my masturbation habit as an addiction


---------26:05----------
and then


---------26:07----------
i pursued that addiction as i saw it as


---------26:10----------
an addiction


---------26:11----------
instead of being a religious man


---------26:15----------
and from the perspective of the man i


---------26:18----------
was


---------26:19----------
i had committed the ultimate sin


---------26:23----------
yeah so but i i also so here's what i


---------26:26----------
understand


---------26:26----------
where you're coming from because that's


---------26:28----------
how you felt at that time


---------26:30----------
but if we think about you know someone


---------26:32----------
leaving a religion that they were


---------26:34----------
indoctrinated against at the age of 13


---------26:36----------
that sounds to me like someone who is


---------26:40----------
letting go


---------26:41----------
of societal conventions and


---------26:45----------
kind of living by their own rules


---------26:50----------
i don't really resonate with that okay


---------26:53----------
to be honest i i feel like i missed an


---------26:57----------
opportunity back then


---------26:59----------
uh i feel like i missed an opportunity


---------27:01----------
back then to conquer my addictive


---------27:03----------
personality


---------27:05----------
because even today do you regret it do


---------27:08----------
you regret it


---------27:10----------
absolutely so now now you have to be


---------27:13----------
really careful noah because what i'm


---------27:15----------
hearing you fall into


---------27:16----------
is a very common trap that people with


---------27:18----------
addictions have


---------27:20----------
which is that if there was a fork in the


---------27:22----------
road many years ago and if i had taken a


---------27:24----------
different fork i would not be where i am


---------27:26----------
today


---------27:29----------
okay right it's kind of interesting like


---------27:32----------
we all do this where we say like oh like


---------27:35----------
it's not just people with addictions


---------27:36----------
right it's sort of like the one who


---------27:38----------
you know if you let the one get away you


---------27:41----------
kind of think back


---------27:42----------
oh that was the right relationship for


---------27:43----------
me like i let them get away i shouldn't


---------27:45----------
have done that


---------27:46----------
my whole life would be different today


---------27:50----------
they do this really interesting thing


---------27:52----------
where like instead of solving the


---------27:54----------
problem that you face today


---------27:56----------
you go back to the past you rewrite


---------27:58----------
history through fantasy to create a


---------28:00----------
hypothetical present


---------28:03----------
rewriting the past through fantasy


---------28:06----------
is a huge thing i do it


---------28:10----------
is that a symptom of addiction or is


---------28:12----------
that something like everyone does


---------28:14----------
no it's it's something that um you know


---------28:16----------
i call it the fantasy trap


---------28:19----------
and it's sort of like this weird sort of


---------28:21----------
the three dimensions to it from kind of


---------28:23----------
a neuroscience and psychological


---------28:24----------
perspective but like


---------28:26----------
it you know it's it's just something


---------28:28----------
it's sort of like a coping mechanism


---------28:29----------
that keeps people stuck


---------28:31----------
and because what happens is you're like


---------28:33----------
like so if you're in


---------28:35----------
the present and you're facing a


---------28:36----------
situation like let's say you're trying


---------28:38----------
to figure out if you're addicted


---------28:40----------
if you really think about it that's a


---------28:41----------
really difficult question there's a lot


---------28:42----------
of challenges around it you have to


---------28:44----------
maybe give up things you don't want to


---------28:45----------
give up things


---------28:46----------
and so your mind does that plays this


---------28:47----------
really interesting trick it goes back to


---------28:50----------
when you were 13


---------28:51----------
and then it says if you had done this


---------28:53----------
then imagine where your life would be


---------28:55----------
now and then you think about how easy


---------28:57----------
things would be


---------28:57----------
how wonderful things would be and then


---------28:59----------
an hour goes by and your life hasn't


---------29:01----------
changed but suddenly the question of


---------29:03----------
being an addict is like disappeared from


---------29:04----------
your mind


---------29:07----------
it's kind of it's a weird sort of coping


---------29:10----------
mechanism it's not exclusive to


---------29:11----------
addiction


---------29:12----------
but i i do see it happen in addiction


---------29:15----------
yeah yeah that's really interesting um


---------29:18----------
and so because at the end of the day


---------29:20----------
like your mind is not thinking about


---------29:21----------
solving so if you think about like


---------29:23----------
literally what your


---------29:25----------
you know mental energy is being spent on


---------29:27----------
it's not being spent on


---------29:29----------
solving the issue of whether you're an


---------29:30----------
addict today your mental like literally


---------29:33----------
the thoughts in your head are devoted to


---------29:35----------
rewriting history and then like you run


---------29:38----------
out of mana


---------29:39----------
and there's this weird fantasy about how


---------29:41----------
things would have been different and


---------29:42----------
then like you don't actually make any


---------29:43----------
change in your life


---------29:45----------
because your mind is not thinking about


---------29:47----------
what can i change today it's thinking


---------29:48----------
about


---------29:50----------
how today would be different if only i


---------29:52----------
had dot dot


---------29:54----------
yeah i do that with a uh i don't know if


---------29:57----------
this is the same thing you're talking


---------29:58----------
about but with my social anxiety


---------30:00----------
i do that a lot too where it's like oh


---------30:02----------
this interaction


---------30:03----------
when i was a child like really


---------30:05----------
traumatized me and if i had said


---------30:07----------
something differently then i wouldn't


---------30:08----------
carry that trauma from that event


---------30:10----------
you know absolutely so i think this is


---------30:13----------
where like


---------30:15----------
you know it's weird but your mind


---------30:16----------
focuses on


---------30:19----------
but that's it it's hard to say but


---------30:20----------
that's a completely unproductive way of


---------30:22----------
thinking i'm not trying to like shame


---------30:23----------
you or anything but i'm saying like


---------30:25----------
literally technically that does not do


---------30:28----------
anything for your present problem


---------30:30----------
yeah right so in fact on sunday and then


---------30:33----------
not going to the grocery store


---------30:34----------
just i'm getting fat food i'm sorry can


---------30:37----------
you say that again


---------30:39----------
it's like creating a meal plan being


---------30:40----------
like yeah i'm gonna get my life together


---------30:42----------
exercise every day


---------30:43----------
and then you just don't do it yeah you


---------30:45----------
know absolutely fancy


---------30:47----------
yeah so you're just thinking you spend


---------30:48----------
all the time thinking about everything


---------30:50----------
that you're going to do and then end up


---------30:51----------
not really doing it


---------30:54----------
but let's kind of go back to um


---------30:57----------
let me just think for a second so what


---------31:03----------
so


---------31:04----------
do you think you're addicted to alcohol


---------31:10----------
do you identify as an alcoholic


---------31:13----------
really but i do see a problem between me


---------31:16----------
and alcohol


---------31:17----------
and what i don't problem i i


---------31:21----------
i drink and i don't stop you know i


---------31:24----------
don't drink frequently


---------31:26----------
um before it was like maybe


---------31:29----------
four times a month i would drink uh


---------31:32----------
four or five times a month i would drink


---------31:33----------
but every time i drank


---------31:35----------
it was like rolling the dice man you


---------31:38----------
really don't know


---------31:39----------
if i'm gonna clean the entire apartment


---------31:40----------
or cuss out my roommate


---------31:42----------
and that [ __ ] was really scary um


---------31:46----------
yeah like like my story with the


---------31:48----------
thursday sunday kind of rock bottom


---------31:50----------
thing like one day was really good


---------31:53----------
and it was like don't worry you threw up


---------31:55----------
it happens we all get a little too


---------31:57----------
turned sometimes


---------31:58----------
and then the next day being like you


---------32:00----------
said some


---------32:01----------
really shitty stuff last night you need


---------32:03----------
help


---------32:04----------
because it came out of nowhere um that's


---------32:07----------
why i have a problem


---------32:09----------
what's your problem with that


---------32:14----------
um i recognize that alcohol is something


---------32:17----------
that


---------32:18----------
if i touch i need to surrender that i do


---------32:22----------
not have control


---------32:23----------
i need to surrender my control um


---------32:26----------
or it's inevitable that i am


---------32:29----------
surrendering my control


---------32:31----------
because i can't i cannot look back in


---------32:34----------
hindsight on all the horrible [ __ ] i've


---------32:36----------
done while


---------32:36----------
drunk and then say oh if i had done


---------32:39----------
something different


---------32:40----------
i can't say that instead it's like you


---------32:42----------
were drunk


---------32:43----------
that's on you that's on your drunk self


---------32:46----------
don't let it happen again


---------32:48----------
and yeah so that i think is a great way


---------32:51----------
to tell if you're addicted or not


---------32:57----------
right so i think that's sort of the


---------32:59----------
nature of it like so the first question


---------33:00----------
that you asked me is like how do you


---------33:01----------
know if you actually have a problem i


---------33:03----------
think that's a beautiful way to describe


---------33:04----------
it


---------33:05----------
and i think the issue is that substances


---------33:08----------
you know they affect our mind


---------33:10----------
and either we're in control of the


---------33:12----------
substance or the substance is in control


---------33:14----------
of us


---------33:16----------
and what i'm hearing you really say is


---------33:17----------
that like you


---------33:19----------
you know you kind of give up you kind of


---------33:21----------
put things on autoplay


---------33:23----------
and like like once you become drunk noah


---------33:25----------
like and this also has to do a little


---------33:27----------
bit with sort of like consciousness and


---------33:29----------
mind and things like that i think that


---------33:30----------
like


---------33:31----------
there's a part of you that is aware


---------33:34----------
right and so it it healthy game we try


---------33:37----------
to cultivate like awareness of the true


---------33:39----------
self


---------33:40----------
which is actually outside of the mind


---------33:42----------
and anytime you


---------33:43----------
you use a phrase like blackout drunk


---------33:46----------
what i'm hearing is that your mind is


---------33:48----------
technically operating right because


---------33:49----------
you're still doing things you're saying


---------33:50----------
things things like that


---------33:52----------
but there's no awareness and so it's


---------33:54----------
actually a beautiful example of like


---------33:56----------
complete oblivion


---------33:57----------
of awareness and if we look at the road


---------34:00----------
to enlightenment it's actually in the


---------34:02----------
opposite direction because the goal of


---------34:04----------
like moving towards enlightenment


---------34:06----------
is to cultivate our sense of awareness


---------34:08----------
that exists outside of our mind


---------34:10----------
and our body um okay can you elaborate


---------34:14----------
on that you lost me


---------34:15----------
in how both of those


---------34:18----------
things are outside of the mind but i


---------34:21----------
missed how enlightenment is


---------34:22----------
the opposite spectrum so if we think


---------34:25----------
about blackout drunk so like right now


---------34:28----------
you're thinking right so earlier today


---------34:31----------
you said this beautifully


---------34:33----------
you were like i have a loud thought in


---------34:35----------
the back of my mind so if we think about


---------34:37----------
what that


---------34:37----------
statement means it means that there is a


---------34:39----------
part of you that is observing the action


---------34:42----------
of your mind


---------34:43----------
you you don't say i have a thought you


---------34:46----------
say


---------34:47----------
i have a thought in my mind which


---------34:50----------
implies that your mind is an


---------34:51----------
object and you are outside of it


---------34:54----------
like i have a pain in my hand this isn't


---------34:57----------
me


---------34:58----------
it's my hand i have a crack in my bottle


---------35:01----------
i am not the bottle


---------35:02----------
this is my bottle you're using the


---------35:04----------
possessive


---------35:05----------
to imply that the mind is something that


---------35:08----------
you own


---------35:09----------
does that make sense which in turn means


---------35:12----------
that you are


---------35:13----------
not your mind because you can notice it


---------35:16----------
the same way that you can notice the


---------35:17----------
fingers of your hand


---------35:18----------
but if i lose my hand it would be a


---------35:20----------
tragedy because i couldn't play games


---------35:21----------
anymore


---------35:22----------
but i would still be me right the


---------35:25----------
meanest would exist


---------35:27----------
so and if we think about like what


---------35:30----------
meditation does what meditation does


---------35:32----------
is help helps us strengthen


---------35:36----------
the eye outside of mind so as we become


---------35:40----------
awareness as our awareness of things


---------35:42----------
grow like this is when we tell people to


---------35:44----------
take a step back right so i'm tortured


---------35:46----------
i'm all upset because i've gotten dumped


---------35:48----------
by my girlfriend


---------35:49----------
and then my friends tell me to take a


---------35:50----------
step back and when i'm able to take a


---------35:52----------
step back i suffer less


---------35:54----------
i begin to see things more objectively


---------35:56----------
my life gets better you know


---------35:58----------
and so the road to enlightenment is all


---------36:01----------
about


---------36:02----------
separating the awareness from the mind


---------36:04----------
and cultivating that sense of awareness


---------36:08----------
okay like um like i am not my thoughts


---------36:13----------
rather the vehicle for such


---------36:16----------
uh i don't know what you mean by vehicle


---------36:19----------
but like


---------36:19----------
i'm the thinker of my thoughts i didn't


---------36:21----------
want to say a thinker persona


---------36:23----------
yep good i'm the thinker right so i am


---------36:26----------
like the


---------36:26----------
the liver in like isn't the person who


---------36:29----------
lives


---------36:30----------
within my body i'm the per like so there


---------36:33----------
is a sense of you


---------36:35----------
that exists outside of mind and outside


---------36:37----------
of body


---------36:38----------
because your body changes your mind


---------36:40----------
changes but you remain the same


---------36:42----------
right there's a person like you used to


---------36:43----------
be three years old


---------36:45----------
and then you were a nine-year-old good


---------36:46----------
christian boy and then you were like a


---------36:48----------
rebel parkour person and now you're like


---------36:51----------
someone who's sort of like grappling


---------36:53----------
with you know who you are and what your


---------36:55----------
worth is


---------36:56----------
and during all of those moments there's


---------36:58----------
a certain noah-ness


---------37:01----------
that transcends each of those individual


---------37:03----------
fluctuations


---------37:06----------
certain knowingness now is is that where


---------37:09----------
i want


---------37:10----------
some work to go figuring out what that


---------37:12----------
knowingness is


---------37:13----------
yes because that's where you're all


---------37:15----------
tangled up because even when you were a


---------37:17----------
good christian boy


---------37:18----------
you were still noah and when you were a


---------37:20----------
bad christian boy you were still noah


---------37:23----------
and before you realized you had a


---------37:24----------
problem you were still noah and after


---------37:26----------
you realized you had a problem you're


---------37:28----------
still noah


---------37:28----------
and and this is where like you know you


---------37:30----------
judge yourself a lot for being a bad


---------37:32----------
person for drinking red bull because


---------37:34----------
you're screwing up your life


---------37:36----------
and i would venture that part of the


---------37:38----------
reason you're beating yourself up is


---------37:39----------
because you know four years from now


---------37:41----------
that you're going to go back to the


---------37:42----------
fantasy trap and regret all those red


---------37:45----------
bulls of your drink


---------37:46----------
and then you're going to be telling


---------37:47----------
yourself if i had not drank all those


---------37:48----------
red bulls


---------37:49----------
then i wouldn't be in this situation and


---------37:52----------
then you really really hate yourself


---------37:54----------
because like


---------37:55----------
even now all of those fantasies that


---------37:58----------
you're going to be thinking in the


---------37:59----------
future


---------37:59----------
you can't fix them now i know it sounds


---------38:02----------
if i just lost either


---------38:04----------
but like so now in regard to my


---------38:06----------
substance abuse


---------38:08----------
i think i have a lot of fantasy traps


---------38:10----------
that i escape


---------38:11----------
through substances like um


---------38:17----------
sorry um i'm trying to think of what i


---------38:19----------
want to say


---------38:21----------
how much i want to say it it wasn't easy


---------38:24----------
growing up


---------38:25----------
in my household uh and


---------38:28----------
i think i have a lot of fantasy traps


---------38:31----------
about


---------38:32----------
things that happened in that house and i


---------38:34----------
think


---------38:35----------
i escape those traps with


---------38:38----------
substances does that make sense


---------38:41----------
yeah i think it would help a lot if you


---------38:43----------
could provide an example but if you


---------38:45----------
don't feel


---------38:46----------
comfortable i think that's totally fine


---------38:48----------
yeah well i was talking to zack about


---------38:49----------
this yesterday


---------38:51----------
uh when i was like how


---------38:55----------
i have theories for why i struggle with


---------38:56----------
substance abuse


---------38:58----------
um i don't know if you're familiar with


---------39:00----------
the attachment styles by


---------39:01----------
pool heller i think i'm a very anxious


---------39:05----------
ambivalent kind of person


---------39:07----------
which means um for stream like my my


---------39:10----------
caregivers my parents were very on and


---------39:12----------
off


---------39:13----------
like you cannot expect my mom to provide


---------39:17----------
affection or hatred at any kind of given


---------39:19----------
moment


---------39:21----------
and as such it was really difficult to


---------39:27----------
have a consistent spot where i could


---------39:29----------
really breathe


---------39:30----------
and enjoy myself it was


---------39:33----------
instead it was always like a constant


---------39:35----------
okay what do i got to say to keep mom


---------39:37----------
happy okay what do i


---------39:38----------
where do i go to avoid to stay away from


---------39:40----------
mom you know like


---------39:42----------
[ __ ] like that and


---------39:45----------
if we're talking about fantasy traps man


---------39:47----------
i i fantasize about


---------39:49----------
what i would have done if i was a


---------39:50----------
stronger kid that would have stood up to


---------39:52----------
her


---------39:53----------
and i hate myself so much for not


---------39:55----------
standing up to her that i drink


---------40:01----------
yeah and what what is it what does it do


---------40:04----------
for you


---------40:06----------
when you drink it makes me stop thinking


---------40:08----------
about it because


---------40:10----------
otherwise i'm i'm a very vote that kind


---------40:12----------
of mind i can't stop


---------40:14----------
um even at the end of the day like after


---------40:16----------
i finish my homework i'll lay in bed and


---------40:18----------
i'll be like [ __ ] i should be working on


---------40:20----------
that freaking


---------40:21----------
art project or whatever so um


---------40:24----------
and it's the same with my trauma like


---------40:26----------
the trauma never stops i never stopped


---------40:28----------
thinking about it and i never stopped


---------40:29----------
thinking about


---------40:30----------
how much better how much more productive


---------40:32----------
i would be if x y and z


---------40:34----------
didn't happen to me so that's why i


---------40:36----------
drink


---------40:38----------
yeah so what i'm noticing is that you


---------40:40----------
know this idea of the fantasy trap


---------40:42----------
um is is feels really really relevant to


---------40:46----------
you you notice yourself doing that a lot


---------40:49----------
and and so this is what i enjoy about


---------40:50----------
these conversations so just um


---------40:52----------
i'm gonna just send you a quick dm after


---------40:54----------
we're done with the call


---------40:55----------
um but i i have some other thoughts kind


---------40:58----------
of about the fantasy trap and things


---------40:59----------
like that but


---------41:01----------
um so and


---------41:04----------
if i if i don't dm you just please dm me


---------41:06----------
to remind me okay


---------41:07----------
okay um so i i want to just point out a


---------41:10----------
couple of things


---------41:11----------
and and one is so we've kind of kind of


---------41:13----------
got another fork in the road here which


---------41:14----------
is like do we go down the fantasy trap


---------41:16----------
route or do we go down sort of like


---------41:17----------
stick with addictions and trauma and


---------41:19----------
whatnot


---------41:20----------
um okay so i think that


---------41:24----------
you know the key thing here is that if


---------41:26----------
we think about what alcohol does for you


---------41:28----------
or substances is that it quiets your


---------41:31----------
mind


---------41:32----------
right it helps you forget it reduces


---------41:34----------
your anxiety


---------41:35----------
and now we kind of get to your question


---------41:37----------
about like


---------41:39----------
um you know do i have to give up


---------41:42----------
marijuana


---------41:43----------
i have a medical reason for it and i


---------41:46----------
think that


---------41:46----------
you don't have to give it up but i think


---------41:48----------
it's the same thing


---------41:50----------
and what do i mean by that so like if we


---------41:52----------
think about the function of medical


---------41:54----------
marijuana or even a medically prescribed


---------41:57----------
medication like a you know


---------41:58----------
pharmaceutical medication


---------42:00----------
for acute anxiety what its aim is to


---------42:02----------
calm the mind


---------42:04----------
right so like whether you use alcohol to


---------42:06----------
calm the mind whether you use marijuana


---------42:08----------
to come


---------42:08----------
calm the mind whether you use lorazepam


---------42:11----------
or klonopin to cl


---------42:12----------
calm the mind all of these are


---------42:14----------
artificial substances that are used


---------42:16----------
to reduce your emotional like negative


---------42:18----------
energy


---------42:19----------
right so then the issue is is not one of


---------42:22----------
like whether it does that or not it's


---------42:24----------
just an issue of like


---------42:25----------
where on the spectrum it is so


---------42:28----------
you know as medical professionals we


---------42:31----------
sort of acknowledge and admit


---------42:33----------
that there are some addictive substances


---------42:35----------
like marijuana


---------42:36----------
and things like xanax that we prescribe


---------42:40----------
to people


---------42:41----------
to relieve the emote artificially


---------42:43----------
relieve the emotion of their mind


---------42:46----------
now alcohol does the same thing for you


---------42:49----------
it's just alcohol


---------42:50----------
hurts a lot more causes a lot more


---------42:53----------
problems


---------42:54----------
and so this is where you know there's


---------42:56----------
kind of like


---------42:57----------
i i'm not i'm kind of


---------43:01----------
very simple in my mind about this that


---------43:03----------
there's like a spectrum


---------43:05----------
you use all substances to relieve the


---------43:07----------
the emotions in your mind


---------43:09----------
even who people who don't have a


---------43:10----------
drinking problem still do the same thing


---------43:12----------
right like if i go to happy hour after


---------43:14----------
like a long week at work and i kind of


---------43:15----------
like decompress


---------43:17----------
i'm still using the substance to like


---------43:19----------
mentally


---------43:20----------
relieve me in some way so that's what


---------43:22----------
substances do


---------43:23----------
it's just where on the spectrum does


---------43:25----------
each substance lie


---------43:27----------
and this is where like do i think it's


---------43:29----------
healthy if you stop smoking marijuana


---------43:31----------
absolutely do i think you're ready yet


---------43:35----------
probably not do i think you need to be


---------43:36----------
ready right now


---------43:38----------
probably not and i think it's a journey


---------43:41----------
right so when we think about addictions


---------43:43----------
it's like you start with the biggest


---------43:45----------
problems first


---------43:46----------
and then you don't have to make a


---------43:48----------
commitment to be sober from all things


---------43:50----------
including caffeine today


---------43:52----------
and and this is also where like you know


---------43:54----------
the fantasy trap is kind of like


---------43:57----------
it tricks us into thinking that we have


---------43:59----------
to be perfect that's the real problem


---------44:01----------
with the fantasy trap is that


---------44:02----------
you know you have these thoughts and


---------44:04----------
then you think if this had happened


---------44:05----------
everything would be amazing today and


---------44:08----------
that's not


---------44:09----------
even if that was the case like that's


---------44:10----------
just not how life works like everything


---------44:12----------
wouldn't be amazing to it's just not


---------44:14----------
you know you gotta like you can't go


---------44:16----------
from level zero to level ten you gotta


---------44:18----------
go like level one level two level three


---------44:19----------
level four level five


---------44:21----------
and in your case what i'm really hearing


---------44:22----------
know is that like it's time to really


---------44:24----------
focus on alcohol


---------44:25----------
that's gonna have its whole own host of


---------44:27----------
problems because right now you have a


---------44:29----------
lot of emotional energy


---------44:30----------
around being sober the challenge is


---------44:32----------
gonna arise when like


---------44:34----------
you know a month from now


---------44:38----------
you know i haven't asked you this


---------44:39----------
question yet but what was in your mind


---------44:40----------
when you went to the liquor store


---------44:46----------
always in my mind when i went to the


---------44:48----------
liquor store


---------44:53----------
well for one i was already drunk um


---------44:57----------
horrible mistake don't drink and drive


---------45:00----------
what was going through my mind god i


---------45:02----------
just wanted more i just wanted more


---------45:04----------
relief


---------45:06----------
from what i have no idea what goes


---------45:09----------
through your mind when you purchase


---------45:10----------
alcohol and you're sober


---------45:21----------
i'm thinking about the imagery of


---------45:24----------
taking the drink i'm thinking about how


---------45:27----------
cool i'm gonna feel when i have like a


---------45:29----------
glass of whiskey with some ice cubes in


---------45:31----------
it


---------45:32----------
um i'm just thinking life will be better


---------45:36----------
in a couple of minutes that's one thing


---------45:40----------
that's the dangerous thought okay


---------45:45----------
right because like that's the moment


---------45:46----------
like that so people always think it's


---------45:48----------
like


---------45:48----------
like that that's the so here's the


---------45:51----------
here's the real challenge noah like a


---------45:52----------
month from now


---------45:54----------
like right now you're like filled with


---------45:56----------
shame and you're filled with i gotta do


---------45:57----------
it and i gotta grow and i gotta be a


---------45:59----------
better person


---------46:00----------
i'm gonna talk to dr k i'm gonna learn


---------46:02----------
more about myself


---------46:04----------
it's gonna be great we're on this


---------46:05----------
journey of growth man we're on this


---------46:06----------
journey of growth


---------46:07----------
together and then like over time the


---------46:10----------
emotional energy from the shame of your


---------46:13----------
roommate kind of messaging you or


---------46:14----------
whatever like that's gonna start to


---------46:15----------
dwindle


---------46:17----------
you know the messages between your


---------46:18----------
family like they're all supporting you


---------46:20----------
right now like this is a problem with


---------46:21----------
like support from other people


---------46:23----------
it comes like a torrent instead of a


---------46:25----------
drip


---------46:27----------
right it comes like a flood and we we


---------46:29----------
can see this a lot when like when


---------46:30----------
there's grief it's like everyone's like


---------46:32----------
oh my god


---------46:33----------
like or i see this a lot in people who


---------46:35----------
are diagnosed with cancer


---------46:37----------
where like for the first month


---------46:38----------
everyone's on board


---------46:40----------
and nine months into chemo no one's


---------46:42----------
around


---------46:45----------
and wait you said nine months and no


---------46:48----------
one's doing chemo or no one's supporting


---------46:50----------
no one's supporting the person who's


---------46:52----------
doing chemo like everyone's there


---------46:55----------
and they're like yeah like i'll cook for


---------46:57----------
you i'll do everything and then nine


---------46:58----------
months like


---------46:59----------
no one's around to take people to their


---------47:01----------
appointments no one's around


---------47:02----------
like it's tough that's horrible


---------47:06----------
it is hard are there like volunteer


---------47:08----------
groups for like


---------47:09----------
uh sure there are all kinds of


---------47:12----------
you know systems in place to help those


---------47:14----------
people medical professionals being at


---------47:16----------
the top of the list right because


---------47:17----------
obviously we're still around


---------47:19----------
but i i just want to kind of point out


---------47:21----------
that even like when someone passes away


---------47:22----------
it's like you get a thousand messages


---------47:25----------
when someone hears that you know someone


---------47:27----------
passed away


---------47:28----------
and then a year later when it's their


---------47:29----------
birthday like it's crickets


---------47:32----------
right and and so you're gonna get a


---------47:34----------
bunch of support you have a bunch of


---------47:36----------
emotional energy


---------47:37----------
but over time i just think about this no


---------47:40----------
like emotions don't last forever


---------47:42----------
right so you're that emotional energy


---------47:44----------
that motivation the emotional motivation


---------47:46----------
is gonna wane over time


---------47:48----------
it's gonna decrease and then a month


---------47:50----------
from now or two months from now or on


---------47:52----------
like


---------47:52----------
august 4th you're going to be like oh


---------47:55----------
man


---------47:56----------
feeling good is just a few moments away


---------48:00----------
yeah and the shame is going to be far


---------48:02----------
away then


---------48:04----------
yeah well i don't know because it's so


---------48:06----------
interesting what's happened in the past


---------48:08----------
week


---------48:08----------
because i have felt so proud of myself


---------48:11----------
for well okay it's been hard


---------48:15----------
since quitting nicotine and alcohol


---------48:18----------
i've been like a neurotic mess dude like


---------48:21----------
i'm walking around the house like just


---------48:24----------
having like these little mini screams of


---------48:26----------
like pent-up energy that i just cannot


---------48:28----------
release now


---------48:30----------
um and uh but it just feels so good


---------48:34----------
um i don't know if this is something i


---------48:36----------
should expect


---------48:38----------
to dwindle but i get a lot of


---------48:41----------
fulfillment


---------48:42----------
um on monday you were talking about and


---------48:45----------
i'm wondering if my dharma right now is


---------48:48----------
to


---------48:50----------
get clean yeah yeah so


---------48:53----------
so absolutely so this is where there are


---------48:55----------
some things that will sustain you right


---------48:56----------
because


---------48:57----------
like like people are sober for years


---------49:00----------
and this is where i think if you're if


---------49:02----------
this is a dharmic pursuit


---------49:04----------
that will sustain you if it's an


---------49:07----------
emotional pursuit


---------49:08----------
that won't like if you're quitting


---------49:10----------
alcohol because of the shame


---------49:13----------
like what i'm hearing is that you know


---------49:14----------
you got a text message


---------49:16----------
from your roommate and they were like


---------49:17----------
you need help and it was like


---------49:20----------
shattering and grand and profound


---------49:23----------
and you realized that's all like


---------49:27----------
that's all gonna dwindle yeah but


---------49:30----------
taking confidence and being fulfilled


---------49:33----------
about


---------49:33----------
you know like moving your life in the


---------49:36----------
direction that you want it to go


---------49:38----------
that will absolutely sustain you in fact


---------49:40----------
that's what you need that's what's going


---------49:42----------
to fight off


---------49:43----------
the i'm moments away from feeling so


---------49:47----------
good


---------49:48----------
i'm just mere moments away from feeling


---------49:50----------
so good


---------49:52----------
dharma can fight against that absolutely


---------49:55----------
yeah


---------49:56----------
is the only thing that can fight against


---------49:57----------
that yeah right


---------50:00----------
oh because i i have thought in the past


---------50:02----------
like i've tried to get clean in the past


---------50:04----------
and i've had these struggles before and


---------50:07----------
i don't want it to be like


---------50:09----------
oh i'm just on the hype train i'm


---------50:10----------
getting all emotional


---------50:12----------
but you know man i've seen that this


---------50:14----------
really fulfills me in a profound way


---------50:17----------
when i exercise discipline and impulse


---------50:19----------
control


---------50:21----------
so yeah so i think those are those are


---------50:23----------
positive i think the other thing that


---------50:24----------
you're doing that is a very good


---------50:26----------
prognostic sign


---------50:27----------
is that you are learning to tolerate


---------50:29----------
your negative emotions


---------50:33----------
right so i hear you being a train wreck


---------50:35----------
and like


---------50:37----------
good job because if we think about it


---------50:40----------
what do the substances do for you


---------50:41----------
is they they take away you being like a


---------50:44----------
neurotic mess


---------50:45----------
right and so the interesting thing if we


---------50:47----------
really look at like conquering


---------50:48----------
addictions i think a lot of it is


---------50:51----------
being able to tolerate and withstand the


---------50:54----------
thing that the addiction takes away


---------50:56----------
because if you can survive it without


---------50:58----------
the addiction you no longer need the


---------51:00----------
addiction


---------51:01----------
and now we get to like a second


---------51:03----------
principle of like you know how do i know


---------51:05----------
if someone is addicted


---------51:06----------
everyone has coping mechanisms when the


---------51:09----------
coping mechanism becomes the only tool


---------51:11----------
in your belt


---------51:12----------
that's when it becomes an addiction


---------51:15----------
okay right so like if i have a long day


---------51:18----------
and


---------51:18----------
i decide to play a video game and like


---------51:21----------
no big deal


---------51:23----------
but when i'm having a bad day the only


---------51:26----------
thing i can do


---------51:27----------
is to play a video game and then like


---------51:29----------
the video becomes


---------51:31----------
video game becomes my soul escape


---------51:33----------
becomes my soul crutch


---------51:35----------
becomes my like dominates the avoidance


---------51:37----------
of the problems in my life


---------51:40----------
like is such a good way to avoid all the


---------51:42----------
problems in my life that's when it


---------51:44----------
becomes a problem


---------51:49----------
yeah yeah go ahead so so just to


---------51:51----------
summarize i think like


---------51:53----------
you being i know it sounds weird it's


---------51:55----------
soft you suffer a lot in the moment when


---------51:57----------
you have these little


---------51:58----------
you know you said you have these little


---------51:59----------
like screams or whatever


---------52:01----------
but i think like your ability to sit


---------52:03----------
with that ultimately is a very good


---------52:05----------
prognostic sign


---------52:06----------
about your long-term sobriety


---------52:10----------
now that is very assuring thank you it


---------52:13----------
just sucks


---------52:15----------
you know ty's gonna suffer because i'm


---------52:17----------
sitting there thinking like am i gonna


---------52:19----------
be


---------52:19----------
like screaming into my pillow for the


---------52:22----------
rest of my life like a freaking maniac


---------52:24----------
or like but nah nah that's crazy


---------52:28----------
i hope uh yeah but i i'm


---------52:32----------
so curious about uh correct me if i'm


---------52:34----------
being presumptuous but you struggled


---------52:36----------
with video game addiction correct


---------52:38----------
yeah when did you personally


---------52:41----------
if i may ask realize this is a problem


---------52:43----------
that i really gotta get under control


---------52:46----------
oh that was the beginning bro from the


---------52:49----------
first time you picked up a video game


---------52:51----------
no no no no not the first time i picked


---------52:52----------
up the video game but like i knew it was


---------52:54----------
a problem


---------52:55----------
years before i did anything about it


---------52:57----------
right and it was it was kind of like


---------52:59----------
you know when i say that there's a part


---------53:00----------
of you that actually knows you're just


---------53:02----------
resistant to it


---------53:04----------
that's that comes from my own experience


---------53:06----------
like looking back on it


---------53:07----------
yeah like i mean you [ __ ] know like


---------53:09----------
you know


---------53:11----------
right i mean like you know like when i


---------53:13----------
you know my


---------53:15----------
third week of freshman year before i


---------53:18----------
failed any classes


---------53:20----------
when i like am skipping all my classes


---------53:23----------
for a week and playing diablo like


---------53:25----------
i know there's a problem yeah like


---------53:28----------
and and that's that's actually what was


---------53:29----------
the vicious cycle is like i knew it was


---------53:32----------
a problem


---------53:32----------
i could see my future slipping away from


---------53:36----------
me one day at a time


---------53:37----------
and the thought of like watching that


---------53:39----------
future like slip away like one day at a


---------53:42----------
time


---------53:43----------
was so painful that i escaped through


---------53:46----------
video games


---------53:48----------
and then two days had gone by and now


---------53:50----------
i've messed up twice


---------53:52----------
and that shame i couldn't sit with so i


---------53:55----------
played another day of video games


---------53:56----------
and then three days had gone by the


---------53:58----------
shame increases


---------53:59----------
the need for video games increases and


---------54:02----------
every step i take


---------54:03----------
i get deeper and deeper down the rabbit


---------54:05----------
hole and like


---------54:07----------
i'm i'm like going down a tunnel and i


---------54:09----------
can see


---------54:10----------
the light like every step i take like


---------54:12----------
the light is getting further and further


---------54:14----------
away


---------54:15----------
and the further away the light gets like


---------54:16----------
the more i like i can't


---------54:18----------
handle it yeah


---------54:21----------
oh my god sorry what my roommate just


---------54:25----------
texted me


---------54:25----------
saying i'm watching you right now i love


---------54:27----------
you so much and i'm like oh


---------54:32----------
that that's so scary how you describe it


---------54:35----------
because god damn's that accurate


---------54:37----------
how so god the freaking going down the


---------54:41----------
rabbit hole and then seeing the light


---------54:43----------
gradually just get tinier and tinier and


---------54:45----------
tinier


---------54:46----------
it it's so hard to convince yourself


---------54:50----------
that i as a man that gets drunk and


---------54:53----------
swears out the people that love him


---------54:55----------
as a man that smokes weed and shows up


---------54:58----------
to a date


---------54:59----------
barely conscious you know as a guy that


---------55:03----------
smokes cigarettes at work until he's


---------55:05----------
passing out while washing the cars


---------55:06----------
like how is that guy even worth


---------55:10----------
escaping that rabbit hole how why does


---------55:12----------
he deserve to escape the rabbit hole how


---------55:14----------
is he going to


---------55:16----------
like [ __ ] that guy man so it i


---------55:20----------
i have a question of how can an addict


---------55:23----------
develop enough self-love to


---------55:26----------
give a [ __ ] about themselves i i feel


---------55:29----------
like that's a flawed question though


---------55:31----------
why is it a flawed question i think


---------55:33----------
self-love is missing the point


---------55:35----------
because i think it's i think it's more


---------55:37----------
like


---------55:38----------
i think the point is not wasting your


---------55:40----------
life away


---------55:41----------
like you mentioned but then again i


---------55:45----------
guess that is self-love because you love


---------55:46----------
yourself enough tonight


---------55:49----------
i mean you seem like you're you're you


---------55:51----------
know exploring important territory so


---------55:53----------
just fill us


---------55:53----------
in on what you think you know ah [ __ ]


---------55:56----------
man


---------55:57----------
i this is what i was scared of because


---------56:00----------
i'm so


---------56:00----------
i do this with my normal therapist too


---------56:03----------
like i get so


---------56:04----------
anxious of like am i talking about the


---------56:06----------
right thing right now


---------56:08----------
yeah um uh could you direct me a bit


---------56:11----------
assuage


---------56:12----------
my sure so let's let's start in a place


---------56:16----------
that will potentially ramp up your


---------56:17----------
anxiety i'm going to ask you a weird


---------56:19----------
question


---------56:19----------
so i'm getting i'm getting a little bit


---------56:22----------
of of like a mask


---------56:24----------
from you noah so you seem really really


---------56:26----------
authentic


---------56:27----------
but you also seem just a touch fake to


---------56:30----------
me


---------56:31----------
oh for sure for sure um


---------56:36----------
yeah i i've dealt with social anxiety


---------56:38----------
all my life being a yes man


---------56:40----------
that's something that i'm very recently


---------56:42----------
getting over


---------56:44----------
um i think i got that from my mom you


---------56:46----------
know


---------56:47----------
i love her she's a much better person


---------56:49----------
now what part of you is being fake with


---------56:56----------
me


---------56:58----------
do you mind if i sit with myself nope


---------57:00----------
not at all


---------57:09----------
i'm being fake to compensate for my fear


---------57:12----------
of being seen as crazy


---------57:17----------
um i really want to come off as someone


---------57:20----------
articulate


---------57:21----------
and someone that has their [ __ ] together


---------57:25----------
but also at the same time i'm admitting


---------57:28----------
that i have all these issues


---------57:31----------
and it


---------57:38----------
it's


---------57:40----------
noah how does it feel to have all be


---------57:42----------
someone who has all these


---------57:44----------
issues


---------57:52----------
feel like i'm not ready to accomplish my


---------57:55----------
dreams


---------57:59----------
[Music]


---------58:00----------
and that's scary going into your last


---------58:02----------
year of university because it's like


---------58:04----------
oh man if i may like interject a little


---------58:08----------
anecdote


---------58:10----------
when i was 19 i i dropped out of college


---------58:13----------
to


---------58:14----------
to teach in honduras for a year i was a


---------58:16----------
volunteer third grade teacher


---------58:18----------
and i


---------58:21----------
loved the fact that i was a teacher but


---------58:23----------
i hated


---------58:24----------
how shitty of a teacher i was


---------58:28----------
um and it was actually in honduras that


---------58:32----------
i


---------58:32----------
started drinking man i'll never forget


---------58:35----------
the day after i got drunk for the first


---------58:37----------
time i i was just like


---------58:39----------
looking at the trees and i was like my


---------58:41----------
brain is completely different now


---------58:44----------
i vividly remember that


---------58:47----------
but anyway um going back to substance


---------58:49----------
abuse like i thought i was a shitty


---------58:51----------
teacher i was like a stupid 20 year old


---------58:54----------
and then coming back and developing


---------58:56----------
these substance abuse issues i feel


---------58:59----------
again like i i'm not ready i'm not ready


---------59:03----------
to graduate college


---------59:04----------
i'm not ready to look for a job i'm not


---------59:06----------
ready to


---------59:07----------
to to have a girlfriend


---------59:12----------
i'm just not enough


---------59:16----------
yeah that's how it works so it's it's


---------59:20----------
cool


---------59:21----------
like i i think um that you know even as


---------59:24----------
you say all of that


---------59:25----------
i still see that as being part of the


---------59:26----------
mask so i think there's a lot of genuine


---------59:29----------
i know it's weird i know it's weird


---------59:30----------
we'll just follow me okay


---------59:32----------
so i asked you a question i i noticed


---------59:34----------
the emotions came up and then your mind


---------59:35----------
did this really interesting thing where


---------59:37----------
you're like let me tell this anecdote


---------59:38----------
let me kind of talk about it


---------59:39----------
and then like i think everything you


---------59:41----------
said was genuine


---------59:43----------
but it was also like away from the


---------59:45----------
emotions


---------59:47----------
yeah i i did kind of like right right


---------59:51----------
away from it


---------59:51----------
yeah and and so a lot of stuff is going


---------59:54----------
to come together okay so like there's


---------59:55----------
there's interesting because a lot of


---------59:57----------
times when you talk about being a shitty


---------59:58----------
person


---------59:59----------
you actually don't feel like a shitty


---------60:00----------
person and when you feel like a shitty


---------60:02----------
person you actually don't talk about


---------60:04----------
being a shitty person


---------60:05----------
just in in terms of this interview so if


---------60:07----------
you look at your


---------60:08----------
emotional level you can own


---------60:11----------
a lot of negativity about yourself but


---------60:14----------
you do so in sort of like a very like


---------60:16----------
inspiring and positive way


---------60:20----------
would like to do it but is that the


---------60:23----------
fakeness that you're seeing i think so i


---------60:26----------
think so


---------60:26----------
so so like what we call this is sort of


---------60:29----------
discongruent affect


---------60:30----------
so affect is what your in what appear


---------60:33----------
what your emotional appearance is


---------60:36----------
yeah and like you know this is like a


---------60:37----------
good example of discongruent affect is


---------60:39----------
when people like laugh about you know


---------60:40----------
getting cancer


---------60:42----------
it's like that's not funny but we all


---------60:44----------
laugh about it right


---------60:45----------
and so so i i think that no you


---------60:47----------
genuinely made a lot of progress but i


---------60:49----------
i'm


---------60:49----------
getting somewhere here with this okay so


---------60:52----------
what i'm hearing


---------60:53----------
underneath everything is that like


---------60:55----------
you're a crappy person


---------60:57----------
right like you're afraid that you're a


---------60:59----------
crappy person you're a crappy teacher


---------61:01----------
that's you felt so crappy and we can see


---------61:03----------
a lot of this like that it's a very good


---------61:04----------
anecdote i'm really glad you shared it


---------61:06----------
because it illustrates sort of like this


---------61:08----------
moment like this turning point once


---------61:09----------
again


---------61:10----------
your mind is always looking at those


---------61:11----------
fantasies right i bet you have a fantasy


---------61:13----------
trap about


---------61:14----------
drinking in honduras because that was


---------61:16----------
the moment where you felt


---------61:18----------
such like such a bad person and alcohol


---------61:21----------
was there for you


---------61:24----------
right see now we have affect now this is


---------61:26----------
genuine


---------61:27----------
it hurts right yeah


---------61:31----------
okay all right


---------61:34----------
so yeah this is this is what affect


---------61:37----------
looks like right so like


---------61:38----------
right i should i should go with this


---------61:41----------
feeling


---------61:42----------
like it it's yeah i feel like i'm trying


---------61:45----------
to be professional right now


---------61:47----------
yep even asking the question is not


---------61:49----------
going with the feeling you're like what


---------61:50----------
am i supposed to do with it


---------61:52----------
right it's it's so like it and it's


---------61:54----------
become and this out also goes back to


---------61:55----------
your


---------61:56----------
you know anxious ambivalent attachment


---------61:57----------
style where like you learned a long time


---------62:00----------
ago


---------62:00----------
what other people want and boy are you


---------62:03----------
good at giving it to him


---------62:04----------
oh yeah dude yeah so i know you talk


---------62:07----------
about social anxiety but you know i


---------62:09----------
would bet money you're incredibly


---------62:10----------
charismatic


---------62:12----------
and and and like it's not a compliment


---------62:15----------
it's just you know like i think people


---------62:18----------
like you


---------62:19----------
right you're a likable guy and and so


---------62:21----------
like it's interesting because you feel


---------62:23----------
all the social anxiety but like


---------62:25----------
you know you you know how to make


---------62:28----------
friends man


---------62:29----------
like it and so this is kind of it's kind


---------62:32----------
of interesting because so i think what


---------62:34----------
it comes down to


---------62:35----------
this is kind of the veneer the mask the


---------62:37----------
protective layers that


---------62:38----------
it's not your fault you're not doing


---------62:39----------
anything wrong it was actually like it


---------62:41----------
was a survival mechanism for you and you


---------62:42----------
illustrated that for us really well


---------62:44----------
um i think you're incredibly insightful


---------62:46----------
that's a compliment


---------62:48----------
um but i think you've you've really laid


---------62:50----------
out like all the


---------62:51----------
what i think are important pieces that


---------62:53----------
get us to sort of this conclusion which


---------62:54----------
is that


---------62:56----------
you know you think you're a crappy


---------62:58----------
person and you are asking me how do i


---------62:59----------
learn


---------63:00----------
self-love well like the first most


---------63:02----------
important thing


---------63:03----------
is that you have to so how do you learn


---------63:06----------
to accept yourself


---------63:08----------
you have to be taught and the simplest


---------63:11----------
way to be taught how to sell like how


---------63:12----------
does anyone learn anything


---------63:14----------
how do you learn spanish okay yeah you


---------63:17----------
taught


---------63:18----------
right right like so like how do children


---------63:19----------
learn language how do children learn


---------63:21----------
like how to put on a mask like they're


---------63:23----------
taught


---------63:24----------
in some way or another so and now now we


---------63:27----------
get into the real problem noah that i


---------63:29----------
think you know this is where you really


---------63:31----------
need to work


---------63:32----------
which is that if you want


---------63:37----------
if you want to be accepted by other


---------63:39----------
people if you want to learn


---------63:40----------
self-acceptance you have to start by


---------63:41----------
being accepted by other people


---------63:44----------
and the real problem is i don't think


---------63:45----------
you're going to truly get accepted by


---------63:46----------
other people because there's this veneer


---------63:48----------
of positive [ __ ] on top of


---------63:50----------
everything you're saying


---------63:52----------
right like like it's kind of weird but


---------63:54----------
like


---------63:55----------
you know you're so like i'm gonna become


---------63:57----------
sober and you're like owning all these


---------63:59----------
negative things but it's like incredibly


---------64:00----------
inspiring


---------64:02----------
and so when people like look at you they


---------64:04----------
don't see


---------64:05----------
a waste of space they look at someone


---------64:07----------
who's


---------64:08----------
amazing and walking their journey which


---------64:10----------
is what you want to present


---------64:12----------
which is what you succeed at and now


---------64:15----------
that puts you in a really tricky


---------64:17----------
situation okay


---------64:18----------
because if you never show us the ugliest


---------64:21----------
parts of you


---------64:22----------
you show us the ugliest parts of you


---------64:24----------
wrapped with beautiful bowstring


---------64:26----------
and and flower you know framed


---------64:28----------
positively and stuff like that


---------64:29----------
but like those really like ugly little


---------64:31----------
bits


---------64:32----------
that are not about growth just just give


---------64:35----------
us the pure ugliness


---------64:38----------
and then what you need to like that


---------64:40----------
vulnerability


---------64:41----------
is gonna like like when you show us that


---------64:43----------
which i think from a young age you were


---------64:45----------
like taught that you can't do that


---------64:47----------
because


---------64:47----------
you know the anxious avoid ambivalent


---------64:50----------
attachment style


---------64:51----------
it's really hard but you have have to


---------64:54----------
let us


---------64:54----------
see you in all of your ugliness and


---------64:56----------
that's really dangerous because we could


---------64:58----------
reject you there and like you can't


---------65:00----------
handle like you're not ready for that


---------65:01----------
but something magical will happen which


---------65:03----------
is that when you show us that


---------65:05----------
we'll be okay with it and then you're


---------65:08----------
gonna be really really confused and


---------65:09----------
that's even more terrifying


---------65:11----------
that is so true oh my god let me tell


---------65:14----------
you when people love me and i don't


---------65:16----------
expect it it's


---------65:17----------
[ __ ] weird it is so weird


---------65:21----------
god if my roommate's still watching she


---------65:23----------
is a perfect example


---------65:25----------
of just like i will say a thing like


---------65:28----------
maybe i


---------65:28----------
dude in the discord shout out to your


---------65:30----------
discord your those people are amazing


---------65:33----------
i typed in the discord and sorry this is


---------65:35----------
uh this is a tangent


---------65:37----------
um i i typed in the discord like is it


---------65:40----------
rude to ask


---------65:41----------
my uh


---------65:44----------
is it is it rude to ask someone to not


---------65:46----------
call me a simp and


---------65:47----------
everyone was like what the [ __ ] no of


---------65:49----------
course not and i was like wait wait wait


---------65:51----------
she's always joking about it and they're


---------65:53----------
like no if you don't like being called a


---------65:55----------
sim


---------65:55----------
just tell her you don't like being


---------65:56----------
called a sim and so i tell her i'm like


---------65:58----------
hey can you like not say that and she's


---------66:01----------
like


---------66:02----------
okay but in my heart does that thing


---------66:05----------
where it just like


---------66:06----------
jumps you know it like occupies two


---------66:08----------
beats instead of one


---------66:10----------
uh it it's freaking crazy sorry about


---------66:13----------
that jesus you hit the nail on the head


---------66:15----------
with that


---------66:16----------
what and help me understand which what's


---------66:19----------
the nail that i hit


---------66:21----------
when you said if i show all my ugly bits


---------66:25----------
um yeah y'all might reject me but also


---------66:28----------
y'all might accept me and then i'm gonna


---------66:30----------
be confused if y'all accept me


---------66:32----------
yep and and that's that's because like


---------66:35----------
so the reason you're confused is because


---------66:37----------
you don't know how to accept yourself


---------66:39----------
right so it's like a foreign thing it's


---------66:40----------
like we're giving you like a new kind of


---------66:41----------
food


---------66:42----------
right so it's like feels unfamiliar to


---------66:45----------
be accepted for your ugly bits


---------66:47----------
like when when and what i'm hearing from


---------66:49----------
the simps story it's a good story


---------66:50----------
because it sort of


---------66:52----------
signals that like you are telling


---------66:55----------
someone else that you're dissatisfied


---------66:56----------
with them which means that they may not


---------66:58----------
like you


---------66:58----------
and will trigger a lot of social anxiety


---------67:00----------
and all that kind of stuff so it's like


---------67:01----------
it's really challenging for some people


---------67:03----------
to stand up for themselves


---------67:06----------
and and so when you do that you know it


---------67:08----------
feels weird when


---------67:09----------
the person is sort of like yeah okay


---------67:10----------
fine i won't do that


---------67:12----------
you know did they apologize yeah oh of


---------67:15----------
course she did


---------67:16----------
she was like what okay i guess


---------67:20----------
but yeah it was funny yeah and and how


---------67:24----------
do you


---------67:24----------
feel when people mistreat you noah


---------67:30----------
i forget which personality test i was


---------67:32----------
taking but one of the questions was


---------67:34----------
um when i have a bad


---------67:38----------
boss i am a bad employee and i like


---------67:40----------
strongly agreed with that


---------67:43----------
uh to answer your question when people


---------67:45----------
mistreat me dude i get angry


---------67:47----------
i i get angry i get into fantasy i don't


---------67:49----------
know if this is a fantasy trap


---------67:51----------
but i do have the problem of arguing


---------67:54----------
with people in my head


---------67:55----------
you know like if i want to have a


---------67:59----------
conversation with someone


---------68:00----------
i will practice that conversation in my


---------68:02----------
head like i i've practiced this


---------68:04----------
conversation for like


---------68:06----------
hours in the past week since i sent in


---------68:07----------
my app for this uh


---------68:09----------
interview you know what does it do for


---------68:11----------
you when you practice that conversation


---------68:15----------
it will i expect


---------68:19----------
the correct answer to be


---------68:22----------
nothing but what it does what i feel it


---------68:24----------
does for me


---------68:26----------
is it validates perspectives that i


---------68:29----------
could provide and it gives me a little


---------68:31----------
test run of


---------68:33----------
okay how might they react what is


---------68:35----------
something


---------68:36----------
really challenging that they could say


---------68:38----------
that i could now think about and prepare


---------68:40----------
myself for


---------68:42----------
and it's this really weird


---------68:43----------
objectification of conversation


---------68:46----------
i get you so here's the here's the issue


---------68:49----------
there is that like


---------68:50----------
all of those lines of reasoning that


---------68:52----------
you're following all those hypotheticals


---------68:55----------
are for what goal


---------68:58----------
to be faith absolutely good


---------69:05----------
sit with that for a second yeah


---------69:10----------
but


---------69:13----------
one gear isn't turning right now


---------69:16----------
because i do this so often because i


---------69:19----------
want to have the right conversation i


---------69:21----------
want to converse correctly


---------69:23----------
yep and you're so good at it because i


---------69:26----------
asked you a question


---------69:27----------
and guess who got the answer right


---------69:32----------
you're so good at it right and you know


---------69:34----------
where i'm going


---------69:35----------
you know where i'm going you're good at


---------69:38----------
this job bro


---------69:40----------
how are you you're very slippery


---------69:44----------
noah because you know you know how to be


---------69:46----------
what i want you to be


---------69:50----------
now that's interesting you say that


---------69:51----------
because i i wanted to come into this


---------69:53----------
conversation trying to be as honest as


---------69:55----------
possible


---------69:56----------
because that's something i i also wanted


---------69:59----------
to be as concise as possible but i


---------70:01----------
kind of failed at that um so here's the


---------70:04----------
problem


---------70:05----------
this is why this is going to go on for


---------70:07----------
add infant item


---------70:08----------
and the reason is because i the problem


---------70:11----------
isn't what's at the end of the statement


---------70:13----------
the problem is the beginning of the


---------70:14----------
statement


---------70:15----------
i wanted to be dot dot dot


---------70:18----------
it's not i am dot dot dot


---------70:22----------
any time you say i want to be something


---------70:24----------
that's gonna


---------70:25----------
engage the fakeness


---------70:28----------
you said something on monday that i


---------70:30----------
think might pertain to this


---------70:32----------
or maybe it wasn't monday you said um


---------70:35----------
when you have a goal


---------70:36----------
when you are motivated you may engender


---------70:39----------
this


---------70:40----------
fantasy this at the end of the road kind


---------70:43----------
of fantasy


---------70:44----------
you have don't strive for that fantasy


---------70:47----------
you need to just go you just need to go


---------70:49----------
in that direction


---------70:51----------
um so now now i'm thinking how can i


---------70:53----------
apply that to not being fake


---------70:56----------
you know how do i not imagine a person i


---------70:59----------
want to be with you


---------71:00----------
how do i simply be with you


---------71:04----------
yeah so so so how i want to be


---------71:08----------
genuine yeah


---------71:11----------
doing it again that's wrong so


---------71:15----------
i just be genuine no


---------71:18----------
you don't just be genuine you just be


---------71:23----------
can't have anything on the other side i


---------71:25----------
just be


---------71:27----------
okay let's try that out i don't know how


---------71:32----------
neither do i but


---------71:36----------
ah [ __ ] man okay but i um


---------71:40----------
if if that little tendril is


---------71:43----------
concluded can we go back to how someone


---------71:46----------
might determine they're


---------71:47----------
addicted to something and like poly


---------71:49----------
substance abuse


---------71:51----------
because that tendril is not we can


---------71:53----------
certainly talk about that but that


---------71:54----------
tendril isn't concluded that was


---------71:56----------
starting okay sorry that was me doing


---------71:58----------
that thing again where i'm like


---------72:00----------
what might he want to talk about yeah so


---------72:02----------
so you're slipping away because we're


---------72:04----------
entering territory that you can't give


---------72:05----------
me what i want


---------72:09----------
you see that like it's like boom like oh


---------72:12----------
just b


---------72:12----------
oh i don't know how to do that let's


---------72:14----------
talk about something else


---------72:17----------
[ __ ] man i got more practice ahead of me


---------72:20----------
than i thought


---------72:21----------
yeah see look oh look at look at how


---------72:24----------
look at how much you're learning


---------72:25----------
and you're owning how much you have to


---------72:27----------
go look at how positive you are about


---------72:29----------
all this


---------72:30----------
oh man man oh man


---------72:34----------
i guess positive yeah right so so now


---------72:36----------
real emotions are coming out you're


---------72:38----------
feeling embarrassed you're feeling like


---------72:39----------
you're doing a bad job


---------72:41----------
like that's where that's what we want


---------72:43----------
bro


---------72:44----------
okay okay right so i gotta i gotta


---------72:47----------
yeah don't don't keep on resetting


---------72:49----------
yourself man


---------72:50----------
it's the wrong direction you're like


---------72:53----------
okay


---------72:55----------
no that's what we that's the opposite of


---------72:56----------
what we want don't like like taking a


---------72:58----------
breath okay i'm gonna


---------72:59----------
i'm gonna use my coping skills now it's


---------73:01----------
okay just just be


---------73:02----------
be bad today you know like you don't


---------73:05----------
need to be good


---------73:08----------
oh my god you see like i can see like


---------73:10----------
it's so uncomfortable for you to sit


---------73:12----------
with that


---------73:13----------
oh my god i mean if you say so [ __ ]


---------73:17----------
there we go


---------73:21----------
all right um yeah where do we go from


---------73:24----------
here


---------73:25----------
i'm not sure i'm gonna need a second did


---------73:28----------
i push you too hard


---------73:30----------
no i need a second too thank you for


---------73:32----------
i'll take a breather with you


---------73:35----------
i'm gonna check chat which i've been


---------73:37----------
fighting the urge to do


---------73:40----------
no i think i think they love you for


---------73:41----------
calling me an [ __ ] i do too


---------73:44----------
boy do i feel put in my place


---------73:47----------
no i did not mean that


---------73:51----------
would it be okay if you did


---------73:55----------
i would judge myself for putting out


---------73:58----------
unnecessary negativity what makes it


---------74:00----------
unnecessary


---------74:02----------
i think there's other words to use than


---------74:03----------
an [ __ ] like okay doc


---------74:06----------
you know the negativity would be the


---------74:09----------
same


---------74:11----------
yeah i guess right i hear what you mean


---------74:14----------
so


---------74:14----------
you see what you did there like you put


---------74:16----------
a you made it more pc


---------74:18----------
did it again the veneer there it is it's


---------74:21----------
always there


---------74:22----------
so this is this is the thing right like


---------74:24----------
so like no i


---------74:25----------
you know what you do with this so here's


---------74:27----------
the answer okay


---------74:28----------
and then we can go back to safer topics


---------74:31----------
okay so


---------74:32----------
i think huh i enjoy this we don't


---------74:36----------
need to be safe okay um


---------74:39----------
so so i think the first thing is just to


---------74:41----------
catch yourself doing it right like


---------74:43----------
you can't fix something until you


---------74:45----------
recognize like


---------74:46----------
how it works so like the more you try to


---------74:49----------
slip away and the more i try to pin you


---------74:51----------
down you're beginning to see it


---------74:53----------
and so now like hopefully you know


---------74:55----------
you'll begin to see it in other places


---------74:57----------
and and you know if you if you want to


---------74:59----------
call people like an [ __ ] and then


---------75:00----------
you're like oh i could have done it i


---------75:02----------
could have said doc like be authentic


---------75:03----------
with yourself


---------75:04----------
and and that authenticity means like


---------75:07----------
accepting that some of that is going to


---------75:08----------
look kind of ugly and that like other


---------75:10----------
people may get bruised


---------75:12----------
if you advocate for yourself and like


---------75:15----------
you have to be okay with that right like


---------75:17----------
you have and this is where


---------75:19----------
you know i i really i'm really really


---------75:21----------
glad you called me an [ __ ] there


---------75:23----------
because i think like


---------75:24----------
you know i think i did push a little bit


---------75:26----------
too far and then i think like you kind


---------75:28----------
of


---------75:29----------
it's just it's just a tiny bit right


---------75:30----------
because you're so respectful and like oh


---------75:32----------
i shouldn't do that but absolutely you


---------75:33----------
should


---------75:34----------
you call it unnecessary negativity it's


---------75:36----------
not like you know if there's one thing


---------75:37----------
you need to understand


---------75:39----------
it's that some neces negativity is


---------75:41----------
completely necessary and appropriate


---------75:44----------
[Music]


---------75:45----------
can can i say two things yeah um


---------75:48----------
one you didn't push me too far two my


---------75:52----------
biggest problem i've had this veneer


---------75:54----------
issue all my life


---------75:57----------
i i mean god i have memories of being in


---------75:59----------
elementary school and my friends calling


---------76:01----------
me fake


---------76:03----------
but any time i ever was inspired to


---------76:06----------
change


---------76:07----------
i didn't change because i was afraid


---------76:11----------
that people wouldn't


---------76:15----------
like what i imagined to be the natural


---------76:18----------
me


---------76:20----------
i i think the natural me and god who


---------76:23----------
knows


---------76:24----------
but i would just be chill i wouldn't


---------76:27----------
talk much


---------76:28----------
i'm actually quite introverted you know


---------76:31----------
and i


---------76:31----------
don't have many things to say um


---------76:35----------
but i imagine myself in that kind of


---------76:37----------
state and i'm like


---------76:39----------
look at this reticent little [ __ ]


---------76:41----------
just sitting there thinking he's better


---------76:43----------
than everyone else you know


---------76:45----------
yeah so


---------76:48----------
there once again we see a flavor of like


---------76:50----------
self-judgment


---------76:51----------
and like putting yourself down for being


---------76:53----------
what you are right like if we


---------76:54----------
you ask the question how do i learn


---------76:56----------
self-acceptance it's the opposite of


---------76:58----------
what you do to yourself right now


---------76:59----------
because you have this inclination to be


---------77:01----------
something and then you call yourself a


---------77:03----------
reticent [ __ ]


---------77:04----------
so here's the main question why do they


---------77:07----------
have to like you


---------77:09----------
they ain't they really don't


---------77:15----------
so then why do you behave in such a way


---------77:18----------
where


---------77:18----------
them liking you like why does what they


---------77:21----------
like and what they want dictate


---------77:23----------
like why did you have to come on today


---------77:26----------
and be like a good guest


---------77:30----------
i well truth be told i had a lot of


---------77:34----------
imposter syndrome coming into this


---------77:36----------
i i was asking my roommate like yo am i


---------77:38----------
qualified


---------77:40----------
to be interviewed about substance abuse


---------77:43----------
um that was something i struggle with


---------77:45----------
and even right now i still feel a little


---------77:47----------
bad that we're talking about me more


---------77:49----------
than we are about substances


---------77:51----------
um because um god damn


---------77:55----------
yeah yeah i'm glad you're feeling bad


---------77:57----------
and and you're doing something that is


---------77:59----------
making you feel bad


---------78:02----------
because it's something i'm not used to


---------78:03----------
and i need to practice this


---------78:06----------
yes okay absolutely


---------78:09----------
but still there there still is the issue


---------78:12----------
that i i as a huge fan of the stream


---------78:16----------
i get immense benefit from this stream


---------78:20----------
and i want to contribute to your streams


---------78:24----------
and i feel right now that someone


---------78:26----------
wouldn't


---------78:27----------
walk away from this being like oh man i


---------78:30----------
really have a different perspective on


---------78:31----------
my substance abuse i feel like they


---------78:33----------
would be like


---------78:34----------
wow i really learned about that noah guy


---------78:36----------
and how he jerked off in middle school


---------78:39----------
you know that's what i'm thinking yeah


---------78:41----------
so so that's but but i think this is


---------78:43----------
where


---------78:43----------
no i think what people are so


---------78:47----------
the more genuine people are the more


---------78:49----------
they benefit from the stream


---------78:51----------
the more benefit happens right because


---------78:53----------
like the problem no is not that like i


---------78:55----------
mean we could talk about substance use i


---------78:56----------
could [ __ ]


---------78:57----------
lecture right like i was kind of


---------79:00----------
suggesting


---------79:01----------
but i think like the far more important


---------79:03----------
thing is that you're not the only one


---------79:04----------
with a mask


---------79:06----------
you're not the only one who you know


---------79:09----------
tries to be


---------79:10----------
what they think everyone wants them to


---------79:13----------
be


---------79:16----------
right you're not the only one who has


---------79:18----------
like emotions that are wrapped in a


---------79:20----------
veneer of positivity


---------79:23----------
you know and and so i think that like


---------79:27----------
i try to avoid chat but i've glanced


---------79:29----------
over a couple times and i think that


---------79:30----------
like


---------79:31----------
that's what they need because


---------79:34----------
the issue here is that substance use is


---------79:36----------
not like we we sort of externalize


---------79:38----------
i'm gonna plow right over your emotion


---------79:40----------
and keep talking okay


---------79:42----------
yeah yeah so if you if you want to learn


---------79:44----------
about substance use so this is the


---------79:46----------
problem is that in western medicine we


---------79:48----------
like


---------79:48----------
externalize our problems right so we say


---------79:50----------
that there's a treatment for


---------79:51----------
depression but we don't treat people we


---------79:53----------
treat depression it's like this external


---------79:55----------
lifeless thing right we say like these


---------79:58----------
are the treatments for


---------79:59----------
depression they're not treatments for


---------80:00----------
you in my experience as a substance use


---------80:03----------
clinician


---------80:04----------
is that ultimately like substance use is


---------80:06----------
something that interacts with who


---------80:08----------
you are the pattern of your judgments


---------80:11----------
the pattern of the veneers and the masks


---------80:13----------
that you put on


---------80:14----------
the patterns of your own sense of


---------80:16----------
inadequacy it preys on all those things


---------80:18----------
just like you said


---------80:19----------
how shitty of a teacher you are that's


---------80:21----------
when it started


---------80:23----------
and so we could talk about substance use


---------80:25----------
as a separate


---------80:26----------
academic thing but i think the main


---------80:29----------
takeaway here is that like your


---------80:31----------
journey to fix substance use if there


---------80:33----------
was a playbook for substance use you


---------80:35----------
could read that playbook and it could be


---------80:37----------
fixed


---------80:38----------
there is a playbook for creating a


---------80:39----------
valheim dedicated server i just have to


---------80:41----------
read it and i have to copy it verbatim


---------80:43----------
it's one to one that doesn't work for


---------80:46----------
substance use


---------80:48----------
and why not it's because there's an


---------80:50----------
individual in there


---------80:53----------
and that the challenges that you face in


---------80:55----------
substance use


---------80:56----------
are going to be like dependent on who


---------80:58----------
you are as a person


---------81:00----------
it's gonna have to do with your anxious


---------81:02----------
ambivalent and attachment style


---------81:04----------
it's gonna have to do with the fact that


---------81:05----------
like fundamentally when you were growing


---------81:07----------
up


---------81:07----------
you were not taught self-acceptance


---------81:09----------
because of the your attachment style


---------81:11----------
that's what it comes down to


---------81:14----------
right all of these conditions like


---------81:15----------
borderline personality disorder


---------81:17----------
and improper attachment styles they all


---------81:19----------
come down to a sense of self-worth


---------81:21----------
and self-identity you know this blackout


---------81:25----------
drunk and like


---------81:26----------
you try to run away from who you are and


---------81:28----------
you try to show someone


---------81:30----------
you try to show every everyone in the


---------81:32----------
world what you aren't


---------81:35----------
and so there's like there's this piece


---------81:37----------
of you that you think is ugly


---------81:40----------
which is could be ugly but like the


---------81:43----------
issue here is that


---------81:44----------
it's okay to be ugly


---------81:48----------
right like you don't need to change like


---------81:50----------
people can accept you for who you


---------81:52----------
are they could take it or leave it


---------81:55----------
right and like like i i know it's it


---------81:57----------
seems kind of weird but like


---------81:58----------
you're doing something that you're kind


---------82:00----------
of like you were sort of being a little


---------82:01----------
it's not your fault but you're kind of


---------82:03----------
being like just a touch fake and i know


---------82:04----------
you're trying to help people i know it's


---------82:05----------
for a good reason but


---------82:06----------
i want to see you noah i don't want


---------82:10----------
i don't want to see the person that you


---------82:12----------
think i want to see


---------82:15----------
i don't want to see the person who's


---------82:16----------
going to help the most


---------82:18----------
that's why i said like every


---------82:19----------
conversation i have to forget about the


---------82:21----------
thousands of people watching


---------82:23----------
i have to be here just for you and i'm


---------82:25----------
willing to take you


---------82:27----------
however you are if you're a shitty human


---------82:30----------
being so be it


---------82:33----------
that doesn't bother me i can handle it


---------82:36----------
you still deserve to be here even if


---------82:38----------
you're not good enough like there's no


---------82:39----------
there's no good enough


---------82:41----------
we're gonna take you for who you are


---------82:43----------
like i'm


---------82:45----------
that's all i want i just want you like


---------82:47----------
whatever you are


---------82:48----------
if it's broken if it's flawed if it's


---------82:50----------
beautiful


---------82:51----------
like it doesn't matter to me just give


---------82:53----------
me you


---------82:56----------
okay dog


---------83:00----------
oh man you said something that that


---------83:02----------
piqued my interest and now i'm


---------83:03----------
forgetting what it was


---------83:04----------
um it is whatever


---------83:10----------
god damn i


---------83:15----------
oh yes um okay so this


---------83:18----------
this this veneer positivity man


---------83:23----------
i like the man at the end of the tunnel


---------83:26----------
of positivity i want to be a teacher one


---------83:29----------
day


---------83:30----------
and a lot of the best qualities of a


---------83:34----------
teacher


---------83:35----------
that i would imagine in a ideal teacher


---------83:38----------
are parts of my mask and that's one way


---------83:42----------
i


---------83:42----------
rationalize my mask i justify it because


---------83:45----------
the more


---------83:46----------
positive i am with you the the more


---------83:50----------
i don't want to say the more fake i am


---------83:51----------
about my substance abuse story


---------83:53----------
um but is this not practicing


---------83:57----------
my ideal version of myself because i


---------83:59----------
want to be positive


---------84:02----------
yeah so there's value to the mask but


---------84:05----------
your


---------84:06----------
struggles there's certainly value to the


---------84:10----------
mask i think the mask is justified i


---------84:11----------
think the mask is adaptive and it's


---------84:13----------
useful


---------84:14----------
i think it's fine to strive for things


---------84:17----------
but there's a difference between


---------84:19----------
striving for things


---------84:21----------
and being unsatisfied with like where


---------84:23----------
you are


---------84:24----------
right like there's a huge difference


---------84:26----------
between saying i wish i was somewhere


---------84:28----------
else


---------84:29----------
like that's the fantasy trap right it's


---------84:31----------
like we're gonna go back in time and


---------84:32----------
we're gonna rewrite history


---------84:34----------
to create like this weird thing that


---------84:37----------
doesn't exist


---------84:38----------
that's different from being in the


---------84:40----------
present and saying how can i take


---------84:42----------
one step towards becoming the person


---------84:44----------
that i eventually want to be


---------84:46----------
that's totally fine but but and i know


---------84:48----------
this sounds kind of weird but


---------84:49----------
that also starts with acceptance


---------84:53----------
because you can't really take a step


---------84:55----------
forward to being the person that you


---------84:56----------
want to be


---------84:57----------
until you accept where you are


---------85:03----------
okay going back yeah


---------85:06----------
yeah yeah


---------85:11----------
in um if one is addicted


---------85:14----------
uh you can you can look and you can be


---------85:17----------
like


---------85:17----------
is this the only tool i have in my


---------85:19----------
toolbox


---------85:21----------
when i have a bad day is this the only


---------85:23----------
thing i go to


---------85:24----------
if so then you're probably addicted


---------85:27----------
when i'm facing my social anxiety when


---------85:30----------
i'm facing this situation here


---------85:32----------
i mean my only tool is my mask


---------85:36----------
so would it be appropriate to say i'm


---------85:38----------
kind of


---------85:40----------
i'm i'm overcompensating one for my lack


---------85:43----------
of self-acceptance


---------85:44----------
uh but but two i'm addicted to this mask


---------85:47----------
of positivity i'm i'm addicted to giving


---------85:50----------
people this


---------85:51----------
positive [ __ ] yes


---------85:54----------
okay yeah but but i i think so here's


---------85:56----------
here's the thing noah so like


---------85:57----------
the journey of growth is like one step


---------86:00----------
at a time


---------86:01----------
so specifically you know i think in your


---------86:03----------
case like the first


---------86:04----------
problem is like alcohol so like it's


---------86:07----------
okay to be


---------86:08----------
it's okay to have your mask it's okay to


---------86:10----------
use marijuana it's okay to like


---------86:12----------
you know you gotta tackle one thing at a


---------86:14----------
time


---------86:15----------
but and this is where i would be a


---------86:17----------
little bit careful because you kind of


---------86:18----------
say


---------86:19----------
you know oh you're afraid that i'm gonna


---------86:21----------
say you have a problem or whatnot like


---------86:23----------
you don't have to fix everything today i


---------86:25----------
mean you're 24


---------86:26----------
you know arguably some people are gonna


---------86:28----------
think you're old some people


---------86:29----------
i think you're young you've got a long


---------86:31----------
way to go


---------86:32----------
you know and it sounds like you know i


---------86:34----------
think two years is a very long time and


---------86:36----------
you can really do a lot of good work


---------86:38----------
in that time so i'd say the first thing


---------86:41----------
you should do is if you're sober from


---------86:42----------
nicotine and alcohol like all of your


---------86:44----------
energy should be into like


---------86:45----------
not slipping back in that way okay then


---------86:49----------
you know i would really consider like


---------86:51----------
revisiting marijuana and things like


---------86:53----------
that and the social anxiety there may be


---------86:55----------
other


---------86:56----------
you know i i haven't purposely asked you


---------86:58----------
you know what you have


---------87:00----------
a medical lice like what your medical


---------87:02----------
condition is but that's fine it's


---------87:04----------
irrelevant


---------87:05----------
the the key thing here at least i mean


---------87:08----------
it's rel absolutely relevant from a


---------87:09----------
clinical perspective so


---------87:11----------
like ideally you know obviously you it


---------87:12----------
sounds like you have a therapist you


---------87:13----------
have a prescriber


---------87:14----------
those are that becomes very relevant for


---------87:16----------
them but the purpose of this


---------87:18----------
conversation is to not necessarily do


---------87:20----------
addiction treatment


---------87:22----------
it's to help because you've got that


---------87:24----------
it's to really help you understand some


---------87:26----------
of these other parts of yourself because


---------87:28----------
what i really see


---------87:29----------
your addiction as is like this is just


---------87:32----------
one long journey towards


---------87:35----------
enlightenment right and it start starts


---------87:38----------
by like


---------87:39----------
stopping the blackouts and then like it


---------87:42----------
it starts by like


---------87:44----------
understanding who you are like what is


---------87:46----------
that self


---------87:47----------
what is noah like underneath all of the


---------87:49----------
masks


---------87:50----------
because in your journey for addiction


---------87:52----------
you're gonna have to grapple with the


---------87:54----------
ugly noah


---------87:56----------
and and like the the real lesson to be


---------87:58----------
learned here is that like


---------88:00----------
it's not that all people are beautiful


---------88:02----------
it's that


---------88:03----------
it's okay to be ugly right because this


---------88:07----------
is very subtle but


---------88:08----------
if we say that everyone is beautiful


---------88:10----------
we're still placing a value


---------88:12----------
judgment on beauty we're still subtly


---------88:16----------
saying that


---------88:16----------
some people are above other people that


---------88:19----------
we value this thing


---------88:20----------
over other people and so suddenly we're


---------88:22----------
actually not being like egalitarian or


---------88:24----------
like equality it's it's actually


---------88:27----------
raising everyone to the pedestal but


---------88:29----------
still


---------88:30----------
subtly acknowledging that the pedestal


---------88:32----------
is what's important


---------88:33----------
nothing is actually changed and then you


---------88:36----------
know we get into this fakeness because


---------88:38----------
not everyone is equally like physically


---------88:40----------
attractive right


---------88:42----------
and so you can and so this is where i


---------88:44----------
think the real growth is in like


---------88:46----------
accepting the negativity accepting that


---------88:48----------
you're never going to be perfect and


---------88:49----------
that you don't need to be


---------88:51----------
you know that being flawed is okay


---------88:55----------
being flawed is okay you um


---------88:59----------
i was listening to your to your monday


---------89:00----------
stream this morning


---------89:02----------
work you said good and bad are human


---------89:05----------
constructs


---------89:06----------
that that hit me right here dude because


---------89:09----------
because like oh my god isn't it true you


---------89:12----------
know


---------89:13----------
oh man so


---------89:17----------
that is something this


---------89:20----------
application of


---------89:24----------
like accepting yourself for the ugliness


---------89:27----------
that that is something that is difficult


---------89:30----------
and i'm very curious on how to


---------89:32----------
recommend doing that because i'm


---------89:35----------
i'm not even sure what the ugly parts of


---------89:37----------
me are yet


---------89:38----------
does that make sense yes and no because


---------89:41----------
i think i think you're gonna


---------89:42----------
like like so so you know one thing you


---------89:44----------
can do is go back and


---------89:46----------
watch this and what you'll see is that


---------89:48----------
there are moments where like i'll tell


---------89:49----------
you to your face that i'm willing to


---------89:51----------
accept you no matter who you are


---------89:53----------
and then like you'll get emotional and


---------89:54----------
then you'll ask some question


---------89:56----------
so like like literally what it is is is


---------90:00----------
you know like there's a space where


---------90:02----------
you're unable to sit with it


---------90:05----------
and and so that's okay like you're


---------90:07----------
practicing city like you can sit with it


---------90:09----------
for like five seconds


---------90:11----------
and then like the next time around like


---------90:13----------
the next time you notice that you're


---------90:14----------
judging yourself


---------90:16----------
what i would say that you should do is


---------90:17----------
like


---------90:19----------
play the tape through to the end so if


---------90:22----------
you are an addict


---------90:23----------
what does that mean so what


---------90:28----------
and and this is where this is where like


---------90:30----------
if you really want to be present focused


---------90:31----------
and escape the fantasy trap what you've


---------90:34----------
got to do


---------90:34----------
i think it all rolls together is you


---------90:36----------
have to accept that you


---------90:37----------
are ugly or that you are an addict or


---------90:39----------
you are a failure or you are behind


---------90:42----------
so be it what are you going to do about


---------90:45----------
it


---------90:46----------
now right you don't run away from that


---------90:48----------
thought you don't try to justify it


---------90:50----------
you don't try to make excuses you don't


---------90:52----------
try to fantasize


---------90:53----------
we're at the bottom of the pit we can


---------90:55----------
barely see a little bit of light


---------90:57----------
that's fine let's just accept that we're


---------91:00----------
in the pit


---------91:01----------
because until we accept that we're in


---------91:03----------
the pit it's going to be impossible to


---------91:04----------
climb out


---------91:07----------
and so i know this sounds weird but like


---------91:10----------
oddly enough


---------91:11----------
accepting your negative qualities is not


---------91:13----------
like a bad thing like it's not a bad


---------91:15----------
thing


---------91:16----------
i mean i'm not saying that like because


---------91:18----------
everyone says oh acceptance is a good


---------91:19----------
thing what i mean is that it's actually


---------91:21----------
like completely fine


---------91:22----------
like it's completely fine to be like


---------91:24----------
completely worthless because that's just


---------91:26----------
what you are


---------91:26----------
like you can't you can't change that in


---------91:29----------
this moment


---------91:30----------
right if you're lost in the middle of


---------91:32----------
the woods like you have to start by


---------91:34----------
acknowledging that you're lost because


---------91:35----------
that's where real growth happens if i


---------91:38----------
sit there like i'm in the woods and i'm


---------91:39----------
like oh i wish i had done this and i


---------91:41----------
wish i'd done this i wish i brought my


---------91:42----------
gps i wish i brought a backup battery


---------91:44----------
then i wouldn't be lost


---------91:45----------
it doesn't help you at all


---------91:47----------
[Music]


---------91:48----------
to understand and this is where if you


---------91:50----------
as you really move towards like the


---------91:52----------
spiritual road it's like


---------91:53----------
it's this idea that good and bad are


---------91:55----------
constructs right so like if you really


---------91:57----------
understand it like being at the bottom


---------91:58----------
of the pit is not


---------92:00----------
even a bad thing i honestly believe that


---------92:03----------
and that's because like if i wasn't at


---------92:05----------
the bottom of the pit like i wouldn't be


---------92:06----------
here today


---------92:08----------
and is this a good thing absolutely


---------92:10----------
which necessitates the bad thing


---------92:12----------
and so all there are are just things


---------92:17----------
can i ask a question you asked me


---------92:19----------
earlier


---------92:20----------
how i feel when someone wrongs me yeah


---------92:23----------
um


---------92:24----------
and in accepting where i am i


---------92:28----------
think to the people that wronged me you


---------92:30----------
know namely like


---------92:31----------
my my rough childhood and i


---------92:34----------
wonder how i can if you have any tips


---------92:38----------
for forgiving


---------92:40----------
you know because i think a big part of


---------92:43----------
staying here being okay with these


---------92:45----------
problems


---------92:47----------
comes from it's not my fault that i'm


---------92:49----------
here it's


---------92:51----------
you know it's her fault


---------92:54----------
yeah so tips for forgiveness fantastic


---------92:56----------
question


---------92:57----------
the first tip for forgiveness is that


---------92:59----------
you have to blame someone in order


---------93:01----------
to forgive them okay


---------93:05----------
i know it sounds weird i see this holds


---------93:07----------
people back a lot


---------93:08----------
right so like when you say it's it's her


---------93:11----------
fault that's the first step forward


---------93:13----------
okay i know it sounds weird because


---------93:14----------
sometimes what people will do is when


---------93:16----------
people wrong them


---------93:17----------
they will make excuses for the other


---------93:19----------
person


---------93:20----------
and if they if the person isn't really


---------93:22----------
to blame there can never be forgiveness


---------93:24----------
does that make sense


---------93:27----------
yeah yeah dude i can't forgive you


---------93:32----------
unless i actually blame you yeah so i


---------93:35----------
know


---------93:37----------
exactly you have to say you did


---------93:40----------
something wrong


---------93:41----------
then you can forgive it's the first


---------93:43----------
problem that people run into with


---------93:44----------
forgiveness


---------93:45----------
so i'll tell you just a quick story so i


---------93:47----------
was working with a patient who


---------93:50----------
lost their mom to an illness and then


---------93:53----------
their dad was grieving and every day


---------93:56----------
after work


---------93:56----------
they used to go to like a bar and drink


---------93:59----------
basically


---------94:00----------
so they would be like at a bar from like


---------94:01----------
five to eight pm and they'd like kind of


---------94:03----------
come home dinner time


---------94:04----------
be drunk and then like my patient kept


---------94:07----------
on saying like i kept on asking like you


---------94:08----------
know tell me about your dad and he said


---------94:10----------
he did the best that he could


---------94:12----------
that would always be his answer and it


---------94:14----------
was like you know he lost his wife


---------94:17----------
and like he was grieving and he did the


---------94:19----------
best that he could like i don't blame


---------94:20----------
him for that


---------94:23----------
but what he never said is that he did a


---------94:25----------
good job


---------94:26----------
[Music]


---------94:29----------
oh my god that's [ __ ] sad dude yep


---------94:34----------
and so so like he couldn't forgive his


---------94:36----------
dad because like that


---------94:37----------
there's like a another side of the story


---------94:40----------
which is like


---------94:41----------
you know the patient was like eight and


---------94:44----------
had lost


---------94:45----------
one parent and then suddenly lost two


---------94:48----------
and like he needed his dad to be there


---------94:51----------
twice as


---------94:52----------
much right like his dad had to make up


---------94:54----------
for two


---------94:56----------
so like the patient lost two parents all


---------94:59----------
at the same time


---------95:01----------
and his relationship with his parents


---------95:03----------
his dad got better


---------95:04----------
once he blamed him i didn't do it to his


---------95:08----------
face but like he just did it in therapy


---------95:09----------
where like we acknowledged that like


---------95:11----------
and i one day i said to him i said you


---------95:13----------
keep on saying your dad did the best


---------95:15----------
that he could you never say that he did


---------95:16----------
a good job


---------95:18----------
and then once he was able to admit to


---------95:20----------
himself and accept


---------95:22----------
that his dad did a bad job then he could


---------95:25----------
forgive him


---------95:28----------
right but you got to hold people


---------95:29----------
accountable yeah i just feel bad man


---------95:33----------
because i see


---------95:36----------
i see what


---------95:41----------
i see what she went through you know


---------95:44----------
and i feel like i'm just kicking her


---------95:46----------
while she's down when i say she wasn't


---------95:48----------
good at what she did but i hear what


---------95:52----------
you're saying and i know it's


---------95:54----------
important to be honest with myself and


---------95:55----------
be like yo


---------95:57----------
hey you [ __ ] up all right like you


---------95:59----------
[ __ ] up


---------96:00----------
yeah i got a [ __ ] so


---------96:03----------
so and it's it's hard no so we see this


---------96:06----------
a lot like in addictions right because


---------96:08----------
like here's


---------96:08----------
here's the real problem like did your


---------96:10----------
mom ever do the work that you're doing


---------96:12----------
today


---------96:17----------
i don't think so i wouldn't know so


---------96:20----------
that's something that like like so so


---------96:22----------
that's the difference right so that's


---------96:23----------
what you can blame her for


---------96:25----------
i know it sounds weird but like you can


---------96:28----------
say like


---------96:28----------
i am breaking the cycle like i don't


---------96:30----------
know if you're gonna have kids one day


---------96:32----------
but you can have a conversation with


---------96:34----------
your mom and maybe this conversation


---------96:36----------
happens once you have kids and once


---------96:37----------
you're sober


---------96:38----------
and that's when you really get to blame


---------96:40----------
her because you can say like i was dealt


---------96:43----------
this shitty hand of cards you were dealt


---------96:44----------
the shitty handle cards


---------96:46----------
and i did something about it and i broke


---------96:48----------
the cycle and you did not


---------96:50----------
okay


---------96:55----------
you lost me when you said uh was she


---------96:57----------
doing the same work that i'm doing now


---------96:58----------
i was like eh i don't know how i feel


---------97:00----------
but then you were like once i have kids


---------97:02----------
once i'm clean


---------97:04----------
then i can really like that then it's


---------97:06----------
like


---------97:08----------
unequivocable unequivocal


---------97:11----------
unequivocal yeah yeah uh


---------97:14----------
damn that's that's powerful dog right so


---------97:17----------
so and this is where like the


---------97:18----------
forgiveness comes in because


---------97:20----------
you can have compassion for her but


---------97:23----------
compassion for another human being


---------97:25----------
should not get tangled up


---------97:27----------
with them not doing their dharma


---------97:32----------
okay right so that's like really really


---------97:35----------
important


---------97:35----------
huh i didn't catch that so this is


---------97:38----------
really important like


---------97:40----------
you can have compassion for your mom you


---------97:43----------
can forgive your mom but if your mom did


---------97:45----------
not do or dharma she did not do her


---------97:47----------
dharma


---------97:50----------
right so i like i can hold you


---------97:52----------
accountable like so you're


---------97:54----------
kind of slippery today right and so like


---------97:57----------
you're kind of like


---------97:57----------
i have this mask on i can have


---------97:59----------
compassion for you and still call you


---------98:01----------
out on it


---------98:03----------
like i can say like noah you're being


---------98:06----------
inauthentic with me


---------98:08----------
and i can still care about you and not


---------98:11----------
be mad at you for that


---------98:13----------
so compassion and harm are completely


---------98:15----------
separate and i think like what you may


---------98:17----------
need to do is


---------98:18----------
you know blame your mom for not doing


---------98:20----------
her dharma


---------98:22----------
because like when you're four years old


---------98:24----------
and she's like yelling at you because


---------98:26----------
she's drunk


---------98:30----------
if you want to forgive her for that you


---------98:31----------
got to start out by saying


---------98:33----------
that's completely [ __ ] up


---------98:37----------
right and this can can i tell you how


---------98:41----------
i'm feeling right now


---------98:42----------
yeah go for it i feel i feel guilty for


---------98:44----------
bringing up my mom


---------98:45----------
yep absolutely i feel really good right


---------98:48----------
absolutely so so you're protecting her


---------98:50----------
right like


---------98:52----------
you don't want so like what's happening


---------98:54----------
right now


---------98:55----------
is you're feeling bad because we're


---------98:58----------
starting towards the


---------98:59----------
road of holding her accountable for her


---------99:02----------
actions


---------99:03----------
we're going down the road of blaming her


---------99:06----------
and you're not like you're you're doing


---------99:08----------
the same thing that my patient did


---------99:10----------
he was protecting his dad he did the


---------99:13----------
best that he could


---------99:16----------
right and so what we had to work through


---------99:18----------
was a lot of guilt like when we blame


---------99:20----------
people


---------99:20----------
because we have compassion for them we


---------99:22----------
have a lot of guilt


---------99:24----------
and i mean i'm just we don't really know


---------99:25----------
what your mom did i mean maybe she


---------99:27----------
didn't do anything wrong


---------99:28----------
i just i don't know that so we also have


---------99:29----------
to acknowledge that like she may not be


---------99:31----------
she may have done a wonderful job i


---------99:32----------
don't i don't know


---------99:33----------
we don't know right so we have to


---------99:34----------
acknowledge that truth


---------99:36----------
but what i'm saying is that like if you


---------99:37----------
know if your parents messed up in a


---------99:40----------
particular way when it comes to you


---------99:42----------
and you really want to forgive them you


---------99:45----------
have to start by like


---------99:46----------
everyone agreeing that like you know


---------99:49----------
you messed up but you can't forgive


---------99:52----------
unless


---------99:53----------
you're willing to blame okay yeah


---------99:56----------
i'm glad you brought that up you


---------99:58----------
reminded me that the end goal is


---------99:59----------
forgiveness


---------100:00----------
you know i was so caught up in like


---------100:01----------
holding her accountable but i do want to


---------100:03----------
forgive her


---------100:04----------
i really do okay so so this is also


---------100:07----------
where the end goal doesn't have to be


---------100:09----------
forgiveness


---------100:10----------
okay right so now other tips for


---------100:13----------
forgiveness


---------100:14----------
okay um first thing is you have to blame


---------100:17----------
someone


---------100:18----------
in order to forgive them second thing is


---------100:21----------
that no one is owed forgiveness


---------100:23----------
[Music]


---------100:27----------
forgiveness is the sole right of the


---------100:30----------
aggrieved party


---------100:32----------
right if i if you break my jaw i don't


---------100:35----------
have to forgive you


---------100:38----------
i never have to forgive you it's


---------100:41----------
entirely my choice


---------100:43----------
so don't feel forgiveness should never


---------100:46----------
be an obligation


---------100:47----------
it should always be something that is


---------100:49----------
given freely


---------100:52----------
and if you feel obliged to forgive it's


---------100:54----------
not true forgiveness


---------100:55----------
[Music]


---------100:57----------
okay second tip for forgiveness should


---------100:59----------
be freely given


---------101:00----------
and is never owed and never entitled we


---------101:03----------
see this a lot


---------101:04----------
in very toxic family dynamics where like


---------101:07----------
you know huh that they think their own


---------101:10----------
forgiveness


---------101:11----------
yeah or like like so i had you know


---------101:13----------
another situation where


---------101:14----------
i had a patient who was you know trigger


---------101:16----------
warning was sexually assaulted by a


---------101:18----------
family member


---------101:20----------
and then like years later like at family


---------101:22----------
gatherings and stuff like this


---------101:24----------
my patient was like i'm not gonna be


---------101:25----------
there if this person is there


---------101:28----------
and then like family members are like it


---------101:29----------
was in the past it was years ago


---------101:32----------
like you should forgive them you know


---------101:34----------
like we can move past it


---------101:36----------
they regret what they did they have they


---------101:38----------
stopped doing it


---------101:40----------
and so i got a lot of pressure from the


---------101:41----------
family because it's like people are


---------101:43----------
wondering where you are


---------101:44----------
and we can't say it's because so and so


---------101:47----------
you know


---------101:49----------
like that's how families work right like


---------101:51----------
it's like you don't


---------101:52----------
you don't show up at a family gathering


---------101:54----------
and be like yeah i'm not gonna come


---------101:56----------
because


---------101:56----------
oh hey how are you uncle bob


---------101:59----------
i hate you for raping me and i've been


---------102:01----------
in therapy for 10 years


---------102:03----------
yeah you just don't do that that's not


---------102:04----------
how families work


---------102:08----------
i mean it's crazy but like and so like a


---------102:09----------
lot of times people get pressured into


---------102:11----------
forgiveness


---------102:12----------
people are like you know like we also


---------102:15----------
see this in romantic relationships where


---------102:17----------
like people like you know who


---------102:18----------
feel like they deserve forgiveness no


---------102:20----------
one deserves forgiveness


---------102:22----------
no one is entitled to forgiveness


---------102:25----------
second tip i feel like there was a third


---------102:27----------
tip but i'm blanking on it now


---------102:29----------
um uh let me think for a second how do


---------102:32----------
you uh


---------102:35----------
you have to blame the person no one's


---------102:36----------
entitled


---------102:40----------
yeah i i think so i think in your case


---------102:43----------
no i think it's really about like


---------102:44----------
figuring out


---------102:46----------
you know what you want to forgive them


---------102:50----------
for it's okay to love them it's it's


---------102:52----------
good to forgive i think it's healthy to


---------102:53----------
forgive


---------102:54----------
i think hanging on to like hatred and


---------102:56----------
stuff like that is not good for you but


---------102:58----------
at the same time like you shouldn't feel


---------103:00----------
like you're a bad person


---------103:01----------
if you don't forgive you should forgive


---------103:04----------
because you love your mom not because


---------103:06----------
she deserves it or that you need to


---------103:08----------
protect her


---------103:10----------
like


---------103:13----------
yeah it's also yeah yeah


---------103:17----------
it's also like sorry i was just residing


---------103:21----------
in my head


---------103:21----------
no no so i i think it's also much more


---------103:24----------
powerful like the forgiveness


---------103:26----------
on both parties means so much more when


---------103:29----------
these two boxes are met


---------103:32----------
like it's transformative


---------103:36----------
and this is nothing i would do with my


---------103:38----------
mom right


---------103:39----------
like like


---------103:42----------
would it be weird would it be too


---------103:46----------
conflict conflict-based to like


---------103:49----------
talk to my mom and being like hey you


---------103:52----------
did some shitty [ __ ]


---------103:54----------
but i hope you know i'm cool with it now


---------103:56----------
you know


---------103:57----------
no so so so i i think that this is where


---------103:59----------
like we got to do a better job of this


---------104:01----------
at healthy gamer but like we can


---------104:03----------
prep you through how to have a


---------104:05----------
conversation so we had a webinar


---------104:07----------
like back in march of 2020 about like


---------104:10----------
how to talk to people


---------104:12----------
and so we need to teach people like like


---------104:14----------
give you all a playbook for how to have


---------104:16----------
that conversation


---------104:17----------
and i think the first question that i


---------104:19----------
would start with i mean just


---------104:20----------
this is not don't listen to me here but


---------104:22----------
based on what you've said because i


---------104:23----------
haven't asked all


---------104:24----------
the appropriate questions but out of


---------104:26----------
everything that i've heard today the


---------104:27----------
question that leaps to my mind the most


---------104:30----------
is having a conversation with your mom


---------104:32----------
about her attempts to control


---------104:34----------
her alcohol


---------104:37----------
i i should clarify about my mom i don't


---------104:39----------
think it was really alcoholism


---------104:41----------
it was really just whatever other mental


---------104:44----------
illness she was dealing with at


---------104:46----------
the time that made her dare i say


---------104:49----------
abusive


---------104:51----------
um so sure so so i think it's it's like


---------104:54----------
it's like trying to understand what your


---------104:56----------
your mom's perspective is because


---------104:58----------
through that understanding you may


---------105:00----------
actually find


---------105:01----------
that like like you definitively


---------105:04----------
don't think it was her fault


---------105:08----------
and if that's if that's okay then


---------105:09----------
there's no need for forgiveness right


---------105:11----------
like


---------105:12----------
but like like i think it starts by sort


---------105:14----------
of having


---------105:15----------
like a a good understanding of what her


---------105:18----------
experience


---------105:19----------
of raising you was like


---------105:23----------
okay right so like


---------105:26----------
well here's what's going in my mind


---------105:28----------
because now i'm i'm not confused but now


---------105:31----------
i have a really difficult question in my


---------105:33----------
head


---------105:34----------
um i i firmly believe


---------105:37----------
that if i were put in the exact same


---------105:39----------
position as my mom


---------105:41----------
with all the same backstory and all the


---------105:43----------
same responsibilities


---------105:45----------
i feel like i would have acted similarly


---------105:47----------
you know i


---------105:48----------
don't feel like it was her fault but i


---------105:51----------
still believe she did not fulfill her


---------105:53----------
dharma


---------105:54----------
so so that's you know so this is where


---------105:58----------
i think like it starts with conversation


---------106:00----------
so i i wouldn't start by blaming her


---------106:02----------
unless you're prepared to do that okay


---------106:04----------
so i think like when it comes to having


---------106:06----------
conversations like


---------106:07----------
showing up and like opening salvo of


---------106:10----------
like [ __ ] you


---------106:12----------
you know and and so i i think that


---------106:15----------
that it sort of starts by like just


---------106:17----------
listening to her and then at some point


---------106:19----------
you know when you're ready


---------106:20----------
you can kind of say to her that mom like


---------106:22----------
i really feel like a lot of the


---------106:25----------
um i feel like a lot of the


---------106:28----------
you know a lot of like what happened


---------106:30----------
when i was growing up like was really


---------106:32----------
hurtful and like has caused me a lot of


---------106:33----------
problems


---------106:35----------
and there were particular times that


---------106:38----------
were really painful for me is it okay if


---------106:41----------
i tell you about them


---------106:42----------
[Music]


---------106:44----------
and and then like you're gonna get a lot


---------106:46----------
of defensiveness so that's why


---------106:48----------
there's like a way to like you're gonna


---------106:49----------
ask for permission she may not be ready


---------106:51----------
to hear it


---------106:53----------
she may be ready to hear it and then you


---------106:55----------
kind of share one story and then like


---------106:57----------
you give her a chance


---------106:59----------
to apologize right like she may say like


---------107:02----------
i


---------107:03----------
like you you'd be surprised at where


---------107:04----------
these conversations go when they're


---------107:06----------
framed in the right way like


---------107:07----------
this is also like i'm not kidding you


---------107:09----------
know like these conversations can be


---------107:11----------
truly amazing and transformative


---------107:13----------
and like they can lead to conversations


---------107:15----------
like parents being like for years and


---------107:16----------
years and years


---------107:17----------
like i let you down and i've never been


---------107:20----------
able to like


---------107:21----------
say that they're not never able to admit


---------107:24----------
it because they have their own like


---------107:26----------
and to hear like your parent like


---------107:27----------
authentically say


---------107:29----------
i you deserve so much better than what i


---------107:31----------
was able to give you and i'm incredibly


---------107:33----------
sorry for that


---------107:34----------
can like completely transform a


---------107:36----------
relationship between a child and a


---------107:37----------
parent


---------107:40----------
and it's not even about you blaming them


---------107:42----------
because you don't even have to blame


---------107:43----------
because they're gonna take it all for


---------107:45----------
themselves


---------107:47----------
and she'll be able to admit that to you


---------107:50----------
i mean


---------107:51----------
it goes i mean it's it's like i've seen


---------107:53----------
these i'm tearing up because i've seen


---------107:55----------
just


---------107:55----------
incredibly powerful like i mean it's


---------107:58----------
just like


---------107:59----------
completely op like it just wipes away


---------108:02----------
years and years of like stuff that has


---------108:04----------
not been said


---------108:07----------
yeah man i'm thinking i gotta go visit


---------108:10----------
my mom tonight


---------108:15----------
that that last part that last part


---------108:18----------
really got me


---------108:20----------
thank you for answering that question oh


---------108:22----------
[ __ ] dude


---------108:25----------
god damn


---------108:28----------
[Music]


---------108:31----------
i'm fighting the earth just say


---------108:33----------
something because my my brain is going


---------108:35----------
like dead air down here


---------108:37----------
you're right right so that that's


---------108:38----------
sitting with things right so good


---------108:40----------
good and we'll let it slide that you


---------108:44----------
said something about finding the urge to


---------108:46----------
say something but that's actually


---------108:48----------
the right level of meta so you notice it


---------108:50----------
right like you noticed it like


---------108:52----------
i think what's happened several times so


---------108:54----------
that's actually like leveling up


---------108:56----------
noah because several times during this


---------108:57----------
conversation you would just slip and now


---------109:00----------
you caught like you it's okay to slip


---------109:02----------
but at least you're aware you're


---------109:03----------
slipping now


---------109:05----------
right good god it's weird


---------109:09----------
because um


---------109:10----------
[Music]


---------109:12----------
it's weird to think that you know to


---------109:15----------
to indulge a fantasy trap real quick if


---------109:18----------
i were to just sit there


---------109:19----------
after you said that that would just like


---------109:21----------
say nothing


---------109:23----------
and be the kind of person that would


---------109:26----------
think to himself


---------109:27----------
yeah i'm sitting here doing nothing and


---------109:29----------
like i'm


---------109:30----------
just going to wait for dr k to say


---------109:32----------
whatever comes to mind or like anything


---------109:33----------
that comes to my mind


---------109:35----------
okay that's weird to me like i'm so


---------109:38----------
i'm excited for it now we get to


---------109:40----------
meditation


---------109:42----------
hey let's do it so we're just gonna sit


---------109:45----------
here and look at each other


---------109:48----------
three two one go


---------110:08----------
um


---------110:41----------
oh my god this is so hard is it


---------110:44----------
i'm loving this


---------110:47----------
this is what the introvert in me has


---------110:49----------
dreamed of my entire life


---------110:52----------
god i need a girlfriend that'll do that


---------110:54----------
with me


---------110:55----------
oh that was so uncomfortable for me i


---------110:58----------
that's that's crazy i can't believe i


---------111:00----------
was totally okay with that


---------111:03----------
so i think we did something right yeah


---------111:05----------
i'm sorry i didn't ask for your consent


---------111:07----------
first but


---------111:07----------
um thank you for that no no i i'm i'm


---------111:10----------
the one that


---------111:11----------
dumped you into it you're gonna try


---------111:14----------
again


---------111:16----------
you wanna try again we don't have to try


---------111:18----------
again now i feel like there's a there's


---------111:20----------
a pressure to do it well


---------111:21----------
we don't have i think that was perfect


---------111:24----------
okay


---------111:25----------
well we could also just acknowledge the


---------111:27----------
pressure


---------111:28----------
and then sit with that and not give into


---------111:30----------
it but


---------111:32----------
if it was perfect then that's that's


---------111:34----------
meditation for the day that's fine


---------111:36----------
well i can


---------111:39----------
oh can i ask you um


---------111:42----------
about a particular meditation yeah what


---------111:44----------
is something


---------111:46----------
that can knock me out of


---------111:50----------
wanting to relapse i guess there's no


---------111:53----------
gonna


---------111:53----------
definitely knock you out of it but i


---------111:55----------
have been doing uh


---------111:56----------
mindfulness meditation like 20 minutes


---------111:59----------
and seeing how


---------112:00----------
i feel because sometimes i'll yeah


---------112:03----------
i think it depends on what is causing


---------112:06----------
you to move towards the drink


---------112:09----------
so like i i think that the really hard


---------112:12----------
thing


---------112:12----------
is um the thing that i'm the most


---------112:15----------
worried about for you


---------112:17----------
uh noah is this thought that i'm a few


---------112:19----------
moments away from relief


---------112:22----------
so oddly enough like if you you have inc


---------112:24----------
like do you think that anxiety pushes


---------112:26----------
you to drink


---------112:29----------
um well i i want to


---------112:32----------
uh clarify a bit because i don't really


---------112:36----------
feel that way anymore


---------112:38----------
because because i i'm so good with not


---------112:41----------
drinking anymore


---------112:42----------
at least two weeks into it but um good


---------112:45----------
for you man


---------112:46----------
yeah thank you what it really is is like


---------112:49----------
nicotine


---------112:50----------
or like inappropriate cannabis use where


---------112:52----------
it's like


---------112:54----------
i'm bored and yes to answer your


---------112:56----------
question anxiousness


---------112:57----------
it's like i have nothing to do but my


---------112:59----------
mind will not


---------113:00----------
shut up so i'll i'll take a bong hit


---------113:03----------
because then i can think about how high


---------113:04----------
i am


---------113:05----------
instead of all the work that i'm not


---------113:07----------
doing at midnight


---------113:09----------
you know so if you want um


---------113:12----------
have you seen like us do like the


---------113:14----------
closing of the gates


---------113:16----------
technique okay so i'm going to teach you


---------113:19----------
uh


---------113:20----------
something called bee's breath or brahma


---------113:22----------
ibrahim and like the closing of the nine


---------113:25----------
gates


---------113:26----------
and the reason for this is simply that


---------113:28----------
this is a technique that like


---------113:31----------
explodes the thoughts in your mind like


---------113:33----------
it'll just


---------113:35----------
destroy them it's it's quite powerful


---------113:37----------
and


---------113:38----------
the reason i think about it for you is


---------113:40----------
because post technique since you enjoy


---------113:42----------
just


---------113:42----------
sitting quietly with yourself so much


---------113:44----------
which i know is something that you've


---------113:46----------
been running away from this entire


---------113:49----------
interview but i think it's it's


---------113:51----------
genuinely like i think


---------113:53----------
you'll discover that sitting with


---------113:54----------
yourself feels really really nice


---------113:58----------
so i'll teach you this technique it's


---------113:59----------
one that we do a fair amount


---------114:01----------
let me just think there's another


---------114:03----------
technique that i was thinking about


---------114:04----------
that's a little bit more


---------114:06----------
anti-anxiety


---------114:12----------
but yeah let's let's go with closing of


---------114:14----------
the nine gates okay


---------114:16----------
okay so


---------114:19----------
what i'm gonna do is um put


---------114:22----------
my pinkies at the corners of my mouth


---------114:25----------
i'm gonna put my middle finger in the


---------114:28----------
groove


---------114:29----------
uh right outside like right in my


---------114:32----------
nostril like


---------114:33----------
outside my nostrils and i'm gonna put


---------114:35----------
two fingers over here


---------114:36----------
at the it in my um it's sort of like the


---------114:40----------
the tear ducts and edges of my eyes


---------114:43----------
and then for the last bit i'm going to


---------114:46----------
put my thumbs


---------114:47----------
in here inside okay so you have the pin


---------114:51----------
of your ear


---------114:52----------
and your thumb should be behind the


---------114:54----------
pinna the pin is the little flap


---------114:56----------
okay so i'll show you what that kind of


---------114:59----------
looks like so i can't do it with


---------115:00----------
headphones on but


---------115:04----------
this is what it looks like okay and then


---------115:06----------
what we're going to do is we're going to


---------115:07----------
sit up straight


---------115:08----------
and we're going to hum like a b so just


---------115:10----------
watch me first


---------115:12----------
because if you have your thumbs in your


---------115:14----------
ears you can't hear me so i'm going to


---------115:16----------
show you once okay


---------115:26----------
[Laughter]


---------115:32----------
[Music]


---------115:33----------
okay so we're gonna buzz like a beaches


---------115:38----------
question um discord cut you off were you


---------115:41----------
humming that entire time


---------115:42----------
yep so discord is gonna cut me off okay


---------115:46----------
and discord is going to cut you off too


---------115:48----------
so um it's just because of the way that


---------115:50----------
the voice detection works


---------115:51----------
yeah so it's going to be a constant


---------115:55----------
then when you run out of breath you stop


---------115:56----------
so what we're going to do is we're going


---------115:57----------
to do five rounds


---------116:00----------
and then and not


---------116:03----------
so what i want people to take away from


---------116:05----------
this afterward is just notice what it


---------116:06----------
does to the thoughts in your mind


---------116:09----------
okay like as you hum and then but don't


---------116:12----------
pay too much attention because then


---------116:13----------
it'll shatter the humming


---------116:14----------
but you know just hum five times do five


---------116:17----------
breaths and then


---------116:18----------
sit with yourself afterwards so you can


---------116:21----------
let your hands come down


---------116:23----------
let your eyes remain closed we'll do


---------116:25----------
five breaths and maybe 60 to 90 seconds


---------116:27----------
of like silent meditation


---------116:40----------
okay


---------116:54----------
um


---------117:07----------
[Music]


---------117:23----------
[Music]


---------117:36----------
um


---------117:50----------
so


---------119:28----------
so


---------119:32----------
as much as this is a tragedy you can


---------119:34----------
come on back


---------119:35----------
[Music]


---------119:38----------
that's interesting so what is


---------119:42----------
what effect do you feel on your thoughts


---------119:44----------
when you do that


---------119:47----------
i find them to be pushed aside by the


---------119:49----------
humming


---------119:51----------
okay


---------119:54----------
yeah it gets really loud after that


---------119:57----------
humming


---------119:58----------
but then i thought the impression was


---------119:59----------
you're you're uh it's not like


---------120:01----------
mindfulness where you're like


---------120:02----------
returning to that river of breathing


---------120:04----------
it's like you want to sit with those


---------120:05----------
thoughts


---------120:06----------
correct i i i don't quite follow what


---------120:09----------
what was your experience of the practice


---------120:13----------
um i was humming it the humming is


---------120:16----------
something i got to get used to but it


---------120:17----------
was


---------120:18----------
an isolating experience you know i felt


---------120:21----------
very alone


---------120:22----------
inside my head and that when i started


---------120:25----------
breathing


---------120:26----------
um you know i started thinking about my


---------120:28----------
mom the air conditioning i can hear


---------120:31----------
uh and i just observed things when you


---------120:34----------
said earlier that it's supposed to


---------120:36----------
explode my thoughts i thought the goal


---------120:38----------
was to bring them out


---------120:41----------
no yeah so so


---------120:45----------
yeah so noah you've really got to stop


---------120:49----------
trying to do things right


---------120:52----------
and instead do things the way they


---------120:55----------
happen


---------120:58----------
okay so you so so like don't ask me what


---------121:01----------
my experience is


---------121:02----------
my experience is relevant what matters


---------121:05----------
is what happened in your case


---------121:07----------
and whether it was helpful to you in


---------121:09----------
some way what's supposed to happen


---------121:11----------
if it's not helpful to you this can you


---------121:13----------
got to be careful because your mind is


---------121:15----------
going to tell you oh i'm not doing it


---------121:17----------
right


---------121:17----------
but that thought stems from


---------121:20----------
a sense of inadequacy right in a weird


---------121:24----------
way


---------121:25----------
so like the question is what happens for


---------121:27----------
you so if you've got to get used to it


---------121:29----------
if it's


---------121:29----------
uncomfortable and doesn't work for you


---------121:30----------
that's totally fine don't do it


---------121:32----------
but i would say you can practice a


---------121:33----------
little bit but the goal is that like if


---------121:35----------
you're having you know particular


---------121:36----------
anxieties


---------121:37----------
and you do the humming practice the


---------121:40----------
anxieties will be


---------121:41----------
amplified because you're going to be in


---------121:42----------
a public situation and people are going


---------121:44----------
to be wondering what


---------121:45----------
is this guy doing no but but ideally


---------121:48----------
like what will happen is the sound will


---------121:49----------
kind of push


---------121:50----------
all the thoughts away and then like


---------121:53----------
you'll just be like


---------121:54----------
lost in that sound and then like


---------121:57----------
afterward you'll kind of like


---------121:58----------
ideally be in in sort of like this calm


---------122:01----------
sort of state


---------122:02----------
yeah i i really like that like if


---------122:06----------
next time i have a craving i i know


---------122:08----------
that's gonna help a lot


---------122:09----------
you know just jostle me a bit yeah


---------122:11----------
exactly so that's that's


---------122:12----------
so jostling is actually gonna be really


---------122:14----------
that's a beautiful word


---------122:16----------
to describe a great way to get out of a


---------122:18----------
craving


---------122:20----------
so this is where like we talk about


---------122:21----------
something called urge surfing which is


---------122:23----------
to remember that like urges don't last


---------122:26----------
forever


---------122:27----------
right so like just like if you're


---------122:28----------
surfing like there's a wave and as long


---------122:30----------
as you ride on top of it


---------122:31----------
it's going to crash and you just have to


---------122:34----------
ride you have to jostle your way like


---------122:36----------
out of that rabbit hole that you go down


---------122:38----------
because like


---------122:39----------
when you have a craving it's like a


---------122:41----------
chain of thoughts right it's like


---------122:43----------
i want this it's just the right way i


---------122:45----------
can do it oh i shouldn't do it


---------122:46----------
i really shouldn't do it oh i can handle


---------122:48----------
it it's not that big of a deal


---------122:50----------
it's just this one time there's this


---------122:52----------
whole like thing and you just gotta kind


---------122:53----------
of


---------122:54----------
crack that whole jostling it up


---------122:57----------
is the most important thing so


---------123:00----------
all right yeah hey thank you thank you


---------123:04----------
so much


---------123:05----------
thank you the end of the conversation


---------123:07----------
yeah


---------123:08----------
i think i mean that's that's what i was


---------123:11----------
how does that feel to you


---------123:14----------
i'm grateful man i'm so grateful to you


---------123:16----------
are you disappointed too


---------123:21----------
i was afraid i would but you know what


---------123:24----------
this is what happened


---------123:26----------
and i'm gonna walk away different


---------123:28----------
because of this


---------123:29----------
you know so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna


---------123:32----------
be upset


---------123:33----------
that you didn't take away every impulse


---------123:35----------
i have to do drugs


---------123:37----------
you know that i do think you're a


---------123:40----------
miracle worker but i was not expecting


---------123:41----------
that


---------123:42----------
and i'm incredibly happy with this


---------123:43----------
conversation we've had


---------123:45----------
okay and so just to hammer in the final


---------123:48----------
point of the conversation


---------123:49----------
if you were a little bit upset that i


---------123:51----------
didn't take away all of your impulses


---------123:53----------
if this conversation did not live up to


---------123:55----------
your fantasy that's okay too


---------123:58----------
yes yes okay good luck to you noah


---------124:02----------
