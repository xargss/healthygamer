---------00:05----------
so if you really want to take control of


---------00:06----------
your life the first thing that you have


---------00:08----------
to understand is how does my mind work


---------00:14----------
these modules are a distillation the


---------00:17----------
essence


---------00:17----------
of my personal journey to understand


---------00:20----------
myself


---------00:20----------
over the last two decades they're kind


---------00:23----------
of like a choose your own adventure


---------00:25----------
of understanding a particular topic


---------00:27----------
because in my experience as a


---------00:28----------
psychiatrist


---------00:30----------
the best outcomes come from educated


---------00:32----------
patients


---------00:33----------
and you are ultimately going to be the


---------00:35----------
most important part of your treatment


---------00:38----------
okay fine i'm in this place and this


---------00:40----------
place sucks what am i going to do about


---------00:42----------
it


---------00:42----------
now focus on building a healthy identity


---------00:46----------
of yourself


---------00:47----------
where you can learn to unconditionally


---------00:49----------
love yourself


---------00:51----------
if meditation has one good effect on the


---------00:52----------
brain it actually strengthens the hell


---------00:54----------
out of your frontal lobes


---------00:55----------
you have to let go of the entire


---------00:57----------
construction


---------00:58----------
right because what does it mean to have


---------01:00----------
fallen behind it's a construct of the


---------01:01----------
mind


---------01:02----------
what does it mean to catch up it's a


---------01:04----------
construct of the mind because think what


---------01:05----------
you're doing here right


---------01:06----------
you're doing so much problem solving


---------01:08----------
there's a certain


---------01:09----------
method there's a certain secret there's


---------01:12----------
a certain technique


---------01:13----------
to being able to find that peace in


---------01:16----------
spite of the emotion


---------01:26----------
we can go to the birth of that scar and


---------01:29----------
we can actually try to rewrite history a


---------01:31----------
little bit


---------01:32----------
change our minds conceptualization of


---------01:34----------
the truths that we learned in the past


---------01:37----------
that cause us suffering today
