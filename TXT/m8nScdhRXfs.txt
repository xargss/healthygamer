---------01:16----------

---------01:21----------
recently because of recent events okay


---------01:24----------
uh yeah those're no we can talk about


---------01:31----------
them okay um well it's pretty pretty


---------01:38----------
pretty gnarly dr. Kang


---------01:42----------
basically I you you said you don't know


---------01:47----------
any of this right nope I didn't even


---------01:51----------
know how to pronounce your name until


---------01:52----------
today by the way I'm not laughing about


---------01:57----------
the situation I you should though that I


---------01:59----------
just like nervous laughter sister we


---------02:02----------
talk a lot about how laughter is a


---------02:04----------
defense mechanism against overwhelming


---------02:07----------
internal emotions yeah yeah I use


---------02:11----------
humor is a big defense mechanism that's


---------02:13----------
that's a that's a really really big


---------02:15----------
thing I make lots of jokes that I should


---------02:17----------
not make um but for anyway I guess well


---------02:22----------
what happened was I I had a boyfriend


---------02:25----------
and I cheated on him with several people


---------02:31----------
okay yeah and it's yeah that long story


---------02:37----------
short


---------02:37----------
okay yeah and Josh I can imagine that


---------02:42----------
the internet was not kind to you in that


---------02:45----------
circumstance oh no even and we're best


---------02:47----------
friends they love me the people love me


---------02:50----------
okay they're really mad just yeah it's


---------02:55----------
you know sorry I think it's it's not


---------02:57----------
good to cheat on people and also I don't


---------03:01----------
know that it's the Internet's place to


---------03:03----------
judge I think the judgment that you


---------03:05----------
really you know I think you aggrieved


---------03:08----------
one person right as far as I can I want


---------03:12----------
like like you you really messed with one


---------03:14----------
person right so like your boyfriend um


---------03:17----------
yeah but I hurt other people in the


---------03:20----------
process


---------03:20----------
I can imagine well yeah definitely


---------03:24----------
especially the boyfriend my ex boyfriend


---------03:26----------
now but okay do you want to talk about


---------03:29----------
this or also not talk about this I mean


---------03:34----------
I don't I don't know if there's really


---------03:35----------
much to talk about besides like I don't


---------03:39----------
know what is there to talk about you


---------03:41----------
know I kinda that's a great question can


---------03:45----------
I can I try to answer that sure yeah so


---------03:47----------
sometimes I [ __ ] up and I'm not I'm not


---------03:50----------
trying to say that you did or didn't


---------03:51----------
[ __ ] up that's entirely I did for good


---------03:53----------
that's for sure so so I think you know a


---------03:57----------
lot of times when people make mistakes


---------04:01----------
my sound is quiet okay let me try to fix


---------04:07----------
this hello okay I don't know how I can


---------04:11----------
fix this okay maybe hopefully this is


---------04:19----------
better


---------04:20----------
right now I can also turn up the game


---------04:23----------
sorry Kate oh you're good Joey is this


---------04:27----------
better


---------04:27----------
oh yeah fix it hello yep


---------04:32----------
I think way better turns out that maybe


---------04:36----------
one of the kids was playing with the the


---------04:38----------
game dial on the back of my microphone


---------04:41----------
but we're just kind of going back to you


---------04:46----------
know why people screw up I think often


---------04:49----------
times people make a mistake and then


---------04:51----------
they don't really understand what led


---------04:54----------
them to make that mistake and


---------04:55----------
understanding why we make mistakes in


---------04:58----------
life so I think a lot of times what we


---------05:00----------
do is we just punish people for mistakes


---------05:01----------
right but we don't necessarily learn


---------05:03----------
from them or what we learn is something


---------05:05----------
like a very very surface level


---------05:06----------
especially when it comes to something


---------05:08----------
like cheating on a partner which is like


---------05:11----------
we just learned that don't do it again


---------05:13----------
but what I've come to appreciate is that


---------05:16----------
when we make mistakes that they're


---------05:18----------
usually like there's something that's


---------05:21----------
driving you towards that behavior and I


---------05:23----------
think understanding where that behavior


---------05:25----------
comes from is like really really


---------05:26----------
important because if you just tell


---------05:29----------
yourself like oh I shouldn't do that


---------05:30----------
again like that doesn't actually change


---------05:32----------
behavior in my experience feeling bad


---------05:35----------
about yourself and sort of a moral


---------05:38----------
judgment is not really a great way I'm


---------05:42----------
not saying it doesn't work but I'm


---------05:43----------
saying that you know when I when I work


---------05:46----------
with I'm specifically thinking about I


---------05:48----------
do a lot of addiction psychiatry so I


---------05:49----------
work with a lot of people who will


---------05:51----------
relapse and then we'll mortal they feel


---------05:53----------
bad about themselves they'll hurt a lot


---------05:55----------
of people in the process they'll sell


---------05:58----------
belongings that or their family members


---------06:02----------
for the sake of like you know purchasing


---------06:04----------
drugs so that they can get money and do


---------06:05----------
all kinds of things that are morally


---------06:06----------
reprehensible and at the same time you


---------06:10----------
know feeling like a piece of [ __ ]


---------06:11----------
sometimes makes them more vulnerable to


---------06:14----------
the addiction yeah and so sometimes it


---------06:18----------
can yep go ahead sorry yeah well it's


---------06:21----------
they're happy of course when they feel


---------06:24----------
when they feel bad it's you know feeling


---------06:26----------
bad is gonna make them want to do some


---------06:28----------
[ __ ] coke or whatever they're


---------06:29----------
addicted to right so I think the the the


---------06:34----------
question about you know whether this is


---------06:37----------
worth talking about or not really you


---------06:39----------
know is about like whether there's


---------06:40----------
something to be gained I really have no


---------06:43----------
intention of making the internet think


---------06:45----------
worse of you then than they do or


---------06:47----------
anything like that yeah I honestly I


---------06:50----------
don't think okay so I mean otherwise you


---------06:55----------
know Kate if if you don't want to talk


---------06:57----------
more into that and maybe try to


---------06:58----------
understand because you said you cheated


---------07:00----------
on your boyfriend with several people so


---------07:02----------
that makes me think that there was


---------07:03----------
something going on inside you that you


---------07:05----------
really and and so to try to understand


---------07:08----------
that if you think that's valuable and


---------07:09----------
you feel like this is a safe enough


---------07:11----------
place to discuss it we can do that


---------07:13----------
because I I think one thing that we


---------07:16----------
haven't talked about much on stream is


---------07:17----------
like why do people cheat and it happens


---------07:20----------
all the time


---------07:21----------
okay sure


---------07:24----------
well yeah one thing is I don't want


---------07:27----------
people to think that I'm trying to like


---------07:31----------
garner sympathy


---------07:32----------
I guess just because like obviously you


---------07:38----------
know we talked before this and you know


---------07:40----------
I struggle with mental health issues and


---------07:43----------
um I think that yeah I made the decision


---------07:48----------
to cheat you know I made a decision hurt


---------07:50----------
those people


---------07:51----------
I [ __ ] up it wasn't you know my mental


---------07:53----------
health decision but but that's not to


---------07:56----------
say that it didn't you know obviously I


---------08:00----------
mean yes and as I'm sure you know like


---------08:02----------
mental health kind of can really mess


---------08:05----------
with your head yep yeah yeah I don't get


---------08:14----------
the sense that you're looking for


---------08:15----------
sympathy here or anything like that I


---------08:18----------
mean I have no idea if people are


---------08:19----------
sympathetic to you or not because I


---------08:21----------
ignored twitch at as best as I can while


---------08:23----------
I'm talking to someone I think the main


---------08:25----------
question Kate is like what do you feel


---------08:29----------
safest doing and what do you feel is


---------08:32----------
most productive like I mean I guess like


---------08:37----------
let me put it this way do you understand


---------08:38----------
why you cheated yeah yeah I took two


---------08:42----------
months off stream and just kind of


---------08:44----------
processed things and tried to understand


---------08:47----------
you know


---------08:47----------
my own therapist too and we we talk


---------08:49----------
about it a lot and yeah I understand now


---------08:53----------
look I can talk about it if you want


---------08:55----------
it's whatever I


---------08:59----------
I find myself being curious about what


---------09:02----------
you discovered about yourself because I


---------09:03----------
think that could be helpful for people


---------09:07----------
okay so I well for me I mean there's a


---------09:12----------
lot of factors and a lot of things but


---------09:16----------
it's it's several different things a big


---------09:22----------
part of it was my um my


---------09:28----------
depersonalization was something I really


---------09:30----------
struggled with what do you mean by


---------09:33----------
depersonalization can you explain


---------09:35----------
something else yeah that's like


---------09:38----------
depersonalization for me was like I'm


---------09:41----------
feeling like a like a passenger in my


---------09:44----------
own body like kind of you know how when


---------09:47----------
you look and when you interact with the


---------09:49----------
world in life your eyes are kind of here


---------09:51----------
you know your vision is here but it kind


---------09:53----------
of feels like what I do personalized


---------09:55----------
like my visions back here like I'm super


---------09:57----------
on autopilot and honestly I feel like


---------09:59----------
for the past or not now but like for six


---------10:03----------
months I just felt like I was a shell of


---------10:05----------
a person like I was new in living you


---------10:07----------
know what I mean and I think know what


---------10:10----------
would weigh in by that I don't know what


---------10:11----------
you mean um it just felt like my body


---------10:15----------
wasn't my own I guess like I was there


---------10:18----------
and I was just kind of like passively


---------10:20----------
living while my body just did things you


---------10:22----------
know like I wouldn't I didn't think


---------10:25----------
about anything I didn't process anything


---------10:26----------
like that you know and that is I deeper


---------10:34----------
ties when I get stressed or anxious and


---------10:39----------
I think the anxiety of my job and [ __ ]


---------10:45----------
like that which is my job is you know is


---------10:49----------
a twitch streamer mm-hmm okay yeah which


---------10:52----------
is pretty a pretty you know pretty scary


---------10:55----------
sometimes and then and then cheating


---------10:58----------
also things I do that too um


---------11:01----------
just triggered my depersonalization


---------11:05----------
stuff


---------11:07----------
yeah so that's so that that's your


---------11:13----------
understanding of it I mean there's more


---------11:17----------
but you know it's it's a lot like you


---------11:20----------
know obviously I wasn't happy my


---------11:22----------
relationship and I depressurize all


---------11:24----------
those feelings away you know it's just


---------11:26----------
it's just mainly what it was to


---------11:29----------
summarize it was I just kind of told all


---------11:34----------
my thoughts and feelings to [ __ ] off you


---------11:36----------
know okay I didn't process it anything


---------11:40----------
or I didn't think about anything and I


---------11:41----------
just like totally lived on autopilot you


---------11:44----------
know okay look can I just think for a


---------11:49----------
second yeah thank you for sharing that


---------11:51----------
by the way how are you doing I can


---------11:53----------
imagine that this could be rough to


---------11:56----------
share no I'm okay


---------11:59----------
okay I'm good strong work Thanks I'm


---------12:06----------
gonna just think about what you shared


---------12:10----------
and try to piece together a couple of


---------12:13----------
different things


---------12:28----------
are you depersonalized right now um no


---------12:32----------
I'm I've been trying to work through D


---------12:35----------
personalising I still do sometimes but


---------12:37----------
it's mostly when I when I get really


---------12:39----------
anxious or stressed and I feel pretty


---------12:40----------
relaxed right now and I have coping


---------12:43----------
mechanisms with it like like grounding


---------12:45----------
mechanisms you know and so I'll like


---------12:48----------
smell something strong or touch


---------12:51----------
something that feels funny I just don't


---------12:53----------
like it I'm I fidget even stuff good or


---------12:58----------
I go outside and you feel the ground um


---------13:01----------
so one thing that I want to be careful


---------13:04----------
about is you know you mentioned earlier


---------13:06----------
that you don't want you're not looking


---------13:08----------
for sympathy and and I'm gonna if it's


---------13:10----------
okay with you Kate I'm gonna point out


---------13:13----------
where I think that something you say may


---------13:18----------
be misinterpreted and may lead to people


---------13:22----------
hating on you so one thing that I want


---------13:26----------
to point out very explicitly because I


---------13:27----------
don't want people to walk away from this


---------13:29----------
with like an incomplete understanding or


---------13:31----------
an unfair judgment and if they want to


---------13:33----------
judge you for cheating I think that


---------13:34----------
that's fair but you know one thing I


---------13:37----------
just want to point out is that sometimes


---------13:39----------
people think that if you D personalize


---------13:41----------
and you're like watching yourself move


---------13:43----------
that removes responsibility from your


---------13:46----------
actions what do you think about that I


---------13:48----------
agree but I mean what can i I guess I


---------13:53----------
just don't know what to do except for


---------13:55----------
like that's what happened you know I did


---------13:57----------
make the decision to cheat it was me you


---------13:59----------
know that wasn't like my my mental


---------14:01----------
health or my depersonalization making


---------14:02----------
the decision that was me but I it was


---------14:07----------
full and anxiety inducing obviously and


---------14:13----------
so I it like triggered my [ __ ]


---------14:17----------
depersonalization whatever and which is


---------14:22----------
some why I've always had I realize now


---------14:25----------
in the past and stuff and then yeah so


---------14:32----------
I'm I'm what I'm just pointing out is


---------14:35----------
that I don't


---------14:36----------
I don't hear you saying although I was


---------14:38----------
afraid that people could interpret what


---------14:41----------
you said is it's not my fault because I


---------14:43----------
depersonalized


---------14:45----------
okay so I just wanted you know like they


---------14:50----------
can exist together yeah


---------14:51----------
absolutely that's exactly what I want to


---------14:54----------
clarify because I'm afraid that without


---------14:56----------
understanding that we can understand


---------14:59----------
better what that means but you know I


---------15:01----------
just don't want to have people coming


---------15:03----------
across with the idea that you're


---------15:04----------
absolving yourself from blame by


---------15:06----------
depersonalization yeah cool so let's


---------15:12----------
just think a little bit about this so


---------15:14----------
you were saying that you weren't you


---------15:15----------
said obviously I wasn't happy in my


---------15:17----------
relationship so that too is not obvious


---------15:19----------
to me well I mean if you're cheating on


---------15:22----------
someone you're probably not happy people


---------15:25----------
a lot of people a lot of people think


---------15:26----------
that but in my experience that being


---------15:30----------
unhappy in a relationship is not the


---------15:32----------
only reason that people cheat it's a


---------15:35----------
common one but sometimes people cheat


---------15:37----------
out of ego or narcissism or the fact


---------15:40----------
that they feel like they can right so in


---------15:43----------
in in in some really uneven power


---------15:48----------
relationship like in uneven power


---------15:51----------
dynamics I've seen one partner cheat


---------15:53----------
just because they feel like they're


---------15:55----------
entitled to yeah I work with a lot of


---------16:01----------
executives so yeah I mean not to you


---------16:09----------
know bash executives as a whole but


---------16:11----------
sometimes people tend to be a little bit


---------16:12----------
nurse I also work with a lot of


---------16:13----------
physicians so so let's just think about


---------16:18----------
this for a second so I'm gonna try to


---------16:19----------
unpack what I understood so it sounds


---------16:21----------
like you had some feelings and those


---------16:23----------
feelings were hard for you to tolerate


---------16:25----------
and processing and experiencing my


---------16:30----------
emotions and feelings I use humor as a


---------16:32----------
defense mechanism and I am really bad at


---------16:36----------
processing sadness as an emotion great


---------16:39----------
you know who else is bad at processing


---------16:42----------
their emotions


---------16:45----------
pretty much right so


---------16:49----------
oh yeah so I think what what happened


---------16:53----------
what sounds like you had some you know


---------16:54----------
authentic feelings of unhappiness or


---------16:56----------
maybe insecurity or god knows what else


---------16:58----------
and then as you started to d personalize


---------17:01----------
you kind of shunted those feelings off


---------17:03----------
to the side and then what I'm guessing


---------17:06----------
is that cheating somehow you know


---------17:11----------
balanced or covered or helped you forget


---------17:15----------
it about the negative feelings yeah yeah


---------17:18----------
and I think I think when you're in our


---------17:21----------
long relationship like that feelings of


---------17:24----------
oh god I can't end this you know like it


---------17:29----------
I you know I don't want to say stuck but


---------17:33----------
you know what I mean like when you're in


---------17:34----------
a long relationship in you even if


---------17:37----------
things might not be working you want to


---------17:39----------
keep working at them you know what I


---------17:41----------
mean because you know you care about


---------17:44----------
that person and you've been in the


---------17:45----------
relationship for a long time yeah um can


---------17:49----------
you tell me a little bit about the


---------17:50----------
relationship he was we dated for for a


---------18:08----------
long time and I met him before I started


---------18:11----------
streaming everything and I guess I don't


---------18:22----------
know we what is a long time mean it's a


---------18:25----------
long time bye boomer standard sir


---------18:27----------
streamers no no Sumer standards what is


---------18:31----------
that


---------18:31----------
couple years okay uh but the couple


---------18:35----------
means to yeah okay and a long time we


---------18:40----------
yeah especially because you know we


---------18:44----------
started dating when I was young so and


---------18:46----------
when you when you start dating some


---------18:48----------
you're really young and I also started


---------18:50----------
dating him this is actually kind of


---------18:52----------
important [ __ ] so no I think for you at


---------18:55----------
least someone analyzing my brain we met


---------19:02----------
months after my dad


---------19:03----------
died and so kind of in the wake of that


---------19:08----------
we start dating and how old were you


---------19:12----------
when you started dating 18 we met on my


---------19:18----------
18th birthday yeah


---------19:21----------
so I was 18 when we started dating and a


---------19:31----------
few months after my dad died and he was


---------19:34----------
very comforting um but I I don't know


---------19:40----------
two major things relaxed in the


---------19:42----------
relationship um one I have vaginismus


---------19:46----------
and so our sex life was pretty not good


---------19:49----------
Wow I'm really being open about this


---------19:51----------
well can you explain to us what


---------19:53----------
vaginismus is yeah vaginismus is


---------19:56----------
basically like so it's it's a so it's a


---------20:02----------
mental thing like a lot of people who


---------20:06----------
were sexually abused had vaginismus


---------20:09----------
and it was it's like basically he's


---------20:13----------
cannot explain it's like a mental thing


---------20:15----------
where basically you Jenna broke vagina


---------20:18----------
broke it to work okay let me it's hard


---------20:20----------
to fit things in there let me try to


---------20:23----------
give a different definition of it sure


---------20:25----------
yeah you should do that no I think


---------20:29----------
you're doing great it's just you know


---------20:32----------
vagina broke is you know I think you did


---------20:34----------
a funder fellini what depersonalization


---------20:36----------
is I think you've explained a lot of


---------20:38----------
things really well so there are two


---------20:42----------
issues that I have with with your


---------20:44----------
definition of vaginismus first is vagina


---------20:46----------
broke and second is that you think it's


---------20:49----------
a mental thing so in my experience


---------20:50----------
fashion business is not purely a mental


---------20:53----------
thing


---------20:54----------
vaginismus yeah well you physically it's


---------20:59----------
a physical thing too but I think it's


---------21:00----------
caused by mental stuff usually but how


---------21:03----------
my therapist and I talked about it it's


---------21:05----------
like I guess it is a physical thing too


---------21:07----------
because we talked about it like um when


---------21:11----------
you're you know sexually abused and you


---------21:14----------
it's like muscle tension there


---------21:17----------
I don't know okay I'm I'm gonna just


---------21:19----------
interrupt you and explain and then we


---------21:22----------
can talk about your how you and your


---------21:24----------
therapist have talked about it


---------21:25----------
so vaginismus is spasm of like the


---------21:29----------
muscles of especially the entrance of


---------21:32----------
the vagina so essentially what happens


---------21:34----------
is like you know your body has a lot of


---------21:36----------
muscles and and you know different kinds


---------21:38----------
of openings like I know this this


---------21:42----------
reminds me of beavis and butt-head but


---------21:43----------
literally it has sphincters and and


---------21:46----------
sphincter is like a circular muscle that


---------21:48----------
contracts and relaxes this is gonna get


---------21:50----------
so taken out of context but it really


---------21:52----------
isn't really to understand no no I'm not


---------21:55----------
worried about it


---------21:55----------
taking being taken out of context for


---------21:57----------
you I'm worried about you guys that are


---------21:59----------
gonna I know I'm giving him so much but


---------22:06----------
seriously I mean this is important to


---------22:07----------
understand because I think vaginismus is


---------22:08----------
something that's like not like people


---------22:10----------
don't a lot of people a lot of women


---------22:12----------
will have a gene is amiss and they don't


---------22:13----------
understand they just think that they're


---------22:15----------
they think actually exactly like you


---------22:17----------
think that my vagina is broken but it's


---------22:19----------
not that your vagina is broken it's just


---------22:20----------
you have a medical condition that needs


---------22:22----------
some kind of treatment and then you're


---------22:24----------
able anyway so what happens is


---------22:25----------
essentially you have spasm of the I


---------22:28----------
think mostly the outer muscles of the


---------22:30----------
vagina which make it which make your


---------22:32----------
essentially your vagina like clamp down


---------22:34----------
and then you can't really you know


---------22:36----------
insert anything into it and when you do


---------22:40----------
try to have sex it's often very very


---------22:42----------
very painful because or doesn't work


---------22:45----------
because your your that muscle is like


---------22:47----------
clamped down very hard and so you just


---------22:50----------
can't engage in any kind of sexual


---------22:52----------
relations and so it's it's so I really


---------22:55----------
think about it as muscle spasm is really


---------22:58----------
what it is and and you know Kate is spot


---------23:02----------
on that a lot of times


---------23:04----------
vaginismus I think has if you look at


---------23:07----------
like the population of people who are


---------23:09----------
vaginismus and now I'm kind of curious


---------23:10----------
about like how common of a problem it is


---------23:12----------
and I think it's important actually it's


---------23:15----------
sometimes a kid is really common - yes


---------23:19----------
so so a risk factor for vaginismus is


---------23:22----------
the sexual trauma and and this is where


---------23:26----------
once again we kind of get to the fact


---------23:28----------
that like you know a physical thing is


---------23:30----------
not just purely


---------23:30----------
physical thing nor is it purely a mental


---------23:32----------
thing it's like her her body has trained


---------23:35----------
or has been programmed to like have that


---------23:39----------
that muscle spasm in sort of a


---------23:43----------
protective way or whatever it may have a


---------23:45----------
mental component to it in terms of as


---------23:47----------
you get anxious then your body is gonna


---------23:50----------
start to spasm more you may you know you


---------23:52----------
may have like an anxiety attack or


---------23:54----------
something like that like your heart rate


---------23:55----------
increases blood pressure increases


---------23:57----------
mental stuff in your head has all kinds


---------24:00----------
of physical effects on your body yes in


---------24:03----------
fact yeah so so vaginismus is one kind


---------24:09----------
of vulnerability that saw a particular


---------24:11----------
body and has to respond to a mental


---------24:14----------
stressor and we each have our each of


---------24:17----------
our bodies is like a little bit unique


---------24:18----------
in the way that it responds to strengths


---------24:20----------
so when we're mentally stressed


---------24:22----------
depending on the kind of stress that we


---------24:23----------
feel our body is going to do different


---------24:25----------
kinds of things some people will get


---------24:26----------
butterflies in their stomach


---------24:27----------
some people will start to hyperventilate


---------24:29----------
some people will have a panic attack


---------24:31----------
some people will emotionally shut down


---------24:33----------
or D personalize some people will have


---------24:35----------
vaginismus some people will you know


---------24:38----------
piss themselves like all like the body


---------24:41----------
just does all kinds of crap that like we


---------24:44----------
don't want it to do because we're just


---------24:46----------
that's just the way our body works based


---------24:47----------
on mental stuff and so so it sounds like


---------24:51----------
you have vaginismus and and I forgot how


---------24:55----------
we got onto that so it sounds like you


---------24:57----------
would you started dating your boyfriend


---------24:58----------
when you were eight our issues are ear


---------25:01----------
issues okay my vaginismus or sex link


---------25:05----------
wasn't very existent okay and and also


---------25:10----------
uh but we weren't we didn't I don't know


---------25:14----------
how to word this I wasn't well I'm


---------25:19----------
really bad at accepting my emotions and


---------25:21----------
processing my emotions already and I


---------25:23----------
think that he wasn't good at doing you


---------25:27----------
know he also wasn't good at that sure


---------25:28----------
and so we I guess we didn't talk about


---------25:31----------
our emotions at all which was my fault


---------25:33----------
because I wanted you know I wanted


---------25:36----------
someone who was there for me mostly I


---------25:38----------
think subconsciously but I didn't admit


---------25:40----------
that to myself it was a lot of like


---------25:43----------
feelings I had


---------25:44----------
just kind of pushing them away like what


---------25:46----------
were the feelings that you had like I


---------25:50----------
won't have sex but like whatever or you


---------25:53----------
know I want to have someone who's there


---------25:57----------
for me emotionally but whatever you know


---------25:59----------
just kind of pushing it was he not there


---------26:01----------
a problem


---------26:01----------
it sounds like he was very comforting


---------26:03----------
after your dad passed away was he not


---------26:05----------
there for you emotion no because the


---------26:08----------
thing is my dad died like I dealt with


---------26:12----------
things in a humorous way so I would just


---------26:15----------
make jokes about it all the time so then


---------26:17----------
you know and I'm also pretty I don't


---------26:20----------
know I'm pretty good at dealing with


---------26:22----------
emotional trauma have practice that's


---------26:27----------
sad sorry Matt laughing nervously um but


---------26:32----------
yeah we weren't I guess we just weren't


---------26:35----------
really we didn't really connect


---------26:37----------
emotionally just not very good at


---------26:40----------
helping me with my anxiety which was the


---------26:42----------
biggest thing and I had a lot of anxiety


---------26:45----------
what were you angry about I relationship


---------26:48----------
anxiety a lot which is like um you know


---------26:52----------
what is that really annoying I don't


---------26:55----------
know I guess just like I'd relationship


---------26:57----------
anxiety like thinking maybe he wouldn't


---------27:00----------
like me anymore or you know maybe he


---------27:02----------
wouldn't maybe he's gonna lose feelings


---------27:05----------
for me or you know whatever I think in


---------27:06----------
the beginning of the relationship I


---------27:08----------
latched so much onto I want this to last


---------27:10----------
forever I want to marry this person that


---------27:12----------
anything that could threaten that scared


---------27:15----------
the [ __ ] out of me and and then which is


---------27:18----------
why as it moved on even though I know I


---------27:20----------
should have ended the relationship like


---------27:21----------
while ago I didn't because it when I was


---------27:29----------
he personalizing so I was like whatever


---------27:31----------
problem doesn't exist and - I just


---------27:37----------
wanted to make things work because when


---------27:39----------
I was [ __ ] 18 I decided I'm gonna


---------27:40----------
marry this guy so you know yeah but why


---------27:44----------
did you want to make things work because


---------27:47----------
I I loved him and I cared about the


---------27:52----------
relationship and I think uh I don't know


---------27:58----------
my I think um because he was the person


---------28:02----------
it was there for my dad died like he


---------28:05----------
kind of filled the void that my dad left


---------28:07----------
I guess in a way you know someone who to


---------28:10----------
spend time with who was there for me who


---------28:12----------
took care of me you know he would cook


---------28:13----------
for me sometimes and you know like he


---------28:16----------
was very very caring and very you know


---------28:19----------
like yeah so I guess it was did you feel


---------28:22----------
like you owed him um yeah I guess I owe


---------28:29----------
it to him to keep my promise


---------28:31----------
I guess what was your promise that I


---------28:34----------
that we'd get married and that we never


---------28:36----------
very good this is so weird to talk about


---------28:39----------
on the street what's weird to talk about


---------28:43----------
I don't know this is the most


---------28:46----------
emotionally vulnerable I've ever been on


---------28:48----------
screen like this is should I only really


---------28:50----------
talk about my therapist do you want to


---------28:53----------
stop no it's whatever it's good it's


---------28:57----------
good to talk about things I think um you


---------28:59----------
know maybe I have a slight advantage


---------29:01----------
over you because since I'm a Boomer


---------29:03----------
sometimes I forget we're on stream I I


---------29:06----------
was forgetting to I think that was why I


---------29:08----------
was like it only it only helps to ignore


---------29:16----------
the thousands of people who are watching


---------29:18----------
yeah I guess it's also scary cuz I don't


---------29:21----------
want to embarrass my ex boyfriend


---------29:23----------
because maybe his friends are watching


---------29:24----------
you know what I mean so that's that sure


---------29:25----------
so you you don't want sure good I mean I


---------29:28----------
think it's good that you don't want to I


---------29:29----------
mean it's like he's coming on stream so


---------29:34----------
he didn't say you know yeah so so let's


---------29:37----------
just think a little bit cuz I I think so


---------29:40----------
let me say this Kate I think that a lot


---------29:42----------
of what people are gonna be taking away


---------29:44----------
I I hope that what they take away is not


---------29:47----------
specific to you or your boyfriend I


---------29:50----------
think the whole whole reason that we


---------29:52----------
stream to begin with is because what we


---------29:55----------
feel applies only to us actually applies


---------29:59----------
to a hell of a lot more people like if


---------30:01----------
there's a single person who's watching


---------30:03----------
who actually hat has vaginismus and is


---------30:05----------
super super embarrassed because they're


---------30:07----------
18 years old and like just thinks that


---------30:11----------
their vaginas


---------30:11----------
and like just think about if you're a


---------30:13----------
woman who feels like your vagina is


---------30:15----------
broken like how much shame comes with


---------30:17----------
that and the fact that yeah shame is a


---------30:21----------
big one how some I don't know


---------30:28----------
well there I guess because I was


---------30:32----------
sexually abused as a kid you know and a


---------30:34----------
lot of shame came from that like I


---------30:38----------
remember it I stupid


---------30:40----------
I mean it's not that it you know it's


---------30:42----------
silly I guess I had this memory of when


---------30:45----------
I was a kid and I was looking at these


---------30:48----------
like apples to apples cards and I was


---------30:52----------
like probably like seven or eight or


---------30:55----------
something and when I was sexually abused


---------30:57----------
I was like it was from like four to six


---------31:00----------
it's like for a couple years and I was


---------31:06----------
looking at this like apples to apples


---------31:08----------
card and it was it said I'm pure and I


---------31:12----------
remember thinking I looked at it I was


---------31:14----------
like crying thinking that I'm not pure


---------31:17----------
and I'll never be pure because of what


---------31:19----------
happened to me and I guess that memory


---------31:21----------
just sticks in my head of like shame


---------31:23----------
feeling ashamed for something that I


---------31:25----------
didn't ask for you know um yeah it's a


---------31:30----------
powerful memory don't click around close


---------31:42----------
your eyes no no no tea you're gonna


---------31:44----------
you're gonna make like take this


---------31:46----------
Dragonite just close your eyes okay tell


---------31:52----------
me what you feel it's hard to keep feel


---------31:55----------
like it's hard to keep my eyes closed


---------31:57----------
absolutely I'm looking I know and what


---------31:59----------
you want to look so so looking so let's


---------32:02----------
explain why we close our eyes when we


---------32:04----------
meditate oh yeah so I I hadn't thought


---------32:10----------
about that so if you if you want to open


---------32:11----------
your eyes to feel safe by all means open


---------32:13----------
them sorry for nothing


---------32:17----------
sorry for what I interrupted you you


---------32:21----------
know no it's good I'm glad you did


---------32:22----------
because you just taught me something


---------32:24----------
about you know when people


---------32:25----------
a history of sexual abuse closing your


---------32:28----------
eyes can make them feel vulnerable which


---------32:29----------
is something that I should I should


---------32:30----------
remember the reason that I was huh


---------32:34----------
know that about myself that closing my


---------32:36----------
eyes well that's what we're here to do


---------32:40----------
the reason I was asking you to close


---------32:42----------
your eyes is because I think generally


---------32:44----------
speaking when it so here's what I see


---------32:46----------
you you don't it's hard for you to sit


---------32:48----------
with what's on the inside and if we


---------32:50----------
think about our sense organs the purpose


---------32:52----------
of our sense organs is to take our


---------32:54----------
attention and put them to the outside


---------32:57----------
right that's like literally what they do


---------32:59----------
like if I open my eyes and I see


---------33:01----------
something then a fraction of my mental


---------33:03----------
attention goes to the outside thing so


---------33:06----------
what what instead of closing your eyes


---------33:09----------
since that maybe makes you feel a little


---------33:10----------
bit vulnerable I want you to take your


---------33:12----------
teacup and place it in front of you


---------33:14----------
okay and I want you to look at the


---------33:17----------
grains of the wood on the teacup yes is


---------33:25----------
just stare at the grains of your teacup


---------33:26----------
and then tell me how you feel right now


---------33:28----------
I guess I feel relieved like to be


---------33:37----------
talking about something that I guess I I


---------33:40----------
feel I feel happy because I know there's


---------33:45----------
so many victims of sexual abuse who


---------33:49----------
probably watch this dream and I feel I'm


---------33:53----------
happy that they're not alone like no no


---------33:58----------
no cuz it's scary it's scary to talk


---------34:00----------
about that stuff but if I was watching


---------34:03----------
this I know I'd be like wow that's


---------34:06----------
really cool you know that someone who


---------34:08----------
went through something similar to me is


---------34:10----------
like I can look at them but I guess to


---------34:14----------
be honest I also feel kind of guilty


---------34:16----------
because this guy comes off we're gonna I


---------34:18----------
think but I feel bad anyone who has to


---------34:22----------
relate to me because I don't want them


---------34:25----------
to think that they're a bad person


---------34:27----------
because they have stuff in common with


---------34:28----------
me and you feel like you're a bad person


---------34:31----------
yeah yeah keep acting at the teacup


---------34:39----------
okay now what do you feel no no so I'll


---------34:47----------
ask a leading question now is this the


---------34:49----------
feeling that you had when you were seven


---------34:51----------
years old and you looked at the


---------34:53----------
apples-to-apples card and it said pure


---------34:56----------
um I guess yeah ashamed I'm like tainted


---------35:02----------
I can feel like I'll never be the same I


---------35:06----------
feel like I have like you know the


---------35:08----------
Scarlet Letter the book uh-huh


---------35:10----------
I feel like I look at a on me forever


---------35:12----------
you know


---------35:15----------
yeah do you think that you cheating on


---------35:17----------
your I'm gonna ask you another leading


---------35:19----------
question


---------35:19----------
okay so feel free to say no but do you


---------35:23----------
feel like you were destined to hurt


---------35:26----------
people because you are tainted I'm happy


---------35:32----------
to hear that now I'm going to ask you


---------35:36----------
sort of a weird question I'm hot because


---------35:42----------
I think everyone has a lot of good in


---------35:43----------
them no one's really evil or a bad


---------35:46----------
person and I think everyone at their


---------35:48----------
core is like everyone maybe not everyone


---------35:51----------
but most people want to do good and I


---------35:53----------
think I'm one of those people where did


---------35:57----------
you get that idea where did you get the


---------36:01----------
idea that you have a core of goodness I


---------36:03----------
guess it's something that you kind of


---------36:05----------
know something that only you can know


---------36:07----------
because if you can only know what if


---------36:10----------
someone is good if you only know if


---------36:14----------
you're good placed on your actions when


---------36:16----------
no one else is watching and I guess I'm


---------36:19----------
there when no one else is watching and


---------36:20----------
so I think I'm a good person too I guess


---------36:23----------
I guess I think both at different times


---------36:25----------
you know both what I'm a good and a bad


---------36:28----------
person okay then I guess we all are - so


---------36:32----------
Kate I'm gonna push you a little bit


---------36:34----------
further okay so and if this is hurtful


---------36:37----------
at some point you let me know and I'll


---------36:38----------
get back pain is important sometimes I


---------36:42----------
think so I'm I'm gonna put together a


---------36:50----------
version of you which is going to


---------36:52----------
be like just half of you right so this


---------36:55----------
is the person who looks at a card that


---------36:58----------
says pure and then thinks deep down that


---------37:01----------
this doesn't apply to them that you're


---------37:03----------
tainted the person who has a brokerage


---------37:06----------
ina the person who you know cheats on


---------37:11----------
someone who supported them and comforted


---------37:14----------
them and and there's that person how can


---------37:18----------
that person feel like they're good


---------37:21----------
because that's that's not all there is -


---------37:25----------
so tell us what else there is what else


---------37:30----------
what have you show me the rest of it and


---------37:37----------
then yeah I like to cook for people I


---------37:45----------
don't know it makes me happy to make


---------37:47----------
other people like feel good and like


---------37:50----------
take care of them sure I like to show


---------37:54----------
people music make them happy I like to


---------37:58----------
drive people around I like to help


---------38:01----------
people when they're sad I love when


---------38:03----------
people come to me when they're sad or


---------38:04----------
anxious it makes me really happy to help


---------38:07----------
them because they trust me and I guess I


---------38:12----------
guess I know that I have a really hard


---------38:15----------
time opening up to people interesting


---------38:17----------
people and I'm glad that they have


---------38:20----------
someone to trust and open up to and I'm


---------38:23----------
also glad that I can be that I'm glad


---------38:25----------
that I can experience that side of them


---------38:27----------
because recently I've been trying open


---------38:30----------
up to myself more and everyone else and


---------38:33----------
really talk about my feelings because


---------38:35----------
I'm really bad at being sad and it's


---------38:38----------
because of my PTSD you know and all my


---------38:40----------
passionate cuz you know like that was


---------38:43----------
really hard and then my Papa died he was


---------38:45----------
my mom's dad when I was 11 and then my


---------38:49----------
dad died and you know it's just like a


---------38:50----------
lot you know for someone young to go


---------38:52----------
through and so from all that I guess I


---------38:56----------
just became really good at like D


---------38:59----------
personalizing and like pushing all my


---------39:00----------
bad feelings away and not thinking about


---------39:01----------
them because it was easier now that I'm


---------39:05----------
really


---------39:05----------
trying to open up and process my bad


---------39:08----------
feelings and tell people when I'm


---------39:09----------
anxious and sad and like not just deal


---------39:13----------
with it on my own I guess


---------39:20----------
well so many thought yeah I don't I


---------39:25----------
don't think you lost your train of


---------39:26----------
thought I think your train of thought is


---------39:29----------
forming no I mean I I think I think the


---------39:33----------
thoughts in your mind are not like a


---------39:35----------
train that you lose it's like a tree


---------39:37----------
that's growing and so thoughts start to


---------39:39----------
sprout and then they're kind of like


---------39:41----------
half formed but they're not like really


---------39:43----------
fully formed yet and you're just in the


---------39:45----------
process of like growing your


---------39:48----------
understanding about yourself that's


---------39:51----------
really beautiful yeah I'm big about


---------39:54----------
nature analogies I love analogies dude


---------39:58----------
no it's interesting there right so we


---------40:00----------
blame ourselves for not speaking clearly


---------40:02----------
or not understanding ourselves we we


---------40:05----------
expect of ourselves an omniscient


---------40:07----------
understanding and also a perfect


---------40:10----------
articulation but but we're just figuring


---------40:14----------
ourselves out as we talk you know like


---------40:16----------
we're learning about ourselves while


---------40:17----------
we're explaining ourselves to other


---------40:19----------
people yeah which is why it's so


---------40:21----------
important to talk about your feelings


---------40:22----------
because you can learn so much about


---------40:23----------
yourself - yeah Oh putting on it feels


---------40:27----------
really can I ask a I'm sure so we you


---------40:33----------
mentioned that your grandfather passed


---------40:35----------
away when you were 11


---------40:36----------
can you tell me about that you said oh


---------40:39----------
that's a lot for a kid to deal with yeah


---------40:42----------
what I mean obviously but you know what


---------40:46----------
was he was like my main father figure in


---------40:49----------
my life um my my papa


---------40:52----------
is what I called him he was my my mom's


---------40:54----------
dad and I lived with him up until I was


---------40:57----------
like seven or something so we and I


---------41:00----------
didn't live my parents my mom's a


---------41:01----------
lesbian my parents got divorced when


---------41:05----------
they I was six months old and so my dad


---------41:08----------
always lived like two hours away but


---------41:09----------
he's always very like it was never the


---------41:11----------
dynamic of like oh it is my dad care


---------41:14----------
about me it was always more the opposite


---------41:15----------
which makes me feel guilty now -


---------41:17----------
especially that he's dead that


---------41:19----------
he was always kind of looking for my


---------41:22----------
affection rather than me looking for his


---------41:24----------
oh and try that my pop yeah my papa was


---------41:28----------
um was yeah go ahead sorry I'm just no I


---------41:33----------
was just curious though in what ways was


---------41:34----------
your dad looking for your affection you


---------41:37----------
would try to like buy me stuff or try to


---------41:39----------
like I don't know he just I think he


---------41:41----------
always felt that he cared about me a lot


---------41:44----------
more than I cared about him and I think


---------41:45----------
that was true to a certain extent and I


---------41:47----------
think a big part of that is because I


---------41:48----------
was really young and dumb and I really


---------41:51----------
wish that he could see now that he's


---------41:53----------
gone like how much I [ __ ] care about


---------41:56----------
him you know like even even when he died


---------42:00----------
like I don't think my brother thought I


---------42:02----------
cared that much you know it was like I


---------42:06----------
guess that was another way to call like


---------42:07----------
god I'm so terrible expressing my


---------42:10----------
emotions and like how I feel about


---------42:13----------
people that like my own brother thought


---------42:15----------
that I didn't really care that much that


---------42:17----------
my dad that I did like God I'm [ __ ]


---------42:19----------
[ __ ] that what I'm getting better


---------42:22----------
why didn't your brother think that you


---------42:24----------
didn't care that your dad passed away I


---------42:26----------
think cuz I joke around a lot Kyle this


---------42:30----------
too though my brother um but I don't


---------42:33----------
know I guess cuz I was so [ __ ]


---------42:35----------
[ __ ] I was 17 when he died you know


---------42:38----------
like I was a senior in high school I was


---------42:41----------
just like not focused on him I would


---------42:44----------
when I was in place and shows I'd forget


---------42:46----------
to tell him about it even though that's


---------42:47----------
all he wanted to do is just see me


---------42:49----------
perform and sing and you know what do


---------42:56----------
you what are you feeling now I just kind


---------43:01----------
of stressed out yeah you seemed amped up


---------43:03----------
so go back to looking at your teacup oh


---------43:06----------
oh okay nothing just discord lighting


---------43:12----------
just look at your teacup for a second


---------43:15----------
and then tell me what you feel


---------43:22----------
okay the grains I feel like I I should


---------43:29----------
go back to explaining about my papa


---------43:32----------
I also I don't know I think I just lost


---------43:36----------
my feeling I have a habit of doing that


---------43:38----------
yup trying to make myself laugh or


---------43:40----------
feeling something else really quick and


---------43:42----------
and losing the feeling what do I have a


---------43:43----------
lot of trouble crying if I ever feel


---------43:45----------
like crying I I like cry for like 20


---------43:47----------
seconds and then it's done it's really


---------43:50----------
hard for me to cry unless it's out of


---------43:53----------
joy or Kate can you hold on a second so


---------43:56----------
beautiful my two-year-old seems to be


---------43:58----------
having a meltdown I'm gonna be right


---------43:59----------
yeah yeah let's go pee if you need to


---------44:03----------
yeah hey Frankie how you doing I'm doing


---------44:12----------
well


---------44:13----------
okay strong work so far how you feeling


---------44:16----------
yeah I'm good I just you know had a


---------44:19----------
little bit of a hoof in the bathroom but


---------44:22----------
it was good good yeah what was those a


---------44:25----------
little bit of like what is that I'm


---------44:33----------
gonna anxiety that's not a real word


---------44:36----------
yeah what what were you anxious about I


---------44:43----------
feel um maybe it wasn't I guess it just


---------44:46----------
wasn't really the right feeling maybe I


---------44:48----------
think it was I was overwhelmed with my


---------44:52----------
emotions and also I feel good because I


---------44:55----------
opened my discord and I just saw a


---------45:02----------
message from like a viewer that just


---------45:05----------
said like like I I love you and I just


---------45:10----------
don't know and then my mom's are


---------45:12----------
watching and and they're they just they


---------45:14----------
text me and said they're crying and they


---------45:16----------
love me and they're proud of me so so I


---------45:18----------
guess it's like overwhelmed but happy


---------45:21----------
yeah so it sounds like there's a lot of


---------45:23----------
positive emotion and a lot of negative


---------45:25----------
emotion that's swirling around inside


---------45:28----------
you like a washing machine I love


---------45:34----------
okay so let's go back to your pop pop


---------45:38----------
pop tell me about your Papa uh he's


---------45:43----------
pretty cool he's kind of epic cool guy


---------45:46----------
yeah my mom was at work a lot growing up


---------45:50----------
so she definitely liked my mom and I


---------45:52----------
were really close growing up but my dad


---------45:54----------
was you know I seemed like every weekend


---------45:55----------
pretty much my mom worked a lot but we


---------45:58----------
were so really close but my papa was


---------46:01----------
like always home when I was home you


---------46:03----------
know and when you're like when you're


---------46:04----------
really really young that's when your


---------46:05----------
home the most often and he was just


---------46:07----------
always there for me


---------46:09----------
my brother and I talk about this a lot


---------46:11----------
like how my dad more raised my brother


---------46:13----------
and my Papa more raised me and that


---------46:15----------
caused a lot of differences in us and


---------46:17----------
losing way and um one thing is like my


---------46:21----------
dad was kind of he he was an alcoholic


---------46:23----------
and so he wasn't always that nice to my


---------46:26----------
brother um and you know kind of would he


---------46:32----------
just wasn't that nice and or supportive


---------46:33----------
a lot of the time you know he was


---------46:35----------
judgmental of him and you know the kind


---------46:38----------
of parent who would be like I don't know


---------46:41----------
I I wasn't there but long story short he


---------46:44----------
wasn't a nice woman and my Papa just


---------46:46----------
treated me like I don't know I think


---------46:50----------
he's the reason I'm so like extroverted


---------46:52----------
and bubbly and um curious now like the


---------46:56----------
reason I have any cheese he treated me


---------47:00----------
so patiently he taught me to read when I


---------47:03----------
was like really young really really


---------47:05----------
young like I think it's headed reading


---------47:06----------
when I was like 2 or 3 or something like


---------47:08----------
really young he just answered all my


---------47:11----------
questions was always so patient


---------47:12----------
encouraged me to be curious I really


---------47:15----------
liked dancing and singing as a kid and


---------47:16----------
like acting and stuff so I would like


---------47:18----------
dance and sing on the fireplace for like


---------47:20----------
hours and you never ever make me stop


---------47:22----------
you just sit there and support me and


---------47:25----------
encourage me and you know make me sleepy


---------47:29----------
soup and he was just so lonely yeah he


---------47:34----------
was just so amazing and then he got


---------47:36----------
dementia which was holy [ __ ] like wow


---------47:39----------
you know he got the men


---------47:44----------
yeah hold on a second yeah well holy


---------47:47----------
[ __ ] Wow let's translate that okay um


---------47:52----------
holy [ __ ] Wow is roughly translated -


---------47:55----------
that was very hard for like I don't I


---------47:59----------
think I think I went up like two years


---------48:00----------
so like nine year old k2 process sure I


---------48:04----------
mean I miss rent like we were two peas


---------48:08----------
in a [ __ ] pot it was always Katy and


---------48:10----------
Papa always together hmm


---------48:12----------
and and what what was it like - I mean


---------48:16----------
what did you understand back then


---------48:19----------
understand yeah well I don't know I just


---------48:25----------
knew that I was watching the person who


---------48:28----------
raised me and Wow I was watching him


---------48:32----------
deteriorate and I didn't understand it


---------48:36----------
fandom he died when I was like 11 I was


---------48:41----------
like two weeks before I started middle


---------48:43----------
school I think and um and I remember


---------48:47----------
everyone like flew down all my family


---------48:49----------
flew in and he's in the hospital we all


---------48:51----------
knew he's gonna die it was like a long


---------48:53----------
long process you know true where you


---------48:57----------
know like I'm sure you or you know a lot


---------49:01----------
of people watching and probably dealt


---------49:02----------
with you know um people they know having


---------49:06----------
dementia or Alzheimer's and um so hard


---------49:11----------
seeing them like forget about you of


---------49:16----------
course like as a kid I didn't really


---------49:17----------
understand it but I'd also you know gone


---------49:20----------
through a lot of the kids so I think


---------49:22----------
mentally


---------49:23----------
I'd already learned how to do


---------49:24----------
personalized and how to push things away


---------49:26----------
so it was like you know I didn't feel


---------49:31----------
like I was them at the time yeah and but


---------49:35----------
I remember wind whenever would use in


---------49:39----------
the hospital and everyone know he was


---------49:40----------
gonna die like that night road knew how


---------49:43----------
close poplin I worry about everyone is


---------49:46----------
in his hospital room there's like a lot


---------49:48----------
of us and and I remember they're all


---------49:50----------
taking turns saying goodbye to him and


---------49:52----------
holding his hand and everyone kept


---------49:55----------
telling me go go hold his hand


---------49:57----------
I wouldn't and I just would not I just


---------50:01----------
kept saying no no I don't like I don't


---------50:03----------
want to and I think obviously like that


---------50:06----------
makes a lot of sense with how I handle


---------50:09----------
things now just like pushing things away


---------50:11----------
it's not real don't worry about it just


---------50:13----------
don't help us understand what makes


---------50:15----------
sense to you now


---------50:16----------
um do cousin together for us um it makes


---------50:21----------
sense now because how bad I am at


---------50:23----------
expressing and processing my emotions so


---------50:25----------
I just kind of ignore them and focus on


---------50:27----------
something else when you say you're bad


---------50:29----------
at processing emotions is that like


---------50:32----------
basically like you saying my vagina's


---------50:34----------
broke someone's gonna break an emotional


---------50:38----------
processing unit no I used it actually


---------50:42----------
when I was in high school I used to


---------50:43----------
think of my brain like a broken clock


---------50:45----------
like I just did not understand like I


---------50:48----------
just did not understand how to process


---------50:51----------
emotions or how to how to be and there's


---------50:54----------
just I think it was just because of like


---------50:56----------
the sexual abuse thing really really set


---------50:59----------
me up for failure in that department so


---------51:04----------
can I just say something I don't think


---------51:06----------
that you're bad at processing emotions


---------51:08----------
what do you think about that


---------51:10----------
I don't maybe I'm open to your


---------51:14----------
interpretation an opinion so so here's


---------51:16----------
here's what I think happened I think


---------51:17----------
when people get sexually abused and I


---------51:20----------
know this is gonna sound kind of weird


---------51:22----------
but I'm not even so sure that there may


---------51:24----------
have been more there than that like I


---------51:26----------
don't want to point to that as the


---------51:27----------
smoking gun but I think what happens is


---------51:31----------
so the reason that you D personalizes


---------51:32----------
like so this is well understood and


---------51:34----------
people who have trauma from a young age


---------51:36----------
that they dissociate and they D


---------51:38----------
personalize and that's essentially a


---------51:40----------
protective mechanism yes it is and and


---------51:43----------
so I think rather than thinking about it


---------51:45----------
is you being bad at processing emotions


---------51:48----------
what I want you to understand is that


---------51:50----------
you almost have like an emotional


---------51:52----------
resistance and every time like with


---------51:55----------
sexual trauma essentially what it does


---------51:57----------
is it like jacks up your emotional


---------51:59----------
resistance and so you're like immune to


---------52:01----------
any kind of emotional damage the problem


---------52:04----------
is that that also makes you like color


---------52:05----------
blind to all kinds of stuff and what I'm


---------52:08----------
hearing from your life is that you


---------52:09----------
essentially


---------52:10----------
like our leveling up your


---------52:12----------
depersonalization skill was like it's


---------52:17----------
like Oh like let's let's like let's love


---------52:20----------
like let's buy this skill when you're


---------52:23----------
sexually abused and then when Papa dies


---------52:25----------
away it's like yeah let's dump some more


---------52:27----------
points into that scale and then your dad


---------52:29----------
passes away and it's like yeah let's


---------52:31----------
dump some more points into that skill


---------52:33----------
and then then the tricky thing in life


---------52:35----------
is that like what makes life hard is


---------52:37----------
that we use the skills that we're best


---------52:40----------
at which sort of makes sense right like


---------52:42----------
that's how [ __ ] works like you just do


---------52:45----------
what you're kind of good at because


---------52:46----------
that's what you lean on it's not like


---------52:48----------
you wake up one day and you're like I'm


---------52:49----------
gonna instead of walk I'm going to swim


---------52:52----------
across the ground you just don't do


---------52:55----------
stupid things like ignore things that


---------52:57----------
you're good at your body's like this is


---------52:59----------
how we move from point A to point B if


---------53:01----------
we are on a solid surface and that's the


---------53:05----------
skill that we use because that's what


---------53:07----------
we've used our entire life and what I'm


---------53:09----------
hearing from you and I think it's really


---------53:11----------
awesome that you piece this together for


---------53:13----------
yourself but I want to kind of even dig


---------53:15----------
a little bit deeper and recognize that


---------53:16----------
you're not bad at processing emotions


---------53:21----------
being resistant to your emotions has


---------53:24----------
been a survival skill for you yeah


---------53:27----------
because watching yeah so watching you're


---------53:31----------
your best friend in your primary


---------53:33----------
caretaker start to crumble from the


---------53:38----------
inside and like him to not recognize you


---------53:41----------
like that [ __ ] is enough to traumatize


---------53:44----------
you you know even without the sexual


---------53:47----------
abuse and the sexual abuse is enough to


---------53:51----------
traumatize you any one of those is


---------54:02----------
enough to [ __ ] you up for life and then


---------54:08----------
you toss in like a little bit of that


---------54:10----------
vaginismus and now we're vaginas broke


---------54:14----------
motions are broke yeah and then get the


---------54:19----------
internet hating on you


---------54:21----------
oh that's great love that honestly


---------54:24----------
though I'm so lucky that I'm good at the


---------54:27----------
survival instinct of it's not my friend


---------54:35----------
yes so I want to explain this I would


---------54:37----------
this exactly my point is it's not luck


---------54:40----------
it's like lip it's not luck that you're


---------54:43----------
good at this


---------54:43----------
it's something that you have your brain


---------54:46----------
has and psyche and stuff is like leveled


---------54:49----------
up it's like you're not immune to


---------54:51----------
emotions because of luck you're immune


---------54:53----------
to emotions because you've leveled that


---------54:55----------
[ __ ] up your entire life yep and yep yes


---------55:02----------
I mean you've got a lot of hurt in there


---------55:06----------
somewhere in the OL noggin but yeah I


---------55:12----------
think when I when I lost my Papa like


---------55:15----------
the it was really hard to I don't know


---------55:23----------
that's when I started becoming like a


---------55:25----------
weird kid you know like hey not that


---------55:30----------
these things are weird but people I also


---------55:32----------
went to a Catholic school so that was


---------55:33----------
really hard too because I saw all the


---------55:36----------
same people all the time and they were


---------55:38----------
really judgmental especially like my


---------55:40----------
idol lesbian mother so they all [ __ ]


---------55:42----------
hate like judge me because of that


---------55:44----------
and I dealt with that a lot in middle


---------55:47----------
school in elementary school and then I


---------55:48----------
also like the the sexual [ __ ] they


---------55:51----------
didn't know about that stuff but because


---------55:53----------
I grew up in a Catholic environment it


---------55:55----------
made it way worse than I felt super


---------55:56----------
impure you know and I felt even more


---------55:59----------
shamed because of all the Catholic stuff


---------56:00----------
but I also got really into like like


---------56:05----------
role-playing online you know like I got


---------56:08----------
really into the internet life when my


---------56:09----------
Papa died um you know and then they


---------56:12----------
could pay man I don't really know


---------56:13----------
wizard101 and take down and making


---------56:15----------
internet friends because I didn't like


---------56:17----------
the people that I met in real life you


---------56:20----------
know or I got really into horror movies


---------56:23----------
welcome sister embrace us for we didn't


---------56:27----------
really the Internet's


---------56:29----------
and you belong here and I got really in


---------56:35----------
the horror like I love horror movies


---------56:36----------
score I love that stuff and I think it


---------56:39----------
was because death at a young age you


---------56:41----------
know and then what I got what you keep


---------56:44----------
doing that where you say you know what


---------56:48----------
is that I think there's value to what


---------56:55----------
you say I just I I'd like to understand


---------56:57----------
the rest of it [ __ ] see okay so a way


---------57:06----------
for me to connect people when I talk to


---------57:08----------
them to make sure they're on the same


---------57:09----------
page as me maybe I don't know you know


---------57:12----------
okay so so you you became one of us yes


---------57:17----------
and I got really into that and now


---------57:20----------
actually through all this like the last


---------57:23----------
two months I've realized that I win my


---------57:27----------
papa died so handling my Papa's death


---------57:30----------
which I didn't even realize I was


---------57:31----------
handling that until I went to therapy


---------57:33----------
and I talked about like we talked about


---------57:35----------
history of depression whatever and I


---------57:37----------
talked about how I was pretty depressed


---------57:39----------
in middle school and I didn't know why


---------57:41----------
until she was like when I do pop then I


---------57:45----------
was like oh right before I started


---------57:46----------
middle school she's like I was like oh


---------57:48----------
all right like that's why I was so


---------57:51----------
[ __ ] sad in middle school my papa


---------57:54----------
died right and I feel like losing him


---------58:00----------
versus dealing with my sexual abuse


---------58:02----------
versus dealing with my dad dying versus


---------58:05----------
like this I would compare my papa


---------58:08----------
and this situation dealing with these


---------58:11----------
last two months the most similar to each


---------58:13----------
other how they feel and a big part of


---------58:15----------
that is because I guess I've kind of


---------58:17----------
taken to like I want to watch horror


---------58:19----------
movies again and you know like scare


---------58:22----------
myself again I don't know how to talk


---------58:26----------
about this okay yeah no I mean I think


---------58:28----------
it's just it's growing that that trees


---------58:30----------
growing that's all so tell me when you


---------58:34----------
say when you say this is the most


---------58:35----------
similar that you felt to I mean this


---------58:37----------
feels the most like when your your Papa


---------58:39----------
died how do you feel right now or over


---------58:41----------
the last


---------58:41----------
or you know how's that been for you well


---------58:46----------
it's really weird um it's really weird I


---------58:49----------
guess it they're not like super similar


---------58:51----------
I would just compare it to that more


---------58:53----------
than the other stuff that I've gone


---------58:55----------
through and you know when my dad died I


---------58:58----------
also was going through my first real


---------59:00----------
break up at the same time like we broke


---------59:02----------
up like just a little bit before so that


---------59:06----------
was very hard so it sounds like this


---------59:09----------
most recent relationship was all coming


---------59:11----------
off the back of a breakup and your dad


---------59:13----------
passing away it was a it was months


---------59:16----------
after but yeah okay okay it was pretty


---------59:18----------
good but can you tell me a little bit


---------59:20----------
about your dad's passing and what that


---------59:22----------
was like for you I was in high school


---------59:27----------
and I actually had just seen him that


---------59:31----------
weekend we my brother and I and he lived


---------59:34----------
where I live now in the town I used to


---------59:36----------
do hours away and we would come up here


---------59:39----------
sometime because to go Disney and stuff


---------59:43----------
and we would stay at his place and I


---------59:50----------
would uh I don't know we have seen this


---------59:55----------
place when we had to spend time together


---------59:57----------
and the last time I see last time I ever


---------59:59----------
saw him was Friday and he died on a


---------60:02----------
Sunday or Monday it was a 16th of


---------60:06----------
October 2017 um and we we had gone to a


---------60:14----------
to a hockey game and like spent the


---------60:17----------
whole weekend together the weekend


---------60:18----------
before and in that weekend Kyle and I


---------60:20----------
went out to go to Disney and he cooked


---------60:21----------
us breakfast and it was really nice and


---------60:24----------
it was really good and I remember


---------60:26----------
feeling like wow my relationship with my


---------60:28----------
dad right now


---------60:29----------
is really good like I feel good and I


---------60:32----------
for a while I actually thought I he's


---------60:35----------
bipolar


---------60:36----------
and I thought I was bipolar as well for


---------60:38----------
a while but I was like nah I'm not


---------60:40----------
bipolar and then now my therapist thinks


---------60:42----------
I might be by anyway that's a good point


---------60:45----------
I was really relating to him based on


---------60:48----------
like how he felt emotionally and we were


---------60:51----------
like having deep talks finally about our


---------60:54----------
emotion


---------60:55----------
um even though you know sometimes he was


---------60:57----------
one time for it he was drunk and I was


---------61:00----------
very uncomfortable about that but


---------61:02----------
whatever after that when he died I


---------61:06----------
remember because I had gone through a


---------61:09----------
breakup right and after the breakup I


---------61:11----------
was like cuz it was a long-distance


---------61:12----------
relationship - so after that breakup I


---------61:15----------
just kind of wanted to go go go go go go


---------61:17----------
go I never want to be home kind of


---------61:19----------
scared of being alone scared of being in


---------61:20----------
my room because that's where we always


---------61:21----------
talked on you know on skype and and so I


---------61:28----------
was dill go go go go for however long it


---------61:31----------
was like a month or two and then mmm


---------61:36----------
when my dad died it was like wolf


---------61:38----------
everything kind of stopped and I didn't


---------61:41----------
have energy to go go go and how did he


---------61:42----------
pass away hypertension and alcoholism


---------61:46----------
was though okay so I didn't fix cutely


---------61:53----------
or was it like do you just he drank


---------61:56----------
himself like he drank his whole life but


---------61:59----------
the thing was he had just gone to the


---------62:01----------
doctor like a few weeks before and got


---------62:04----------
he was bragging everyone like clean bill


---------62:06----------
of health


---------62:06----------
it was seven I mean no sudden we we all


---------62:10----------
kind of we tossed around the idea of


---------62:14----------
like god dad drinks have [ __ ] on and


---------62:16----------
he smokes a fuckton and like you know


---------62:18----------
geez you know but it was sudden I was


---------62:22----------
very I was surprised I guess I knew it


---------62:26----------
would happen but I did not know what


---------62:27----------
happened then I guess what death is you


---------62:30----------
know what's gonna happen but you don't


---------62:31----------
know what Kate can I ask you and sorry


---------62:33----------
if this question is insensitive but if


---------62:34----------
your mom is a lesbian


---------62:36----------
how did your parents get together where


---------62:39----------
did you like so mom was Catholic as well


---------62:50----------
and she was raised that being King is


---------62:52----------
wrong and so she fell in love with my


---------62:54----------
dad and how she describes it is she's


---------62:55----------
not bisexual because I've asked her this


---------62:57----------
question because that's confusing she


---------62:59----------
describes it as um basically she fell in


---------63:02----------
love with my dad who he was as a person


---------63:04----------
but she was always like attracted to


---------63:06----------
women you know what I mean


---------63:08----------
I had sex and they had children but it


---------63:11----------
wasn't until after they got divorced and


---------63:13----------
she actually divorced him because of his


---------63:15----------
alcoholism not because she was lesbian


---------63:16----------
after they got divorced she was like I'm


---------63:20----------
a LESBIAN I'm gonna live my life as a


---------63:21----------
lesbian yeah that I hope that explains


---------63:26----------
just sort of a job and my mom has been


---------63:31----------
wait the same woman


---------63:32----------
dawn who's my second mom for like 10 or


---------63:34----------
11 years now so she's been here for a


---------63:36----------
while and she's is really nice socks


---------63:39----------
going from three parents to two but you


---------63:41----------
know still got to it's okay yeah um okay


---------63:45----------
so you just so how you feeling right now


---------63:52----------
good you you you look like you feel good


---------63:57----------
mm-hmm


---------63:58----------
anything in particular that you want to


---------64:01----------
talk more about no I mean I guess


---------64:10----------
there's a lot of stuff to talk about but


---------64:12----------
I don't know what I don't know is there


---------64:13----------
anything you were like anything that's


---------64:16----------
stuck out to you yeah so let me um let


---------64:20----------
me try to explain how I understand what


---------64:22----------
this conversation has been like because


---------64:23----------
in a sense it's been all over the place


---------64:27----------
yeah and and I think that that's okay so


---------64:30----------
like sometimes you know when we talk to


---------64:32----------
people there's like a particular thing


---------64:33----------
but I think in your case the main theme


---------64:36----------
that I'm getting at is you know this


---------64:39----------
idea of emotional processing and the


---------64:41----------
avoidance of emotions and for us to try


---------64:43----------
to understand that like it's not that


---------64:45----------
your brain is broke and it's just that


---------64:49----------
you know vaginismus I think is one


---------64:51----------
example of emotions being manifested in


---------64:53----------
the body so I talk a lot a lot about


---------64:56----------
this because people don't understand


---------64:57----------
what their emotions are I don't think


---------64:58----------
you understand what your emotions are


---------64:59----------
you know you feel a lot and I think that


---------65:02----------
you're just not ready or capable yet of


---------65:07----------
sitting with what that feeling is and


---------65:10----------
putting words to it but I'm getting the


---------65:13----------
sense that there are large pockets of


---------65:15----------
emotion that have been present through


---------65:18----------
many parts of your life because we'll


---------65:19----------
see you get emotion


---------65:20----------
natira and and like you can you have


---------65:23----------
like stories you have pictures right so


---------65:25----------
it's almost like the way that you


---------65:27----------
describe your life is depersonalization


---------65:31----------
so you can't tell us how you feel but


---------65:34----------
you can paint us a picture of a seven


---------65:38----------
year old girl looking at an


---------65:39----------
apples-to-apples card you can paint us a


---------65:42----------
picture of an eleven year old girl and I


---------65:45----------
know you're feeling things I'm just


---------65:46----------
gonna keep plowing forward okay so so


---------65:49----------
you can paint us a picture of an 11 year


---------65:52----------
old girl who doesn't want to tell their


---------65:55----------
grandfather goodbye and I imagine that


---------65:58----------
you feel some degree of guilt over that


---------66:01----------
you know you can like like there's a lot


---------66:04----------
there's a there's a parent who's who


---------66:06----------
longs for your affection and and you


---------66:09----------
know tried to win you over and you


---------66:10----------
didn't honor that in the way that maybe


---------66:14----------
you should have and so you feel guilt


---------66:16----------
over that and and so you can paint us


---------66:19----------
all these pictures and that's that's I


---------66:20----------
think actually is a really good


---------66:21----------
representation of what your life has


---------66:23----------
been like you don't know exactly what


---------66:25----------
the person in the picture is feeling but


---------66:28----------
you can get as far as yeah death sucks


---------66:30----------
am i right and like that's kind of like


---------66:34----------
where you are right now and I think it's


---------66:36----------
great that you're you know at least you


---------66:38----------
you're accessing them and so it's sort


---------66:40----------
of like I don't know if you've ever been


---------66:42----------
to like a really delicious restaurant


---------66:44----------
where you eat something like you know


---------66:46----------
maybe like really good guac and then


---------66:49----------
like you don't know exactly what's in


---------66:50----------
there but you know it's really delicious


---------66:52----------
and you're like is that a little bit of


---------66:53----------
garlic a little bit of lime a little bit


---------66:55----------
of cilantro is there like some onion


---------66:56----------
powder in there and so and it's like


---------67:03----------
what's in there right what's in there


---------67:06----------
dude exactly and and I what what I'm


---------67:09----------
seeing from you is that you know you


---------67:11----------
you've figured out that like there are


---------67:13----------
emotions in these areas and you can


---------67:15----------
connect to some degree of shame or some


---------67:17----------
degree of being impure I was actually


---------67:19----------
really happy to hear that you know you


---------67:23----------
do have a sense of your goodness and


---------67:25----------
that you can sit with this like


---------67:27----------
dichotomy of like 'hey i can be a piece


---------67:30----------
of [ __ ] sometimes


---------67:31----------
but i'm also like a fundamentally good


---------67:34----------
person


---------67:34----------
or I can believe that about myself but


---------67:37----------
this this experience like with that was


---------67:41----------
so hard I thought I was a bad person for


---------67:43----------
a long time and then in high school I


---------67:45----------
realized like no I'm not I am just


---------67:48----------
emotionally closed off because I thought


---------67:49----------
it was a bad person in the sense that


---------67:51----------
like you know girls that I be friends


---------67:53----------
with would be like your [ __ ] you know


---------67:56----------
you're insensitive cuz I make jokes that


---------67:58----------
were me and or I would just like I was


---------68:02----------
just really bad at expressing my


---------68:03----------
emotions you know and so they thought I


---------68:06----------
came across was really cold like I will


---------68:08----------
never forget there's this one [ __ ]


---------68:10----------
girl


---------68:11----------
I'll never get this she said to me if


---------68:15----------
she said to someone else actually kate


---------68:17----------
has no empathy and that is burn in my


---------68:21----------
head forever especially because god damn


---------68:24----------
it I have held that girl's hair while


---------68:26----------
she threw up no one else would I am so


---------68:29----------
bad at watching people throw up sick but


---------68:30----------
[ __ ] like she would she would throw up


---------68:33----------
and I would hold her hair I've been in


---------68:34----------
like five plus times that [ __ ] dude I


---------68:37----------
have empathy okay I just don't express


---------68:39----------
the same way yeah but yeah I really was


---------68:44----------
a good person later it's officially cuz


---------68:46----------
do you get sick when other people throw


---------68:48----------
up that's an expression of empathy


---------68:52----------
exactly so I think you know as is common


---------68:55----------
is that a lot of people who have you


---------68:59----------
know are emotionally closed off will


---------69:01----------
have physical manifestations of their


---------69:04----------
emotions like vaginismus or like you


---------69:09----------
know sickness in their stomach or like


---------69:11----------
they'll have GI problems or things like


---------69:12----------
that


---------69:13----------
oftentimes but anyway just kind of going


---------69:16----------
back to go ahead sorry I was like


---------69:19----------
Audrina thought and then I got


---------69:20----------
sidetracked by that story oh well I was


---------69:25----------
talking so I was just talking your sense


---------69:27----------
of goodness and I think I were you were


---------69:30----------
kind of thinking about oh yeah this


---------69:31----------
[ __ ] thought that I wasn't a good


---------69:32----------
person but I was because I held her


---------69:34----------
[ __ ] hair while she beaut and how dare


---------69:36----------
she oh there she and I think it's really


---------69:40----------
remarkable that you you do have a sense


---------69:42----------
of goodness because I've met many people


---------69:45----------
who have been through half of


---------69:48----------
what you've been through and they're


---------69:49----------
pretty convinced that there are other


---------69:50----------
pieces of [ __ ] on the inside


---------69:51----------
essentially that that seven-year-old


---------69:53----------
girl in the way that she felt kind of


---------69:55----------
carries with them so I'm kind of curious


---------69:58----------
about really two or three two things


---------70:01----------
then I can offer a couple of other


---------70:02----------
topics one is like the one emotion it's


---------70:06----------
kind of interesting you know there's one


---------70:07----------
emotion that I think has been very very


---------70:09----------
absent over the course of our entire


---------70:10----------
conversation and I'm kind of curious if


---------70:13----------
twitch chat can figure out what it is


---------70:15----------
I'm gonna look at twitch chat is that


---------70:17----------
okay let's see what they say


---------70:20----------
okay ah beautiful they got it right away


---------70:27----------
yeah that's so good twitch chat I'm very


---------70:34----------
impressed because it's usually the


---------70:35----------
emotion that we see the most stuff


---------70:36----------
actually on this stream yeah I do not I


---------70:39----------
do not I'm not at all yeah so that's not


---------70:44----------
how we work right so so so let me just


---------70:51----------
like I was oh my god wait that's


---------70:54----------
important actually could I tell you


---------70:55----------
brothers really quick sure


---------70:57----------
I was like terrible I was a terrible kid


---------71:00----------
really really bad angry outbursts like a


---------71:03----------
lot a lot of really angry outbursts like


---------71:06----------
I would just have these meltdowns just


---------71:08----------
like don't talk to me yeah like really


---------71:10----------
terrible when I was a kid but then they


---------71:12----------
just went away like I don't feel him


---------71:13----------
anymore I feel I think I don't know I


---------71:17----------
mean I get angry sometimes but I think


---------71:19----------
I'm good at expressing my anger in a way


---------71:21----------
that's not angry did that make sense


---------71:24----------
sure but do you feel anger sometimes


---------71:28----------
yeah but I just feel anger about any of


---------71:31----------
this stuff because it's just sad okay so


---------71:38----------
you know not I mean different people


---------71:41----------
experience different levels of emotion I


---------71:43----------
feel anger towards that girl who [ __ ]


---------71:45----------
I see that there we go


---------71:47----------
yeah and and so far you know if I want


---------71:51----------
to ask a cut like so here's the first


---------71:53----------
thing so let's just think about this for


---------71:54----------
a second so you say that I don't really


---------71:55----------
feel angry and sure you have anger bits


---------71:57----------
of anger here and there but generally


---------71:59----------
speaking I think that you know some


---------72:01----------
people


---------72:02----------
certain emotions more than other


---------72:03----------
emotions and and it just seems like


---------72:06----------
there's a remarkable absence of anger in


---------72:09----------
so much of what you're saying like I


---------72:11----------
know this sounds kind of weird but


---------72:12----------
oftentimes children who have parents who


---------72:15----------
die or angry at their parent for dying


---------72:18----------
it's not logical but it's oftentimes how


---------72:24----------
people feel you know oftentimes people


---------72:28----------
who end up in relationships where they


---------72:30----------
feel stuck which it sounds like you felt


---------72:34----------
stuck and we're not saying that that


---------72:35----------
justifies anything that you did or


---------72:37----------
didn't do but oftentimes people will


---------72:39----------
feel anger towards the person who keeps


---------72:41----------
them stuck or they will feel anger


---------72:44----------
towards themselves I'm curious do you


---------72:48----------
feel anger towards your ex-boyfriend or


---------72:51----------
towards yourself towards myself


---------72:53----------
sometimes that that's been really really


---------72:56----------
hard I wanted to talk to you about that


---------72:57----------
that's been really hard over the past


---------72:58----------
two months like dealing with cuz I dealt


---------73:01----------
with trauma before but dealing with when


---------73:04----------
my dad died and my boyfriend broke up


---------73:06----------
with me


---------73:06----------
you kind of know how to deal with that


---------73:09----------
stuff you know like okay this [ __ ]


---------73:12----------
happened to me I didn't do anything


---------73:13----------
wrong I just have to sit and be sad and


---------73:15----------
I can do whatever I want with that


---------73:17----------
sadness with those emotions people


---------73:19----------
understand what I'm going through I just


---------73:19----------
lost a parent you know like it was hard


---------73:22----------
but this is so different because I


---------73:27----------
[ __ ] up I made the bad decisions I'm


---------73:30----------
the bad guy I'm the villain here there's


---------73:33----------
no way that this story can make me be


---------73:37----------
the good guy I'm the bad guy here you


---------73:39----------
know and and um I guess that's just so


---------73:45----------
been so hard to deal with and it's been


---------73:47----------
it's really hard to grapple with being


---------73:49----------
angry with myself because I think I've


---------73:50----------
always been really good at loving myself


---------73:53----------
throughout everything pretty much also


---------73:55----------
skill you level out by the way hmm


---------73:57----------
also a skill do you leveled up by the


---------73:59----------
way yeah definitely yeah I think I'm


---------74:02----------
very confident and good with myself


---------74:04----------
which is good


---------74:05----------
it's real you know I'm very proud of


---------74:08----------
myself for levelling it up but I felt


---------74:13----------
like cuz I guess


---------74:15----------
you go through all this trauma and


---------74:17----------
you're bad at expressing it the person


---------74:19----------
that you feel like is always there for


---------74:21----------
you the only person you feel like you


---------74:22----------
can trust is you and so I guess I just


---------74:24----------
gained a lot of confidence in myself in


---------74:26----------
my kid I can teach myself can you tell


---------74:32----------
us how you leveled up your self-love


---------74:36----------
because I think that's something a lot


---------74:37----------
of people struggle with I remember when


---------74:43----------
I was in middle school and I really


---------74:44----------
really was dealing with it I think I


---------74:45----------
just like kids just looked at me like I


---------74:48----------
was weird you know they were not very


---------74:50----------
nice to me and it was hard for a while


---------74:53----------
and I really didn't like myself for a


---------74:54----------
while but then the way I did it was just


---------74:57----------
fake it to you make it I just it's


---------74:59----------
really like I just acted like I used


---------75:03----------
instead of using self-deprecating humor


---------75:06----------
I've always been a very person you know


---------75:08----------
comedy focused person so I always abused


---------75:11----------
jokes and humor to cope with stuff and


---------75:13----------
whatever as you can see obviously it's


---------75:15----------
looking a lot but I was I would um make


---------75:22----------
jokes about how I was the best make


---------75:25----------
jokes about how I'm the [ __ ] you know


---------75:27----------
and maybe that's not the best way to go


---------75:29----------
about it but eventually it's like when


---------75:33----------
people when you force people to view you


---------75:36----------
as confident by telling them you're


---------75:40----------
confident then you become confident and


---------75:44----------
that was probably not the best way to go


---------75:47----------
about it but I think it was a


---------75:49----------
combination of that and trust in myself


---------75:51----------
after dealing with so much [ __ ] that I


---------75:54----------
can always get through it and I have the


---------75:57----------
power to get through this and I don't


---------76:02----------
know that explains it very well yeah


---------76:04----------
sorry I think how did you develop the


---------76:06----------
trust in yourself that you're gonna get


---------76:08----------
through it


---------76:11----------
experience not like just I have so


---------76:17----------
I thought I can get behind yeah cool so


---------76:24----------
you were saying something about anger


---------76:27----------
towards yourself because you are at


---------76:28----------
fault here so in the past I survived so


---------76:32----------
just to kind of catch people up so


---------76:34----------
here's what I remember the frame of the


---------76:36----------
conversation so in the past you've been


---------76:38----------
able to get through it because you


---------76:40----------
recognize that like this wasn't your


---------76:42----------
fault this was just bad [ __ ] happening


---------76:43----------
to you and you've survived it before so


---------76:46----------
you're you can survive it again but this


---------76:48----------
time it's different because it's not bad


---------76:50----------
[ __ ] happening to you it's you you're


---------76:52----------
the villain and so it's not the same


---------76:55----------
[ __ ] yeah it's really it's been so hard


---------77:02----------
to deal with


---------77:03----------
not that I what's been hard to deal with


---------77:06----------
I guess going through something really


---------77:12----------
hard but I'm not the victim you know


---------77:17----------
does that make sense yeah makes a lot of


---------77:19----------
sense um so I think what's hard about


---------77:24----------
going through something when you're not


---------77:25----------
the victim very impressive by the way


---------77:29----------
that your psychology has not done some


---------77:31----------
sort of mental gymnastics to make you


---------77:33----------
the victim that's usually what people do


---------77:35----------
seriously I'm not that's not a joke it's


---------77:37----------
like yeah no I'm not I'm not victim um


---------77:43----------
the hardest part is definitely the hurt


---------77:47----------
I put these people I care about through


---------77:50----------
cuz I care so much about the people that


---------77:54----------
I hurt and yet I still did it and


---------77:58----------
getting wrapping your head around that


---------78:00----------
and just to regret and the hindsight is


---------78:05----------
twenty-twenty you know looking back and


---------78:07----------
thinking god I [ __ ] could have done


---------78:09----------
it differently and I didn't and just


---------78:13----------
kind of it's easy to be upset with


---------78:16----------
yourself it's easy to hate yourself it's


---------78:19----------
easy to not trust yourself because no


---------78:25----------
one else can so why should you you know


---------78:28----------
and and it was really hard because I had


---------78:30----------
been


---------78:30----------
one there from me the whole time they


---------78:32----------
cut through all my whole life and now am


---------78:35----------
I even there for me anymore like do I


---------78:37----------
even love myself anymore do I even trust


---------78:40----------
myself anymore you know and and that was


---------78:43----------
the main thing I struggled with I'd say


---------78:47----------
struggled yeah you use the past tense


---------78:50----------
for that so have you come to summit yeah


---------78:53----------
I have forgiven myself it was like


---------78:58----------
everyone else around me had to forgive


---------79:00----------
me and I did too which was weird


---------79:04----------
that was something I never dealt with


---------79:05----------
before I thought I'd die I'd deal with


---------79:07----------
but I you forgive yourself understanding


---------79:13----------
what did you learn why and that I won't


---------79:19----------
do it again I think that's the biggest


---------79:21----------
thing I having confidence that I won't


---------79:26----------
do it again is the thing that helped me


---------79:29----------
forgive myself the most and I have that


---------79:33----------
confidence now where does that


---------79:34----------
confidence come from understanding why


---------79:39----------
don't you understand why I did it and


---------79:43----------
whatever lots of things um feeling stuck


---------79:53----------
not communicating my feelings not


---------79:56----------
processing what I was feeling choosing


---------79:59----------
to push that away and now I'm making a


---------80:04----------
point to be brutally honest which not


---------80:06----------
option but you know my therapist says


---------80:08----------
it's like a pendulum so when you when


---------80:10----------
you have so much force and resistance


---------80:12----------
one way and you're like [ __ ] I'm lying


---------80:14----------
about [ __ ] all the time and then you


---------80:15----------
just you'll you know swing the other way


---------80:18----------
so right now I'm in a more of a brutal


---------80:21----------
honest kind of area where I want to I


---------80:24----------
over communicate which is I'm trying to


---------80:27----------
work on finding a balance sure right now


---------80:30----------
I don't know why I was asking you you


---------80:35----------
know what why did you do what you do and


---------80:38----------
what did you understand about yourself


---------80:39----------
and so tell say you felt stuck


---------80:43----------
yeah I felt I don't stuck I felt I felt


---------80:56----------
pulled a lot of things but but no anger


---------81:02----------
anger towards myself I guess it's like


---------81:06----------
the anger I feel is very like God okay


---------81:12----------
you're such an idiot but then when I


---------81:14----------
feel anger a lot of times I'm able to


---------81:16----------
just like feel it for a second I just


---------81:17----------
kind of laugh about it okay okay cuz


---------81:23----------
it's like [ __ ] I'm a dumb [ __ ] like I


---------81:26----------
[ __ ] up holy [ __ ] but you know


---------81:30----------
sometimes you have to laugh at yourself


---------81:32----------
you know [ __ ] stupid you are


---------81:34----------
sometimes yes or anything that's


---------81:37----------
important I think um you know I'm


---------81:39----------
noticing something that I think is maybe


---------81:41----------
where your confidence comes from I think


---------81:43----------
you own who you are yeah yeah I accepted


---------81:50----------
I guess I accepted that I was a liar I


---------81:55----------
accepted these labels I accepted that I


---------81:58----------
was a liar that I was a cheater I


---------81:59----------
accepted that I did not prioritize


---------82:02----------
anyone but myself even if I didn't do it


---------82:06----------
from a malicious place my the outcome


---------82:09----------
hurt people very badly I accepted those


---------82:12----------
things and I accepted that I did it and


---------82:16----------
accepting that and accept it I'm able to


---------82:20----------
forgive myself because I didn't push the


---------82:22----------
blame onto anyone or anything else


---------82:24----------
except for me and accepting that blame


---------82:29----------
makes it easier to move on because it's


---------82:34----------
it's like the restores balance I suppose


---------82:37----------
yeah I think that's a very very


---------82:39----------
important principle which is that if you


---------82:42----------
you know if you blame I don't even know


---------82:48----------
how exactly it says but if you blame


---------82:49----------
someone else for your problems you first


---------82:53----------
of all aren't in control of your life


---------82:55----------
because it's there


---------82:56----------
fault not yours and the other


---------82:59----------
interesting thing is that if you make


---------83:00----------
excuses for yourself or other people


---------83:03----------
then you can't forgive because if


---------83:05----------
there's an excuse there isn't a sin and


---------83:08----------
if there isn't a sin


---------83:10----------
there's no capacity for forgiveness so I


---------83:13----------
think of a big problem that I hear a lot


---------83:15----------
from our community is that like how they


---------83:17----------
asked like how do I commit I mean how do


---------83:19----------
I forgive myself how do i more and how


---------83:22----------
do I move past this and the first


---------83:24----------
problem is that they make excuses and so


---------83:27----------
if I make an excuse like there's nothing


---------83:29----------
to move past from because there's it's


---------83:31----------
not my fault there's no need to accept


---------83:33----------
who you are and it's a really powerful


---------83:36----------
thing to stop making excuses for


---------83:38----------
yourself and also a very hard thing


---------83:41----------
because a lot of times making it not


---------83:43----------
making excuses for yourself is to let


---------83:46----------
that part of you that feels like you're


---------83:47----------
tainted take control and then beat the


---------83:50----------
[ __ ] out of you which is not the same


---------83:52----------
it's a really fine tightrope to you know


---------83:56----------
not let your shame take over but like


---------83:58----------
let it have a seat at the table because


---------83:59----------
a lot of times what people will do is


---------84:01----------
they're like I'm a piece of [ __ ] and


---------84:02----------
then they start like this whole like


---------84:03----------
rant about how they're awful people and


---------84:05----------
that's not mourning or acceptance that's


---------84:08----------
just you ranting yeah I guess the reason


---------84:12----------
I'm not angry with myself anymore the


---------84:13----------
reason I don't blame my I mean I blame


---------84:15----------
myself but you know the reason I'm not I


---------84:18----------
understand myself and I think I think I


---------84:21----------
learned that especially in the past in


---------84:25----------
the past month specifically I deserve


---------84:29----------
understanding just as much as everyone


---------84:31----------
else does the understanding that I give


---------84:33----------
to my friends when they come to me about


---------84:35----------
a problem or a mistake they made the


---------84:37----------
understanding I give to people in the


---------84:39----------
internet who make mistakes the


---------84:41----------
understanding you get to anyone when


---------84:43----------
they are honest and vulnerable with you


---------84:46----------
I deserve that too and I deserve to give


---------84:49----------
myself that and I think by allowing


---------84:52----------
myself to understand myself it was a lot


---------84:54----------
easier for me to move on from it do you


---------84:56----------
deserve forgiveness from others maybe


---------84:59----------
not I think that's a person-by-person


---------85:01----------
you know I think that's up to everyone


---------85:03----------
to decide that's a good like oh yeah I


---------85:09----------
think


---------85:10----------
I have a lot of friends that I lost


---------85:11----------
through who will never forgive me and


---------85:13----------
that was awful like people that I love


---------85:18----------
love now will never talk to me again um


---------85:23----------
but that's okay


---------85:25----------
it's consequences like people people


---------85:28----------
from my life outside you know who had


---------85:30----------
nothing to do with twitch not my


---------85:31----------
roommate so here it's been wonderful but


---------85:34----------
other people like I one of my best


---------85:39----------
closest friends there were two weeks


---------85:41----------
where he didn't even talk to me now


---------85:42----------
since then we have become very very


---------85:45----------
close but and not like that I know


---------85:48----------
there's like a joke like no it's not but


---------85:54----------
um but I I think there's just so much


---------86:00----------
loss in such little time of respect for


---------86:04----------
myself from other people


---------86:06----------
I felt like my job was gone my so many


---------86:10----------
my you know longest relationship was


---------86:12----------
over my other relationships were gone


---------86:14----------
like so much loss and the biggest one


---------86:16----------
was the loss of respect for myself and


---------86:18----------
love for myself but I gained it back and


---------86:20----------
I feel good now and I accepted that I'm


---------86:25----------
the reason I lost those things and I can


---------86:28----------
gain them back if I want to strong words


---------86:34----------
Thanks I kind of feel like that's a


---------86:42----------
that's a good place to end but what are


---------86:44----------
you yeah no no yeah we can do whatever


---------86:47----------
you want no it's just a you know I


---------86:51----------
really liked what you said there because


---------86:53----------
it's sort of like so I like that you


---------86:55----------
don't feel like you're entitled to


---------86:57----------
anyone elses forgiveness because I don't


---------86:59----------
think you are I think it's fair to


---------87:02----------
expect others to try to understand and


---------87:06----------
and we've had there's it's interesting


---------87:08----------
because I remember actually we had a


---------87:10----------
stream with this guy named LS now a


---------87:12----------
couple of months ago and there was this


---------87:14----------
one point where he was kind of sharing


---------87:16----------
so he he would he was like bad as a kid


---------87:18----------
and would like I think he was like in


---------87:20----------
court or something as a child


---------87:22----------
and I don't remember the exact or maybe


---------87:25----------
it was a school like tribunal or


---------87:27----------
something and then everyone was kind of


---------87:29----------
trying to figure out like what to do in


---------87:31----------
terms of punishing him and then there


---------87:33----------
was only like one person in the room who


---------87:35----------
was like we need to be asking ourselves


---------87:37----------
why this kid is doing this [ __ ] in the


---------87:39----------
first place because people don't usually


---------87:42----------
do this and and I think a lot of people


---------87:45----------
are very quick to judge and I'm not


---------87:47----------
saying that people should not judge I'm


---------87:50----------
not saying you're entitled to


---------87:52----------
forgiveness but I do think the world


---------87:53----------
would be a far better place if along


---------87:56----------
with our judgment we tried a dose of


---------87:57----------
understanding and and I think it's it's


---------88:01----------
a really tricky I mean you really walk


---------88:02----------
in a tightrope Kate which makes me think


---------88:04----------
that you're you really have grown and


---------88:07----------
and I respect you because you don't


---------88:08----------
believe that you deserve forgiveness


---------88:10----------
from other people because you don't no


---------88:13----------
one deserves forgiveness forgiveness is


---------88:15----------
for someone else to give if they want to


---------88:17----------
you're not entitled to [ __ ] from anyone


---------88:19----------
else when it comes to forgiveness


---------88:22----------
and and I do think you should try to


---------88:25----------
forgive yourself but that too is not


---------88:27----------
something you're entitled to myself yeah


---------88:34----------
I see that that that's abundantly clear


---------88:35----------
to me and you know just in terms of you


---------88:40----------
know so I I know that there are concerns


---------88:41----------
about how the internet feels about you I


---------88:43----------
have no idea what's gonna happen after


---------88:45----------
this and I hope that you know you they


---------88:48----------
don't attack is fine I hope they don't


---------88:51----------
take you guys I mean hasn't happened yet


---------88:55----------
but I'm sure it will one day knock on


---------88:58----------
boys and and you know if you do kind of


---------89:03----------
struggle from some of this stuff from


---------89:04----------
from time to time then then or if


---------89:07----------
there's some kind of aftermath and we


---------89:09----------
can support you through that feel free


---------89:10----------
to let us know but overall I think it's


---------89:15----------
been awesome talking to you I think it


---------89:16----------
was awesome that you shared as much as


---------89:18----------
you did about so many different things


---------89:24----------
so sometimes I teach people how to


---------89:26----------
meditate are you interested in that


---------89:28----------
yeah I when I have panic


---------89:31----------
axé I meditate I meditation kind of yeah


---------89:37----------
I can see that


---------89:38----------
so in a sense I actually already taught


---------89:41----------
you a technique do you have a sense of


---------89:42----------
what I'm talking about


---------89:44----------
No so like when I was asking you to look


---------89:47----------
at the Oh Cup and I don't know if you


---------89:51----------
noticed but I think your your more


---------89:53----------
emotionally accessible and you're able


---------89:55----------
to articulate sometimes a little bit


---------89:57----------
better when you're looking at the cup


---------90:01----------
and and maybe that's just my perception


---------90:03----------
but so I'd say maybe well so I'd


---------90:07----------
recommend a sensory technique for you


---------90:09----------
because it sounds like you do those


---------90:10----------
already let me think


---------90:18----------
what's funny what's funny about it


---------90:27----------
it's me it's my buddy you know it helps


---------90:32----------
it helps me out what come to you are you


---------90:38----------
drinking green I just got this like


---------90:41----------
really nice authentic Japanese green tea


---------90:44----------
leaves unusual good let me just think


---------90:49----------
what are we gonna teach you in terms of


---------90:52----------
meditation what do you what do you want


---------90:54----------
- is there something in particular they


---------90:56----------
want to get better at or learn there's


---------91:00----------
so much I want to get better at and


---------91:01----------
learn holy [ __ ] um toss a couple things


---------91:05----------
out there well honesty is a big one


---------91:08----------
communication I think I'm getting really


---------91:11----------
good at those though I think I'm getting


---------91:13----------
really good at being honest and


---------91:14----------
communicating and I think something else


---------91:17----------
I really want to get good at is uh


---------91:21----------
processing my emotions you know like


---------91:23----------
really really thinking about what I feel


---------91:26----------
why I feel it and expressing those


---------91:30----------
emotions to other people I have a really


---------91:31----------
hard time with that and I'm getting


---------91:33----------
better but okay that's that's a big one


---------91:35----------
um I want to get better at not be


---------91:40----------
personalizing because that that's it's


---------91:43----------
it just makes life feel so


---------91:46----------
dull you know like you don't remember


---------91:49----------
half of the like alright the last six


---------91:52----------
months I mean it's not that I don't


---------91:54----------
remember it but it's it just feels like


---------91:57----------
looking back at it feels like like it


---------92:02----------
feels different


---------92:02----------
you know that make sense sure so I think


---------92:06----------
we're gonna try to build on I'm gonna


---------92:08----------
give you a focus but I think let's build


---------92:10----------
on your teacup because your teacup is


---------92:12----------
your buddy it's your tea couple of help


---------92:13----------
you the only thing that I'm struggling a


---------92:16----------
little bit with is sometimes I ask


---------92:20----------
people to meditate along basically to


---------92:23----------
have our viewers meditate along I think


---------92:25----------
it's gonna be a little bit trickier


---------92:26----------
because I'm gonna ask you a couple of


---------92:29----------
specific questions which they're not


---------92:30----------
gonna it's not gonna apply to them so


---------92:33----------
what I'd like you to do is sit up


---------92:35----------
straight and actually refill your teacup


---------92:39----------
but don't drink it yet


---------92:40----------
and will also give people actually I'm


---------92:43----------
gonna run to the restroom and I want


---------92:44----------
everyone else to grab a sensory object


---------92:47----------
that they can look at and or something


---------92:52----------
that they can drink or eat preferably


---------92:55----------
drink so something that you can take a


---------92:57----------
sip of that has flavor


---------92:59----------
well it doesn't need flavor and then


---------93:02----------
grab a sensory object that you can look


---------93:05----------
at that as a lot of well yeah yeah we're


---------93:13----------
gonna meditate together yeah so why


---------93:18----------
don't you guys grab that Oh we'll just


---------93:19----------
take a really quick break I'm gonna run


---------93:21----------
to the restroom and then we'll get


---------93:22----------

---------93:23----------
camera turn off the camera while you


---------93:27----------

---------93:29----------

---------93:36----------

---------93:42----------

---------96:05----------
i doing something wrong


---------96:19----------
I think she returneth hello hello


---------96:34----------
[Music]


---------96:39----------
alright so okay so what I want you to do


---------96:47----------
so we're gonna go ahead and begin so I


---------96:48----------
want everyone do is sit up straight so


---------96:56----------
you you I noticed you sit with your


---------96:59----------
knees up I want you to just pause for a


---------97:04----------
second close your eyes unless you feel


---------97:05----------
vulnerable again and I want you to feel


---------97:09----------
the curvature of your back yeah is it a


---------97:14----------
hand


---------97:15----------
no no just with your sense of self and


---------97:19----------
then then what I want you to do I don't


---------97:21----------
know if you can do this or not but


---------97:23----------
you're sitting cross-legged or yes okay


---------97:26----------
I want you to take so when you sit


---------97:28----------
cross-legged and what I want you to do


---------97:33----------
is take your is which of your legs is on


---------97:37----------
top is your left leg on top of your


---------97:38----------
right leg on top okay so I want you to


---------97:42----------
take your right ankle and I want you to


---------97:44----------
put it if you can above your left hip


---------97:50----------
like it's all the way up uh-huh yeah now


---------97:55----------
what happened to your back when you did


---------97:56----------
that it straightened weird huh okay good


---------98:00----------
so can you hold that for a little bit


---------98:02----------
good so now what I'm gonna ask you to do


---------98:07----------
is so I'm gonna ask you a couple of


---------98:11----------
questions and essentially what this


---------98:12----------
technique is gonna be is I want you to


---------98:14----------
pick the focus of your what you're gonna


---------98:18----------
look at okay and it's place your focus


---------98:20----------
in front of you and then I'm going to


---------98:22----------
ask you to evoke an emotional memory


---------98:25----------
okay yeah I'll tell you which one pick


---------98:29----------
but for people at home so just like


---------98:32----------
think about a


---------98:33----------
point in your life that was emotional


---------98:34----------
and then as you what we're gonna do is


---------98:38----------
you may experience feelings and try to


---------98:41----------
like work through that memory and if the


---------98:44----------
feelings get to be too much or they feel


---------98:46----------
overwhelming and you can't separate them


---------98:49----------
out I want you to focus on on the object


---------98:52----------
that you're looking at and as you stare


---------98:54----------
at that object start to process those


---------98:58----------
feelings and explore them further


---------98:59----------
because as you so the reason that things


---------99:03----------
feel overwhelming is because you're


---------99:05----------
getting a flood of emotions all at once


---------99:07----------
and when you direct your attention


---------99:09----------
towards an external object your


---------99:12----------
attention is not looking at the


---------99:13----------
overwhelming amount of feelings anymore


---------99:15----------
and so what it does is narrows the


---------99:17----------
spectrum of what's overwhelming you two


---------99:20----------
things that is then gonna be under


---------99:21----------
hopefully understandable as long as you


---------99:23----------
keep your attention on the cop does that


---------99:26----------
make sense that makes any sense but okay


---------99:28----------
so I want you to think about your your


---------99:31----------
papà being in the hospital okay okay and


---------99:37----------
think a little bit about you know


---------99:40----------
they're there they're coming to tell you


---------99:42----------
that you know it's time to say goodbye


---------99:45----------
and maybe you should come and say


---------99:47----------
goodbye and everyone's taking their


---------99:49----------
turns and think a little bit about how


---------99:51----------
you felt when that was coming and


---------99:55----------
everyone was kind of going in and out


---------99:57----------
and then they came to you and they said


---------100:01----------
what you can answer um they just told me


---------100:07----------
to go hold his hand and think about how


---------100:12----------
you felt when they said that what did


---------100:16----------
you feel hmm it says in denial that's


---------100:24----------
not a feeling that's you reflecting back


---------100:31----------
what what did you feel like doing when


---------100:39----------
they said come hold his hand


---------100:45----------
as I felt scared right so so good you're


---------100:50----------
doing it so like you're looking at the


---------100:52----------
cop and and so you've identified an


---------100:54----------
emotion which sort of as like obvious in


---------100:58----------
retrospect but like you you it's the I


---------101:00----------
felt like running away that's the


---------101:02----------
experience of the emotion it's not a


---------101:04----------
hypothesis it's not like an analysis I


---------101:08----------
was in denial no you weren't in denial


---------101:10----------
you were afraid mm-hmm right and and


---------101:14----------
what were you running away from what


---------101:17----------
would have happened if you had gone into


---------101:18----------
the room and held his hand I'd have had


---------101:22----------
to say goodbye and I'd have to let my


---------101:28----------
family see me in an emotional state and


---------101:32----------
you didn't want them to see you that way


---------101:34----------
why not because I want to be viewed as


---------101:39----------
strong and I have trouble being


---------101:45----------
vulnerable emotionally with people so


---------101:48----------
we're getting into analysis but good so


---------101:51----------
I want to be feeling strong no that's


---------101:53----------
okay so I'm gonna point these out to you


---------101:55----------
right so do you see the difference


---------101:56----------
between I want to be few too strong


---------101:59----------
that's from in here that's wrong and


---------102:02----------
then there's the analysis on top can you


---------102:05----------
tell the difference between those two


---------102:06----------
things


---------102:07----------
right one is like it's like a raw


---------102:09----------
feeling of like I want to run away I


---------102:11----------
want to be viewed a particular way and


---------102:13----------
then you can dig into that you know the


---------102:15----------
why and the how and the what with your


---------102:17----------
therapist do you want to continue


---------102:23----------
exploring pretty good okay so just tell


---------102:26----------
me what else so what did you say to that


---------102:29----------
when they said come to Edison skip


---------102:32----------
saying no I'm okay


---------102:33----------
I don't want it and how are you feeling


---------102:36----------
each time they said hey it's it's time


---------102:43----------
soon any I wanted them to ask me again


---------102:48----------
because I wanted to say


---------102:51----------
and what kept you from saying yes I


---------102:54----------
scared of what


---------103:00----------
saying goodbye why did you want to say


---------103:06----------
yes because I knew I had to say goodbye


---------103:10----------
I didn't want to close your eyes sit


---------103:20----------
with those feelings


---------103:25----------
what are you feeling you can describe a


---------103:29----------
physical sensation if that's easier said


---------103:44----------
regretful did you say goodbye no want to


---------103:52----------
give it a shot right now


---------103:57----------
no I think I think I did it over the


---------104:02----------
years in a way yes oh I don't think


---------104:06----------
you're ready yet so what I saw there was


---------104:09----------
fear did you feel it came up again like


---------104:14----------
you open your eyes they flashed open


---------104:16----------
yeah there it is yeah that was fear


---------104:22----------
right hmm I asked you do you want to say


---------104:25----------
goodbye and what did you feel


---------104:26----------
there absolutely you're not right to


---------104:29----------
take advice but you absolutely have to


---------104:31----------
when you're ready but I don't think that


---------104:35----------
he needs to you don't need you can still


---------104:37----------
say goodbye when you're ready that makes


---------104:40----------
sense yeah yep yes all right so now you


---------104:47----------
get to drink your tea and just taste it


---------104:49----------
for a moment so before you do this


---------104:50----------
before you taste it actually I want you


---------104:52----------
to just as you taste it recognize that


---------104:55----------
everything that you just felt is just a


---------105:00----------
piece of you and in a weird way I want


---------105:02----------
you to try to deeper


---------105:03----------
and lies a little bit as you taste the


---------105:06----------
tea just notice what's real and anchor


---------105:11----------
yourself in the reality of the taste of


---------105:14----------
the tea


---------105:26----------
refreshing yeah and where is the fear


---------105:30----------
where's the fear of saying goodbye not


---------105:33----------
there okay where'd it go I drank it it's


---------105:46----------
weird huh so that that's okay


---------105:48----------
so I feel like this was way easier than


---------105:52----------
I was expecting it to be I don't know if


---------105:54----------
hey I don't know because I mean I I


---------105:56----------
think you know we access some very real


---------105:58----------
emotion especially when I asked you you


---------106:00----------
know are you do you want to say goodbye


---------106:03----------
now not like you saw at least I can see


---------106:06----------
it but I think you did a really good job


---------106:08----------
because I think you you you know by


---------106:11----------
focusing on the cop oddly you managed to


---------106:13----------
uncover a couple of things which are


---------106:16----------
sort of like obvious but like you know


---------106:18----------
the fact that the way that other that


---------106:20----------
your parents perceive you or your family


---------106:21----------
perceives you like that's been important


---------106:23----------
to you you know there's a lot of


---------106:26----------
actually really important stuff there to


---------106:28----------
explore further and I think about


---------106:30----------
meditation is like sort of a compliment


---------106:32----------
to therapy it's not necessarily a


---------106:34----------
substitute and a couple of things to


---------106:37----------
further explore ideally with your


---------106:38----------
therapist or on your own through


---------106:40----------
meditation or however you want to do it


---------106:42----------
one is this idea that you wanted them to


---------106:44----------
keeps asking right and there was a part


---------106:49----------
of you that did want to say goodbye or


---------106:51----------
not that want is not the right word


---------106:53----------
there's a part of you that still knows


---------106:55----------
that you need to say goodbye but that


---------106:58----------
you absolutely don't want to and when I


---------107:02----------
think when I when it comes to you know


---------107:05----------
all of the emotions that float around


---------107:06----------
and guide your behavior and trigger your


---------107:08----------
depersonalization it's now I'm actually


---------107:10----------
going to teach you something that will


---------107:11----------
help you okay so as long as you're


---------107:13----------
carrying around this fear of saying


---------107:19----------
goodbye to your grandfather your


---------107:22----------
threshold to D personalized is going to


---------107:25----------
be higher a [ __ ] sorry lower so I want


---------107:28----------
you to think about depersonalization is


---------107:31----------
like a bar like a debuff bar that fills


---------107:34----------
up and if it fills up all the way then


---------107:37----------
you D personalized yeah


---------107:39----------
this stuff around your grandfather is


---------107:41----------
like it like fills up your bar at 20% so


---------107:45----------
all you need to get is 80% to tip over


---------107:48----------
into depersonalization it's like a 20%


---------107:51----------
fills up your you know your poison meter


---------107:54----------
or whatever and like after a certain


---------107:55----------
amount then you get poisoned yeah yeah


---------107:59----------
so so this is why it's important for you


---------108:02----------
to let go of this stuff because you know


---------108:04----------
I I don't oh I don't think that's saying


---------108:08----------
goodbye is gonna be nearly as bad as you


---------108:10----------
think it is yeah and I think that in a


---------108:13----------
bizarre way saying goodbye is going to


---------108:17----------
be a way for you to actually reconnect


---------108:19----------
with your Papa but I don't think it's I


---------108:25----------
don't think you can understand that


---------108:26----------
until you do it yeah yeah I think you're


---------108:33----------
right I think I anything goodbye is


---------108:38----------
necessary and I will yeah I guess it's


---------108:43----------
just hard your loss is so hard to deal


---------108:47----------
with like in general not just people


---------108:49----------
dying yep it's really hard to deal with


---------108:56----------
you look spent yeah yeah it's kind of


---------109:02----------
tiring to talk about your emotions for a


---------109:05----------
while yeah yeah cool any questions for


---------109:13----------
you before you wrap up for the day no I


---------109:15----------
just want to say thank you so much like


---------109:17----------
this has been a really cool experience


---------109:20----------
you have a really cool way of delving


---------109:22----------
into people's brains and I feel really


---------109:24----------
good and I'm glad I came on so thank you


---------109:26----------
very much you're very welcome and thank


---------109:28----------
you for coming on because I think um you


---------109:32----------
know I I think the whole point of this


---------109:35----------
is it's not me that's doing it right


---------109:37----------
it's you or us and and you know talking


---------109:42----------
about things like I'm really happy that


---------109:44----------
you know we had a chance to talk about


---------109:45----------
something like vaginismus because that's


---------109:47----------
one of these problems that like people


---------109:49----------
just go their entire life but


---------109:51----------
that they're broken and and let me just


---------109:53----------
say this to you guys if you feel


---------109:56----------
fundamentally broken in some way shape


---------109:59----------
or form about your body your mind your


---------110:01----------
being your worth as a human being you


---------110:03----------
should definitely go talk to probably


---------110:06----------
actually start with a doctor because the


---------110:09----------
number of things that make people feel


---------110:11----------
like they're not like other people and


---------110:13----------
that they feel like they're


---------110:14----------
fundamentally broken so here's the


---------110:16----------
really cool thing decent chance that


---------110:19----------
some kind of doctors somewhere can


---------110:20----------
actually help you with that [ __ ] and


---------110:22----------
then you don't have to be broken anymore


---------110:25----------
but the problem is that you never tell


---------110:28----------
anyone about it because you feel so


---------110:29----------
shamed because of how broken you weren't


---------110:31----------
on the inside and sometimes that stuff


---------110:33----------
is like actually physical like you know


---------110:35----------
you can get treatments for all kinds of


---------110:39----------
stuff I had a guy one one time who had


---------110:42----------
gone his entire life with skin sound


---------110:46----------
kind of it's gross but like basically


---------110:49----------
anal leakage


---------110:50----------
and he just yeah it sucks because he


---------110:54----------
would just you know and and like that


---------110:59----------
[ __ ] got fixed in his life was different


---------111:01----------
afterward and so he just thought he was


---------111:04----------
an incompetent human being because like


---------111:06----------
people don't go around [ __ ]


---------111:08----------
themselves and he does so like he's a


---------111:09----------
piece of [ __ ] sort of makes sense no pun


---------111:12----------
intended and and you know like so get


---------111:15----------
stuff checked out like even if you think


---------111:17----------
it's like super super embarrassing and


---------111:19----------
like you're completely alone and no one


---------111:21----------
ever has this problem and something is


---------111:22----------
fundamentally wrong with you if you


---------111:24----------
think that something is fundamentally


---------111:24----------
wrong with you get that [ __ ] checked out


---------111:26----------
yeah life knowing what is wrong because


---------111:32----------
everyone has their own struggles that


---------111:33----------
they're always going through everyone


---------111:34----------
does knowing what is wrong is the first


---------111:38----------
step in improving yourself cool yeah


---------111:41----------
yeah I can get behind that yeah awesome


---------111:44----------
Katie thank you so much thank you


---------111:47----------
good luck Thanks and and I hope that the


---------111:51----------
internet does not hate you and also feel


---------111:53----------
sympathetic for you because you didn't


---------111:55----------
want them to do that yeah


---------111:58----------
time they can do whatever you know


---------112:00----------
they've got a mind of their own


---------112:01----------
purchased they're showing take care


---------112:05----------
adios yeah bye bye dad I'm chattin and


---------112:11----------
chattin is finished


---------112:14----------
alrighty oh my god


---------112:17----------
I see a $10,000 donation what the [ __ ]


---------112:28----------
okay hey okay I will check okay so um


---------112:47----------
call me Carson fog absolutely man


---------112:49----------
all right so first of all and so many


---------112:56----------
different things to say I just need to


---------112:57----------
process for a second I'm feeling


---------112:59----------
overwhelmed


---------113:07----------
you


---------113:15----------
so the first thing is like I don't want


---------113:18----------
you guys to go through life like


---------113:20----------
thinking you're [ __ ] up


---------113:22----------
right and it's like really sad like I


---------113:25----------
can just because that's what happens


---------113:28----------
right like I I remember feeling this way


---------113:30----------
when I was in my early 20s and I guess I


---------113:35----------
thought oh man it's totally aced by the


---------113:36----------
way that she was like yeah two years ago


---------113:38----------
I was young and it's like lady you're


---------113:42----------
still young they're like 20 but you know


---------113:51----------
it's it's I just wish that I could read


---------113:58----------
people's minds and like see people on


---------113:59----------
the street who think that they're broken


---------114:01----------
on the inside and just tell them like no


---------114:02----------
you're not broken like that's just not


---------114:04----------
true right and I want you guys to think


---------114:06----------
about you know seven-year-old Kate and


---------114:10----------
you know looking at like an


---------114:12----------
apples-to-apples card such a powerful


---------114:14----------
story and then just seeing pure and just


---------114:16----------
like thinking like that's not gonna be


---------114:18----------
me like I'm not like that


---------114:20----------
the thoughts and feelings that we have


---------114:22----------
the things that we believe to be true


---------114:24----------
about ourselves the aspects of worth


---------114:28----------
that we treat as facts or born in such


---------114:32----------
insidious places and then they just grow


---------114:36----------
like our entire life right like in and I


---------114:39----------
think Kate is really in the minority


---------114:41----------
here because she's incredibly resilient


---------114:42----------
usually people get way more [ __ ] than


---------114:45----------
she is like by if they have what


---------114:48----------
happened to her and I just don't know


---------114:52----------
how else to say that it's just like I've


---------114:53----------
seen complete train wrecks this is what


---------114:55----------
we used to call [ __ ] life syndrome you


---------114:58----------
know anyway but and like so just stop


---------115:02----------
and think about if you feel like you're


---------115:04----------
an awful piece of [ __ ] or like a waste


---------115:07----------
of space or that other people are better


---------115:09----------
than you and you don't deserve


---------115:10----------
forgiveness or any of this kind of crap


---------115:12----------
you don't deserve to be happy because


---------115:13----------
you're a waste of space and you just sit


---------115:16----------
there and play video games all day and


---------115:17----------
like all this kind of crap about


---------115:19----------
yourself just know that's just not true


---------115:24----------
like I understand that you feel that way


---------115:26----------
and just like Kate did when


---------115:29----------
she was seven she felt like she was


---------115:30----------
never gonna be pure is not good and and


---------115:36----------
like I don't we can't blame her for


---------115:38----------
feeling that way because she had things


---------115:39----------
happen to her which made those feelings


---------115:42----------
feel true and you guys have had [ __ ]


---------115:45----------
that's happened to you which makes your


---------115:47----------
feelings feel true and I'm not saying


---------115:50----------
that your feelings are wrong what I'm


---------115:53----------
saying is that you shouldn't form a


---------115:55----------
conclusion about who you are as a person


---------115:57----------
based on that feeling right of course


---------116:02----------
she feels tainted for the rest of her


---------116:05----------
life and of course she feels weak for


---------116:08----------
not saying goodbye to her grandfather


---------116:10----------
and she's still not strong enough and


---------116:13----------
she's not strong enough right now and


---------116:14----------
that's [ __ ] okay why does she need to


---------116:17----------
why do we expect ourselves to have all


---------116:20----------
of the strength that we're going to gain


---------116:22----------
over the course of our life now like


---------116:26----------
where did we set up that expectation


---------116:28----------
it's okay for her to not be strong


---------116:30----------
enough and it's okay for you to knock


---------116:32----------
these socks off right like and and do


---------116:36----------
what she do what she did like how did


---------116:40----------
she like start to love herself it was


---------116:42----------
sort of like you know accepting that


---------116:44----------
she's like she was like yeah I'm kind of


---------116:47----------
a dumb [ __ ] and that's not like her


---------116:50----------
beating herself up it's actually like a


---------116:51----------
positive sort of thing and it's kind of


---------116:54----------
like I I think that's the answer it's


---------116:55----------
not fake it till you make it because


---------116:57----------
that's not really how it happens that


---------116:59----------
leads to imposter syndrome it's not


---------117:03----------
getting other people's validation it's


---------117:05----------
actually like accepting that you are


---------117:07----------
flawed in some way and we see this in


---------117:09----------
like Alcoholics Anonymous where they


---------117:11----------
start every meeting with with you know


---------117:13----------
hi I'm so-and-so and I'm an alcoholic


---------117:15----------
well when was the last time you had a


---------117:17----------
drink 34 years ago it's like how are you


---------117:19----------
still an alcoholic and it's like no man


---------117:21----------
I'm still an alcoholic and and so I want


---------117:24----------
you guys to really just stop and think


---------117:26----------
about you know do you feel broken and do


---------117:28----------
you feel like you're unredeemable and


---------117:30----------
recognize that those feelings are real


---------117:32----------
and they come from a very real place but


---------117:35----------
they come from a place that is


---------117:36----------
incomplete they come from an


---------117:38----------
understanding they're born at the age of


---------117:41----------
seven after you


---------117:42----------
sexually abused it's born in a


---------117:44----------
seven-year-olds mind cannot understand


---------117:46----------
the nuance that is life in that feeling


---------117:49----------
in you is primitive because it doesn't


---------117:51----------
have qualities and it's not logical and


---------117:53----------
it like doesn't make sense but it feels


---------117:55----------
very real it feels fuel it feels real


---------117:57----------
and start to explore it and see where


---------118:00----------
that came from and and don't just


---------118:05----------
because you feel that way and it feels


---------118:06----------
true does not mean it has to determine


---------118:09----------
your destiny or the the next phase of


---------118:13----------
your life it doesn't have to and all you


---------118:17----------
have to do is you know take your teacup


---------118:19----------
and look at it and go back to like


---------118:21----------
exploring where where was that feeling


---------118:23----------
feeling born for you where did it come


---------118:26----------
from


---------118:33----------
yeah because it's just not fair for you


---------118:35----------
to live your life like that and you just


---------118:37----------
don't need to and I just don't think


---------118:40----------
it's fair and I don't want you to do


---------118:42----------
that to yourself because you deserve


---------118:44----------
better


---------118:44----------
you deserve to treat yourself better and


---------118:47----------
you deserve you're just like this is the


---------118:48----------
problem right it's like so many things


---------118:50----------
so many of the people that we work with


---------118:52----------
like they start to get better and then


---------118:55----------
they don't believe they deserve to be


---------118:57----------
better so they actually stop trying and


---------118:59----------
it's so [ __ ] mean right like you guys


---------119:03----------
have actually spent times of your life


---------119:04----------
where you've started to become good


---------119:06----------
people but then you stop and the voice


---------119:08----------
inside your head tells you I'm not a


---------119:10----------
good person and like I don't deserve


---------119:12----------
that so I'm gonna stop and it's so


---------119:16----------
[ __ ] insidious I hate it so much oh


---------119:18----------
my god but it happens we did a interview


---------119:21----------
many many months ago when we were a tiny


---------119:23----------
tiny stream with this guy named crucify


---------119:25----------
and I think he illustrates that well but


---------119:30----------
and like I mean come on dude like cut


---------119:33----------
yourself some slack


---------119:34----------
cuz if I mean if as long as you believe


---------119:37----------
that you don't deserve to do better


---------119:38----------
you're theirs I mean people are like how


---------119:41----------
do I put my life together you start by


---------119:44----------
acknowledging that you deserve a life


---------119:46----------
that is worth living like that's where


---------119:48----------
you start do you believe that about


---------119:50----------
yourself do you believe that you deserve


---------119:52----------
to be happy


---------119:53----------
or at least that you deserve a chance at


---------119:55----------
happiness and if the answer is no like


---------119:58----------
that's your [ __ ] problem where did


---------120:00----------
you learn that where did you learn that


---------120:02----------
you're you don't deserve a chance to be


---------120:04----------
happy anyway I don't know where to go


---------120:12----------

---------123:23----------
okay so thanks to our Lando Blakely for


---------123:27----------
all the gifted subs bro and just just a


---------123:31----------
reminder that so we actually hit our


---------123:34----------
full funding goal for the month so we're


---------123:37----------
really grateful for that so massive


---------123:39----------
amount of subs Orlando Blakeley thank


---------123:41----------
you very much and yeah so let me just


---------123:47----------
share a couple things so the may is


---------123:48----------
mental health awareness month and you


---------123:51----------
know we've been streaming on Twitch for


---------123:52----------
like six or seven months now and we try


---------123:54----------
to raise awareness for mental health


---------123:57----------
issues like every time we stream but


---------124:00----------
we're really asking for some support to


---------124:02----------
build some of the services that we think


---------124:04----------
our community needs and at the top of


---------124:07----------
the list for the services that we think


---------124:08----------
the community needs one is that like


---------124:10----------
one-on-one work matters and I think that


---------124:14----------
I just can't you know streaming is a


---------124:16----------
powerful and important but I think that


---------124:18----------
everyone sort of you know deserves the


---------124:21----------
opportunity to have what people who come


---------124:24----------
on here on stream cloth which is that


---------124:28----------
for a compassionate and authentic human


---------124:30----------
being to like listen to what they have


---------124:32----------
to say and try to support them through


---------124:33----------
that through it


---------124:34----------
and I can't do it for all of you I just


---------124:36----------
like it's like literally time and space


---------124:39----------
constrain what I can do so I I'd love to


---------124:42----------
do it for each and every one of you if


---------124:43----------
our communities 20 people would be


---------124:44----------
awesome we'd be done but it's bigger and


---------124:48----------
I'm sort of glad that it's bigger


---------124:49----------
because that's what that's what we need


---------124:52----------
right now right like that's who we are


---------124:53----------
where the I wasn't kidding when when I


---------124:56----------
was trying to virtually embrace Kate


---------125:00----------
when she was like 11 and joined the


---------125:03----------
Internet's and came home to her people


---------125:06----------
because that's us and we're all a little


---------125:08----------
bit broken and we all deserve a little


---------125:10----------
bit help a little bit of help and that's


---------125:13----------
what our coaching program is is


---------125:14----------
therefore so we'll see if this grand


---------125:17----------
experiment works I wouldn't have asked


---------125:18----------
for money until we knew it was working


---------125:22----------
basically


---------125:22----------
so we collected a bunch of data I


---------125:24----------
designed a study I designed a lot of you


---------125:26----------
know Harvard Andy instruments and I'm


---------125:30----------
confident that it actually can help


---------125:32----------
people which is why we're actually doing


---------125:34----------
it so the you know all the testing and


---------125:35----------
stuff was on our end but now that I've


---------125:38----------
now that we've actually helped we had


---------125:40----------
people enroll in our beta program and


---------125:42----------
they worked with coaches for eight


---------125:43----------
months and those people felt like it was


---------125:46----------
helpful


---------125:47----------
and so now that I have now that I'm


---------125:50----------
confident that this can help in some way


---------125:52----------
shape or form like now it's about


---------125:54----------
actually providing it for you guys so so


---------126:02----------
it's fully funded now so thank you guys


---------126:03----------
very much it 100k we start a scholarship


---------126:06----------
fund and we're gonna have Moses's edate


---------126:10----------
so the other thing guys is anything else


---------126:13----------
we we raise after 75 K is actually going


---------126:17----------
to subsidize free coaching and so we


---------126:20----------
recognize that a lot of people so we're


---------126:23----------
making coaching super cheap you know


---------126:26----------
it's gonna be like way cheaper than


---------126:28----------
going to a therapist because it's not


---------126:29----------
therapy but and and we're still


---------126:32----------
committed to offering you know services


---------126:35----------
to people irrespective of their ability


---------126:37----------
to pay


---------126:37----------
and we're kind of working on on that and


---------126:42----------
so yeah and so we're committed to that


---------126:49----------
and you know we really try to make our


---------126:52----------
content as easily accessible and


---------126:54----------
available as possible and then one last


---------126:59----------
thing to think a little bit about is


---------127:00----------
that on Friday so I don't know exactly


---------127:03----------
what we're doing on why is everyone


---------127:08----------
saying


---------127:08----------
keemstar is that a person course that


---------127:14----------
like a word


---------127:15----------
I can't tell see I don't know if you


---------127:21----------
guys are talking about people or like is


---------127:26----------
that like POG how do you guys see how


---------127:29----------
that's confusing because when you're


---------127:30----------
like pogchamp like i don't know if


---------127:32----------
pogchamp is a person or just something


---------127:34----------
that people say because


---------127:35----------
pogchamp countess sounds like sounds


---------127:38----------
like keemstar like as a keemstar a thing
