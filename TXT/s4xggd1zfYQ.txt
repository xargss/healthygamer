---------00:00----------
good at side quests but bad at the main


---------00:02----------
quest


---------00:03----------
okay hello all basically as the title


---------00:06----------
says i'm good at completing the


---------00:07----------
necessary daily mundane chores and


---------00:09----------
actually don't mind doing them things


---------00:11----------
like the dishes cleaning outdoor work


---------00:13----------
taking care of small errands here and


---------00:14----------
there and i'm quite bad at moving


---------00:16----------
forward with the main quests of life


---------00:18----------
financial independence relationships a


---------00:20----------
plan for the future and i'm 25 and


---------00:22----------
living with my parents while unemployed


---------00:24----------
and feel quite a bit of shame about it i


---------00:26----------
have a university degree in classical


---------00:28----------
civilizations which i love but haven't


---------00:30----------
found a job using the skills i've


---------00:31----------
learned


---------00:32----------
i went to school because i was


---------00:34----------
passionate about the field but never


---------00:35----------
once took into consideration what was


---------00:36----------
going to happen after i graduated


---------00:39----------
i have many interests and i spend a lot


---------00:41----------
and i spend my days engaging in in these


---------00:43----------
hobbies but it has occurred to me lately


---------00:45----------
that i need to get going and on on a


---------00:48----------
life path or something


---------00:50----------
to my detriment now i tend to be very


---------00:52----------
good at idling spending a good chunk of


---------00:54----------
my day doing leisurely activities like


---------00:56----------
walking through the woods near my house


---------00:57----------
or reading at the park under the sun


---------01:00----------
not that these things are bad but i


---------01:01----------
probably spend too much time doing them


---------01:03----------
as opposed to doing things that are more


---------01:05----------
obviously productive as far as having a


---------01:07----------
goal to move towards


---------01:08----------
i apply for jobs almost every day but


---------01:10----------
these are mostly dead end jobs that have


---------01:12----------
nothing to do with the things that i'm


---------01:13----------
interested in i think it's time to stop


---------01:15----------
i stopped doing that i guess my issue is


---------01:17----------
that i'm not good at breaking down the


---------01:19----------
main quest in the smaller chunks because


---------01:21----------
it feels like it's never enough


---------01:23----------
maybe someone here could relate


---------01:26----------
someone's like yeah i want to be friends


---------01:28----------
with this guy absolutely


---------01:29----------
okay


---------01:30----------
so this is a fantastic post and my


---------01:32----------
answer is going to be kind of weird okay


---------01:36----------
so the first thing is that i think


---------01:37----------
you've discovered your main quest it's


---------01:39----------
just your main quest happens to be other


---------01:41----------
people's side quests


---------01:43----------
okay so this is what i'm hearing from


---------01:45----------
this person's life first of all there


---------01:47----------
isn't a whole lot wrong


---------01:49----------
it just doesn't fit


---------01:51----------
what people perceive to be like what


---------01:53----------
life is supposed to be


---------01:55----------
do you all get that


---------01:56----------
it's not like this person is like


---------01:58----------
suffering it's just like they're


---------01:59----------
interested in stuff they like have a


---------02:01----------
healthy work-life balance because they


---------02:02----------
have no work


---------02:04----------
and they're actually really good at


---------02:05----------
executing on small tasks and it doesn't


---------02:07----------
bother them to do that and they tend to


---------02:09----------
be like philosophical in thinking right


---------02:11----------
so i love this line in particular


---------02:14----------
it's uh


---------02:17----------
um


---------02:20----------
where is it oh yeah


---------02:22----------
i have many interests i spend my it


---------02:24----------
occurred it has occurred to me lately


---------02:26----------
that i need to get going on a life path


---------02:29----------
or something i love this sentence


---------02:31----------
because here's what i'm envisioning


---------02:32----------
here's this person who studies classical


---------02:34----------
civilizations in university who's going


---------02:37----------
for a walk in the woods and is kind of


---------02:39----------
like


---------02:42----------
perhaps i should start living life and


---------02:44----------
get a job


---------02:46----------
right so i think this is actually


---------02:48----------
awesome this is who you are okay so


---------02:50----------
you're contemplative


---------02:52----------
right like you're a thinker


---------02:55----------
you're like


---------02:57----------
like you like to take life slow and you


---------02:59----------
tend to be like detail-oriented


---------03:02----------
this sounds very okay so


---------03:06----------
dr k is going to go to pseudoscience


---------03:08----------
ayurveda astrology whatever for a second


---------03:10----------
sounds really guppa right like hard to


---------03:13----------
change


---------03:14----------
not really too ambitious


---------03:16----------
pretty detail-oriented can kind of get


---------03:19----------
things done


---------03:20----------
is like very like earth element okay


---------03:23----------
so i'd be curious whether this person is


---------03:25----------
physically kapha


---------03:26----------
but seems very mentally


---------03:28----------
guffa y'all get that like no ambition


---------03:30----------
but like nothing's wrong i'm just kind


---------03:32----------
of chilling just chilling so the first


---------03:34----------
thing is that so i i make two concrete


---------03:36----------
recommendations please god become a


---------03:38----------
personal assistant or executive


---------03:40----------
assistant please stop looking for dead


---------03:42----------
end jobs


---------03:43----------
so i don't know if you guys know this


---------03:45----------
but like good executive assistants can


---------03:47----------
get paid like six figure salaries like


---------03:50----------
i've i've known some executive


---------03:52----------
assistants that will get like 250 300k a


---------03:55----------
year


---------03:56----------
so it's a very very valuable like skill


---------03:59----------
grossly underestimated like in the


---------04:01----------
market


---------04:02----------
so becoming a personal assistant or


---------04:04----------
executive assistant you can make like


---------04:05----------
depending on you know where if you're


---------04:08----------
answering a facebook ad for someone who


---------04:10----------
wants to pay you like two dollars an


---------04:11----------
hour like that's gonna suck


---------04:13----------
but i don't know exactly how these


---------04:15----------
people become executive assistants i


---------04:17----------
don't know like how they got there


---------04:19----------
and i've even asked a couple of times


---------04:20----------
but it seems like there isn't like a


---------04:22----------
formal process to it it's sort of like


---------04:24----------
you're good at detail-oriented stuff


---------04:26----------
someone who has a pile of money


---------04:28----------
recognizes that they're bad at this crap


---------04:31----------
and you're good at this crap and they're


---------04:33----------
like hey can i pay you 50k a year to


---------04:35----------
make sure that


---------04:36----------
my registration sticker is updated in my


---------04:39----------
in my car so i don't get like


---------04:41----------
pulled over in my car impounded because


---------04:43----------
i have this crap to do


---------04:46----------
so if you're looking for a job i would


---------04:48----------
strongly strongly look for like


---------04:50----------
high-value personal assistance and


---------04:51----------
executive assistants and like help


---------04:53----------
people who have more money than you do


---------04:56----------
and don't have the time to do all the


---------04:57----------
little crap that


---------04:59----------
you are good at like just do it for them


---------05:01----------
and it'll be like a good exchange for


---------05:02----------
everyone involved


---------05:04----------
so i think you'd be very well suited to


---------05:05----------
that kind of job


---------05:08----------
so second thing is


---------05:10----------
recognize that like in your life what i


---------05:13----------
would envision for you i have no idea if


---------05:14----------
this is possible or not it's like you're


---------05:15----------
an executive assistant to someone making


---------05:17----------
like 80k a year okay so you take care of


---------05:19----------
crap during the day that they need to


---------05:21----------
take care of


---------05:22----------
but it's like


---------05:24----------
they're going to give you a list of


---------05:25----------
things and you're going to kind of take


---------05:26----------
care of it your leisure and the rest of


---------05:28----------
the time you're just going to be like


---------05:28----------
thinking right because you're going to


---------05:30----------
like go do things like pick up their dry


---------05:31----------
cleaning


---------05:32----------
and so you're going to like go pick up


---------05:33----------
their dry cleaning and on the drive


---------05:35----------
there you're going to be thinking about


---------05:36----------
classical civilizations like you do so


---------05:39----------
i'd encourage you to like carry a


---------05:40----------
notebook and start to like write or do


---------05:42----------
something because you've got something


---------05:43----------
in there that's philosophical and


---------05:45----------
contemplative and needs to come out in


---------05:46----------
some way


---------05:47----------
and so essentially you want to like pay


---------05:49----------
your bills being someone's like personal


---------05:50----------
assistant or executive assistant


---------05:52----------
and while you're doing that just let


---------05:54----------
your mind slowly like nurture and grow


---------05:56----------
whatever the kind of contemplative crap


---------05:58----------
you want to do is


---------06:00----------
but your skill set and your degree can


---------06:02----------
be completely independent okay


---------06:04----------
like even if you look at me like i'm a


---------06:07----------
twitch streamer


---------06:08----------
my degree is in medicine those are not i


---------06:10----------
don't this isn't even medical care like


---------06:12----------
what we're doing right now is not


---------06:12----------
medical care


---------06:14----------
my skill set my degree are different


---------06:17----------
and so a lot of what i see in our


---------06:19----------
community is people are so hung up


---------06:22----------
on


---------06:22----------
the traditional road of life that they


---------06:24----------
don't realize


---------06:26----------
that like your side quest is your main


---------06:28----------
quest


---------06:29----------
if you're just good at doing random


---------06:30----------
tasks for like


---------06:32----------
and it's easy for you and it's so hard


---------06:35----------
for our vata-esque adhd no one can get


---------06:38----------
their crap done on time


---------06:39----------
and you can do it for them like some


---------06:41----------
people will pay you


---------06:43----------
piles of money to do it


---------06:44----------
so that's what i think you should do for


---------06:46----------
a job i don't usually give advice but


---------06:48----------
i'd say for this person it's the first


---------06:49----------
thing that popped into my head and then


---------06:51----------
over time like continue to cultivate


---------06:53----------
whatever it is that you actually find


---------06:55----------
interesting and i'd say take that


---------06:57----------
interest and start creating with it and


---------06:59----------
what i mean by creating is like


---------07:01----------
literally produce something so like


---------07:02----------
start journaling


---------07:04----------
write things down


---------07:06----------
type up stuff in a word document just


---------07:09----------
capture your thoughts and put them out


---------07:11----------
into the world in some way they don't


---------07:13----------
have to be read by anyone i don't mean


---------07:14----------
like you can start a blog if you want to


---------07:16----------
but take all the things that you're


---------07:18----------
interested in this is probably the


---------07:19----------
biggest problem with our community is


---------07:21----------
that


---------07:21----------
they don't recognize that we're we are


---------07:24----------
all actually pretty smart


---------07:27----------
and that our thoughts have value but in


---------07:29----------
order for our thoughts to have value we


---------07:31----------
have to translate them into some medium


---------07:34----------
that can be helpful to another human


---------07:35----------
being


---------07:36----------
it's that translation into a separate


---------07:38----------
medium that our community really falls


---------07:40----------
apart at right you may have a great


---------07:42----------
taste in music but at some point you've


---------07:43----------
got to like make it


---------07:45----------
at some point like you may know a lot


---------07:48----------
about dota


---------07:49----------
but at some point like like it doesn't


---------07:51----------
have to you don't have to write a blog


---------07:52----------
like just start a youtube channel just


---------07:54----------
start creating we've had so many


---------07:56----------
creators that we've interviewed and we


---------07:58----------
asked them like how did you start and


---------08:00----------
they just like i just started and it was


---------08:02----------
small and insignificant for a while


---------08:04----------
right and then like 10 years later they


---------08:06----------
have like 8 million followers


---------08:10----------
so


---------08:11----------
anyway for this person you know my heart


---------08:13----------
goes out to you but i i think that like


---------08:15----------
don't adopt a main quest just because


---------08:18----------
other people are adopting it the whole


---------08:19----------
point of the main quest is that it's


---------08:21----------
like spawn specific right your main


---------08:23----------
quest is different from other people's


---------08:24----------
main quests and i think you've got


---------08:26----------
particular skills that are highly valued


---------08:28----------
you just have to figure out how to


---------08:30----------
market them which is it's it's a big ask


---------08:31----------
you can't just show off someone


---------08:33----------
somewhere and be like pay me 60k to be


---------08:36----------
your for a year you know like you


---------08:38----------
can't that people aren't going to take


---------08:39----------
that but


---------08:41----------
at the same time like these tasks can be


---------08:43----------
very very valuable like what you're good


---------08:45----------
at and what you excel at can be really


---------08:48----------
valuable to some people i just don't


---------08:49----------
know how you find them but i'd start


---------08:51----------
there so i look for like openings for


---------08:53----------
personal assistance and just keep on the


---------08:55----------
lookout because someone will pay a lot
