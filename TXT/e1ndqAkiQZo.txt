well welcome ghosts and and next let's


---------02:28----------
go to yeah I guess you guys don't see


---------02:32----------
yeah exactly


---------02:33----------
yeah awesome so my name is Richard I


---------02:36----------
live in California and first of all I


---------02:40----------
just liked it not


---------02:41----------
stock decay for letting all the viewers


---------02:43----------
on so I'm really really excited for this


---------02:45----------
my big thing with porn addiction is that


---------02:51----------
there's like I so throughout my


---------02:55----------
experience I've always placed a value


---------02:57----------
judgment when I when I first got into


---------02:59----------
the act I was king of the animal kingdom


---------03:02----------
and the two weeks went on and then I


---------03:05----------
started to see it as like a shameful act


---------03:07----------
and then more time went on I I don't


---------03:10----------
know I've like I've tried to differ a


---------03:11----------
lot of different value propositions of


---------03:13----------
like what it is like I see like right


---------03:17----------
now I'm in a state of where um I see it


---------03:20----------
as you know I see like a little bit of


---------03:23----------
beauty to it I like even though it's


---------03:25----------
artificial I still think there there is


---------03:28----------
room for it in the world


---------03:30----------
but the one thing that I'm struggling


---------03:32----------
with is like the dopamine and like the


---------03:35----------
relationship with the frontal lobe


---------03:37----------
that's a big thing on why that's


---------03:40----------
something that I kind of want to moving


---------03:43----------
forward I kind of want to discuss the


---------03:45----------
topic of like like nofap and like just


---------03:49----------
ways that like not using porn as a form


---------03:55----------
enix of escapism use it more as like a


---------03:59----------
way to like create things in your


---------04:02----------
reality I don't know maybe I'm kind of


---------04:04----------
rambling now but I'm really excited to


---------04:06----------
be on and listen Richard let me hear let


---------04:10----------
me tell you what I'm hearing I'm hearing


---------04:11----------
that you've thought about this a lot and


---------04:13----------
also you've tried a lot of different


---------04:15----------
things and you're curious about how


---------04:17----------
different ways to look at this you're


---------04:18----------
curious you have like some thoughts


---------04:20----------
about nofap you have some thoughts about


---------04:22----------
you know how you apply values to it and


---------04:24----------
and so you're really here to just learn


---------04:26----------
and kind of like like sort of sort some


---------04:28----------
of this stuff out and maybe some of the


---------04:29----------
other folks here myself included can


---------04:31----------
like help you sort that out maybe we can


---------04:33----------
try to understand this a little bit


---------04:35----------
better to come to some answers together


---------04:36----------
is that absolutely perfect perfect right


---------04:39----------
on the middleman and and next we have


---------04:42----------
the the dude yes hey so you can call me


---------04:47----------
Harold


---------04:47----------
okay and I guess I'm Harold the one


---------04:51----------
thing the one thing things


---------04:54----------
it's it's we're talking to you as as


---------04:56----------
ghost said because I just only watched


---------05:00----------
your stuff and now I'm actually talking


---------05:01----------
to you welcome man thanks I guess the


---------05:06----------
only thing I've been really thinking


---------05:07----------
about is I've been trying to quit this


---------05:09----------
for four years so I guess I want to


---------05:13----------
explore reasons why it's been so hard to


---------05:15----------
kick it because I mean for four years


---------05:16----------
I've been trying to quit I mean I've


---------05:18----------
gone lengths of time without it but then


---------05:19----------
I just always come back and it just


---------05:21----------
seems like super hard to kick for some


---------05:23----------
reason I've tried lots of different


---------05:24----------
stuff and can't really find the right


---------05:26----------
way to get rid of it okay sure so so


---------05:32----------
maybe what we can do is is try to like


---------05:34----------
compare and contrast a little bit see


---------05:36----------
what people have tried what seems to


---------05:37----------
have worked what hasn't and then maybe


---------05:41----------
come to some kind of consensus about how


---------05:43----------
to help you guys overcome a porn


---------05:45----------
addiction and so I think the next icon


---------05:48----------
I'm seeing is myself right this the yeah


---------05:51----------
and then down in the bottom left yeah


---------05:55----------
welcome dude yeah oh my name is Erin I


---------06:01----------
guess my porn addiction is lasted eight


---------06:06----------
years now yeah okay I guess the one


---------06:11----------
thing that I really wanted to address is


---------06:14----------
that the first couple times that I like


---------06:17----------
well I addressed the issue pretty early


---------06:19----------
on to myself but when I was trying to


---------06:21----------
find support and others there was this


---------06:26----------
sort of stigma I guess that porn isn't


---------06:29----------
an addiction that will share something


---------06:31----------
that just like hit me pretty hard and I


---------06:35----------
guess that's one big thing that I want


---------06:37----------
to bring up during this stream is that


---------06:39----------
like pornography can be a severe


---------06:42----------
addiction just like others but in


---------06:44----------
different ways of course okay yeah I was


---------06:48----------
one of the main things that I want to


---------06:49----------
address so Erin it sounds like


---------06:52----------
you really looked for help in support


---------06:55----------
and you you really sort of judged for it


---------06:59----------
and and kind of you weren't really met


---------07:01----------
with a whole lot of support or


---------07:03----------
understanding or and and that was that


---------07:06----------
that is a big problem absolutely so


---------07:08----------
thank you for bringing that up and then


---------07:12----------
next I see like anime portrait with blue


---------07:15----------
eyes yes hello


---------07:17----------
hey man welcome I am Virgil on the


---------07:21----------
discord okay and welcome Virgil thank


---------07:24----------
you appreciate you having us here


---------07:28----------
I've been struggling with this issue the


---------07:32----------
issue of porn addiction since I was 14


---------07:35----------
okay ballpark for us how long ago that


---------07:40----------
was uh about ten years okay probably 11


---------07:46----------
actually okay so it sounds like you me


---------07:50----------
struggling with this for a long time


---------07:51----------
yeah and knowing what I know now about


---------07:54----------
how porn affects your brain your


---------08:00----------
connections and everything it's been


---------08:05----------
really tough to quit it because it was


---------08:09----------
introduced to me by my by my oh sorry


---------08:17----------
that's okay man take your time it's


---------08:21----------
[Music]


---------08:24----------
absolutely I can't I came across it in


---------08:26----------
my form of years and I think that's that


---------08:29----------
it's it's damaged me in a way that's


---------08:32----------
very hard to sort of recognize and deal


---------08:37----------
with and it's just something in general


---------08:40----------
that I just want to be able to quit it


---------08:45----------
because it's just it's something that's


---------08:48----------
more difficult to quit then maybe people


---------08:51----------
might think absolutely people people


---------08:55----------
definitely downplay the issue more than


---------08:57----------
they should I don't think that they take


---------09:00----------
it seriously absolutely guys absolutely


---------09:03----------
so I'm gonna I'm gonna just jump out


---------09:06----------
what something how many of y'all feel


---------09:07----------
damaged I do sorry I just see but in


---------09:14----------
this came a little quick what do you


---------09:16----------
mean by damaged you kind of I'm just


---------09:18----------
curious if that word sort of resonates


---------09:20----------
like Virgil used the word he felt like


---------09:23----------
you know being exposed to such such an


---------09:25----------
early age completely damaged him and he


---------09:31----------
used he used literally the word damaged


---------09:33----------
and I was just thinking about how


---------09:34----------
powerful that word is and I was just


---------09:36----------
curious how much what he experienced


---------09:39----------
kind of resonates with the rest of y'all


---------09:41----------
and just fun isn't a thousand percent


---------09:45----------
and and can you can you share a little


---------09:49----------
bit more by what you mean by that


---------09:53----------
whoever said a thousand percent okay my


---------09:58----------
I thought I came across it when I was 11


---------09:59----------
and I had a friend at the time and he


---------10:03----------
you know he talked about how amazing it


---------10:05----------
was I thought I thought about looking at


---------10:09----------
it before and it sort of spurred me to


---------10:12----------
look at it and it was like tasting sugar


---------10:16----------
for the first time sure and because it's


---------10:21----------
such a sort of new phenomenon in the


---------10:24----------
high-speed Internet form that we have it


---------10:26----------
people don't really understand the risks


---------10:28----------
and it's not really explained to you you


---------10:30----------
know you're taught not to overeat sugar


---------10:33----------
but you're not taught to over consume


---------10:35----------
this yet it's sort of from the moment I


---------10:39----------
was exposed to it it was like every day


---------10:43----------
two to three times a day at least


---------10:45----------
just from then on for about the first


---------10:48----------
two years before I realized there were


---------10:50----------
any negative effects and you sort of


---------10:53----------
realized it as you start to grow more


---------10:56----------
desensitized to regular stuff and you


---------10:58----------
realize it doesn't affect you like it


---------10:59----------
used to and you get exhausted with it so


---------11:02----------
it's kind of like moving to not to be it


---------11:06----------
like hyperbolic but like moving to


---------11:08----------
harder drugs you can sort of keep


---------11:10----------
searching for that hi yep so it sounds


---------11:13----------
like you you have to go to more kind of


---------11:14----------
more extreme pornography to get the kind


---------11:16----------
of dopamine response


---------11:19----------
yeah yeah absolutely thank you so much


---------11:24----------
for sharing that goes so so I'm hearing


---------11:26----------
from a lot of you guys that you all feel


---------11:28----------
you all feel damaged in some way yes all


---------11:32----------
right so let's just put a pin in that


---------11:33----------
idea for just a second let's finish


---------11:35----------
doing introductions and then you know my


---------11:38----------
hope is that if nothing else I don't


---------11:40----------
know what we're gonna uncover about


---------11:42----------
dopamine or neuro development or any of


---------11:44----------
that stuff but if nothing else I would


---------11:47----------
love it if if we could you know start


---------11:49----------
you guys on the path of I don't know


---------11:51----------
what we're gonna do about porn but if we


---------11:53----------
can start to help you feel less damaged


---------11:55----------
and in more whole that's kind of at the


---------12:00----------
top of my list for like like just first


---------12:02----------
steps that I don't know if we can solve


---------12:04----------
the rest of it but but if we can even do


---------12:07----------
something about that that's just that


---------12:09----------
feels really important to me can we


---------12:13----------
continue with introductions so down in


---------12:17----------
the in the middle right oh you're muted


---------12:23----------
buddy


---------12:28----------
can you guys hear him no no so I don't


---------12:36----------
know if we want to move to the


---------12:37----------
discussion just right over to the right


---------12:38----------
move yeah we'll circle back to you buddy


---------12:41----------
so then the other anime portrait yeah me


---------12:45----------
yeah George you can call me George if


---------12:51----------
it's easier to pronounce okay I've been


---------12:54----------
struggling with this addiction for like


---------12:57----------
six years okay a discovery really early


---------13:01----------
age and like 11 C 11 or 10 years old I


---------13:04----------
don't really remember actually no it was


---------13:07----------
like 12 or 13 years old and pretty much


---------13:11----------
I in the first years I didn't really do


---------13:14----------
it too much but then when my life


---------13:18----------
started became more difficult and I


---------13:20----------
became more depressed and stuff I sort


---------13:23----------
of used it as an escape tool and then


---------13:29----------
you just you just bite a lot of control


---------13:31----------
I grew more desensitize


---------13:33----------
to stuff and I started over sexualizing


---------13:37----------
people that's one way I feel damaged


---------13:39----------
like I started over sexualizing stuff


---------13:42----------
okay and can you help me understand what


---------13:45----------
you mean by that


---------13:46----------
like for example I was in school and I


---------13:50----------
was in class and I looked at a girl that


---------13:55----------
I was at a crush on and then I was


---------13:58----------
started I will start thinking about


---------13:59----------
things I will do with her like stuff


---------14:04----------
like that even in the street when I


---------14:06----------
looked at her woman okay so like I


---------14:11----------
started over sexualizing stuff and II


---------14:15----------
grew to a point where I was feeling


---------14:16----------
disgust to myself which didn't help


---------14:18----------
because then it made me feel more


---------14:20----------
depressed and made me wanna jerk off


---------14:23----------
even more


---------14:23----------
sure so yeah that's something that I've


---------14:27----------
been trying to drive is struggling with


---------14:30----------
I tried doing nofap I actually did like


---------14:33----------
a month but then I just went back in


---------14:37----------
into it because I was struggling with


---------14:40----------
school and other surfing yeah okay and


---------14:44----------
do you want to try so thank you thank


---------14:47----------
you very much you said it's it's George


---------14:50----------
yeah yeah okay and do you want to try


---------14:53----------
the one person that we had to skip are


---------14:57----------
we are we good you want to try


---------14:58----------
introducing yourself or you think it's


---------15:00----------
Oh


---------15:02----------
still not getting audio okay


---------15:07----------
no audio yet okay do you want to try


---------15:15----------
rejoining the call or yeah why don't you


---------15:19----------
try rejoining and if not then you know


---------15:21----------
we'll have you four thumbs up and thumbs


---------15:23----------
downs you're gonna be our our virtual up


---------15:26----------
vote down vote machine depending on what


---------15:28----------
other people are saying okay so okay so


---------15:34----------
let me just think for a second


---------15:42----------
okay so I'm gonna just toss out a series


---------15:46----------
of just thoughts


---------15:48----------
okay topics and then you guys let me


---------15:50----------
know which direction you want to go so


---------15:52----------
the first is the sense of being damaged


---------15:55----------
I think we should really explore because


---------15:57----------
like George was saying there's something


---------15:59----------
like a cycle right so we can also talk


---------16:01----------
about this about the effect when you


---------16:08----------
masturbate it it serves as like a


---------16:10----------
dopamine release and helps us feel good


---------16:13----------
like so we release endorphins and other


---------16:15----------
kinds of like endogenous chemicals that


---------16:19----------
make us feel good and so there's anytime


---------16:22----------
you have an addictive behavior there's


---------16:24----------
like the addiction in and of itself and


---------16:26----------
then there's using the addiction is a


---------16:28----------
coping mechanism for other things


---------16:31----------
because basically like our brain learns


---------16:33----------
a surefire way to release certain neuro


---------16:37----------
chemicals that we're going to make us


---------16:38----------
feel a particular way so if we're


---------16:40----------
feeling bad about ourselves and we've


---------16:42----------
kind of got like this like guaranteed


---------16:45----------
way to feel better


---------16:46----------
oftentimes we'll turn to that addictive


---------16:48----------
behavior and so there's something of a


---------16:51----------
cycle of addictive behavior and feeling


---------16:55----------
bad and then using it to make ourselves


---------16:57----------
feel better so we can talk about the


---------17:00----------
sort of cycle of addiction in terms of


---------17:04----------
feeling bad and then making ourselves


---------17:06----------
feel better we could talk about being


---------17:08----------
damaged we should definitely talk about


---------17:13----------
what other people understand or don't


---------17:16----------
understand and how it sounds like the


---------17:18----------
other thing that you guys feel is


---------17:19----------
isolated right so we can kind of talk


---------17:23----------
about isolation and stigma and then we


---------17:30----------
can


---------17:30----------
should probably talk about nofap and


---------17:32----------
just what you guys think about that and


---------17:33----------
then the last thing that I'm gonna just


---------17:36----------
put on the table for is control of the


---------17:39----------
mind so what I would like to do and


---------17:42----------
maybe this is where I can actually help


---------17:44----------
is that our mind functions in a


---------17:48----------
particular way like we have certain


---------17:49----------
impulses and then we have certain


---------17:51----------
feelings and then those impulses and


---------17:53----------
feelings kind of do some sort of you


---------17:56----------
know inner calculation and then result


---------17:59----------
in us engaging in a particular behavior


---------18:02----------
and so how can we understand like what


---------18:05----------
is going on in your mind to actually


---------18:07----------
control it in a way that you want to to


---------18:10----------
achieve what you want so that's gonna be


---------18:13----------
like almost like a very engineering


---------18:15----------
standpoint and I'm gonna ask you guys a


---------18:17----------
lot about like the sequence of events


---------18:20----------
over like the span of five minutes of


---------18:22----------
like what you experience what happens in


---------18:25----------
your head you know how do you struggle


---------18:27----------
internally what ends up happening and


---------18:29----------
and so that's something that I think we


---------18:31----------
you know hopefully I'll be able to help


---------18:32----------
in that way because that tends to apply


---------18:34----------
to all addictions so what exactly


---------18:38----------
so cycle being damaged being isolated


---------18:40----------
stigma nofap or controlling the mind


---------18:43----------
what do y'all want to talk about you


---------18:45----------
guys want to go down the line just like


---------18:46----------
we did for introductions or or is the


---------18:51----------
most poignant which one's the most


---------18:55----------
poignant you damaged okay so actually


---------19:01----------
let's just take a step back so how would


---------19:03----------
you guys so let's say someone you say


---------19:05----------
that you tell someone that you're


---------19:07----------
addicted to pornography and they say oh


---------19:11----------
man that's like that's completely normal


---------19:12----------
like there's nothing like special or


---------19:14----------
wrong or different about that can we


---------19:16----------
actually just start by sort of defining


---------19:18----------
when you guys say that you're addicted


---------19:23----------
help us understand or yourselves


---------19:26----------
understand like where do you draw the


---------19:28----------
line like why do you think that you have


---------19:30----------
a problem and like what do you think is


---------19:32----------
normal let's just start by defining what


---------19:35----------
we're talking about are we going in an


---------19:38----------
odor at all no just anyone just you know


---------19:42----------
just jump in


---------19:44----------
okay for me when I had the realization


---------19:48----------
it was when it was like 4:00 in the


---------19:52----------
morning


---------19:53----------
and I'm watching for like a few hours


---------19:57----------
and and then like the next day I wanted


---------20:03----------
to watch more it was just like the ever


---------20:05----------
needing like urge for that consumption


---------20:08----------
okay and it just never went away it was


---------20:12----------
always there always it sounds like a


---------20:15----------
hunger that cannot be satisfied


---------20:17----------
absolutely yep agree so that sounds like


---------20:22----------
that's a pretty universal experience yes


---------20:25----------
definitely yeah can you share somebody I


---------20:28----------
like to know go for it sorry ghosts um


---------20:32----------
yeah it seems like it's sort of this


---------20:34----------
thing that overpowers all other things I


---------20:39----------
first sort of realized it was a problem


---------20:41----------
at around 13 and I did know that for


---------20:44----------
three months because I was starting to


---------20:48----------
learn about how it worked and I felt


---------20:51----------
great and some of that like bad things I


---------20:55----------
had noticed when I was a child I was


---------20:58----------
able to remember anything that I wanted


---------21:00----------
to so if I watched a documentary and you


---------21:04----------
asked me about any part of it I'd be


---------21:05----------
able to tell you exactly what was said


---------21:08----------
but then once I started watching porn


---------21:11----------
I know it's over a really sort of a long


---------21:13----------
period of time my cognitive abilities


---------21:17----------
were sort of tapering off even though I


---------21:19----------
was meant to be growing and then I


---------21:21----------
realized when I didn't know FUP again


---------21:23----------
they start to come back and I was able


---------21:25----------
to remember things again fast oh yeah


---------21:28----------
and I realized they got really bad when


---------21:32----------
I was 16 and in England we have these


---------21:38----------
things called GCSEs I seem like finals


---------21:41----------
other trum sort of similar thing so


---------21:45----------
before these big tests I was meant to be


---------21:48----------
revising getting eight hours of sleep


---------21:50----------
and I was watching porn to the point


---------21:54----------
where there were three days in a row


---------21:57----------
we're collectively in these three days I


---------22:00----------
got two hours of sleep and I was


---------22:02----------
sleeping for around 40 minutes because I


---------22:04----------
guess I was using it as like an anxiety


---------22:06----------
and because I was so I felt so pressured


---------22:11----------
by these tests that I was just


---------22:13----------
constantly consuming okay and that's


---------22:16----------
when I sort of realized it was a really


---------22:18----------
like it was devouring my life Wow yeah


---------22:22----------
so I think it was Aaron I saw you


---------22:27----------
nodding like a madman


---------22:28----------
when ghost was talking so does that does


---------22:31----------
that mirror your own is it okay if I if


---------22:33----------
I just call attention to things that I


---------22:35----------
notice for you guys absolutely yeah hold


---------22:37----------
out I'm good with that


---------22:38----------
okay don't dr. kay just want to let you


---------22:42----------
know I don't have my voice but okay I


---------22:52----------
sign that video my I'm sorry I did not


---------22:55----------
say voice on video you can call me


---------23:01----------
Squatch I'm 24 I'm from South Florida


---------23:05----------
and I had a significant traumatic


---------23:08----------
experience that happened in my life when


---------23:12----------
I was a kid at 11 years old that ever


---------23:15----------
since then caused me to have a real


---------23:17----------
severe addiction to pornography and I've


---------23:21----------
been struggling with it to this day so


---------23:23----------
it's about all that honestly I fight


---------23:25----------
every single day and its really really


---------23:27----------
rough and even though I don't have my


---------23:29----------
video I you guys saw my face I'm very


---------23:32----------
very happy to be here and I'm looking


---------23:34----------
forward to having this discussion with


---------23:36----------
you guys awesome and welcome squash and


---------23:39----------
I'm sorry to hear that something bad


---------23:41----------
happened to you in your your teen years


---------23:43----------
I'm also noticing a trend that it sounds


---------23:45----------
like for a lot of you guys like stuff


---------23:46----------
started very very early yeah so we


---------23:50----------
should probably just I just got to think


---------23:52----------
about that in terms of the developing


---------23:54----------
brain but Aaron you were you were


---------23:56----------
nodding along as his ghost was talking


---------23:59----------
yeah I also experienced a pretty much


---------24:04----------
the same exact thing I actually managed


---------24:07----------
to


---------24:08----------
break the addiction for two years and


---------24:13----------
during that time I was like at my peak


---------24:16----------
academically and mentally and my


---------24:20----------
happiness was like through the roof


---------24:22----------
but uh then some things happens life


---------24:26----------
happens and I relapsed I guess I'll call


---------24:30----------
it that and it's been just repeating


---------24:34----------
that cycle like you said over and over


---------24:37----------
again and if you I mean anybody else


---------24:41----------
curious about how Aaron broke the the


---------24:44----------
addiction for two years I think that's


---------24:46----------
incredibly curious about that because


---------24:49----------
there's so my thing is that I think you


---------24:53----------
said step four there's like something


---------24:54----------
there's a conversation that happens in


---------24:56----------
your mind maybe left and right there


---------24:59----------
there's a point where when you're


---------25:01----------
induced in this like coma


---------25:04----------
this sex drive it's influencing your


---------25:07----------
whole mind and body and once you start


---------25:09----------
like bringing up like a conversation


---------25:12----------
between like yes and though between the


---------25:15----------
act of doing it or not it just seems


---------25:18----------
that like the whole like the feeling the


---------25:21----------
whole feeling inside your body is


---------25:23----------
influencing your mind and what it's


---------25:25----------
thinking and then you start making


---------25:27----------
negative rationalizations about it so


---------25:30----------
and that's what gets to me most of time


---------25:33----------
it comes down to a point where I start


---------25:35----------
arguing with it like this side of my


---------25:38----------
brain for you know maybe five or so


---------25:42----------
minutes and then it gets to a breaking


---------25:43----------
point where like I just my


---------25:46----------
rationalizations just make sense at that


---------25:48----------
point and then the act ensues so I mean


---------25:52----------
I I'm hearing something that sounds like


---------25:53----------
almost like a very very physical craving


---------25:57----------
yeah absolutely


---------25:59----------
that that's what it sounds to me like I


---------26:00----------
mean it you know it sounds like it's not


---------26:02----------
actually like your mind it's your body


---------26:05----------
yeah the craving is huge yeah what is


---------26:10----------
that what is the craving feel like in


---------26:12----------
your body well initially so first of all


---------26:17----------
it gets triggered so once it what if I


---------26:20----------
see some type of suggestive and


---------26:23----------
you know like a spark happens and then


---------26:27----------
like my whole body kind of tenses up and


---------26:30----------
then I feel it like deep inside my spine


---------26:33----------
almost my lower spine I feel it almost


---------26:36----------
around my stomach and it feels like this


---------26:39----------
what's the word you used it was a ball


---------26:43----------
of undigested feelings what's the word


---------26:46----------
for that some scar some scone some scar


---------26:49----------
yes it feels like I just yeah absolutely


---------26:51----------
yeah good


---------26:54----------
well just feel I don't know it's just


---------26:57----------
like it kind of just starts enveloping


---------26:59----------
and it's just like it's it has an


---------27:01----------
influence over my whole body and it's


---------27:03----------
just like it's it's something I don't


---------27:05----------
like because I really want to you know


---------27:08----------
quit this addiction and I don't like you


---------27:12----------
know surging up this massive energy just


---------27:15----------
to you know blow it out 40 minutes later


---------27:18----------
and then have no motivation or more


---------27:21----------
importantly energy to do anything for


---------27:24----------
the rest of the day so so I'm hearing


---------27:26----------
like a buildup of energy or sensation is


---------27:29----------
that and then and then you you feel


---------27:32----------
spent afterward yeah absolutely I've


---------27:36----------
it's yeah I feel like I just I once it's


---------27:41----------
done I feel like I've given it


---------27:42----------
everything and then I you know blow off


---------27:47----------
the rest of the day so I can't like my


---------27:50----------
biggest concern is when I do it early in


---------27:52----------
the morning and like at the end of the


---------27:55----------
day I don't really see much of a problem


---------27:56----------
but I still see a problem with the porn


---------28:00----------
addiction as a whole this is the value


---------28:01----------
judgement of like how early in the day I


---------28:03----------
do it okay so Richard when you were and


---------28:09----------
sorry if I'm bouncing around a little


---------28:10----------
bit you guys are welcome to sort of if


---------28:12----------
you feel like we're moving too fast you


---------28:15----------
all are welcome to you know invite us to


---------28:17----------
kind of stay with a particular topic I'm


---------28:19----------
just gonna kind of run with what I'm


---------28:21----------
hearing and and so can I just think for


---------28:26----------
a second absolutely sure yeah


---------28:40----------
so I'm just I'm struck by how not


---------28:45----------
mentalness is like I'm struck by like


---------28:49----------
the the words that you guys use do not


---------28:53----------
are not words of the mind like you you


---------28:56----------
guys use words like damaged or hungry or


---------28:59----------
even someone said coma I think did


---------29:02----------
someone use the word coma yeah yeah yeah


---------29:06----------
so so these are these are incredibly


---------29:08----------
physical physical words and and what I'm


---------29:13----------
hearing is that that actually your mind


---------29:15----------
sort of tries to fight against this


---------29:18----------
almost like tidal wave of like hunger or


---------29:22----------
demand and you can sort of like fight


---------29:25----------
that battle but it's kind of like trying


---------29:27----------
to keep the waves from washing on shore


---------29:29----------
like you're like you're like you're like


---------29:31----------
pushing you're pushing the water back


---------29:34----------
like with your hands and like you're


---------29:35----------
pushing and you're like no water it's


---------29:37----------
like don't come on to shore don't come


---------29:39----------
on to shore but there's only like so


---------29:41----------
long you can do that before like you


---------29:42----------
know that wave is just it's it there's a


---------29:44----------
certain there's a certain like finality


---------29:49----------
or futility or inevitability to like


---------29:51----------
what I'm hearing you guys describe is


---------29:54----------
that can I jump in and ask a question


---------29:56----------
yeah absolutely everyone else there do


---------29:59----------
you guys feel like your cravings are are


---------30:02----------
more or less re a less frequent when


---------30:05----------
you're out in public or when you're


---------30:07----------
actively engaged in something with


---------30:10----------
people yeah for me it's like a more


---------30:12----------
passive thing like it's still there it's


---------30:15----------
like being hungry almost oh yeah it


---------30:18----------
feels almost exactly like being hungry


---------30:20----------
for food like it'll be there but when


---------30:23----------
you're focused on something that


---------30:24----------
requires your attention that isn't it


---------30:26----------
that's a necessity it uh sort of forces


---------30:30----------
it back with sort of like an equivalent


---------30:32----------
force it's like two tidal waves crashing


---------30:34----------
against each other in that sort of


---------30:37----------
analogy yeah yeah go ahead sorry I feel


---------30:43----------
like when the that emotion is as strong


---------30:45----------
this is like when I'm really not doing


---------30:47----------
anything like when I'm not being


---------30:51----------
productive with anything I'm just like


---------30:52----------
sitting there


---------30:53----------
and then I end up doing it mmm so Harold


---------31:20----------
I thought I saw you or heard you say


---------31:25----------
something like when you out or when you


---------31:27----------
are in public it is easier to deal with


---------31:30----------
yeah well actually me when I'm in public


---------31:32----------
I probably most of the time I don't have


---------31:35----------
any urges at all especially like in open


---------31:40----------
spaces like when I'm out for a walk or


---------31:42----------
something or on campus or something


---------31:44----------
I just don't get actually almost any


---------31:47----------
urges at all it's really just when I'm


---------31:49----------
like working at home alone or something


---------31:51----------
or with a few people or something like


---------31:54----------
that but in public I just don't get them


---------31:56----------
at all okay so so so for some people it


---------32:00----------
sounds like it's kind of in the back of


---------32:02----------
your mind in public for other people it


---------32:04----------
seems like being in public or being some


---------32:06----------
otherwise engaged is it really does help


---------32:09----------
and and I'm hearing that idleness of the


---------32:13----------
mind really is is like let's some of


---------32:16----------
those thoughts and feelings kind of come


---------32:20----------
out it just opens the gate definitely


---------32:23----------
okay what do y'all think about that I


---------32:29----------
see two sides to the coin I don't know


---------32:32----------
what it is but I see I don't know maybe


---------32:36----------
there's a root cause to our different


---------32:39----------
problems between us okay what do you


---------32:43----------
think that root causes


---------32:50----------
let's hear it Aaron well I've been able


---------32:54----------
to so I've been to a bit of therapy and


---------32:57----------
stuff good for you man so I've been able


---------32:59----------
to yeah thank you I've been able to like


---------33:02----------
sort of trace back to where it came from


---------33:05----------
I went through a a similar event when I


---------33:10----------
was seven years old was sort of forcibly


---------33:14----------
sexually awakened and caused like a sort


---------33:21----------
of innocent curiosity to sort of process


---------33:26----------
what actually happened to me


---------33:28----------
and once I exposed myself to the world


---------33:35----------
of porn I was way too young to really


---------33:37----------
sort of properly handle it and process


---------33:41----------
it healthily and so it became like an


---------33:43----------
obsession like when I first started out


---------33:46----------
I didn't even masturbate I didn't really


---------33:49----------
have those urges at that age but uh once


---------33:53----------
said um do you what do you remember what


---------33:57----------
the draw was but before you started


---------34:00----------
masturbating it was like I said almost


---------34:06----------
like a curiosity and then it was still


---------34:10----------
like a slight like dopamine kick and I


---------34:16----------
guess it also helped ease some sort of


---------34:19----------
like social anxieties that I may have


---------34:21----------
had at that age hmm and ghosts I saw you


---------34:24----------
nodding along yeah a lot of it resonated


---------34:29----------
what resonated with you um what he said


---------34:36----------
about the sort of curiosity and need to


---------34:39----------
understand and I feel like I also had a


---------34:44----------
pre-emptive sexual awakening when I was


---------34:46----------
a child but a lot of the memories are


---------34:47----------
sort of blacked out and I've come to a


---------34:49----------
lot of realizations about what that


---------34:51----------
means but I remember on making like


---------34:55----------
sexually inappropriate jokes but a very


---------34:58----------
young age before most people know


---------35:00----------
anything about it


---------35:01----------
and I didn't really know where that came


---------35:03----------
from and it feels like my mind is


---------35:06----------
constantly blocking out the source and


---------35:08----------
porn is somehow my minds way of trying


---------35:13----------
to go back and explore something that I


---------35:15----------
some sort of trauma that hasn't been


---------35:19----------
resolved and it feels like when like


---------35:25----------
it's filling a void and at tons in my


---------35:27----------
life where I felt wholesome or


---------35:28----------
appreciated my urges have completely


---------35:32----------
disappeared like when I had a girlfriend


---------35:35----------
I didn't I didn't have any edges at all


---------35:45----------
who who resonates with ghosts like


---------35:48----------
depiction of like is that what's


---------35:52----------
happening to you guys I don't actually


---------35:55----------
resonate with that and actually the


---------35:58----------
complete opposite and by the way before


---------36:00----------
I keep talking is my mic okay yeah we're


---------36:03----------
good man


---------36:04----------
we're good squash does a lot better


---------36:06----------
sounds a lot better good I actually was


---------36:10----------
the complete opposite because when I


---------36:13----------
actually had a girlfriend around I found


---------36:15----------
myself when she wouldn't give me what I


---------36:17----------
want I would turn to porn more and I


---------36:20----------
would actually start to use it as a kind


---------36:23----------
of scapegoat to get away from certain


---------36:25----------
things when she was annoying me or when


---------36:26----------
she was upsetting me and I wanted to get


---------36:29----------
away from her and just worry about


---------36:30----------
myself and give in to my own selfish


---------36:32----------
desires I would turn to porn and porn


---------36:35----------
was really a safe spot for me in that


---------36:37----------
regard but you know the relationship


---------36:39----------
ended bad and ever since then it's like


---------36:42----------
it got wrapped up twelvefold so you know


---------36:45----------
now I'm at a place in my life at 24


---------36:48----------
where it's like I want to reach out I


---------36:50----------
want to have more relationships and the


---------36:53----------
relationship I've had with porn when it


---------36:56----------
came to having a girlfriend it's like it


---------36:57----------
didn't matter like I still watched it


---------36:59----------
and I still went to it you sound you


---------37:02----------
sound like you judge yourself a lot for


---------37:04----------
that squash my doctor came I think way


---------37:08----------
too much my friend I think way too much


---------37:10----------
what do you think about yourself fur fur


---------37:13----------
what's that judgment I hear I hear


---------37:16----------
almost self-hatred yes and it does stem


---------37:21----------
a lot from the incident I had as a kid


---------37:26----------
because I never wanted anything to deal


---------37:32----------
with it and it never was something that


---------37:36----------
I wanted and it kind of happened and


---------37:39----------
there's no turning back you know there's


---------37:42----------
no change in the past there's no fixing


---------37:44----------
anything or changing anything but


---------37:45----------
honestly I never wanted this you know


---------37:48----------
when I think about the journey that I've


---------37:50----------
been on so far I was 11 years old it's


---------37:58----------
just it's it's very powerful what what


---------38:09----------
was powerful Richard I completely agree


---------38:13----------
I saw


---------38:18----------
let me think there's a lot of power and


---------38:25----------
being vulnerable to like what life


---------38:28----------
throws at you and I just saw like the


---------38:33----------
way that you're dealing with it I see


---------38:35----------
sorry can you guys feel my dog yeah a


---------38:38----------
little bit let me take care of that


---------38:41----------
really quick right after a lot of power


---------38:44----------
and being able to you know you know I


---------38:48----------
don't know I'm lost on this dr. Cammie


---------38:51----------
that's oh that's okay Richard so I think


---------38:54----------
what I'm hearing squash so I thought


---------38:55----------
that was it so what I'm hearing is that


---------38:57----------
like people are affected by what you had


---------39:00----------
to say something about squash just


---------39:03----------
speaking your truth which by the way I


---------39:06----------
mean you say you've been dealing with


---------39:07----------
the witness for 13 years and it's hard


---------39:09----------
it dude it sounds [ __ ] impossible


---------39:12----------
like heart heart is the understatement


---------39:14----------
of the year man yeah it's it's one of


---------39:21----------
those things where I tell myself every


---------39:24----------
single day that it's something I can be


---------39:25----------
and honestly just so the stream knows


---------39:28----------
last night was I want to say the first


---------39:32----------
night in a long time that I had enough


---------39:34----------
motivation that it just never even


---------39:36----------
crossed my mind and we're helping the


---------39:38----------
same routine man for the past so long


---------39:42----------
but last night it was one of the first


---------39:44----------
nights where I said you know what I'm


---------39:46----------
putting myself first I'm gonna put the


---------39:48----------
stream first tomorrow I'm gonna not do


---------39:52----------
it and I didn't and it felt great but


---------39:54----------
you know I think what was powerful about


---------39:57----------
what I said dr. kay is that you know


---------39:59----------
everyone always has different


---------40:01----------
experiences and everyone's always going


---------40:03----------
to experience things differently but the


---------40:06----------
thing when it comes to porn addiction


---------40:07----------
for me that I want to tell the world if


---------40:10----------
I could it's just that like it's really


---------40:13----------
not worth it in the end it's really not


---------40:16----------
because it changes your relationships


---------40:18----------
that changes the way you see people but


---------40:20----------
I know that will maybe get down to it


---------40:22----------
further down the line but you know yeah


---------40:24----------
that's that's how I feel and it sounded


---------40:27----------
like Virgil did I did I hear you say


---------40:29----------
something kind of aligned with what


---------40:31----------
squash was saying I thought I heard you


---------40:33----------
comment yes sir the the thing that it


---------40:37----------
really resonated with me with what


---------40:40----------
squash said was that you know I I didn't


---------40:44----------
I didn't want this for myself I don't


---------40:46----------
think any of us here want this for


---------40:48----------
ourselves we don't want to view the


---------40:51----------
world through this this destructive and


---------40:54----------
damaging lens that just seems to never


---------40:57----------
go away it just it hangs over your head


---------40:59----------
like a cloud constantly and it's


---------41:04----------
something that I wish I could I wish I


---------41:09----------
could fix it feels unfixable first yeah


---------41:16----------
so so this is gonna sound kind of


---------41:18----------
bizarre I think you guys can get better


---------41:21----------
but I don't think that this is something


---------41:23----------
that you can fix


---------41:25----------
like like fixing implies that there's


---------41:29----------
something that I don't know how else to


---------41:31----------
put this but I mean I think what you


---------41:33----------
need to be is is healed not fixed like


---------41:37----------
you're not broken like that so though


---------41:42----------
I'm reeling to be completely honest guys


---------41:45----------
because I have never I've worked with


---------41:47----------
people who have had sexual addictions


---------41:49----------
before I've worked with people who have


---------41:51----------
had porn addictions before but I don't


---------41:53----------
know if they were just you know cuz it's


---------41:55----------
different because you're sitting in an


---------41:56----------
office and you're you're talking to


---------41:59----------
another person or there's some degree of


---------42:01----------
shame or or what but you guys have


---------42:03----------
really just opened my eyes to first of


---------42:05----------
all I've never thought of porn addiction


---------42:08----------
is something that afflicts you like we


---------42:13----------
think about like diseases as things that


---------42:15----------
happen to you right like I got the flu


---------42:18----------
like I'm not the flu it's something that


---------42:21----------
happened to me and I I don't even myself


---------42:26----------
like when I think about you know let's


---------42:28----------
say like a marijuana addiction I don't


---------42:29----------
think about a marijuana addiction like


---------42:31----------
happening to someone it's not like


---------42:33----------
you're walking down the street and you


---------42:34----------
contract a marijuana addiction but what


---------42:37----------
I'm hearing from you guys is that like


---------42:39----------
actually you guys like contracted this


---------42:42----------
that there's a there's a disturbing


---------42:44----------
amount of commonality with your story


---------42:47----------
about being exposed to sexual images


---------42:50----------
like way before puberty before


---------42:52----------
understanding what it was and like your


---------42:55----------
mind almost having a non sexualized like


---------42:58----------
bizarre like fascination with some


---------43:02----------
images or things like that and then


---------43:04----------
y'all are kind of like off to the races


---------43:05----------
and it sounds like in a lot of cases


---------43:07----------
there's actually like Frank trauma yeah


---------43:10----------
doctor can I ask you a question sure go


---------43:15----------
for it man you know it's one of those


---------43:22----------
things that it's like it was forced on


---------43:25----------
you it was not something that you wanted


---------43:27----------
but my question to you is how much of I


---------43:31----------
don't want to you know it to sound too


---------43:33----------
weird but I guess I can just call it


---------43:35----------
like the human element of just trying


---------43:37----------
something to try it


---------43:38----------
how much of that da truly believe comes


---------43:40----------
into play when it comes to things like


---------43:43----------
pornography and even going to it for the


---------43:45----------
first time because even there sometimes


---------43:47----------
there's trauma there sometimes there's


---------43:49----------
other things but for the most part


---------43:51----------
people go to it because they're


---------43:53----------
fascinated by it they're like oh it's


---------43:55----------
this thing this thing looks so cool


---------43:57----------
let's check it out boy what do you say


---------44:00----------
to the people who just had the curiosity


---------44:01----------
and just went for it


---------44:04----------
um so oh so you're saying that that that


---------44:09----------
what would I say to people who just


---------44:11----------
became curious about porn there wasn't


---------44:14----------
any kind of trauma or anything like that


---------44:16----------
and they just went for it and because


---------44:17----------
they went for it they became addicted


---------44:20----------
yes my situation was yeah so here's what


---------44:33----------
I would say so I think just about every


---------44:39----------
kid I would imagine or most kids at some


---------44:43----------
point get curious about pornography and


---------44:45----------
go for it


---------44:46----------
like that's a completely normal


---------44:48----------
experience right are we agreed on that


---------44:51----------
and I'm so so remember that a disease or


---------44:57----------
when I think of kind of problems or


---------44:58----------
addictions especially is when something


---------45:01----------
within you meets the environment in a


---------45:05----------
particular way that is like catastrophic


---------45:08----------
right it's it's not just like kids get


---------45:10----------
exposed to alcohol and marijuana all the


---------45:12----------
time some people become addicted why is


---------45:15----------
that other people do not become addicted


---------45:17----------
why is that so there's something about


---------45:20----------
either there's a biological


---------45:22----------
predisposition or that exposure to porn


---------45:25----------
or curiosity about porn happened in a


---------45:28----------
particular circumstance


---------45:30----------
that allowed the addiction to happen


---------45:32----------
instead of just like being a 15 year old


---------45:35----------
kid and like finding porn and jerking


---------45:37----------
off right which is like a pretty normal


---------45:40----------
experience so something is different I


---------45:44----------
still think that III don't this doesn't


---------45:48----------
sound and I I don't mean to say you guys


---------45:50----------
are abnormal but this doesn't sound


---------45:51----------
normal


---------45:52----------
to me this sounds this sounds like an


---------45:54----------
affliction like you guys are using this


---------45:56----------
word these words like damaging right you


---------45:58----------
guys like something is going on in your


---------46:00----------
mind that is not really like even start


---------46:03----------
it doesn't even sound start like it


---------46:05----------
sounds out sort of sexual it's it's like


---------46:08----------
some kind of weird curiosity where


---------46:11----------
there's some part of your brain which


---------46:13----------
doesn't understand why this thing is so


---------46:16----------
cool


---------46:17----------
but like it scratches a niche in your


---------46:19----------
neurons and then before you know it


---------46:22----------
you're like scratching that itch over


---------46:24----------
and over and over and over and over


---------46:25----------
again this I don't know how how many


---------46:31----------
other people will feel this way but it's


---------46:32----------
sort of you mentioned isolation


---------46:38----------
previously yeah and it feels like


---------46:40----------
pornography can kind of in a really


---------46:45----------
perverse way sort of not satisfied but I


---------46:49----------
guess placate that need for human


---------46:51----------
connection like when you feel really


---------46:55----------
alone when I'm around people who I feel


---------46:58----------
care about me the the urge goes away and


---------47:03----------
it's not because I'm sexually satisfied


---------47:05----------
it's just that I feel whole I guess and


---------47:10----------
it's sort of like it's just filling that


---------47:13----------
void that you're numbing yourself like


---------47:17----------
it's a sedative almost at times that's


---------47:20----------
what I can feel like yeah I'd say very


---------47:25----------
very similar experiences and we both


---------47:28----------
feel very in the same way about it he


---------47:31----------
basically said everything that I wish I


---------47:34----------
could have said yeah in that squash


---------47:37----------
talking yes sir


---------47:39----------
and


---------47:41----------
what what about Virgil's experience


---------47:44----------
resonated with you squash can you just


---------47:46----------
name it what he said specifically when


---------47:50----------
in the beginning when he was talking


---------47:53----------
about how porn addiction kind of just


---------47:56----------
you know it's and I'm listening and I'm


---------47:59----------
hearing back what you said at dr. K when


---------48:01----------
you said it's a dopamine itch and you


---------48:03----------
just keep scratching and scratching and


---------48:04----------
scratching because I never thought of it


---------48:06----------
like that before


---------48:07----------
and the way that I view and urge when I


---------48:11----------
personally want to watch porn


---------48:13----------
it's that itch you know it's that issue


---------48:14----------
just got to scratch it but with what


---------48:16----------
Virgil said my point was just I agree


---------48:19----------
with everything of what he was saying


---------48:21----------
what he was saying about how it makes


---------48:24----------
him feel I feel very similar along those


---------48:26----------
lines and in Virgil how does porn make


---------48:29----------
you feel it's just um it's it's kind of


---------48:36----------
difficult to to verbalize for me but it


---------48:41----------
feels isolating it feels like it feels


---------48:49----------
like I I have some sort of itch that I


---------48:52----------
can't scratch like it feels like a like


---------48:56----------
a physical affliction like like it's a


---------48:58----------
part of me and I can't necessarily but


---------49:02----------
like the trouble that I have is trying


---------49:06----------
to that part of me that that's been


---------49:10----------
affecting me for more than 10 years of


---------49:12----------
my life because I just I just want to


---------49:15----------
feel like normal I don't I don't feel


---------49:19----------
normal right now I know that sounds kind


---------49:22----------
of oh no no it's okay guys I can I think


---------49:26----------
for a second yeah


---------49:29----------
I think I'm understanding something I


---------49:32----------
just need to understand what I'm


---------49:35----------
understanding yeah so I think I think


---------49:56----------
I'm hopeful okay that's I was confusing


---------50:00----------
what I was feeling for a little bit but


---------50:02----------
it was hope okay it's good and here's


---------50:08----------
the reason I'm hopeful so if we think


---------50:14----------
about medicine or mental health when


---------50:17----------
when there are shared experiences


---------50:19----------
amongst people that means like


---------50:21----------
scientifically like something's going on


---------50:23----------
right if you have if you just have like


---------50:26----------
a one-off event science is gonna have


---------50:29----------
trouble understanding that it's when we


---------50:31----------
have a repeated observation over and


---------50:34----------
over and over again that we can begin to


---------50:36----------
understand something and if we can


---------50:39----------
understand it I believe that you know


---------50:40----------
that significantly improves our chances


---------50:42----------
of improving it or fixing it here's what


---------50:46----------
I'm hearing from you guys this is not


---------50:51----------
there's a sense of hole there's a sense


---------50:54----------
of warmth there's a sense of isolation


---------50:56----------
there's a sense of something on that


---------51:00----------
spectrum which somewhere along the way


---------51:03----------
when y'all were young something [ __ ]


---------51:05----------
that up it just came in and it [ __ ] it


---------51:08----------
up and I'm not quite sure how and and


---------51:11----------
now what it is is you guys have this


---------51:13----------
this hunger the sense of isolation the


---------51:16----------
sense of loneliness the sense of not


---------51:18----------
being understood and then along comes


---------51:21----------
porn which is your brains way of like


---------51:23----------
taking that away for a little while


---------51:25----------
bird and and so you might imagine


---------51:30----------
absolutely and so you guys have this


---------51:32----------
sense that okay and then we get into the


---------51:34----------
situation that y'all are in now where


---------51:35----------
like you can only like fight off hunger


---------51:39----------
for so long right and all of you guys


---------51:41----------
are using this strategy of


---------51:43----------
like fighting off hunger which if you


---------51:45----------
think about it that's just not gonna


---------51:47----------
work right you can't fight off like


---------51:51----------
hunger needs to be satisfied


---------51:54----------
the thing is though what you guys do


---------51:57----------
doesn't truly satisfy that hunger like


---------52:01----------
the hunger is partially for porn but


---------52:04----------
it's like partially for something else


---------52:06----------
does that make sense


---------52:08----------
yeah it's like you're eating shitty food


---------52:13----------
and it feels like it's the only food


---------52:14----------
available yeah I never cure hunger but


---------52:17----------
you can eat better food and so I think


---------52:21----------
that if you guys want to be free of this


---------52:23----------
and I do believe and this could be a


---------52:25----------
little bit you know stupid I do believe


---------52:28----------
that people's like mental health can be


---------52:30----------
substantially like improved I don't


---------52:32----------
think it's a lifelong struggle I just


---------52:34----------
kind of choose not to believe that I've


---------52:36----------
seen enough stuff in my personal career


---------52:38----------
to where I people I think people can


---------52:39----------
really like conquer what we call quote


---------52:41----------
unquote mental illness right doesn't


---------52:43----------
mean that they don't need to be on


---------52:45----------
medication or that it won't crop up from


---------52:47----------
time to time but I think you can


---------52:48----------
basically live a normal life like that's


---------52:50----------
my target I don't set my target any


---------52:53----------
lower that and I think you guys can live


---------52:54----------
a normal life I think what it comes down


---------52:57----------
to is understanding that this thing you


---------53:01----------
guys can't fight the hunger you're just


---------53:04----------
not going to be able to so the question


---------53:06----------
is how do you satisfy that in the way


---------53:08----------
that is like healthy and good because I


---------53:11----------
I don't think that that hunger I don't


---------53:13----------
think your body is stupidly hungry right


---------53:16----------
I think in each of y'all's cases


---------53:17----------
something happened to you that you


---------53:19----------
became damaged or busted in some way and


---------53:22----------
and something within you is just


---------53:24----------
striving to be like whole again that's


---------53:27----------
what I'm hearing from you all that is


---------53:29----------
that you all want to be whole again yeah


---------53:32----------
desandem oh sorry go for it buddy this


---------53:38----------
might sound wild I don't know if this is


---------53:40----------
gonna resonate with anyone but there are


---------53:43----------
times where I've it feels like you can


---------53:46----------
be so addicted to porn that I've


---------53:48----------
preferred porn over sex which might


---------53:51----------
sound crazy to some people but it really


---------53:54----------
can


---------53:55----------
it feels like it because it's a solo


---------53:59----------
activity there's more I feel like I'm


---------54:03----------
still stuck in my head having sex


---------54:06----------
because there's another person there and


---------54:07----------
I can't get that same feeling of escape


---------54:10----------
agree yeah it's almost like another


---------54:16----------
element of control that you have as well


---------54:18----------
at least it's Saudis yeah yeah the


---------54:22----------
situation so so not to be indelicate but


---------54:27----------
I don't think sex and what y'all are


---------54:29----------
dealing with is the same at all they're


---------54:31----------
like completely different phenomenon


---------54:33----------
right yeah and just because you not at


---------54:36----------
the end does not mean it's similar at


---------54:38----------
all right and and and that's my whole


---------54:42----------
point is that I think we need to like if


---------54:44----------
we want to get better or make you guys


---------54:46----------
whole again


---------54:47----------
we have to like really understand what


---------54:50----------
it is and what it isn't and let's take a


---------54:51----------
step back and not judge it and just


---------54:53----------
assume that sex is gonna be a


---------54:55----------
replacement for this because that


---------54:56----------
doesn't sound like that's the same thing


---------54:59----------
at all right it's not just about


---------55:01----------
ejaculation


---------55:02----------
it's not about arousal it's not just


---------55:04----------
about sexuality but it does get muddled


---------55:07----------
together with those things yeah when I


---------55:13----------
was doing no five before the Blacktip


---------55:16----------
month every time I did that the geared I


---------55:19----------
will do push-ups and I was trying to do


---------55:22----------
100 pushups a day and I felt like it


---------55:25----------
helped because I was sort of releasing


---------55:27----------
energy it's like I didn't feel like


---------55:31----------
fapping was the thing that it was gonna


---------55:34----------
be it's kind of hard to put it in in


---------55:37----------
words but like Bucky transmuted it yeah


---------55:40----------
yeah like I the urge wasn't really for


---------55:42----------
the fapping was more like releasing the


---------55:44----------
energy if that makes sense


---------55:45----------
yep and I think because I was so


---------55:51----------
addicted like the only way I saw of


---------55:54----------
releasing that energy was riffing off


---------55:58----------
okay so


---------56:00----------
Harold it looked like you wanted started


---------56:02----------
not Harold um Aaron it looked like you


---------56:03----------
wanted to say something yeah


---------56:07----------
when yeah I also in firmly an agreement


---------56:13----------
that it can be healed and it can be done


---------56:17----------
like I guess overcoming this because no


---------56:23----------
but I've done it before yeah I've done


---------56:29----------
it before and what it required was sort


---------56:37----------
of yeah fulfilling that void that is


---------56:40----------
there that sort of the porn addiction


---------56:43----------
kind of just barely emptily feels what I


---------56:49----------
found was very helpful is just having


---------56:51----------
that like being able to be open about it


---------56:55----------
and face it head-on


---------56:57----------
actually during that time of two years I


---------57:01----------
didn't have I had a girlfriend but I


---------57:03----------
didn't have sex so it wasn't even like


---------57:05----------
sex was a replacement for it was just


---------57:08----------
being appreciated and being in a lot of


---------57:13----------
healthy relationships and also having a


---------57:19----------
dharma to also mention that having some


---------57:26----------
sort of like purpose that allows you to


---------57:28----------
push forward that helps a lot as well


---------57:32----------
thanks for sharing dr. Kato for what he


---------57:36----------
said yeah please man go for it


---------57:39----------
I for me own personally I related to


---------57:43----------
that because it really just takes a lot


---------57:47----------
of energy to actually fight the urges


---------57:50----------
and I realized that last night as I was


---------57:54----------
laying in bed it was like nine o'clock


---------57:56----------
and I was playing in Grand Theft Auto


---------57:57----------
and I'm sitting there and I'm thinking


---------57:58----------
like I totally can


---------58:01----------
just yesterday there's no problem


---------58:03----------
there's no issue like how much porn it's


---------58:04----------
not a big deal but then I kind of


---------58:06----------
stopped and I really paused and I said


---------58:08----------
to myself like dude you don't want to do


---------58:11----------
it there's no reason for you to do it


---------58:13----------
but


---------58:14----------
the amount of energy and the amount of


---------58:17----------
strength it took for me to just simply


---------58:20----------
like not do it it was really interesting


---------58:23----------
to me to see it because I've never seen


---------58:25----------
that before in my entire life and for


---------58:28----------
the first time last night when I stopped


---------58:30----------
I was just like wow dude like I'm six


---------58:33----------
foot seven and I'm a lot stronger than I


---------58:35----------
think you know it's like I I like to


---------58:38----------
think of myself is so small and I like


---------58:40----------
to think of myself there's like so tiny


---------58:42----------
dude but it's like I'm six seven like


---------58:44----------
I'm a big guy I'm a strong dude I like


---------58:46----------
to move I like to release energy and


---------58:48----------
[ __ ] but it's like to stop it it just


---------58:51----------
takes a lot man it takes a lot yeah so I


---------58:55----------
think that's that's because the some


---------58:57----------
scar so I'm [ __ ] amazed by also


---------59:00----------
understanding of Sanskrit concepts so


---------59:02----------
props to y'all so I'm just gonna dive


---------59:03----------
right in okay and if I leave someone


---------59:05----------
behind just please let us know so I


---------59:07----------
think that's because the some scar that


---------59:09----------
forms that is hungry is not six foot


---------59:12----------
seven it's like an 11 year old kid yes


---------59:21----------
right so Harold I think you said yes


---------59:25----------
first yeah well actually I said yeah


---------59:34----------
because I thought it was interesting


---------59:35----------
because for me it's not really it's hard


---------59:38----------
to place the age of that some scar it's


---------59:41----------
kind of like this it for me it's such an


---------59:44----------
alien thing in my mind that I can't


---------59:46----------
really compare it to any age it's like


---------59:50----------
this thing I don't know it's it's hungry


---------59:53----------
thing yeah yeah like a hungry beast kind


---------59:57----------
of a thing like a blob I don't know yeah


---------59:59----------
so how long has it been with you Harold


---------60:01----------
uh well for me I started like around ten


---------60:05----------
eleven like most of these people uh and


---------60:10----------
so at first it wasn't really that bad I


---------60:14----------
mean I some some guy told talk to me


---------60:17----------
about porn like in elementary school and


---------60:20----------
so I just looked it up and I didn't


---------60:22----------
really get hooked on it then then right


---------60:25----------
then but then


---------60:27----------
I'm guessing it's because as I got into


---------60:30----------
middle school and I I was like having


---------60:33----------
trouble with like finding friends


---------60:38----------
especially like good friends I was I had


---------60:42----------
bad I was in this group of friends but I


---------60:43----------
I just knew they weren't really you know


---------60:47----------
great people for me but I I was just


---------60:49----------
sort of lost in essence and so I guess I


---------60:53----------
gravitated more towards porn like then


---------60:55----------
especially because those friends


---------60:57----------
actually talked about it as well with me


---------61:00----------
and so they just talked about as like


---------61:03----------
this cool thing and you know it just I


---------61:05----------
think that it helped to solidify my


---------61:10----------
attachment to it and then I just started


---------61:13----------
it Korea was kind of a gradual thing I


---------61:16----------
just I started watching more and more


---------61:18----------
but super slowly cuz like throughout the


---------61:23----------
middle school years it got worse and


---------61:26----------
worse at but it wasn't really as often


---------61:29----------
as some people have said again sometimes


---------61:32----------
it was three times per day but usually


---------61:34----------
was like once a day I don't know where


---------61:38----------
I'm going with this uh know I mean III


---------61:40----------
think it you know Harold so guys by the


---------61:44----------
way y'all don't have to make sense okay


---------61:46----------
just to be clear so like you're not here


---------61:49----------
to make sense that's my job I'm supposed


---------61:52----------
to take whatever you guys so don't worry


---------61:54----------
about making sense okay I'm just just


---------61:57----------
the more you guys I think share with


---------61:59----------
each other so first of all you guys I


---------62:02----------
don't know if you all like how does it


---------62:03----------
feel to be talking about this by the way


---------62:06----------
um at first I was very nervous about it


---------62:11----------
considering like the overall stigma on


---------62:15----------
the topic and it's it's really easy for


---------62:18----------
people to laugh at the issue but you


---------62:20----------
know you're in our position you won't be


---------62:22----------
laughing then but now it just feels very


---------62:26----------
relieving to me


---------62:28----------
I agree go for it George


---------62:36----------
okay so it feels really really thing


---------62:38----------
because I've never talked about this


---------62:40----------
subject with anyone else like this is


---------62:42----------
the first time I'm actually talking with


---------62:43----------
someone about this


---------62:45----------
and so like hearing other people talk


---------62:48----------
about it just sharing my story like it


---------62:51----------
feels reliving it feels like unless how


---------62:55----------
do I put it


---------62:56----------
I'm less closed off I don't think that's


---------62:59----------
the word like I'm not as constrained as


---------63:03----------
I was like I yeah I cannot see that this


---------63:07----------
is nothing not something that only


---------63:09----------
happens to me like all I can relate to


---------63:11----------
the to the people in this group and this


---------63:14----------
people probably can relate to me and it


---------63:17----------
kind of makes like gives me a sense of


---------63:20----------
happiness because like okay I'm not


---------63:22----------
alone within this all right


---------63:25----------
abso-fucking-lutely so I I think I mean


---------63:28----------
I you know do you guys feel like the


---------63:30----------
people who are on this call understand


---------63:32----------
you yeah


---------63:34----------
what does that feel good like you're not


---------63:38----------
a freak yeah so so let me ask you guys


---------63:41----------
this the part of you that's hungry what


---------63:46----------
happens to that part when you're


---------63:48----------
understood by others goes away it's yes


---------63:53----------
right now it's gone completely gone it's


---------63:56----------
smaller so what do y'all think about


---------64:00----------
that it's it's it's just dr. K I've been


---------64:08----------
dealing with this for a really long time


---------64:11----------
and I'm not a social dude I don't have


---------64:13----------
any like Facebook I deleted all my


---------64:16----------
snapchat like I'm on nothing man it's


---------64:18----------
like I work I go to school I have a very


---------64:21----------
very small circle like I have a very


---------64:22----------
loving family and it's like I get really


---------64:25----------
lonely sometimes and it's just I said


---------64:27----------
you know what I'm gonna try this I'm


---------64:29----------
gonna see what this is like


---------64:31----------
and it's just this whole experience


---------64:32----------
chatting with everyone in the car just


---------64:35----------
not feeling like such a freak it's a


---------64:39----------
really rewarding thing and I'm very


---------64:42----------
thankful for that


---------64:43----------
yeah so I want you guys to just notice


---------64:46----------
this right cuz I don't think this gets


---------64:48----------
better through control control matters I


---------64:51----------
I think it gets better when whatever


---------64:54----------
that thing within you that is broken and


---------64:56----------
alone and sort of like wants to be in


---------64:59----------
the darkness but also like thrives on it


---------65:02----------
right like darkness [ __ ] feeds this


---------65:05----------
ship yes yes and and like you guys you


---------65:08----------
guys need the [ __ ] light man and in


---------65:11----------
the amazing thing is that when you put


---------65:13----------
light on it it just goes away it gets we


---------65:18----------
mentioned in the past that when


---------65:21----------
something is kept within like a Sun scar


---------65:23----------
it just grows until it eventually


---------65:24----------
consumes you and that's like a really


---------65:26----------
relatable feeling that that's that's


---------65:30----------
what's happening here guys is that you


---------65:32----------
guys have had this thing and just think


---------65:34----------
about how long you guys have been


---------65:35----------
carrying this how long it's been in your


---------65:38----------
basement and sort of like feeding off of


---------65:41----------
that darkness right like we're talking


---------65:43----------
like a decade or more for so it feels


---------65:48----------
really strong and you guys also go for


---------65:52----------
it okay um like earlier we were talking


---------65:55----------
about physical feelings like mentally


---------65:59----------
and I'm sort of I'm okay with talking


---------66:02----------
about this and I wasn't really that


---------66:04----------
anxious but when you join the core it


---------66:07----------
wasn't like a thought that hit me it was


---------66:08----------
this physical it felt like that got


---------66:12----------
agitated and it was like this wave of


---------66:14----------
energy sort of overwhelming my nervous


---------66:16----------
system like it was rushing through every


---------66:18----------
part of me really intensely and as the


---------66:21----------
calls gone on up so I've been able to


---------66:23----------
sit in the experience and my body is


---------66:25----------
sort of calming down which is quite a


---------66:26----------
refreshing feeling yeah so okay anybody


---------66:37----------
else want to add anything I think it's


---------66:39----------
all great yeah actually it it reminds me


---------66:43----------
of a lot of these times where I mean


---------66:46----------
I've gone sometimes without porn for a


---------66:49----------
long time like up to like 50 days one


---------66:51----------
time I think and then when you're


---------66:53----------
without it for a while and then you come


---------66:55----------
back to it you get like for me my whole


---------66:58----------
body just starts trembling like when I


---------67:00----------
see just one suggestive image like I


---------67:02----------
just started trembling like super


---------67:03----------
violently you know that's kind of the


---------67:05----------
same feeling I got when I joined the


---------67:06----------
stream as well it's like this thing is


---------67:07----------
like waking up it's freaky like it was


---------67:10----------
doing exactly yeah man this is some this


---------67:16----------
is some demonic possession level [ __ ]


---------67:18----------
man I don't know if anyone used the word


---------67:23----------
animalistic impulse but you know I don't


---------67:26----------
know if it's hardwired in our nature I


---------67:28----------
remember there was something that


---------67:30----------
someone told me humans are meant to mate


---------67:34----------
humans are made to survive that's it


---------67:37----------
we're married to mate and feed and then


---------67:41----------
we die and it's a really weird way to


---------67:43----------
think about that and I don't like seeing


---------67:47----------
it in that light so the thing with me is


---------67:49----------
I don't want to see it as like a monster


---------67:51----------
anymore for me it's like I train after I


---------67:54----------
masturbate I don't have the energy to go


---------67:56----------
to jujitsu I want to train then I


---------67:58----------
haven't gone to training in like two


---------68:00----------
weeks because I've been on a really bad


---------68:03----------
binge so I'm going to go to training I'm


---------68:06----------
gonna go to jujitsu and I'm gonna be


---------68:08----------
fine then I'm gonna be able to put the


---------68:10----------
energy in different places and not have


---------68:12----------
to rely on this crutch that I've been


---------68:15----------
dealing with her so long


---------68:18----------
can I get a [ __ ] yeah absolutely man so


---------68:27----------
so I okay I got a I just need a second


---------68:29----------
to think is that okay guys yeah yeah


---------68:52----------
okay all right I'm so I we could talk


---------69:00----------
more there's a lot of stuff we haven't


---------69:02----------
covered right so we haven't really


---------69:03----------
talked about nofap we haven't talked


---------69:05----------
about relationships I think all that


---------69:06----------
stuff is gonna be you know super


---------69:08----------
important to talk about but there's a


---------69:12----------
part of me that wants to help y'all and


---------69:16----------
I think we've done that already so I


---------69:18----------
feel good about that


---------69:20----------
but I want to help you guys more


---------69:21----------
concretely and so I want to talk to you


---------69:24----------
guys about solutions is that okay


---------69:27----------
yeah so the first thing is that this is


---------69:30----------
a physical thing this is not like you


---------69:33----------
guys aren't like mentally ill I mean


---------69:34----------
sure you I'm sure you meet some criteria


---------69:37----------
somewhere but like I don't I don't think


---------69:39----------
of this as a defect in your mind okay


---------69:41----------
III think about I mean there's just this


---------69:44----------
overwhelming sense that something


---------69:46----------
happened to you guys when y'all were


---------69:47----------
young and something kind of got damaged


---------69:50----------
and then that is a thing that is not bad


---------69:53----------
it's not evil it's just hungry


---------69:55----------
it's just unsatisfied and and whatever


---------70:00----------
that thing is that we call it loneliness


---------70:02----------
call it the beast call it a demon I I


---------70:04----------
don't think it's actually an evil thing


---------70:05----------
I think it just it just gets you know


---------70:09----------
it's gonna eat whatever it can however


---------70:12----------
it knows best does that make sense it's


---------70:17----------
kind of


---------70:18----------
it's kind of like a yeah absolutely it


---------70:22----------
was like the Strega yeah and and so I


---------70:25----------
think much like this trigga you can find


---------70:28----------
the princess underneath right so I think


---------70:31----------
that's that's actually what needs to


---------70:32----------
happen it's a really good analogy


---------70:34----------
actually wait what's this trigger people


---------70:39----------
who can explain this trick um but it's


---------70:42----------
like when does when the when a pregnant


---------70:45----------
mother dies and the baby is like cursed


---------70:48----------
and it comes out and it survives it just


---------70:52----------
eats the flesh of people and it's like


---------70:56----------
this one's the child pause pause for a


---------71:00----------
second so this is a fictional thing from


---------71:06----------
The Witcher if you guys have played The


---------71:08----------
Witcher if you all assume let's so


---------71:11----------
ghosts let's just start there right we


---------71:12----------
got to let people know it's not anyway


---------71:16----------
so it's like a cursed thing that's just


---------71:18----------
perpetually hungry so and if onlys is


---------71:22----------
like dead flesh then it's gonna be evil


---------71:24----------
but it doesn't necessarily have to be


---------71:26----------
yeah so it's kind of like a baby that's


---------71:30----------
you know tragic circumstances and all


---------71:32----------
that and then it kind of becomes a demon


---------71:33----------
sort of thing but so the first thing is


---------71:36----------
that I think that you know you guys are


---------71:37----------
just missing something that is is not I


---------71:40----------
mean it's not that y'all are like


---------71:42----------
morally defect it's that something


---------71:46----------
happened to you guys when y'all were


---------71:47----------
pretty young it sounds like and then


---------71:49----------
there's something within you that's just


---------71:51----------
hungry for wholeness for more for beyond


---------71:55----------
anything else what I'm sensing you guys


---------71:57----------
need is wholeness y'all just want to be


---------71:59----------
like whole and calm and like chillin in


---------72:02----------
the Sun and not like Hungary in like a


---------72:04----------
half thing that's like half living in


---------72:06----------
the basement and then you guys are


---------72:08----------
fighting this thing right because


---------72:09----------
sometimes it comes out of the basement


---------72:11----------
and sometimes you guys like you grab


---------72:13----------
like a chair and a whip and you guys


---------72:14----------
like drive it back into the basement and


---------72:16----------
then it's like down there and it's


---------72:18----------
mucking around for a while then it


---------72:19----------
bursts out again and then you guys are


---------72:21----------
in this constant war which you're just


---------72:23----------
not gonna win like that's not gonna be


---------72:24----------
how it works but there are things that


---------72:27----------
calm it down right there are things that


---------72:30----------
cause it to be like Morcant


---------72:32----------
and and that's actually like talking to


---------72:34----------
other people it's like recognizing that


---------72:37----------
oh there's like a half dozen dudes out


---------72:39----------
there who have like weird stringers in


---------72:41----------
their basement and and and somehow like


---------72:45----------
you feel like at peace and as long as


---------72:48----------
you the more that we can cultivate that


---------72:51----------
sense of wholeness and we'll get to how


---------72:53----------
to do that


---------72:54----------
and what I'm talking about is wholeness


---------72:56----------
I'm talking about warmth I'm talking


---------72:58----------
about connection the less powerful this


---------73:02----------
thing is going to become and our


---------73:05----------
strategy here go for it ghost oh sorry


---------73:08----------
it sort of feels like the idea Jung's


---------73:11----------
idea of like integrating the shadow if


---------73:14----------
you continue to just repress it it will


---------73:17----------
grow into this monster but it's a part


---------73:20----------
of you it's like a part of your soul


---------73:22----------
that you're oppressing and assumes that


---------73:24----------
you learn to integrate it into who you


---------73:25----------
are sooner you can feel holy yeah I


---------73:29----------
completely agree so I'm a big fan of


---------73:32----------
young and that's a big part of like my


---------73:34----------
general treatment approach right which


---------73:36----------
is that we are just like go said that we


---------73:38----------
have parts of us and then like we have


---------73:40----------
to bring those parts together because I


---------73:42----------
think this thing is not evil what it is


---------73:46----------
is hurt does that make sense like this


---------73:49----------
thing is just a gigantic ball of hurt


---------73:52----------
and then what it's done is it's managed


---------73:54----------
to find some circuit in your brain which


---------73:58----------
makes it feel a little bit better for a


---------73:59----------
little while and since that hurt in that


---------74:03----------
hunger there it's gonna like keep on


---------74:08----------
making you fat because like that's the


---------74:10----------
only way it knows how to feel like a


---------74:12----------
little bit better for a little for a


---------74:14----------
little while and so the solution here is


---------74:17----------
not to get like really really


---------74:18----------
controlling I mean we can talk about


---------74:20----------
that in terms of like resisting the urge


---------74:22----------
to fat because there may be some value


---------74:24----------
to that it's really in figuring out like


---------74:26----------
what is this hunger inside you and like


---------74:28----------
how can we calm that down how can we


---------74:31----------
help you feel like loved and whole and


---------74:33----------
accepted because the more you guys feel


---------74:37----------
that way and this is the other trend


---------74:38----------
that I'm noticing is that that you know


---------74:40----------
when you guys start to feel like


---------74:42----------
positivity in your life the thing


---------74:44----------
weakens so what we want to do is not


---------74:47----------
conquer it we want to like make it weak


---------74:51----------
we want to tame it not like destroy it


---------74:54----------
does that make sense yeah any questions


---------74:57----------
about that general idea like you who


---------74:59----------
here disagrees with what I'm saying and


---------75:01----------
sort of thinks like oh no this is like


---------75:02----------
we're completely off


---------75:04----------
I agree but um what one thing I sort


---------75:09----------
want to draw attention to I remember you


---------75:11----------
said something on another stream about


---------75:13----------
if someone is like anorexic and they're


---------75:17----------
cutting and they have like academic


---------75:20----------
problems you can start to solve one but


---------75:22----------
then the problem will manifest with the


---------75:24----------
others no it feels like there been times


---------75:26----------
in my life where I've been able to not


---------75:29----------
kick the addiction but I guess keep it


---------75:31----------
at bay for long enough to see that I


---------75:34----------
could live a better life without it and


---------75:36----------
that my life is better without it but


---------75:38----------
then it feels like I'm scared of my own


---------75:39----------
success and I get drawn back into it


---------75:43----------
because you default that there's


---------75:45----------
conflict and that's how it feels like


---------75:46----------
because you can't fall further than the


---------75:48----------
bottom of the pit yep so I was you you


---------75:52----------
jumped ahead a little bit but there's


---------75:53----------
there's one thing that I think is gonna


---------75:55----------
be really dangerous guys is that as you


---------75:58----------
guys get better this thing is gonna


---------76:02----------
start freaking the [ __ ] out and it's


---------76:04----------
going to be harder to resist because it


---------76:06----------
does not want to die and as you put


---------76:10----------
light on to it it's gonna feel afraid


---------76:12----------
that is dying this some weird like


---------76:16----------
psycho mumbo-jumbo kind of [ __ ] okay


---------76:19----------
so like this is not scientific but like


---------76:22----------
there's something within me that that


---------76:23----------
tells me that as you guys actually start


---------76:25----------
to get better as we start to sometimes


---------76:28----------
heal wounds they don't understand what


---------76:30----------
the [ __ ] is happening like there is some


---------76:32----------
part of you that's gonna be primitive


---------76:34----------
and it's gonna fight you tooth and nail


---------76:35----------
to bring you back to where you were


---------76:37----------
because the mind prefers what it knows


---------76:41----------
to what's good yeah actually when it's


---------76:46----------
especially when it's something that you


---------76:49----------
know you've become so used to and it


---------76:51----------
kind of gets part of your routine you


---------76:54----------
know


---------76:54----------
you do the same things every single day


---------76:56----------
and you don't even realize it the same


---------76:58----------
job the same school the same work same


---------77:01----------
wife same girlfriend you know it's it's


---------77:03----------
all a circle it's all one big circle


---------77:05----------
absolutely it's about breaking here's


---------77:09----------
the thing you guys have been struggling


---------77:11----------
with this for so long for so many years


---------77:14----------
we're talking a decade or more right for


---------77:16----------
many of y'all and so there's gonna be a


---------77:18----------
part of you that says even though your


---------77:20----------
life is shitty right now at least you


---------77:23----------
can survive I know you can survive I've


---------77:27----------
done it for a decade I can do it for


---------77:29----------
five more NBD


---------77:30----------
no big deal and there's gonna be a part


---------77:34----------
of there's gonna be a time and place


---------77:35----------
where actually I think you guys are


---------77:37----------
gonna need another level of courage to


---------77:40----------
actually like risk living a life without


---------77:42----------
this thing because then you don't know


---------77:44----------
if you're gonna be able to survive I


---------77:47----------
know it sounds completely crazy and I


---------77:52----------
honest you guys get what I'm saying


---------78:00----------
sorry cool so what I mean to say is that


---------78:04----------
there's actually gonna be a time where


---------78:06----------
right now you guys want to be free from


---------78:08----------
this right you are gonna have to fight a


---------78:12----------
battle because one day there's gonna be


---------78:14----------
a thought in your mind where you don't


---------78:16----------
want to be free of it you actually want


---------78:19----------
to go back that's gonna be a [ __ ]


---------78:22----------
hard battle does that make sense yeah


---------78:25----------
I've had literal flashbacks before when


---------78:29----------
I've like abstained I've had sudden


---------78:31----------
memories come to me of the process and


---------78:34----------
it feels like um like on its dying


---------78:37----------
breath it's desperately trying to pop up


---------78:39----------
one last fight and it feels like it


---------78:44----------
feels like a battle of forces within you


---------78:46----------
and that the whole you is like the body


---------78:50----------
on which these competing forces is


---------78:52----------
acting and you're just sort of watching


---------78:55----------
a war within yourselves yeah so you guys


---------78:57----------
have to watch out for this okay we're


---------78:59----------
gonna I mean this is I do not envy you


---------79:02----------
guys so up until this point I really


---------79:04----------
have not thought about this but this is


---------79:06----------
the one moment where I know


---------79:07----------
Arendt I mean I like I feel sad for your


---------79:10----------
situation because I think this is a


---------79:11----------
heart like it's hard to let go and


---------79:14----------
that's what you guys need to learn how


---------79:16----------
to do which is we're gonna get there but


---------79:19----------
you have to let go of wanting this thing


---------79:22----------
right you have to say to yourself at


---------79:24----------
some point like okay that's a life that


---------79:26----------
it's gonna tell you and you guys have we


---------79:29----------
haven't talked too much about


---------79:30----------
rationalizations and all that but you


---------79:31----------
guys know you remind relies all kinds of


---------79:33----------
[ __ ] to you so it's not about convincing


---------79:35----------
it that it's wrong because here's the


---------79:37----------
crazy thing it's not wrong that's your


---------79:40----------
buddy being controlled by the some scar


---------79:42----------
and it's not wrong that's why it's so


---------79:46----------
[ __ ] hard to argue against because


---------79:49----------
you guys are smart and the smarter you


---------79:52----------
are the better it's gonna be at coming


---------79:54----------
up with reasons to convince you so it's


---------79:58----------
not your self Bethell absolutely so it's


---------80:01----------
it's not about convincing it it's not


---------80:03----------
about fighting it it's about letting go


---------80:05----------
it's about saying yeah you're right


---------80:07----------
there are a thousand good reasons for me


---------80:10----------
to go back to that lifestyle there's


---------80:11----------
security there there's safety there I


---------80:13----------
get to be in control of the hurt inside


---------80:16----------
me and that's what you guys have to give


---------80:18----------
up that's what's [ __ ] hard because


---------80:20----------
right now you guys have a light switch


---------80:23----------
to control the hurt inside you you can


---------80:27----------
go to this thing in the heart inside you


---------80:29----------
gets taken care of for a little while in


---------80:32----------
a shitty way but it gets taken care of


---------80:34----------
and what you guys have to choose is a


---------80:36----------
life where you're no longer in control


---------80:38----------
of that hurt you got to give up this is


---------80:42----------
your [ __ ] cheat code it's the coping


---------80:45----------
mechanism for everything negative within


---------80:47----------
you what would you say if um if you feel


---------80:51----------
like there's immense sort of guilt and


---------80:55----------
shame within you from let's say age four


---------80:59----------
or five onwards and it feels like


---------81:01----------
there's this really dominant force in


---------81:04----------
you that feels that you deserve this


---------81:06----------
pain and you deserve to be in the pit


---------81:08----------
how would you say um yeah how would you


---------81:12----------
go about dealing with that


---------81:15----------
I mean I think that's the crux right


---------81:18----------
that's the damage that's the thing so I


---------81:23----------
think you've got to figure out you know


---------81:25----------
why you started believing yourself why


---------81:27----------
you started believing that about


---------81:29----------
yourself and then as long as you believe


---------81:32----------
that so that's what you have to let go


---------81:35----------
of so that that - and sorry if I'm


---------81:39----------
speaking abstractly because it's I mean


---------81:42----------
you weren't saying something vague but I


---------81:43----------
just don't know if other people are


---------81:45----------
gonna understand this


---------81:47----------
I feel like hopefully you will but so


---------81:50----------
there's something very possessive like


---------81:52----------
you want to hang on to that right


---------81:54----------
there's something very jealous about


---------81:56----------
your shame you're like you you deserve


---------81:59----------
this this is yours to bear it's mine


---------82:01----------
it's my precious right and you want to


---------82:06----------
hang on to it even though it makes you


---------82:07----------
feel bad you want to hang on to it you


---------82:10----------
gotta let go and this is the really


---------82:14----------
dangerous thing when it comes to like


---------82:16----------
letting go of negative feelings within


---------82:18----------
you like do you guys understand that


---------82:20----------
when you all have that negative feeling


---------82:21----------
with with you know since the age of five


---------82:23----------
you've had this thing and then now you


---------82:26----------
guys have walls that keep it at bay


---------82:30----------
which is the porn addiction you guys


---------82:33----------
build up walls to protect yourselves you


---------82:35----------
guys are are y'all are [ __ ] good


---------82:37----------
people right like I look at you guys and


---------82:41----------
I like each and every one of you I'm


---------82:44----------
surprised by how normal you are right


---------82:49----------
like you guys are normal people there's


---------82:52----------
nothing wrong with you that means a lot


---------82:56----------
coming from you dr. K and I know that's


---------82:58----------
a giant I know what abnormal looks like


---------83:03----------
I'm an expert at the abnormal and y'all


---------83:06----------
are [ __ ] normal you guys are just


---------83:09----------
normal people that had something [ __ ]


---------83:11----------
bad happen to you and then your brain is


---------83:13----------
wired a certain way and then you use


---------83:15----------
these you build up these walls around


---------83:17----------
all of these negative feelings and so


---------83:21----------
now you guys need immense courage


---------83:22----------
because taking those walls down is


---------83:25----------
[ __ ] it's hard because ghosts you


---------83:28----------
have to let


---------83:29----------
that shame run rampant through your mind


---------83:32----------
you have to open the door to that shame


---------83:35----------
because right now you keep it walled off


---------83:37----------
because you can control it is the fuss


---------83:39----------
though not just technology just breaking


---------83:42----------
the [ __ ] walls down and letting it


---------83:43----------
flood you that's what you've got to do


---------83:45----------
like sit in the experience absolutely


---------83:49----------
yeah I mean if you can observe it


---------83:52----------
fantastic I think you're gonna get


---------83:54----------
[ __ ] overwhelmed for a little while


---------83:56----------
and then you'll you got to come up for


---------83:58----------
air you know it's gonna wash over you so


---------84:02----------
I think at some point there's got to be


---------84:03----------
some letting go and in that kind of


---------84:05----------
stuff but I'm also like a really


---------84:07----------
practical guy like I can tell you guys


---------84:09----------
this weird [ __ ] abstract stuff


---------84:10----------
there's a there's a voice in the back of


---------84:12----------
my mind that's like what the [ __ ] are


---------84:13----------
these guys gonna do with that like I can


---------84:15----------
I can weave this beautiful symbolism and


---------84:17----------
then you know then you guys like log off


---------84:20----------
the call and then you know that what


---------84:29----------
let's talk concrete okay so we go into


---------84:34----------
more so like what it is to let go


---------84:37----------
good so first of all my approach to it


---------84:39----------
has always been rationalization and it's


---------84:41----------
always been an uphill battle what does


---------84:44----------
it mean to let go like is it just to


---------84:47----------
like be in the experience of it or um


---------84:51----------
I'm not quite sure yes you mean by


---------84:54----------
letting yeah great so I'm gonna tell you


---------84:56----------
guys so now we get to the concrete part


---------84:58----------
great great question Richard the first


---------85:01----------
thing is that this is something of your


---------85:02----------
body it is not necessarily of your mind


---------85:04----------
first thing you guys got to do is


---------85:06----------
something physical so who here goes to a


---------85:08----------
yoga class who has access to yoga you


---------85:10----------
guys do yoga all of you guys need to go


---------85:19----------
to yoga or Tai Chi either ones fine okay


---------85:23----------
and if you want to understand what


---------85:26----------
letting go is Richard do yoga then


---------85:29----------
you'll understand yoga okay can I can I


---------85:33----------
throw in another example and see if it


---------85:34----------
might work


---------85:35----------
so my I'm fairly blessed to have a sauna


---------85:41----------
inside my house and I use it very


---------85:43----------
regularly does it have the same kind of


---------85:46----------
effects as yoga or is there something


---------85:48----------
about the the experience of yoga when


---------85:52----------
you're using your body complex to you


---------85:55----------
know do yoga stuff yoga superior one is


---------85:59----------
making more receptive to endorphins


---------86:01----------
so saunas fantastic I think if you have


---------86:05----------
access to a sauna


---------86:06----------
first of all jealous much and then


---------86:09----------
secondly it is different okay so there's


---------86:15----------
overwhelming scientific research that


---------86:17----------
mind-body exercise practices are


---------86:19----------
superior to other exercise practices


---------86:23----------
okay so like there are lots of


---------86:25----------
randomized control trials that compare


---------86:27----------
yoga to exercise so the control you guys


---------86:30----------
know what I like how a randomized


---------86:32----------
control trial works okay just real quick


---------86:36----------
so what we do is we take we're studying


---------86:38----------
a condition let's say like depression or


---------86:40----------
anxiety and then so let's just say


---------86:42----------
anxiety and what we do is we take a


---------86:43----------
hundred people and we put 50 of them in


---------86:45----------
a control group and so the control group


---------86:48----------
is sometimes like an exercise class and


---------86:50----------
50 of them in a yoga class and then we


---------86:53----------
measure their anxiety like after eight


---------86:55----------
weeks and we see like what's going on so


---------86:57----------
yoga and Tai Chi have been shown to be


---------86:59----------
superior to exercise and it's probably


---------87:02----------
because they have a relatively mental


---------87:04----------
component so yoga and Tai Chi are both


---------87:06----------
mind-body practices they're like both


---------87:10----------
mental and physical practices they're


---------87:12----------
not just physical practices and for a


---------87:15----------
lot of people who exercise they over


---------87:17----------
time incorporate a mental component but


---------87:19----------
yoga and Tai Chi are like designed to be


---------87:22----------
mind-body practices whereas a lot of


---------87:23----------
people will discover a mental component


---------87:26----------
to their physical exercise but it's not


---------87:29----------
like baked-in like running is a good


---------87:30----------
example where people who are runners


---------87:32----------
will describe this kind of meditative


---------87:34----------
like state when they run for long


---------87:35----------
periods of time yeah but but I mean but


---------87:40----------
that's all


---------87:41----------
I mean it's Yoga is like designed to


---------87:43----------
sort of make you into a particular


---------87:45----------
mind-body space which I think is gonna


---------87:49----------
help you can I think question about yoga


---------87:52----------
yeah I remember I saw you


---------87:56----------
you you did an exercise with someone


---------87:59----------
where you had them buzz like a bee ah


---------88:02----------
and it really fascinated me and it made


---------88:05----------
me think about the connection between


---------88:07----------
the body and emotion and I was reading


---------88:09----------
about this idea that trauma is like


---------88:12----------
physically stored in the body I have


---------88:14----------
that Yoga is like opening a series of


---------88:16----------
chambers throughout the body and it sort


---------88:18----------
of allows the emotions to flow through


---------88:20----------
because like you know I don't know like


---------88:23----------
go on a like a tirade here but like if


---------88:26----------
your nervous system gets overwhelmed


---------88:27----------
like your body floods with the emotion


---------88:29----------
and they can just store it for years and


---------88:31----------
it can make you like physiologically it


---------88:33----------
increases like your morbidity and


---------88:34----------
everything and I was reading that Yoga


---------88:38----------
paired with therapy is better than


---------88:40----------
either one of them alone because Yoga


---------88:42----------
allows the emotions to flow through your


---------88:45----------
body so they can more easily be so


---------88:47----------
opened up and it was saying that memory


---------88:50----------
trauma and the body are all linked in


---------88:51----------
that way yeah so I believe most of that


---------88:56----------
although most of that is not scientific


---------88:58----------
right so so that there's like a lot of


---------89:01----------
pseudoscience around physical stuff and


---------89:04----------
trauma in my experience what I think is


---------89:06----------
much more scientifically valid is simply


---------89:08----------
that men experience emotions much more


---------89:12----------
physically than mentally so if you talk


---------89:15----------
to men like when you guys are talking


---------89:17----------
about like what are the words that we


---------89:20----------
use to describe this thing


---------89:26----------
physically it's like pop no we know we


---------89:31----------
don't use deceitful we haven't deceitful


---------89:33----------
has not been mentioned at all Mike point


---------89:34----------
entirely what is the actual language


---------89:36----------
that you guys used to describe this


---------89:38----------
hunger absolutely right you guys don't


---------89:41----------
think that's a [ __ ] emotion that's an


---------89:43----------
emotion right but you guys don't


---------89:48----------
understand what emotion it is but you


---------89:51----------
everyone understands like one person's


---------89:53----------
like hungry and that everyone else is


---------89:54----------
like yeah man like that's an emotion


---------89:59----------
right and and so with it I mean well the


---------90:05----------
whole point is that this is physical


---------90:07----------
like we've been [ __ ] talking about


---------90:08----------
trauma you guys have been traumatized


---------90:10----------
when you're all like ten and you guys


---------90:13----------
talk about hunger now like this is my


---------90:15----------
point is that that it's not the children


---------90:18----------
cry it's just like literally like this


---------90:19----------
is how we're like we're socialized to


---------90:22----------
experience emotion this way so we are


---------90:26----------
going to access this so I agree ghost


---------90:29----------
that Yoga is very helpful for trauma I


---------90:31----------
agree that trauma has I mean I think


---------90:34----------
anything in our mind has some kind of


---------90:36----------
physical manifestation or correlation


---------90:38----------
and a lot of this stuff about you know


---------90:41----------
using like physical like knots and and


---------90:43----------
energy and chakras like I buy into a lot


---------90:46----------
of that stuff but it's not actually


---------90:48----------
scientific okay so we just got to be a


---------90:50----------
little bit careful there so it doesn't


---------90:52----------
mean that it doesn't help it doesn't


---------90:53----------
mean that it isn't therapeutic and I'm


---------90:54----------
advocating yoga to you guys I think you


---------90:56----------
guys must do yoga because you have to


---------90:58----------
get in touch with your body because this


---------91:00----------
is a physical thing for y'all and in


---------91:03----------
yoga yoga is going to connect your


---------91:06----------
physical sensations with emotions


---------91:10----------
and it's also just you know does good


---------91:12----------
things for your immune system and things


---------91:14----------
like that


---------91:14----------
second thing yeah and so the goal of


---------91:18----------
yoga is to help you guys be in your body


---------91:20----------
and Richard when you say how do you let


---------91:23----------
go I mean so that's not something we can


---------91:28----------
talk about it more but my voice isn't


---------91:29----------
gonna last very long but I think it's


---------91:31----------
something that's merely something that


---------91:32----------
you have to you have to learn how to do


---------91:34----------
right like so if I took like a


---------91:35----------
two-year-old kid and I was teaching that


---------91:37----------
kid how to let go like how do I teach


---------91:41----------
that kid mm-hmm so it's a good question


---------91:45----------
I think as you do yoga you'll learn that


---------91:49----------
like getting into the right pose is not


---------91:52----------
about trying harder it's actually about


---------91:55----------
letting go would you say that Yoga is


---------91:59----------
for the body what meditation is for the


---------92:01----------
mind like it's almost this sort of


---------92:03----------
meditative process well yeah so


---------92:06----------
technically what Yoga is is a


---------92:10----------
premeditation state for it's like it's


---------92:14----------
to prepare your body for meditation and


---------92:17----------
Darren's the the when whenever you guys


---------92:20----------
are doing yoga so I'm gonna teach you


---------92:21----------
guys just a little bit about yoga


---------92:22----------
because there seems to be some curiosity


---------92:24----------
okay so the goal of yoga is to bring the


---------92:28----------
attention of your mind to the present so


---------92:31----------
we're gonna do we need Richard for this


---------92:34----------
because Richard has to okay we're gonna


---------92:37----------
I'm gonna teach you guys exactly what


---------92:39----------
yoga's so the goal of yoga is to bring


---------92:41----------
the attention of your mind to the


---------92:43----------
present and so the goal of doing all


---------92:45----------
like turning yourself into a human


---------92:46----------
pretzel is not to increase your


---------92:48----------
flexibility it's to adopt a particular


---------92:51----------
physical like posture that you can't


---------92:56----------
think about anything else okay so we're


---------93:00----------
gonna do this right now you guys ready


---------93:02----------
hold your arms up yeah and tell me


---------93:06----------
what's happening in your mind it's okay


---------93:14----------
okay so I want you guys to just notice


---------93:16----------
okay so arms up


---------93:19----------
so you guys are having thoughts but over


---------93:23----------
time what's gonna happen the physical


---------93:27----------
demands of your body arms up no pushing


---------93:30----------
to talk okay so just keep your arms up


---------93:34----------
so as your arms get tired just keep them


---------93:38----------
up there then it's gonna start demanding


---------93:41----------
your attention you guys feel that your


---------93:43----------
arms are like signaling to you now


---------93:44----------
they're like hey hey we're up here and


---------93:47----------
then the the further the longer we go


---------93:50----------
the more your attention is going to be


---------93:51----------
stuck in your arms does that make sense


---------93:54----------
the arms are demanding the attention


---------93:56----------
demanding your attention demanding your


---------93:59----------
attention notice what's happening in


---------94:00----------
your mind now close your eyes feel hold


---------94:09----------
it good now continue to feel you may


---------94:18----------
notice thoughts arise you may notice


---------94:21----------
perspiration okay now hold it hold it


---------94:30----------
hold it and now let go you feel that


---------94:42----------
Richard absolutely eyes closed


---------94:47----------
oh yeah that is [ __ ] letting go do


---------94:51----------
you understand now just feel that's


---------94:56----------
letting go how do you all feel right now


---------95:02----------
now you can open your eyes and use


---------95:04----------
push-to-talk peaceful like a weights


---------95:07----------
been lifted incredible


---------95:09----------
yeah relieved that jeez that physical


---------95:14----------
that physical exercise was such a


---------95:17----------
powerful experience that the that my


---------95:21----------
mind trying to like my arms trying to


---------95:24----------
bring the attention to my mind was a it


---------95:27----------
started to kind of build and then I was


---------95:29----------
able to like


---------95:32----------
maintain that connection and then once I


---------95:35----------
let go it was just like okay hi I've


---------95:38----------
accepted that it's time to just so


---------95:43----------
Richard what is why that's letting go


---------95:47----------
right like I can't [ __ ] explain it


---------95:50----------
but just got it you know you gotta let


---------95:52----------
go


---------95:53----------
it's like field ring answering all the


---------95:56----------
the demands of your arms that are saying


---------95:58----------
like dude put me down please yes and


---------96:01----------
you're really answering right okay so


---------96:06----------
you guys alright I got um I got addicted


---------96:12----------
to running in the past and it feels like


---------96:13----------
I now understand where that feeling came


---------96:16----------
from like I was letting go that is a


---------96:18----------
great focus on when you focus on the


---------96:23----------
energy demand of your body and when you


---------96:26----------
really experience the sensation of


---------96:28----------
running without you know suffering when


---------96:31----------
you just feel the sort of pain but


---------96:33----------
neutrally it's this really peaceful


---------96:36----------
state yes dr. kay about the connection


---------96:41----------
between yoga and why yoga was so


---------96:43----------
different and the way that I was able to


---------96:47----------
put all of my attention up on my arms


---------96:49----------
reminded me of my jujitsu training but


---------96:52----------
that was special I didn't realize how


---------96:54----------
simple it was when you take out a lot of


---------96:57----------
the complicated it's like you said


---------96:59----------
you're not trying to turn your body into


---------97:00----------
a pretzel you're trying to use your mind


---------97:02----------
to get to a better place and I I think


---------97:07----------
yo that's amazing


---------97:08----------
okay beautiful I'm glad you guys like


---------97:11----------
that so sorry


---------97:14----------
yeah I just have a personal concern


---------97:19----------
about yoga because okay my back a few


---------97:22----------
years ago and I was just worrying if


---------97:25----------
they're they're like more simple poses


---------97:29----------
that I can do or simple things like like


---------97:31----------
what we just stated like raising our


---------97:33----------
arms up or something like that that can


---------97:35----------
benefit me because I have limb ability


---------97:40----------
absolutely so first of all if you have


---------97:43----------
if you've broken your back you know


---------97:45----------
talk to your doctor about doing yoga or


---------97:48----------
Tai Chi


---------97:49----------
sometimes people handle Tai Chi a little


---------97:51----------
bit better than yoga if they've had a


---------97:53----------
back injury but Yoga is actually really


---------97:55----------
good for back injuries so if you go to a


---------97:59----------
yoga class and you guys have like a


---------98:00----------
medical condition you should let the


---------98:02----------
instructors know and also talk to your


---------98:04----------
doctor about it and just say hey and


---------98:05----------
then you know listen to your body so


---------98:07----------
don't like it's not about a pissing


---------98:09----------
contest it's not about who can hold


---------98:11----------
their arms up the longest you guys


---------98:13----------
understand that if you're comparing


---------98:14----------
yourself to someone else in the room


---------98:16----------
your mind is not where it should be


---------98:18----------
which is on you so don't do anything in


---------98:21----------
yoga that is painful Yoga is not


---------98:22----------
supposed to be painful so if your back


---------98:26----------
is signaling to you hey I don't like


---------98:27----------
this kind of stuff that's completely


---------98:29----------
fine there are all kinds of postures


---------98:31----------
that you can do from a seated position


---------98:32----------
there are all kinds of postures that you


---------98:34----------
can do [ __ ] straight laying down you


---------98:36----------
can do all kinds of stuff with a back


---------98:38----------
injury and yoga so definitely you can


---------98:42----------
also you know have you seen a physical


---------98:44----------
therapist in recovery after your back


---------98:46----------
after you broke your back yeah I went


---------98:49----------
through physical therapy for about six


---------98:51----------
months it helped a lot and now I don't I


---------98:54----------
don't really need anymore


---------98:57----------
yeah so if you don't need it you're


---------98:59----------
probably kind of back to normal so it's


---------99:00----------
good to know if you you know to be


---------99:03----------
careful about yoga but the other thing


---------99:04----------
that you can do is depending on how long


---------99:06----------
ago that was or if you have a


---------99:07----------
relationship with your physical


---------99:09----------
therapist you can also talk to them and


---------99:10----------
say hey I'm interested in doing a yoga


---------99:12----------
class what do you think are there are


---------99:14----------
some kinds of strengthening exercises


---------99:15----------
that I need to do or there's some things


---------99:17----------
that I need to avoid and and really like


---------99:19----------
this is exactly what you know physical


---------99:21----------
therapists and doctors are for great


---------99:25----------
point okay so coming back to this now


---------99:29----------
earlier I was kind of talking about you


---------99:31----------
know the sequence of events before you


---------99:34----------
kind of you know when you kind of feel


---------99:36----------
certain physical things or mental things


---------99:38----------
you try to rationalize and all that kind


---------99:39----------
of stuff so the other thing about this


---------99:42----------
practice is where was your mind


---------99:49----------
it was mostly on my arms like I've had


---------99:53----------
experience experiences with meditating


---------99:56----------
before I'd probably weren't the most


---------99:59----------
read transformative experiences um while


---------100:03----------
I was meditating a few years ago I felt


---------100:07----------
like it was it's very easy for me to


---------100:09----------
just focus all the attention on my arms


---------100:12----------
good for right so go for me my mind was


---------100:17----------
my mind was blank and just experiencing


---------100:20----------
the sensation was I don't know if that


---------100:24----------
was in my mind or that was my body but


---------100:25----------
that's that's all I was doing I was just


---------100:27----------
experiencing this sensation so that's


---------100:29----------
consciousness right so it's


---------100:30----------
consciousness without mental activity so


---------100:33----------
thoughts are the mind desires thoughts


---------100:37----------
that's all mine you guys were hopefully


---------100:40----------
conscious so you were present and


---------100:42----------
experiencing without thought does that


---------100:44----------
make sense yeah yeah and when you guys


---------100:48----------
struggle against the the porn addiction


---------100:50----------
is that within the mind or outside of


---------100:54----------
the mind that's it's outside of the mind


---------100:57----------
is the physical urge that we have to do


---------101:01----------
it okay and then what about the battle


---------101:05----------
where does the battle take place in the


---------101:11----------
mind yeah absolutely right so the other


---------101:16----------
thing that I want you guys to try to do


---------101:17----------
is is learn something called urge


---------101:20----------
surfing so as you feel that physical


---------101:22----------
sensation notice the the the connection


---------101:27----------
between the physical sensation and what


---------101:29----------
it creates in your mind and then you


---------101:32----------
guys fight in the mind sometimes you win


---------101:34----------
sometimes you lose so be it if you can


---------101:36----------
step out of your mind and sit with the


---------101:38----------
physical sensation just see what happens


---------101:39----------
and understand that that desire to turn


---------101:43----------
to porn is going to be like it's like an


---------101:46----------
urge that's going to come and you can


---------101:48----------
actually surf on top of it it's not


---------101:50----------
fighting against it it's not trying to


---------101:52----------
keep the waves at bay it's just riding


---------101:54----------
it out surf I wrote that I read that


---------101:59----------
monks can hold their hand on burning hot


---------102:01----------
objects for longer


---------102:03----------
just by focusing on the sensation of the


---------102:05----------
barn is that like a sort of similar


---------102:07----------
feeling that you're able to sort of


---------102:09----------
quell the immense feeling just by


---------102:12----------
focusing in on it yeah so what once you


---------102:15----------
experience so don't hold your hand on


---------102:17----------
burning things just there but what what


---------102:20----------
monks are able to do is to sit with a


---------102:22----------
sensation without judgment right so like


---------102:27----------
it feels bad to hold your arm up but you


---------102:29----------
can sit with that feeling of badness for


---------102:32----------
a longer period of time as long as


---------102:34----------
you're sitting with it purely does that


---------102:36----------
make sense


---------102:37----------
like with intention and focus you can


---------102:40----------
sit with a negative sensation for a


---------102:43----------
greater amount of time than you


---------102:45----------
otherwise would so it's like decoupling


---------102:49----------
the emotional component from just the


---------102:51----------
actual sensation it's up you beautiful


---------102:53----------
it's decoupling everything not just the


---------102:56----------
emotional component decoupling is the


---------102:58----------
point decoupling is via our detachment


---------103:01----------
it's separating yourself from the thing


---------103:05----------
okay now we're getting into advanced


---------103:09----------
concepts I want to like close off a


---------103:10----------
couple things to leave you guys you know


---------103:12----------
with like some kind of plan so yoga


---------103:14----------
second thing is understand that when you


---------103:16----------
guys do these practices you're trained


---------103:18----------
training your mind to do what you tell


---------103:20----------
it to which is to focus on what you


---------103:23----------
choose to do this is cool because once


---------103:25----------
you train this skill you can tell your


---------103:28----------
mind hey I want you to go and think


---------103:30----------
about that and then your mind is gonna


---------103:31----------
be like okay because right now that's


---------103:33----------
not what it does right now


---------103:35----------
your mind is like oh porn and then


---------103:38----------
you're like no no come over here and


---------103:39----------
then your mind is like no no no let's go


---------103:40----------
to porn and you're like no no come over


---------103:42----------
here no no porn so like train yourself


---------103:46----------
to focus your mind where you want it to


---------103:48----------
go that is a skill you can level that


---------103:50----------
[ __ ] up and this is how you do it right


---------103:54----------
you do this [ __ ] every single day not


---------103:56----------
necessarily that one but if you guys


---------103:57----------
like that one you can do that one now we


---------104:00----------
get to one more yoga practice which I'm


---------104:05----------
going to teach you guys I'm going to


---------104:06----------
teach you guys a bunt up okay so number


---------104:09----------
one do any of you guys have a history of


---------104:10----------
a hernia


---------104:13----------
okay if you have a history of a


---------104:14----------
herniation - if this is unpleasant or is


---------104:17----------
painful in any way or anything like that


---------104:18----------
any of you guys have a history of the


---------104:21----------
base chakra thing yes that's exactly


---------104:24----------
what it is so any of you guys have a


---------104:26----------
history of like improper valves in


---------104:30----------
somewhere in your urinary tract or


---------104:31----------
anything like that okay


---------104:34----------
so rule number one if this is causes


---------104:37----------
some kind of pain or unpleasantness or


---------104:38----------
anything like that just stop okay I'm


---------104:40----------
gonna teach you guys something called


---------104:42----------
Abunda which is a lock so bunda means


---------104:45----------
lock like LOC k so what I want you guys


---------104:47----------
to do you guys know where the taint is


---------104:49----------
yeah okay


---------104:51----------
so the taint is the area it's it's your


---------104:53----------
perineum it's the area between your


---------104:55----------
scrotum in your anus okay


---------104:59----------
so I want you guys to try doing


---------105:02----------
something I know this is gonna sound


---------105:03----------
kind of weird but you guys know you can


---------105:05----------
contract that yeah so like you know


---------105:08----------
there's a muscle that you can do that


---------105:10----------
you can use to like lift your penis


---------105:12----------
right to load the Kegel thing yes like


---------105:15----------
the Kegel thing focus boys and girls so


---------105:18----------
you know there's there's you guys know


---------105:20----------
sorry just flex that muscle for a second


---------105:22----------
you guys know what I'm talking about


---------105:23----------
flex it so you can raise the peanut and


---------105:25----------
now where as you flex it you should feel


---------105:27----------
a tightness in the perineum with me yeah


---------105:33----------
yeah does anyone not have a [ __ ] clue


---------105:35----------
what I'm talking about


---------105:37----------
okay so now close your eyes and then I


---------105:42----------
want you to tighten one two three relax


---------105:49----------
tighten one two three


---------105:53----------
relax tighten one two three relax


---------105:59----------
hold on a second hello hello yeah they


---------106:11----------
can tighten the perineum but it's gonna


---------106:13----------
be different for them okay fine okay


---------106:20----------
okay so so if you're a woman you can do


---------106:26----------
this too so this is the other way you


---------106:32----------
can find this thing is it's also the


---------106:34----------
same muscle that you do that you use to


---------106:38----------
stop the flow of your urine midstream so


---------106:43----------
that make sense already badly can I go


---------106:45----------
yeah yeah go go piss okay


---------106:50----------
so but you guys you guys get the


---------106:51----------
sensation that I'm talking about so just


---------106:54----------
okay let's like just so tighten again


---------106:58----------
one two three relax and do two more


---------107:02----------
rounds good okay fantastic


---------107:17----------
all right so yoga class learn to


---------107:21----------
concentrate your attention right do this


---------107:27----------
this is called mula bandha mula is your


---------107:30----------
base chakra and what you're kind of


---------107:32----------
doing like so you can do this for let's


---------107:34----------
say like between one and start off with


---------107:38----------
like just doing five rounds because it's


---------107:40----------
like kind of hard right does that mean


---------107:41----------
it's like difficult to do so you can


---------107:43----------
work your way up to doing like you know


---------107:45----------
rounds that are maybe five seconds ten


---------107:47----------
seconds for a total of like three


---------107:49----------
minutes and you want to do this at the


---------107:51----------
end of like a meditation practice or end


---------107:53----------
of yoga class or something like that so


---------107:55----------
if you guys go to a yoga class at the


---------107:57----------
very end that are gonna have you do


---------107:58----------
something called shavasan which is


---------108:00----------
corpse pose so they're just gonna ask


---------108:02----------
you to lie down on the floor on your


---------108:03----------
back and relax as you do shavasan you


---------108:07----------
can do mula bandha


---------108:08----------
for like a minute or two two minutes


---------108:10----------
three minutes is fine okay if you start


---------108:13----------
to feel bad or it hurts or anything like


---------108:14----------
that don't do it last thing is that you


---------108:20----------
guys were talking about idleness and so


---------108:23----------
idleness is gonna bring this out so the


---------108:25----------
other thing that you all have to do is


---------108:26----------
figure out how are you guys gonna like


---------108:30----------
reduce the idleness


---------108:32----------
in your life right like so what do y'all


---------108:45----------
want to do about that the way that I see


---------108:49----------
it dr. K is I view it as internal volume


---------108:53----------
is when I would get an urge to


---------108:56----------
masturbate or to go to porn I would get


---------109:00----------
a very strong feeling of just you need


---------109:02----------
to do this you need to do this you need


---------109:04----------
to do this and it kind of goes into what


---------109:06----------
you were saying a little bit earlier


---------109:07----------
about trying to surf and ride that urge


---------109:10----------
and ride it away and go the thing that I


---------109:15----------
wanted to ask you specifically was what


---------109:18----------
do you do when it gets to a point where


---------109:21----------
you feel like you know maybe medication


---------109:24----------
would be something that would be


---------109:25----------
beneficial for me maybe I cannot turn


---------109:28----------
down my internal volume yes so I think


---------109:31----------
it's completely reasonable for you guys


---------109:33----------
to get evaluated by a doctor or mental


---------109:35----------
health professional for this problem


---------109:37----------
there are some medications that can help


---------109:40----------
with this they don't work great but


---------109:42----------
especially if you guys have some kind of


---------109:44----------
depression or anxiety or things like


---------109:46----------
that that are contributing to it because


---------109:50----------
remember that


---------109:51----------
so conquering this thing is not it's


---------109:54----------
like it's about probabilities right it's


---------109:57----------
about strengthening your ability to


---------109:59----------
reduce its effect on you and that that


---------110:02----------
battle is fought like five percent at a


---------110:04----------
time so if you guys start going to yoga


---------110:07----------
class then that's gonna be like five


---------110:10----------
percent if you start meeting with other


---------110:12----------
people and hanging out like that's gonna


---------110:14----------
be five percent and then you're gonna


---------110:16----------
build up like five percent over time so


---------110:19----------
I do think that if the urges are too


---------110:21----------
strong getting a professional evaluation


---------110:24----------
is a great idea and the other thing is


---------110:26----------
that you know it's you're not gonna fix


---------110:28----------
this overnight so treat yourself with


---------110:31----------
compassion and forgiveness for like not


---------110:33----------
being able to fix yourself


---------110:36----------
I don't know dr. kay I had a quick


---------110:38----------
question on that yeah so um I'm uh I'm


---------110:42----------
in the circumstance where I recently


---------110:44----------
broke my computer right now I'm using my


---------110:46----------
laptop and I've significantly reduced my


---------110:49----------
video game time and when my urges occur


---------110:53----------
they don't occur when I'm playing the


---------110:55----------
video game so now that my computer's is


---------110:59----------
not functioning right now I do have a


---------111:02----------
I'm in a state of I have a lot more


---------111:05----------
idleness


---------111:07----------
you know just throughout the day so is


---------111:09----------
that more like do I just need to fill my


---------111:12----------
day with more things outside of the


---------111:15----------
house or and yeah yeah that's exactly


---------111:18----------
what I'm saying guys it's like you guys


---------111:20----------
need to think about this right so


---------111:21----------
understand that your forward progress is


---------111:25----------
going to be influenced by your


---------111:28----------
environment so like the two things that


---------111:31----------
we still need to talk about is idleness


---------111:33----------
and secondly connection because when you


---------111:36----------
guys are isolated things get worse and


---------111:39----------
talking about this I mean you guys


---------111:41----------
realize which we've been doing for two


---------111:42----------
hours we can do this for two [ __ ]


---------111:44----------
hours I had no idea right plumbs was


---------111:50----------
like that's crazy and and so you guys


---------111:55----------
have to structure time with other people


---------111:57----------
and you have to structure time away from


---------111:59----------
idleness because you're not gonna be


---------112:00----------
able to fix this as long as your idle we


---------112:03----------
heard it from squash earlier about you


---------112:06----------
know going to jiu-jitsu class and like


---------112:08----------
finding motivation and stuff like that


---------112:09----------
so I don't know what exactly it looks


---------112:11----------
like but you guys have to figure out you


---------112:13----------
know what you want to do the other thing


---------112:14----------
is y'all can come hang out on discord if


---------112:16----------
you guys want to you know figure out


---------112:17----------
like like if you guys want to meet and


---------112:20----------
just check in with each other once a


---------112:22----------
week I don't think that's a bad idea so


---------112:31----------
at some point you know I'm in the


---------112:33----------
process of training coaches and maybe


---------112:34----------
the coaches can help you guys out a


---------112:36----------
little bit we're just not there yet in


---------112:38----------
terms of their training but I think you


---------112:40----------
guys should get together because like


---------112:41----------
y'all's camaraderie with each other is


---------112:44----------
like important right and you guys get a


---------112:46----------
lot out of that so at the end of the day


---------112:50----------
there's all this deep damaged dark


---------112:52----------
whatever inside you but like yoga


---------112:55----------
classes mula bandha thinking about


---------113:00----------
idleness and then companionship right


---------113:06----------
not necessarily like romantic or


---------113:07----------
anything but just like other people like


---------113:08----------
it's a multiplayer game you guys got a


---------113:10----------
party up so if you guys wanted that's


---------113:12----------
what this discord is for so you know you


---------113:16----------
guys can hop on discord but I I just


---------113:18----------
think that each of y'all has to think


---------113:19----------
concretely about what you're gonna do to


---------113:21----------
reduce your idleness and it's not corner


---------113:24----------
go just getting out of house just think


---------113:25----------
about like one of the things when you


---------113:27----------
think about yourself three years from


---------113:29----------
now what's something that you would like


---------113:31----------
to be different about your life you know


---------113:35----------
whether it's being in shape whether it's


---------113:37----------
learning a different language whether


---------113:38----------
it's having a job whether it's being


---------113:41----------
back in school or you know just think


---------113:43----------
about this like I don't I I think


---------113:46----------
sometimes like this is gonna sound


---------113:47----------
really silly but you guys realize you


---------113:49----------
create your life yeah absolutely


---------113:53----------
absolutely right like so so you can you


---------113:56----------
can actually like try to do something


---------113:58----------
tomorrow in the next day in the next day


---------114:00----------
and a year from now you will be a


---------114:02----------
different person and your life will be


---------114:04----------
different so think about what that is


---------114:06----------
and start with like one thing don't


---------114:07----------
start it don't make it a wish list


---------114:10----------
you guys aren't magic genies just think


---------114:12----------
like take like one thing right like what


---------114:14----------
is something that you want to be


---------114:15----------
different about your life what is


---------114:18----------
something that requires time go for it


---------114:22----------
um something really like so hopeful it


---------114:27----------
feels like um when I was still like so I


---------114:31----------
just turned 18 and it feels like being


---------114:35----------
like an adult now and having these


---------114:36----------
freedoms feels like maybe this time I


---------114:38----------
can actually so break the addiction for


---------114:40----------
good because I can go out and actively


---------114:43----------
do things rather than being considered


---------114:45----------
like a child so if I can actually create


---------114:47----------
my own life I think I can kick it yeah


---------114:52----------
I'm sorry Harold


---------114:54----------
um just bouncing off word he said I


---------114:58----------
turned 18 like a few months ago as well


---------115:00----------
and I thought the exact same thing like


---------115:01----------
finally


---------115:02----------
I'm in more control I can use that


---------115:04----------
better so [ __ ] lazy yeah right on man


---------115:09----------
I think the the problem that I have is


---------115:12----------
that you know like like for me


---------115:15----------
personally I'm financially well-off and


---------115:19----------
I I'm in a relationship with someone so


---------115:21----------
those those things aren't necessarily


---------115:25----------
something that is grading at me but the


---------115:30----------
I think the core of the problem for me


---------115:34----------
is that I just don't have a sense of


---------115:36----------
purpose and I just feel kind of stuck in


---------115:40----------
life so when when I try to integrate


---------115:43----------
these these positive behaviors like you


---------115:47----------
know going outside something as simple


---------115:49----------
as going outside for a walk or


---------115:51----------
meditating or something like that it's


---------115:53----------
hard for me to stick with those things


---------115:56----------
sorry for me to even integrate those


---------115:58----------
things in general even though I want to


---------116:02----------
do that you know yes I think that's


---------116:05----------
something else and I struggle with a lot


---------116:07----------
so Virgil that's Virgil right yes sir


---------116:10----------
yeah so Virgil I I completely sympathize


---------116:13----------
with you man unfortunately I don't think


---------116:14----------
we have time to dig into that now


---------116:16----------
because we're about that time for the


---------116:18----------
day but I think you know that is a


---------116:21----------
common problem for like everyone on our


---------116:24----------
discord and everyone in our audience and


---------116:26----------
it's central to the work that we do at


---------116:27----------
healthy gamer videogame sort


---------116:31----------
sorry sorry button is it in terms of


---------116:34----------
like does it stem from a way are the way


---------116:38----------
that our brain processes video games and


---------116:40----------
how changes or is it are you asking me


---------116:45----------
no I'm asking dr. K actually and so so


---------116:49----------
what's the question


---------116:50----------
you said that like this is a problem


---------116:53----------
with you know it is an obstacle rather


---------116:57----------
that everyone is kind of suffering from


---------116:59----------
from this discord is it because I know


---------117:02----------
that a lot of the discord comes from a


---------117:05----------
video game audience yeah I guess I was


---------117:07----------
trying to hint at the idea is that is


---------117:10----------
that where it's stemming from video


---------117:13----------
games yeah


---------117:15----------
the process is like I'm having trouble


---------117:17----------
creating things I'm reading avenues yes


---------117:21----------
and no so I mean I think that's I mean


---------117:23----------
there that's a lot of what I talk about


---------117:25----------
on other streams I I think that many


---------117:29----------
people who are directionless find in the


---------117:32----------
same way that for you guys the porn


---------117:34----------
addiction you know how it like feeds you


---------117:36----------
a little bit but doesn't satisfy it does


---------117:39----------
the trick but it doesn't actually


---------117:41----------
satisfy what's missing in your life so I


---------117:44----------
think a lot of people who feel


---------117:46----------
directionless get some degree of


---------117:48----------
satisfaction from the video game which


---------117:50----------
is really not what they're looking for


---------117:52----------
but it's like close enough and it's


---------117:54----------
easily accessible right because games do


---------117:57----------
challenge us they're like hard they're


---------117:59----------
challenging they give us a sense of


---------118:00----------
accomplishment you know we feel like you


---------118:03----------
know when you're lay if you're playing


---------118:04----------
like a competitive game like you're


---------118:06----------
gonna feel really amazing after like a


---------118:09----------
really hard game that you win and so


---------118:13----------
it's it's hard for your brain when you


---------118:15----------
have such an easily accessible trigger


---------118:19----------
for some of those positive feelings it


---------118:21----------
can be really hard to invest all of this


---------118:25----------
time into like building your life


---------118:26----------
because you don't know what that's gonna


---------118:28----------
bring I have two questions yeah um so


---------118:33----------
the first one like earlier you were


---------118:35----------
saying when you were talking about the


---------118:37----------
odds of hitting you and your mind


---------118:38----------
bouncing around do you think that voters


---------118:42----------
are more like predisposed to like


---------118:46----------
falling into that trap being like the


---------118:49----------
wind element and like yes and no so I


---------118:53----------
think I think vatta's are gonna bounce


---------118:55----------
around more but I don't think that


---------118:58----------
vatta's like you know I think everyone


---------119:00----------
is gonna have urges so and you guys are


---------119:03----------
by the way a wide variety of different


---------119:05----------
Ayurvedic doshas but interesting


---------119:08----------
question so vodkas are gonna have more


---------119:11----------
fluctuations within their mind but I


---------119:13----------
think everyone is going to have the


---------119:14----------
urges so vodkas may experience the urges


---------119:17----------
more quickly and more suddenly whereas


---------119:19----------
other doshas are gonna like have kind of


---------119:22----------
a slow burn of an urge that starts to


---------119:24----------
build up in the morning and then kind of


---------119:26----------
creeps up and then kind of overwhelms


---------119:28----------
you other


---------119:29----------
people are gonna be kind of like medium


---------119:30----------
burn and vodkas gonna be like very


---------119:31----------
dynamic in terms of when you experience


---------119:34----------
the urge and how hard it is to you know


---------119:37----------
how long the urge is gonna last


---------119:38----------
so I'd say vodkas will have high


---------119:41----------
frequency of urges and low duration of


---------119:44----------
urges that makes sense they're not gonna


---------119:47----------
last long since what they'll hit


---------119:49----------
randomly and more often okay someone's


---------119:52----------
really doing their homework


---------119:54----------
okay this is unrelated I just want to


---------119:57----------
like quickly ask this um do you have any


---------120:00----------
thoughts on like I think it's called


---------120:01----------
Bromwich Oreo in relation to NOFA okay


---------120:04----------
so we haven't even talked about no fat


---------120:06----------
so Bromwich Aria is why don't you start


---------120:09----------
with ghosts why don't you tell us what


---------120:11----------
bromwich idea is I have like a really


---------120:15----------
basic understanding sure from my it


---------120:18----------
seems like it's um this idea of like


---------120:24----------
transmuting sexual energy I like the


---------120:27----------
idea of energy like climbing up your


---------120:30----------
chakras to be more conscious and like


---------120:33----------
like okay it's about the way you conduct


---------120:40----------
yourself


---------120:41----------
I'm sure godly way so let's talk about


---------120:43----------
what bromwich audio so brahmacari is


---------120:45----------
frequently translated as celibacy which


---------120:48----------
is not really what it is


---------120:50----------
so brahmacarya means to dwell in Brahman


---------120:54----------
and Brahman is sort of the infinite or


---------120:56----------
cosmic consciousness so in the east they


---------120:59----------
believe that the basic unit of reality


---------121:02----------
is like this cosmic consciousness and


---------121:04----------
that our individual consciousness is


---------121:07----------
like a drop out of this ocean and that


---------121:09----------
we kind of get that bit of consciousness


---------121:13----------
gets wrapped around with a mind in a


---------121:15----------
body and that's what makes up a person


---------121:17----------
and so Brahma chharia is the practice of


---------121:20----------
dwelling in Brahman so to have your mind


---------121:23----------
or consciousness be focused on the


---------121:25----------
cosmic consciousness and not focused


---------121:27----------
anywhere else


---------121:28----------
so technically brahmacari is translated


---------121:31----------
as celibacy so monks for example will


---------121:33----------
engage in Brahma cheerio which means


---------121:35----------
that they usually don't have sex


---------121:37----------
technically though technically


---------121:39----------
brahmacarya does not mean being celibate


---------121:41----------
it


---------121:42----------
means not being horny yeah right so it's


---------121:46----------
to have your mind dwell in like whatever


---------121:51----------
the infinite is I you know it's getting


---------121:53----------
hokey so if you guys want to understand


---------121:56----------
what Ramachari is like if you want to


---------121:57----------
understand what the infinite is I think


---------121:59----------
you guys saw just a tiny tiny amount of


---------122:02----------
it like when you did the arm practice


---------122:03----------
and then you relax there's just a moment


---------122:06----------
where you're just like your mind is kind


---------122:08----------
of off it you're just kind of like


---------122:09----------
chilling like you're in just the


---------122:11----------
straight chillin mode and when you get


---------122:14----------
closer and closer to Brahman like you're


---------122:15----------
in that straight chillin mode all the


---------122:17----------
time and when you're when you're


---------122:19----------
enlightened that's like what your mind


---------122:21----------
is doing all the time it's just straight


---------122:23----------
chillin like all the time so nothing


---------122:24----------
bothers you and like everything's kind


---------122:26----------
of gel and fun did you survive it yeah


---------122:28----------
okay


---------122:30----------
so anyway we haven't had a chance to


---------122:34----------
talk about nofap or relationships but


---------122:36----------
I'm gonna have to stop cuz also I just


---------122:40----------
can't keep going so I just want to offer


---------122:45----------
huh okay so closing thoughts guys go for


---------123:13----------
this was one of the coolest experiences


---------123:16----------
I think I've had in 2020 starting it off


---------123:19----------
with Kobe Bryant passing away and it's


---------123:26----------
just like this has really set me on such


---------123:29----------
a really good path and this is giving


---------123:31----------
you such a feeling of empowerment and


---------123:34----------
I'm honored and I'm blessed the fact


---------123:36----------
that I got to be here so thank you guys


---------123:39----------
thank you all and and can may I say


---------123:46----------
something yeah so we went over a lot of


---------123:51----------
a lot of things


---------123:55----------
relating the porn addiction how


---------123:58----------
difficult the process of kicking it will


---------124:02----------
be for us maybe some more difficult than


---------124:06----------
others but I would like us to reconvene


---------124:11----------
maybe like once a week and just talk


---------124:14----------
about how things are going for each of


---------124:16----------
us because I think one of the reasons


---------124:20----------
why we're been benefitting from this so


---------124:22----------
much is because we don't have a person


---------124:27----------
to turn to in our personal lives to to


---------124:32----------
talk about this so I think this this


---------124:35----------
talk was more important that then it may


---------124:39----------
have seemed yeah this experience this


---------124:45----------
experience has been incredible the whole


---------124:48----------
session I thought it went really well it


---------124:51----------
was incredible to hear everyone's unique


---------124:54----------
take on this and and it kind of you know


---------124:58----------
widened my understanding of like what it


---------125:02----------
is to be dealing with this and like that


---------125:05----------
probably the best thing my best takeaway


---------125:07----------
I'm gonna be watching the vaad to you


---------125:09----------
know kind of you know look over it again


---------125:11----------
but probably the highlight of it was


---------125:13----------
just to like hear dr. K's voices just


---------125:16----------
being in like a total blissful state and


---------125:19----------
just saying I have hope for you guys


---------125:20----------
there's there's something you know


---------125:24----------
there's something that it's just a


---------125:26----------
simple obstacle it's gonna be difficult


---------125:29----------
to take on but it just comes with you


---------125:31----------
know setting that intention and you know


---------125:35----------
sticking to it so I'm really excited for


---------125:37----------
it I think I'm speaking on behalf of


---------125:40----------
everyone that you know this this might


---------125:43----------
be the shift that everyone hears that


---------125:47----------
was looking for and yeah I'm just super


---------125:50----------
excited so this has been awesome yeah


---------125:55----------
I'm just like this at it again like also


---------125:57----------
I think I speak for everyone when I say


---------125:58----------
that like we all really respect you dr.


---------126:01----------

---------126:04----------

---------126:07----------

---------126:08----------

---------126:11----------

---------126:14----------
have hope for each other forget about


---------126:16----------
yourself for a second do you hope for


---------126:19----------

---------126:26----------
about that for a second man it's not


---------126:28----------

---------126:29----------

---------126:31----------

seven random strangers from the internet


---------126:43----------
that have hope after listening to you


---------126:46----------

---------126:47----------
struggled with they have hope that you


---------126:49----------

---------126:52----------
yourself you can believe in the people


---------126:54----------
that believe in you


---------126:55----------

---------126:58----------
you guys can't see my tears that's

---------127:11----------
people on this call to convince every


---------127:15----------
one of them I mean you don't even try to


---------127:16----------
convince them they just they've listened


---------127:19----------
to the words that have come out of your


---------127:20----------
mouth they've watched your face in some


---------127:22----------
cases they've listened to the tone of


---------127:24----------
your voice they've listened to what


---------127:25----------
you've said they've listened to your


---------127:26----------
struggles and they are all concluding


---------127:28----------
that they have hope for you that is
