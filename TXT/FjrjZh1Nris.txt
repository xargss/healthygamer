---------00:38----------
the monks and all that or did you just


---------00:40----------
like study and


---------00:42----------
no so i um i st so yeah it's a good


---------00:45----------
question so i tried to do that so i i


---------00:47----------
spent one summer in a monastery at the


---------00:49----------
age of 21


---------00:50----------
and decided i wanted to become a monk um


---------00:53----------
so i


---------00:54----------
you know was learning from monks and i


---------00:55----------
went to them and i said i'm ready to


---------00:57----------
take my vows and i want to become a monk


---------01:00----------
and they said you're crazy and then


---------01:03----------
i was like what no but i really love


---------01:05----------
this i want to do this and they're like


---------01:06----------
that's totally cool so you can come here


---------01:08----------
and study with us but you're not ready


---------01:09----------
to take your vows


---------01:10----------
we want you to finish your education we


---------01:13----------
want you to go get a doctoral degree


---------01:15----------
you can come here and study with us you


---------01:17----------
can stay as long as you want to


---------01:19----------
but you need to complete certain worldly


---------01:21----------
duties


---------01:22----------
and then if you still want to take your


---------01:23----------
vows at the age of 30


---------01:25----------
we will take you and i said sure you're


---------01:28----------
just like no thanks


---------01:30----------
like no thanks afterwards no no i was i


---------01:32----------
was like yeah absolutely sounds good


---------01:34----------
so then i spent several years doing what


---------01:36----------
they told me to do i spent every summer


---------01:38----------
in india


---------01:39----------
usually like winter breaks as well while


---------01:42----------
i was in college


---------01:43----------
um so would spend like anywhere between


---------01:45----------
two and four months


---------01:46----------
in monasteries also traveled to


---------01:49----------
different monasteries


---------01:51----------
across india south korea and japan


---------01:56----------
and studied with different teachers um


---------01:59----------
and then really wasn't sure like which


---------02:02----------
tradition to take vows in um


---------02:05----------
you know i had my original teachers and


---------02:06----------
they said like you can come back when


---------02:08----------
you're 30.


---------02:09----------
and i was like cool and i went back


---------02:10----------
every year and they continued to teach


---------02:12----------
me


---------02:13----------
and then um how do you know i'm 38.


---------02:18----------
uh so did you end up going i mean i'm


---------02:20----------
assuming you didn't go back and commit


---------02:22----------
so why'd you not commit because i met my


---------02:24----------
wife and fell in love


---------02:26----------
and as it turns out my teachers were


---------02:29----------
very very wise


---------02:30----------
and understood that my desire to become


---------02:33----------
a monk


---------02:33----------
was out of escapism it was a genuine


---------02:36----------
love for what i was learning but there


---------02:37----------
was a heavy


---------02:38----------
component of escaping an ego


---------02:41----------
so they were like okay that makes sense


---------02:44----------
they were like you can't give up a life


---------02:46----------
that you don't have right so they were


---------02:49----------
like go and build a life


---------02:50----------
and have something worth giving up and


---------02:53----------
then give it up and become a monk


---------02:56----------
they're like go build something make


---------02:57----------
sense


---------02:59----------
um i understand yeah and you're like so


---------03:02----------
young when you're like going in and


---------03:03----------
you're like


---------03:04----------
you know how like when you think


---------03:05----------
everything is like magnified so much


---------03:07----------
higher when you're younger


---------03:09----------
and it's like uh yeah like i've done all


---------03:11----------
this stuff and i've experienced a lot of


---------03:12----------
things like no you haven't


---------03:13----------
yeah absolutely so my teachers were very


---------03:16----------
wise then they're still


---------03:17----------
wise now i think they understood me


---------03:21----------
and they still taught me a lot and then


---------03:22----------
i ultimately also discovered or realized


---------03:25----------
also through their help


---------03:27----------
that becoming a monk is just something


---------03:28----------
that you do on the outside


---------03:32----------
right so like there are actually like


---------03:34----------
you can become like


---------03:35----------
the real work of a monk is not has


---------03:38----------
nothing to do with the outside world it


---------03:40----------
has everything to do with like


---------03:41----------
the internal world so i still practice


---------03:45----------
in a robust way that i would if i was a


---------03:48----------
monk


---------03:49----------
uh because everything's internal doing


---------03:51----------
like the mantras and all that


---------03:53----------
yep i was actually learning about um


---------03:56----------
like zen buddhism and all the you know


---------03:59----------
some of those other things and like


---------04:00----------
it's interesting how they like one of


---------04:03----------
the health aspects that they


---------04:04----------
have like that they that we don't really


---------04:06----------
think about in like our society is like


---------04:08----------
sat like the inner monologue like sound


---------04:11----------
within you know like that's why they do


---------04:12----------
mantras to like replace


---------04:14----------
like how your brain is like going down


---------04:15----------
like a different path you can like do a


---------04:17----------
mantra like make it go down like another


---------04:18----------
path


---------04:19----------
i don't know i'm like i'm like not like


---------04:21----------
that well versed in it but i was like


---------04:22----------
just like


---------04:22----------
reading the lip button a little bit and


---------04:23----------
i thought that was interesting that is


---------04:25----------
interesting


---------04:26----------
does that appeal to you oh yeah i've


---------04:28----------
like


---------04:30----------
tried it you know it's like when i feel


---------04:32----------
like uh


---------04:34----------
i don't say like i'm getting overwhelmed


---------04:35----------
but like my brain is like going off


---------04:36----------
somewhere that i don't want it to go


---------04:38----------
and like i i don't i don't wanna sound


---------04:40----------
like a self-diagnosed like add or


---------04:42----------
whatever but it's like definitely my


---------04:43----------
mind wonders a lot so it's like


---------04:46----------
it's like i sometimes do that just like


---------04:47----------
recenter myself


---------04:49----------
i think i try to practice mindfulness or


---------04:51----------
whatever cool


---------04:52----------
so let's start by just uh can you tell


---------04:54----------
me what you go by or what i should call


---------04:56----------

---------04:58----------

---------05:00----------

---------05:03----------

---------05:05----------

---------05:08----------
uh yeah we can talk about that we talked


---------05:09----------
about any other thing you'd be honest


---------05:11----------

---------05:27----------

---------05:30----------
like uh we talked about anything though


---------05:32----------

---------05:33----------
i'm an open book and uh you know


---------05:36----------
i'm i'm definitely like self-aware of


---------05:39----------

---------05:40----------
i'm like a work in progress you know


---------05:42----------

---------05:44----------

---------05:47----------
your work in progress begin


---------05:48----------
like what tell me what tell me a little


---------05:51----------
bit about yourself man


---------05:52----------
about myself oh you want like my whole


---------05:55----------
my story or


---------05:56----------
sure well i mean basically i


---------05:59----------
you know normal person went to high


---------06:01----------
school in small town


---------06:03----------
in like greenville south carolina um


---------06:06----------
did that uh i was addicted super


---------06:08----------
addicted to video games


---------06:10----------
you know to the point where like


---------06:11----------
basically i would spend


---------06:13----------
all my high school time like sleeping if


---------06:15----------
i was in class i was sleeping


---------06:16----------
and then if i went and then half the


---------06:17----------
time i wouldn't show up so i just stay


---------06:18----------
at home and like play games


---------06:20----------
um so then i like missed so many days of


---------06:22----------
my uh high school year that i


---------06:24----------
uh they're like you have to repeat this


---------06:26----------
i just dropped out and like


---------06:28----------
got my ged or whatever and then i ended


---------06:30----------
up going to like community college like


---------06:31----------
working random jobs


---------06:33----------
and uh and then i


---------06:36----------
just got bored of that and one day i


---------06:38----------
just randomly signed up for the navy


---------06:40----------
i was just like okay this is like super


---------06:43----------
border school


---------06:43----------
i just like on a whim signed up for the


---------06:45----------
navy did that for like three and a half


---------06:47----------
years


---------06:48----------
and then i got out of that went to


---------06:50----------
university um


---------06:52----------
i was studying uh pre-med i wanted to be


---------06:55----------
like a


---------06:56----------
orthopedic surgeon um and then in my


---------06:58----------
senior year i ended up


---------07:00----------
playing in some tournament uh in europe


---------07:03----------
and we ended up like winning it for like


---------07:04----------
league of legends so


---------07:07----------
i ended up i was like wow this could


---------07:09----------
like actually kind of take off and i had


---------07:11----------
a very addictive personality kind of so


---------07:13----------
and i was super


---------07:14----------
even though i was like doing school and


---------07:15----------
all that i was like still super addicted


---------07:17----------
to games


---------07:18----------
um so i just on a whim dropped out my


---------07:20----------
senior year and


---------07:22----------
ended up like playing pro league uh for


---------07:25----------
a couple years and like coaching it


---------07:28----------
and then i stopped doing that and


---------07:31----------
i just i stream like a game called tft


---------07:34----------
and i do like day trading on the side


---------07:36----------
too


---------07:37----------
and that's pretty much that yeah but


---------07:40----------
just to paraphrase my entire like i um


---------07:44----------
i feel like my entire 20s uh is like a


---------07:46----------
very


---------07:48----------
uh very self-destructive let's just say


---------07:51----------
that


---------07:51----------
like i think i think i spent like my


---------07:53----------
whole like early 20s like drunk


---------07:54----------
like per like literally permanently


---------07:56----------
drunk and uh


---------07:58----------
and then the second half of my twenties


---------07:59----------
i just spent like permanently high so


---------08:01----------
i definitely have like a very very


---------08:03----------
addictive personality


---------08:05----------
and that's something like i had to like


---------08:06----------
gain control of and


---------08:08----------
yeah definitely led to some interesting


---------08:11----------
interesting


---------08:12----------
life uh some interesting life moments


---------08:16----------
can you i i find myself being incredibly


---------08:18----------
curious can you share


---------08:19----------
some i would you know tease


---------08:23----------
well yeah like i obviously i drink a lot


---------08:25----------
when i was in the military because


---------08:26----------
that's just what everybody does


---------08:27----------
and then drink a lot in college that's


---------08:29----------
just people are partying and then


---------08:31----------
but like that carried over into like


---------08:33----------
when i was like playing games


---------08:34----------
uh like on the team and i basically


---------08:38----------
would like we do our scrims and then


---------08:40----------
like the


---------08:40----------
moment the scripts would get done i


---------08:41----------
would just get like i would just drink


---------08:44----------
a lot and i would become a very like uh


---------08:48----------
i like to argue with people like i'm not


---------08:49----------
like physically fight but like


---------08:51----------
verbally fighting stuff like that or


---------08:52----------
like it like really


---------08:54----------
like messed up with like a lot of my


---------08:56----------
relationships with people and stuff and


---------08:57----------
my teammates


---------08:58----------
and then obviously like uh like when i i


---------09:02----------
like wouldn't get good sleep because you


---------09:03----------
know when you go to sleep when you're


---------09:04----------
drunk or whatever uh like messes up your


---------09:06----------
sleep and i can like go into practice


---------09:08----------
and then it just like becomes this like


---------09:09----------
self-destructive cycle


---------09:11----------
and yeah i don't drink anymore just to


---------09:14----------
like


---------09:14----------
fair praise on that but it's like uh


---------09:16----------
yeah why not it's definitely


---------09:18----------
um i just don't feel the need to and i


---------09:21----------
mean i still drink socially like if i go


---------09:23----------
out like


---------09:24----------
my friends will have like a drink but


---------09:25----------
like i don't drink at home i won't keep


---------09:27----------
it in the house


---------09:29----------
um i just kind of like fell out of it uh


---------09:32----------
actually


---------09:33----------
the moment i stopped is when i started


---------09:34----------
smoking weed and i was i


---------09:36----------
replaced one vice with another vice like


---------09:39----------
in my mid-20s


---------09:40----------
and it's like i said i have like a very


---------09:42----------
addictive personality


---------09:44----------
and what does that mean a very addictive


---------09:46----------
personality you keep watching that


---------09:48----------
phrase when i get into something


---------09:51----------
i'm like uh i say


---------09:54----------
like i just it could be a game even like


---------09:56----------
it's like i become


---------09:57----------
i don't know for games in particular


---------09:59----------
like i become obsessed with it


---------10:01----------
like it's all i can think about like all


---------10:03----------
i want to do


---------10:04----------
um and i think i use it uh i think i do


---------10:08----------
things like that i don't want to say


---------10:09----------
it's a form of escapism but it's like


---------10:11----------
it's more so like uh i guess i'm like


---------10:14----------
really bored of like


---------10:17----------
normal like everyday like living kind of


---------10:19----------
thing i don't know i'm using it as a way


---------10:20----------
to like escape from that you know


---------10:22----------
i think that's like what i like i kind


---------10:23----------
of like came to the realization of so


---------10:27----------
sounds like you've had a lot of varied


---------10:28----------
experiences man like you've like lived


---------10:30----------
life yeah i guess yeah we've been out


---------10:33----------
there


---------10:34----------
yeah it's you know playing


---------10:37----------
professionally


---------10:38----------
joining the navy struggling with an


---------10:41----------
addictive personality


---------10:43----------
like you know odd jobs community college


---------10:46----------
pre-med


---------10:47----------
dreams of being an orthopedic surgeon


---------10:50----------
there's like there's like a lot in there


---------10:51----------
bro


---------10:53----------
yeah we're in there doing stuff not


---------10:55----------
anymore though i just i just a bum now


---------10:58----------
i just play video games yeah how's how's


---------11:01----------
that going


---------11:03----------
uh it's okay i stream a game called tft


---------11:05----------
it's like a


---------11:06----------
it's like a car i want to say like a


---------11:07----------
card game like a glorified card game so


---------11:09----------
it's like a chill game where you can


---------11:10----------
just like hang out and talk to people


---------11:12----------
so i kind of do that and then


---------11:15----------
uh just try to do trade stocks on the


---------11:18----------
side


---------11:19----------
whatever you know all the normal stuff


---------11:21----------
yeah and


---------11:22----------
hang out with the my


---------11:25----------
so and all that and you know


---------11:29----------
so so how do you understand your


---------11:31----------
addictive personality how can you


---------11:32----------
explain to us what that


---------11:34----------
is like what it's like


---------11:37----------
um


---------11:40----------
for like games or like when i was when i


---------11:42----------
was drinking or like i feel like it


---------11:44----------
varies from thick thing to thing


---------11:45----------
it's because it's like uh


---------11:49----------
i feel like um at least like passively


---------11:52----------
my mind


---------11:53----------
i i find like if i'm not like super


---------11:57----------
engaged i


---------11:58----------
am very very active like i'm always like


---------12:00----------
very active mind like always thinking


---------12:01----------
about like a million different things


---------12:03----------
and i find that if like


---------12:05----------
at least in my 20s if i didn't like numb


---------12:06----------
that out like my brain would just like


---------12:09----------
explode


---------12:10----------
i'd just be like thinking about too many


---------12:11----------
things like the future like all this


---------12:14----------
you know all like but you know all the


---------12:15----------
normal stuff right that


---------12:17----------
any person would think about but it's


---------12:19----------
like can you give us an example of what


---------12:21----------
you would think about if you didn't numb


---------12:22----------
your mind


---------12:24----------
uh just like uh just existential crisis


---------12:29----------
uh like what am i gonna be doing in the


---------12:32----------
future


---------12:32----------
like uh past interactions i've had with


---------12:35----------
people or like future interactions i'm


---------12:37----------
going to have with people


---------12:39----------
um like where am i going to be and like


---------12:40----------
you know i'm sure like everybody worries


---------12:42----------
about this kind of stuff but it's like


---------12:44----------
my like it's like very overwhelming for


---------12:46----------
me and


---------12:47----------
uh and like i couldn't turn it off so


---------12:49----------
it's like i guess i would just drink to


---------12:51----------
turn it off


---------12:52----------
or i would like smoke myself into a


---------12:54----------
stupor to turn it off


---------12:56----------
or do like whatever you know and uh


---------12:59----------
that was basically like my coping


---------13:01----------
mechanism with it and then


---------13:03----------
i got like a lot into like philosophy


---------13:06----------
and


---------13:06----------
kind of did like some other interesting


---------13:08----------
like therapeutic stuff to


---------13:10----------
to to like kind of break myself out of


---------13:13----------
that cycle i want to say


---------13:14----------
so like i'm good now when did you


---------13:17----------
realize why did you try to break out of


---------13:18----------
the cycle can you help us understand


---------13:20----------
like how you came to realize that this


---------13:22----------
was a cycle and that it needed to end


---------13:25----------
well it's realizes like well obviously


---------13:28----------
like


---------13:29----------
it's pretty easy to realize that being


---------13:31----------
drunk all the time is bad


---------13:33----------
and and also like i didn't like smoking


---------13:35----------
because even


---------13:36----------
uh just to kind of like give you info


---------13:40----------
it's like when you smoke all the time


---------13:41----------
it's like uh


---------13:43----------
uh i think it like builds up like a a


---------13:46----------
massive


---------13:46----------
like the more you smoke like it it it's


---------13:49----------
like um


---------13:50----------
over time will like build up like a


---------13:51----------
massive layer of anxiety so it's like


---------13:53----------
you're


---------13:54----------
using it to escape from something but


---------13:56----------
it's like actually like


---------13:58----------
building up like what you're trying to


---------13:59----------
escape from you know what i mean


---------14:02----------
so it's like and then one day it just it


---------14:04----------
came to like a brim and i just like


---------14:06----------
i just stopped smoking too so it's like


---------14:09----------
because like when i would be


---------14:10----------
when i would be out of like the out of


---------14:11----------
the state of smoking i would get like


---------14:14----------
we're normal i would have like massive


---------14:16----------
anxiety because it's like i'm


---------14:17----------
i'm not used to like the nor the


---------14:19----------
normality you know what i mean


---------14:21----------
so yeah so it's like and then one day i


---------14:24----------
just realized like i just


---------14:25----------
i i just some reason i just like didn't


---------14:27----------
need to do it anymore i don't know


---------14:29----------
i was like woke up one day i just didn't


---------14:30----------
eat it i was like i'm just gonna stop


---------14:32----------
this


---------14:32----------
and i just like was okay i don't even


---------14:33----------
understand how it happened but


---------14:35----------
what do you think about that well what


---------14:38----------
just stopping


---------14:39----------
yeah how does that that's kind of


---------14:41----------
interesting


---------14:42----------
well i mean at the time i was reading a


---------14:44----------
lot of like a philosophy


---------14:45----------
and um like uh one


---------14:48----------
one thing that really like helped me was


---------14:50----------
like this concept of uh


---------14:52----------
basically like the past not existing in


---------14:54----------
the future not existing the only thing


---------14:56----------
that


---------14:56----------
exists in is like real is the present


---------14:59----------
and basically like being in the present


---------15:02----------
because a lot of my issues of like the


---------15:04----------
anxiety were like


---------15:06----------
like thinking about the future right or


---------15:08----------
you know or thinking about things that


---------15:10----------
happened in the past


---------15:11----------
right but if you like remove those like


---------15:13----------
concepts as ideas


---------15:15----------
and like the only thing that is is real


---------15:17----------
or like matters to you and there's in


---------15:18----------
front of you


---------15:19----------
is like right now like this conversation


---------15:21----------
with you right now and then


---------15:23----------
bringing your mind to like being like in


---------15:25----------
that moment


---------15:26----------
at all times you know so i just like


---------15:30----------
it sounds ridiculous to try not to think


---------15:31----------
about the future but


---------15:33----------
um just more like yeah just more


---------15:36----------
focusing on the present


---------15:37----------
and that just that concept helped me out


---------15:39----------
a lot


---------15:40----------
so it sounds like you were because


---------15:42----------
here's what i'm imagining


---------15:44----------
brandon is that there are people who are


---------15:45----------
watching this right and like


---------15:47----------
so in my day job i'm actually like in a


---------15:49----------
d well i don't even know if that's true


---------15:50----------
anymore because this has become my day


---------15:52----------
job but


---------15:53----------
um in in my day job as of one year ago


---------15:56----------
i used to be an addiction psychiatrist i


---------15:58----------
mean i still have i still see about 10


---------16:00----------
patients a week


---------16:01----------
but um you know the the interesting


---------16:03----------
thing is that


---------16:04----------
like when i when i talk to


---------16:08----------
my patients when i work with patients


---------16:10----------
most of them know


---------16:11----------
just like you said like they know that


---------16:12----------
like drinking every day is not a good


---------16:14----------
idea that using pot every day is not a


---------16:15----------
good idea


---------16:16----------
they'll even realize that like oh my


---------16:18----------
anxiety is actually getting worse and


---------16:19----------
i've become


---------16:20----------
chemically dependent on marijuana


---------16:24----------
um and and then like


---------16:27----------
even though they know that they still


---------16:30----------
wake up


---------16:31----------
in in on a given day like that anxiety


---------16:33----------
they experience is so bad that they like


---------16:36----------
can't


---------16:36----------
they literally like can't stop right and


---------16:39----------
then it becomes a routine


---------16:41----------
yeah it's like a routine so so it's kind


---------16:43----------
of interesting to hear you say one day i


---------16:45----------
woke up and i just ah


---------16:46----------
didn't do it anymore well it's not like


---------16:49----------
it was like a build up it's like i was


---------16:51----------
meant it's like i was mentally


---------16:52----------
conditioning myself every day


---------16:54----------
like tweaking like little knobs and


---------16:56----------
there's other things that like went into


---------16:58----------
like me helping i don't know if


---------16:59----------
i can talk about them but uh it's like


---------17:01----------
uh but it's like i was tweaking knobs in


---------17:03----------
my brain


---------17:04----------
like a little bit every day and then


---------17:05----------
eventually i got it to like


---------17:07----------
i'm like reading things you know like


---------17:09----------
listening to lectures


---------17:11----------
like um talking to people like that like


---------17:14----------
and kind of like trying to tweak my view


---------17:16----------
like a little bit every day and


---------17:17----------
eventually it's like i got


---------17:19----------
my mind to like the view i needed to


---------17:22----------
to just stop so it's not it's not like i


---------17:25----------
just welcome like here i am it's like


---------17:26----------
you know


---------17:27----------
i i had to work on it for sure and and


---------17:29----------
so what i'm kind of curious on is if


---------17:31----------
your mind is


---------17:32----------
you said you got your mind to get the


---------17:35----------
view that you needed


---------17:37----------
yes which implies that there is some


---------17:40----------
kind of force within you that is guiding


---------17:42----------
your mind


---------17:44----------
i mean don't we all we have our inner


---------17:46----------
monologue or ego


---------17:48----------
i i i don't know is it what would you


---------17:51----------
because because when you say you got


---------17:52----------
your mind


---------17:53----------
to where it needed to go what is the


---------17:54----------
part of you that knew where you needed


---------17:56----------
to go


---------17:58----------
i mean the part where it's like i know i


---------18:01----------
don't


---------18:02----------
like how i feel like when i smoke all


---------18:04----------
the time or when i drink all the time


---------18:06----------
like obviously it's i don't know


---------18:08----------
like a moral barometer is not the right


---------18:10----------
word but it's like you know it's not


---------18:12----------
right you know and like


---------18:13----------
and you don't feel right what would you


---------18:15----------
call that part of yourself because it


---------18:17----------
sounds like it's actually not a part of


---------18:18----------
your mind


---------18:20----------
um because that's right


---------18:24----------
is that's what you would call it yeah


---------18:26----------
it's your ego is your monologue


---------18:28----------
okay so it's an inner monologue so you


---------18:30----------
you wouldn't you would separate your


---------18:31----------
inner monologue from your mind


---------18:35----------
um i mean i mean your inner monologue is


---------18:39----------
you that's who you that's


---------18:40----------
that's your mind isn't it doesn't it i


---------18:41----------
mean you could say like your mind is


---------18:42----------
like your subconscious and like all


---------18:44----------
these other things that are like going


---------18:45----------
into it


---------18:46----------
right but like your inner monologue is


---------18:48----------
like your mind that's like on the


---------18:49----------
forefront right


---------18:50----------
what does that mean on the forefront or


---------18:53----------
it's like the one that's like


---------18:54----------
active that you can like like you can


---------18:58----------
you know get like conversations with


---------18:59----------
yourself and like yep all that kind of


---------19:01----------
like it's the one that you're


---------19:03----------
i don't see you interact with but it's


---------19:04----------
like the one that you like


---------19:06----------
is like the loudest you know like the


---------19:08----------
one that you can yeah because


---------19:10----------
i know the subconscious plays like a big


---------19:12----------
big effect on all this kind of stuff too


---------19:13----------
but


---------19:14----------
so when you say inner monologue you're


---------19:15----------
talking about thoughts


---------19:17----------
in your head the conversation between


---------19:20----------
two parts of you


---------19:22----------
yes i see and and so


---------19:25----------
one of those and you would call one of


---------19:27----------
those your ego


---------19:29----------
yeah he goes who you are like it's um


---------19:33----------
i mean that's basically what it is it's


---------19:35----------
your your identity as a person right


---------19:38----------
like to yourself yeah yeah so i


---------19:42----------
personally i would say that who you are


---------19:44----------
and your identity are two separate


---------19:45----------
things


---------19:47----------
to yourself i mean not obviously like


---------19:50----------
your identity to other people is much


---------19:52----------
different than the thoughts that are


---------19:53----------
going on in your head and


---------19:55----------
you know that you think yeah so i would


---------19:58----------
say that your ego and who you are


---------20:00----------
are two separate things what would you


---------20:02----------
define like uh


---------20:03----------
so what would you define the ego as the


---------20:07----------
sense of i so like i have a sense


---------20:10----------
of who i am right yes like i have a


---------20:13----------
construction in my mind about who i am


---------20:17----------
yeah but that yeah but you're like


---------20:19----------
that's what i'm talking about like i'm


---------20:21----------
chiseling away


---------20:22----------
like at that identity because you can


---------20:25----------
get locked into like


---------20:26----------
this is who i am or like this is what i


---------20:28----------
do every day or like this is my routine


---------20:30----------
you know yeah so and so who's doing the


---------20:32----------
chiseling if you're chiseling on your


---------20:35----------
identity


---------20:36----------
who is it that's chiseling


---------20:40----------
uh i'm not i mean it's like


---------20:43----------
i mean my me just being self-aware and


---------20:46----------
it's like i


---------20:47----------
am aware that i want to change this and


---------20:51----------
that's just the only way i know how is


---------20:53----------
like my little like gradual changes


---------20:58----------
so if you look at the the yogic model


---------21:00----------
which is going to be consistent with


---------21:01----------
like zen buddhism


---------21:03----------
they would say that there are more


---------21:06----------
we'll highlight three right now there


---------21:07----------
are three discrete parts of your like


---------21:09----------
internal experience


---------21:11----------
one is awareness one is identity


---------21:15----------
and one is mind okay that's why you were


---------21:18----------
like


---------21:19----------
trying to separate them okay i guess


---------21:20----------
yeah and i i think you


---------21:22----------
you know it sounds like you actually


---------21:24----------
know that it's just it's an issue of


---------21:26----------
vocabulary and like precision


---------21:27----------
in terms of our language but you know


---------21:30----------
like


---------21:31----------
it's the part of you that is aware of


---------21:33----------
stuff


---------21:34----------
that is sort of like looking from the


---------21:36----------
outside and if you're chiseling away at


---------21:38----------
your identity that makes perfect sense


---------21:40----------
and also when you kind of talk a little


---------21:42----------
bit about inner monologue right like


---------21:44----------
it's sort of like


---------21:45----------
there's a part of you that is aware of


---------21:47----------
stuff


---------21:48----------
and that awareness can only exist in the


---------21:50----------
present whereas if you think about


---------21:52----------
the identity the identity is something


---------21:54----------
that's a little bit more longitudinal


---------21:56----------
your sense of identity


---------21:58----------
by necessity involves or not by


---------22:00----------
necessity but generally speaking


---------22:01----------
involves


---------22:02----------
things from the past and things in the


---------22:04----------
future and also your mind has things in


---------22:07----------
the past and things in the future


---------22:09----------
but awareness can only exist in the


---------22:11----------
present


---------22:12----------
and that if you were in the present then


---------22:14----------
you would be


---------22:16----------
sitting more in awareness and that's


---------22:18----------
kind of something i was talking about


---------22:19----------
earlier i guess


---------22:20----------
yep exactly so that that's how i would


---------22:24----------
that's how i would arrange these puzzle


---------22:26----------
pieces


---------22:27----------
um which it sounds like you unders you


---------22:30----------
know sounds like we're talking about the


---------22:31----------
same thing


---------22:32----------
yeah yeah yeah


---------22:35----------
so you mentioned that there are certain


---------22:37----------
things that you may not be able to talk


---------22:39----------
about i was kind of confused about that


---------22:42----------
uh


---------22:46----------
um you don't have to talk about it i'm


---------22:48----------
just confused why you wouldn't be able


---------22:49----------
to talk about something is that like a


---------22:50----------
personal barrier or like a tos thing or


---------22:53----------
what


---------22:54----------
uh not personal barrier i'm fine um i


---------22:57----------
don't really care actually i'll talk


---------22:57----------
about it there's like uh


---------22:59----------
okay let's say you talked about the the


---------23:01----------
ice beside and stuff right


---------23:03----------
and this is okay i'm gonna get like


---------23:06----------
maybe i'll


---------23:06----------
get murdered for this but it's like okay


---------23:09----------
i feel like i'm on the spectrum a little


---------23:10----------
bit


---------23:11----------
and i feel like a lot of gamers are on


---------23:13----------
the spectrum a little bit and sense of


---------23:14----------
like


---------23:14----------
uh very hard to deal with like empathy


---------23:18----------
and like uh missing social cues and


---------23:21----------
um you know all all that jazz


---------23:25----------
uh and it's like that's something i had


---------23:27----------
to deal with uh i was watching yeah


---------23:28----------
that's why i mentioned the ice beside


---------23:29----------
episode is


---------23:30----------
i feel like i had to deal a lot with


---------23:31----------
that when i was like in high school and


---------23:34----------
also like in my earlier years in my


---------23:36----------
relationships with people


---------23:39----------
and it's like that's another like knob i


---------23:41----------
had to like try to tweak as like i went


---------23:43----------
through this whole process


---------23:44----------
and um yeah and like also in this whole


---------23:48----------
process


---------23:48----------
like uh one of the things i did i ended


---------23:52----------
up that i don't know


---------23:52----------
i don't talk about it like i ended up


---------23:54----------
doing like mdma to like help me


---------23:56----------
with like this and uh


---------23:59----------
and like that kind of like uh helped me


---------24:02----------
understand like logically like what


---------24:03----------
empathy is


---------24:04----------
and like help me like also bring like a


---------24:06----------
different level of happiness


---------24:07----------
and like the way that like i think like


---------24:10----------
before like my earlier years like


---------24:12----------
it was like the vice and like the cycles


---------24:14----------
and all this other things that like


---------24:15----------
honestly brought me happiness but like


---------24:17----------
it gave me a new look on like


---------24:19----------
what can create happiness in my life and


---------24:21----------
like the feelings about like


---------24:23----------
basically it's like when i was on it it


---------24:26----------
uh i was like


---------24:27----------
i wanna i was thinking what makes me


---------24:29----------
happy like in this moment


---------24:31----------
besides like the chemical effects and


---------24:33----------
all that and it i


---------24:34----------
came to the conclusion it's that it's


---------24:36----------
the experiences that i'm having with


---------24:38----------
other people


---------24:39----------
and like sharing an experience and like


---------24:41----------
caring about other people


---------24:43----------
and all that kind of you know uh and


---------24:46----------
that's like what brought me happiness


---------24:47----------
right


---------24:48----------
so like before my early years i had


---------24:50----------
trouble with empathy right


---------24:52----------
and now it's like logically i can


---------24:55----------
logically empathize with people


---------24:56----------
because like i have that understanding


---------24:59----------
of


---------25:00----------
like i can logically like piece i can


---------25:03----------
like piece it out i was like this is


---------25:04----------
what it means to like carrot you know


---------25:07----------
yeah yeah that's like that's like one of


---------25:09----------
the things that also like helped me


---------25:10----------
break me out of the cycle and like help


---------25:11----------
me a lot


---------25:13----------
i i was wondering if you were talking


---------25:15----------
about psychedelics so i think you know


---------25:16----------
just to


---------25:17----------
toss out a couple of things one is that


---------25:20----------
um


---------25:20----------
so i've actually had so there are a lot


---------25:23----------
there's lots of research ongoing i don't


---------25:24----------
know if you follow any of this stuff


---------25:26----------
there's an organization called the multi


---------25:28----------
athletes yeah yeah


---------25:30----------
so um we act like the i i have a good


---------25:34----------
relationship with the person who


---------25:35----------
founded and runs maps he actually came


---------25:37----------
on stream like six eight months ago to


---------25:39----------
talk about the work they were doing


---------25:41----------
um and so rick is a phenomenal guy i


---------25:43----------
think there's a lot of


---------25:45----------
recognition now within the psychiatric


---------25:48----------
community


---------25:49----------
that um some of these substances have uh


---------25:52----------
like potential to improve lives um i


---------25:56----------
think you got to be


---------25:56----------
so i've had actually patients who have


---------25:58----------
had like lifelong addictions who have


---------26:01----------
gone to


---------26:01----------
treatment facilities outside of the the


---------26:04----------
united states


---------26:05----------
and have had really amazing healing


---------26:07----------
experiences


---------26:08----------
and i've also had patients who


---------26:12----------
using these experiences have developed


---------26:15----------
permanent and crippling


---------26:16----------
like mental health disorders yeah


---------26:19----------
it's definitely yeah i mean


---------26:23----------
it's definitely it's definitely


---------26:24----------
something i feel like you have to go in


---------26:25----------
with the


---------26:27----------
i don't say a purpose but it's like a


---------26:28----------
lot of people can


---------26:30----------
use like that type of stuff as like a


---------26:31----------
form of escapism in its own as well i


---------26:33----------
think that's like when the issue comes


---------26:35----------
in so


---------26:36----------
yeah i mean so just you know for anyone


---------26:38----------
listening out there i i wouldn't


---------26:40----------
recommend like


---------26:41----------
you know because i think your mileage


---------26:42----------
may vary and we just really don't know


---------26:44----------
what's safe


---------26:45----------
um and i've seen you know we hear i've


---------26:48----------
seen success stories and i've seen like


---------26:50----------
really dangerous things happen to people


---------26:52----------
i have definitely seen it too yep so


---------26:55----------
would not recommend it


---------26:56----------
um i think for for people who are


---------26:58----------
curious uh i actually just had a


---------27:00----------
conversation with someone at maps this


---------27:02----------
week


---------27:02----------
and i was a little bit curious about you


---------27:04----------
know when do you think that fda approval


---------27:06----------
in the united states for some of these


---------27:08----------
things could happen could happen as


---------27:09----------
early as 2022.


---------27:11----------
so we may be looking at you know they're


---------27:12----------
in phase three clinical trials so like


---------27:15----------
you know people may be able to use these


---------27:17----------
in a therapeutic manner within the next


---------27:19----------
year under guidance and like you know


---------27:21----------
being assured of the quality of what


---------27:22----------
you're getting and stuff like that


---------27:23----------
because that's a huge issue


---------27:24----------
well they're already doing it for like


---------27:26----------
ptsd patients and stuff aren't they


---------27:28----------
trials trials okay okay so phase three


---------27:31----------
clinical trials


---------27:32----------
is the last stage of clinical trials


---------27:34----------
before something gets


---------27:36----------
approved as a treatment okay okay that


---------27:38----------
makes sense


---------27:40----------
um and then you can you know so


---------27:43----------
i advise everyone to wait until you can


---------27:45----------
do it in a safe way


---------27:47----------
so dr k is saying invade and invest in


---------27:49----------
shrimp stocks


---------27:53----------
uh yeah i wouldn't listen to me in terms


---------27:55----------
of i mean a stock advice


---------27:59----------
yeah um but what so can you tell us a


---------28:02----------
little bit when you said that like


---------28:03----------
you know you related to some of what ice


---------28:05----------
poseidon was saying like


---------28:07----------
what was your experience in high school


---------28:10----------
uh my high school it's i'll just like


---------28:14----------
kind of talk earlier kind of like how it


---------28:15----------
would be


---------28:16----------
basically my parents got divorced when i


---------28:17----------
was like younger and they were both


---------28:19----------
working i had three sisters so we had


---------28:21----------
like a big family


---------28:22----------
um so my parents they were working like


---------28:25----------
both full-time jobs


---------28:27----------
and so like i then they come from work


---------28:29----------
to be like super tired right


---------28:30----------
so basically my relationship with them


---------28:33----------
is like non-existent


---------28:34----------
you know so i would just like go off to


---------28:35----------
my room and like play games all the time


---------28:37----------
24 7.


---------28:38----------
and i did have a small group of friends


---------28:40----------
like i would hang out with and all that


---------28:42----------
but it's like i feel like that that


---------28:44----------
whole like situation


---------28:45----------
definitely hurt my


---------28:49----------
ability to understand like i don't say


---------28:52----------
like what a uh like a normal human being


---------28:55----------
relationship


---------28:55----------
is you know like the yeah all the little


---------28:58----------
ins and outs of it and that definitely


---------29:00----------
like carried over and like


---------29:01----------
throughout like my whole life and i


---------29:04----------
guess so


---------29:04----------
in high school and all that you know


---------29:07----------
being pro gamer


---------29:08----------
uh just a lot of experiences and that's


---------29:11----------
something like i've always liked been


---------29:12----------
battling with


---------29:13----------
and that's why i brought up like the


---------29:16----------
what is something you've been battling


---------29:17----------
with


---------29:18----------
i just how to explain it um i feel like


---------29:22----------
especially like earlier in my life it


---------29:24----------
was very difficult to have what i would


---------29:26----------
call like a normal


---------29:28----------
like what i think like the i like the


---------29:32----------
i don't say like the template but like a


---------29:33----------
template friendship with somebody or


---------29:34----------
like


---------29:35----------
interact like the relationship with


---------29:37----------
somebody here


---------29:39----------
can you explain how that was hard for


---------29:40----------
you or like what would happen


---------29:43----------
what does that look like empathy was


---------29:45----------
like extreme like


---------29:46----------
i like basically felt like no empathy um


---------29:50----------
it's like it was very hard for me to


---------29:52----------
like understand like how the other


---------29:53----------
person was feeling


---------29:54----------
or like and like i would miss social


---------29:56----------
cues a lot like


---------29:58----------
i would just say like random stuff that


---------30:00----------
like would like hurt them you know or


---------30:01----------
like do random things that would hurt


---------30:03----------
them


---------30:03----------
and like i did i couldn't like


---------30:05----------
understand


---------30:06----------
like it like didn't mentally process to


---------30:08----------
me you know can you tell me a story


---------30:10----------
about that just to illustrate


---------30:11----------
so i can because you're giving me kind


---------30:14----------
of a conclusion i was hoping to get a


---------30:15----------
little bit more raw data


---------30:17----------
a story uh


---------30:21----------
i'll just use like something that's in


---------30:22----------
the public uh when i was like a pro


---------30:24----------
gamer i would like get


---------30:25----------
drunk all the time and like there's like


---------30:27----------
a incident that's out there like where i


---------30:29----------
ended up arguing with one of my


---------30:30----------
teammates like and it was on


---------30:32----------
like we had cameras set up all like


---------30:34----------
throughout our house and like would


---------30:35----------
pretty much stream or


---------30:36----------
stream is 24 7 which is a ridiculous


---------30:38----------
idea of course


---------30:40----------
and i ended up like fighting with one of


---------30:41----------
my teammates that was like it was


---------30:43----------
actually my good friend like


---------30:44----------
i really liked the guy um and i just


---------30:47----------
said like a bunch of [ __ ] that


---------30:49----------
was like really hurtful and like mean to


---------30:50----------
him and uh


---------30:52----------
yeah and then it's like i look back on


---------30:55----------
it now and it's like uh


---------30:57----------
yeah and like in the moment like i don't


---------30:59----------
understand like any of the stuff that's


---------31:00----------
going on like obviously i'm drunk too


---------31:01----------
but it's like


---------31:02----------
i can't i don't like understand the


---------31:04----------
situation you know


---------31:06----------
and like that's like been like a


---------31:07----------
recurring theme


---------31:09----------
like throughout my like whole life so


---------31:13----------
i don't know what's it like to live a


---------31:15----------
life where you don't understand the


---------31:17----------
situation


---------31:19----------
well it's like i understand the


---------31:20----------
situation but i don't understand like


---------31:21----------
the feelings involved


---------31:23----------
that's like a better way looks like you


---------31:25----------
felt something just now


---------31:27----------
yeah now i that's what i like i brought


---------31:29----------
at the end of


---------31:31----------
it's ridiculous but yeah yeah uh


---------31:35----------
it's like i can yeah like now like i can


---------31:36----------
like logically it's like more of like a


---------31:38----------
logical feeling and then it like


---------31:40----------
that like so it's like something like


---------31:41----------
triggers and it's like oh yeah i'm


---------31:43----------
supposed to feel this


---------31:44----------
it's like it's really weird


---------31:48----------
yeah so i don't know but it's it's


---------31:51----------
definitely been like


---------31:52----------
something i've like had to deal with


---------31:54----------
like a very very


---------31:55----------
very a lot of difficult stuff in my


---------31:57----------
early 20s with it but


---------31:59----------
can you tell me a little bit more about


---------32:00----------
growing up so you said you have three


---------32:02----------
sisters


---------32:04----------
older young girls i have one older she's


---------32:07----------
a psychiatrist too


---------32:08----------
and uh two younger so and then


---------32:11----------
yeah my mom my dad and what was it like


---------32:14----------
um


---------32:14----------
growing up in in your household


---------32:18----------
uh well my favorite well before my


---------32:20----------
parents got divorced we were like the


---------32:21----------
normal family


---------32:22----------

---------32:25----------
home from work hang out with him


---------32:27----------
like my mom just stay at home take care


---------32:29----------
of the kids


---------32:30----------
big family and then like one day my


---------32:34----------
dad like he had like a really good job


---------32:36----------
and he like he's like i'm gonna


---------32:38----------
he told my mom like i'm gonna quit my


---------32:39----------
job and i'm gonna go like start my


---------32:42----------
i'm gonna go start a business and my


---------32:43----------
mom's like


---------32:45----------
yeah wait you have like three kids you


---------32:46----------
can't do that you know like you have to


---------32:48----------
like


---------32:48----------
pay for everybody right like and then uh


---------32:51----------
he's


---------32:51----------
like well screw this i'm out and he just


---------32:54----------
like feeds down like started his own


---------32:55----------
business


---------32:56----------
and uh yeah and then like there's like a


---------32:59----------
whole like


---------33:00----------
you know all the like the divorce


---------33:01----------
turmoil with that and


---------33:03----------
did the divorce i think she said both of


---------33:06----------
your parents worked growing up


---------33:08----------
yeah so like after the divorce like my


---------33:11----------
mom's working full-time


---------33:13----------
and yeah then my dad's working full-time


---------33:16----------
and so it's like and then we bounce back


---------33:18----------
and forth between like who have custody


---------33:19----------
of us


---------33:20----------
and like uh you know and


---------33:23----------
when they come home from work like


---------33:24----------
they're just burnt out


---------33:26----------
they're like my dad's like trying to


---------33:27----------
make this get this business off the


---------33:28----------
ground my mom's like


---------33:30----------
trying to work full time like take care


---------33:31----------
of like three kids so it's like i don't


---------33:33----------
really have like that relationship with


---------33:35----------
him you know


---------33:36----------
how old were you when they got divorced


---------33:39----------
um


---------33:40----------
i think i was like eight or nine


---------33:42----------
probably yeah


---------33:43----------
and what was your understanding of why


---------33:45----------
they got divorced


---------33:47----------
i i understood what's going on at the


---------33:49----------
time i mean i was young but it's like


---------33:51----------
i don't understand like the the like i


---------33:54----------
look back at her now i can like


---------33:56----------
i try to put you know put myself in in


---------33:59----------
both of the people's shoes


---------34:00----------
it's like why did my dad you know leave


---------34:02----------
and do this and like


---------34:04----------
try to think like why my mom like what


---------34:06----------
she was going through


---------34:07----------
um like obviously i understand the


---------34:09----------
situation better now but it's like


---------34:11----------
what did you think at the time at the


---------34:13----------
time


---------34:14----------
uh i think it might i think my i mean


---------34:18----------
i thought i thought my dad was just like


---------34:19----------
seeing some like woman or something like


---------34:20----------
that you know like that's like how you


---------34:21----------
always see like


---------34:22----------
you cheated on me like that kind of


---------34:23----------
thing like on the movies and the shows


---------34:25----------
and all that


---------34:26----------
but it's like i kind of like more


---------34:27----------
understanding why like


---------34:29----------
why he didn't like why he left more it's


---------34:32----------
not just like something like that


---------34:33----------
so he when you say left you're not


---------34:35----------
talking about the job


---------34:37----------
he left his job and my mom like refused


---------34:40----------
to let him quit his job right


---------34:42----------
because yeah so they got a big fight


---------34:45----------
over that


---------34:46----------
and then they my dad just like


---------34:49----------
i'm gonna do this no matter what and he


---------34:51----------
just ended up leaving to go do it


---------34:53----------
got it so yep


---------34:59----------
but that's like an interesting thing it


---------35:00----------
says like he's like putting himself


---------35:01----------
before like


---------35:02----------
his like kids is a relationship all that


---------35:04----------
kind of stuff so it's like


---------35:05----------
that's something like it is that how you


---------35:07----------
see it


---------35:09----------
well yeah that's like uh i mean


---------35:12----------
you could see it as like he's like


---------35:13----------
trying to go like i can make more money


---------35:14----------
in the future or i can feel more


---------35:16----------
self-fulfilled


---------35:16----------
it's basically it's like uh something


---------35:18----------
where that person is like trying to


---------35:20----------
self-fulfill like find like a


---------35:23----------
find like a new new purpose a different


---------35:25----------
purpose you know what i mean


---------35:27----------
so have you ever talked to him about


---------35:29----------
that yeah i talked to him about it


---------35:31----------
my relationship my family's good it's


---------35:33----------
not like there's no like bad blood or


---------35:36----------
hurt or anything like that what's your


---------35:37----------
understanding of of


---------35:39----------
after having talked to him how does he


---------35:42----------
how did he kind of share what his


---------35:44----------
experience of that was well i pretty


---------35:47----------
much just


---------35:48----------
said what i just told you now and he's


---------35:50----------
just like


---------35:52----------
i mean because i don't want to like just


---------35:54----------
i don't i don't like just like going


---------35:56----------
after people um


---------35:58----------
without like i want to like try to try


---------36:00----------
to


---------36:01----------
empathize and understand like their


---------36:02----------
position before i'm just like


---------36:05----------
you know screw you man like that kind of


---------36:07----------
thing and so


---------36:10----------
and so like i talked to him about it


---------36:11----------
like i understand like


---------36:13----------
why he did it and it's like but it's


---------36:16----------
still like hurtful that


---------36:18----------
you know he would put himself before


---------36:21----------
like


---------36:22----------
the three kids like if you make you have


---------36:23----------
three kids like obviously


---------36:25----------
you you you're responsible for them you


---------36:27----------
know like


---------36:28----------
like you've accepted that you've sex


---------36:30----------
with that responsibility and it's like


---------36:31----------
basically you're like casting off that


---------36:33----------
responsibility


---------36:34----------
like that life-changing uh


---------36:38----------
experience of having kids and stuff um


---------36:41----------
you're basically just like running away


---------36:43----------
from things you know yeah so brandon i'm


---------36:45----------
asking you because you're saying you try


---------36:47----------
to understand right


---------36:49----------
yeah you try to understand other


---------36:50----------
people's perspective that's the goal


---------36:51----------
correct


---------36:52----------
yes so you're telling this story yeah


---------36:55----------
in the story he's the bad guy


---------36:58----------
i don't want to say he's about i don't


---------37:00----------
like the idea of bad guy or a good guy


---------37:02----------
i i understand but the way that you're


---------37:03----------
telling the story i think that's the way


---------37:05----------
he's coming across


---------37:06----------
yes right yeah so so so in an effort to


---------37:10----------
understand


---------37:11----------
i'm asking you if you guys talked about


---------37:14----------
it what did he say


---------37:17----------
um i mean he basically like confirmed


---------37:20----------
what


---------37:21----------
like kind of stuff i'm talking about


---------37:23----------
right now and


---------37:25----------
obviously he's like apologetic and


---------37:28----------
um and yeah i mean


---------37:31----------
uh it's like difficult to to like


---------37:34----------
understand like what a person is


---------37:36----------
thinking and he kind of talked about


---------37:37----------
like feeling trapped and


---------37:40----------
uh yeah cause like you know it's it's


---------37:42----------
pretty easy for people to get like


---------37:43----------
trapped in their life


---------37:44----------
situations and people try to escape in


---------37:47----------
like all sorts of different ways


---------37:48----------
sure and this this is you know all about


---------37:51----------
that right


---------37:52----------
yes so this is his way of escaping so


---------37:56----------
yeah what do you what do you think about


---------37:57----------
him feeling trapped


---------38:01----------
i mean doesn't everybody feel trapped in


---------38:02----------
life it's some point


---------38:04----------
so i don't know what


---------38:10----------
i'm confused about how that statement


---------38:12----------
relates to my question


---------38:14----------
right so you're about to i feel like


---------38:16----------
it's like


---------38:17----------
it's understandable that's that's how i


---------38:19----------
feel about it


---------38:20----------
i mean i i don't know and that's


---------38:22----------
interesting


---------38:24----------
that goes back to like the logic thing


---------38:26----------
it's like


---------38:28----------
yep i'm gonna suppose you there for a


---------38:30----------
second because i think you actually


---------38:31----------
meant the exact opposite


---------38:33----------
is it yep so this is so let's understand


---------38:36----------
your communication what you say


---------38:38----------
and what your logical mind tells you and


---------38:40----------
maybe what your emotional


---------38:41----------
feeling tells you so i asked you how do


---------38:44----------
you feel about him feeling trapped


---------38:46----------
and then you're like doesn't everyone


---------38:47----------
feel that way and the interesting thing


---------38:49----------
about that if i really had to kind of


---------38:51----------
like if i had to put my money somewhere


---------38:52----------
what i'd say is that


---------38:54----------
it doesn't like everyone deals with this


---------38:57----------
[ __ ]


---------38:58----------
and like they all manage so like


---------39:02----------
he should have learned how to deal with


---------39:03----------
it too i know it sounds kind of weird


---------39:05----------
but that's the emotion that i got from


---------39:07----------
you yeah and then when i ask you what


---------39:09----------
you mean you say well it's


---------39:11----------
understandable whereas like actually


---------39:12----------
what i'm hearing


---------39:13----------
from you is like the exact opposite that


---------39:15----------
like he should have manned up


---------39:17----------
and you know everyone deals with that


---------39:20----------
and like we all deal with it


---------39:21----------
like he should have dealt with it too


---------39:23----------
yes i can yes i understand


---------39:26----------
you see how the logic and the the


---------39:27----------
feeling are a little bit maybe different


---------39:29----------
there


---------39:30----------
yes i can see


---------39:33----------
what do you think about that uh


---------39:38----------
maybe i'm even just like wording it


---------39:39----------
wrong it's like


---------39:42----------
i i don't say like i try to like


---------39:44----------
solidify like what he did


---------39:46----------
but it's like i'm trying to like


---------39:49----------
understand like why he would do it and


---------39:50----------
it's not like i'm giving approval one


---------39:52----------
way or another


---------39:54----------
it's just like okay i see why you did it


---------39:56----------
i don't think you should have done it


---------39:58----------
but it's like i get it that's like more


---------40:02----------
like the interaction that's going on


---------40:03----------
here


---------40:05----------
yeah so brandon let me know if i step if


---------40:08----------
i


---------40:08----------
step out of line okay okay so here's


---------40:11----------
what i'm


---------40:12----------
hearing from you okay here's what i'm


---------40:13----------
noticing you let me know what you think


---------40:15----------
okay so i'm hearing that you had some


---------40:18----------
difficulty like connecting to people


---------40:19----------
understanding people and that


---------40:23----------
you maybe spent some time escaping from


---------40:25----------
unclear exactly what you're escaping


---------40:27----------
from


---------40:27----------
something like an addictive personality


---------40:29----------
and then you've actually like worked at


---------40:31----------
it right like you


---------40:32----------
read philosophy you studied things you


---------40:35----------
you know had


---------40:35----------
mind-altering experiences you've engaged


---------40:38----------
in relationships you've done a lot of


---------40:39----------
self-reflection


---------40:40----------
you joined the military you've done a


---------40:42----------
lot of things to try to grow as a person


---------40:44----------
and now you've gotten a lot better


---------40:47----------
at understanding other people to the


---------40:49----------
point where it sounds like you have an


---------40:50----------
so so good job


---------40:52----------
you know i'm hearing that you have


---------40:53----------
relationships and things like that so


---------40:55----------
you've like


---------40:56----------
learned and grown a lot when it comes to


---------40:58----------
like developing empathy


---------40:59----------
you can cry now right like that these


---------41:02----------
are the things that you've


---------41:03----------
you've leveled up fair


---------41:06----------
yes so interestingly enough what i'm


---------41:09----------
actually finding is like something


---------41:11----------
kind of weird that's happening which is


---------41:12----------
that i think the next phase of what you


---------41:14----------
need to understand is more internal as


---------41:16----------
opposed to like understanding other


---------41:17----------
people's points of view


---------41:19----------
because that statement that you tossed


---------41:20----------
out i think is a good example of where


---------41:23----------
all of your lessons of empathy


---------41:26----------
have actually are actually like


---------41:28----------
reshaping


---------41:29----------
some of your instinctive responses to be


---------41:31----------
like


---------41:33----------
and then like blind you to your own


---------41:35----------
experience of stuff


---------41:38----------
um oh you think i should be like more


---------41:41----------
bitter towards like what happened or


---------41:42----------
like more aware of like that feeling or


---------41:44----------
like i i understand what you're getting


---------41:46----------
at but it's like do you think that i


---------41:48----------
should be


---------41:49----------
like experiencing a more powerful


---------41:50----------
feeling of like


---------41:52----------
against like so we're just talking about


---------41:54----------
the dad's situation right you think i


---------41:56----------
should be


---------41:57----------
more like in tune with like feeling


---------41:59----------
against like this or like with my


---------42:01----------
feeling of like that


---------42:02----------
i'd like disagree with it or i would i


---------42:05----------
think you should have more awareness of


---------42:07----------
the way that you feel


---------42:09----------
well i'm definitely aware how i feel on


---------42:10----------
it and i definitely


---------42:12----------
disagree with it and i i'm aware that


---------42:14----------
like all the


---------42:16----------
trust me i'm aware of all like the


---------42:17----------
turmoil that like the divorce brought me


---------42:19----------
and like my family and my mom and my


---------42:21----------
sisters and all that


---------42:22----------
i'm definitely aware that but it's like


---------42:25----------
it's been it's


---------42:26----------
it's such ancient history it's so long


---------42:28----------
ago that


---------42:30----------
it's like i feel like i'm a very


---------42:32----------
forgiving person


---------42:33----------
you know and i understand that


---------42:37----------
like i'm not the same person today that


---------42:39----------
i was yesterday and i'm not going to be


---------42:40----------
the same person


---------42:41----------
tomorrow you know that i am today and


---------42:44----------
it's more like that i


---------42:46----------
it hurt me but it's like i'm okay to


---------42:48----------
like move past it sure


---------42:51----------
that's more like what i'm like pushing


---------42:53----------
out when i when i say it like that


---------42:55----------
yep yeah i'm definitely i'm definitely


---------42:57----------
aware of like how about you hurt me


---------42:59----------
yeah so you know just to push back a


---------43:02----------
little bit on that brandon what you're


---------43:03----------
saying makes perfect sense


---------43:05----------
now we're gonna get a little bit nuanced


---------43:06----------
okay so i think i i think you've


---------43:08----------
genuinely forgiven your father


---------43:10----------
i think that like you said you know


---------43:12----------
you're not making him out to be an


---------43:13----------
[ __ ] you can understand he felt


---------43:15----------
trapped like he sounds like he's a good


---------43:16----------
dude


---------43:17----------
like we don't want to and so that's why


---------43:19----------
it's kind of weird because i i


---------43:20----------
i don't i think you've forgiven him i


---------43:22----------
don't know if you've moved past


---------43:25----------
in what way well just because the way


---------43:27----------
that you talk about it right so like


---------43:29----------
when you tell the story


---------43:30----------
and this is why i'm asking you for


---------43:31----------
stories because i think you've got like


---------43:33----------
a really good


---------43:33----------
you've done a really good job of like


---------43:36----------
constructing what you want to believe


---------43:40----------
and you can tap into that and at the


---------43:42----------
same time like when you tell the story


---------43:44----------
it like you make him sound


---------43:48----------
like it's not the story is not like one


---------43:50----------
of


---------43:51----------
understanding it's one of like yeah he


---------43:52----------
kind of [ __ ] up there


---------43:55----------
but he did yeah it's like


---------43:59----------
yeah right so so so and that's fine too


---------44:03----------
right and and so it's interesting


---------44:06----------
it's like weird i think it's like it's


---------44:08----------
very subtle so i it's clear that you've


---------44:09----------
done a lot of work


---------44:12----------
and so i think that like the more we


---------44:14----------
learn about ourselves like the higher we


---------44:16----------
climb


---------44:17----------
right like in terms of our league and


---------44:19----------
then like you're at


---------44:20----------
you're at like challenger level now in


---------44:22----------
terms of like self-growth and


---------44:23----------
self-awareness


---------44:25----------
and i don't know about that but i hope


---------44:27----------
someday yeah


---------44:29----------
right because i'm still detecting a lot


---------44:31----------
of emotion essentially that you carry


---------44:33----------
with you


---------44:34----------
yeah so i don't get the sense that


---------44:37----------
you're at peace


---------44:38----------
about it have you forgiven


---------44:41----------
yes do you live your life yes


---------44:46----------
i mean it's not something that i guess


---------44:48----------
it's like it's not something i think


---------44:49----------
about


---------44:50----------
because it's like like i said it's so


---------44:51----------
long ago like i'm i'm an old fart


---------44:54----------
just like you it's just it's


---------44:57----------
it's too much of a lifetime ago you know


---------44:59----------
and it's like i


---------45:00----------
i understand like it shaped me as the


---------45:02----------
person i am


---------45:03----------
and it's like i don't want to say like


---------45:06----------
maybe


---------45:07----------
maybe i find resentment in like how it


---------45:08----------
shaped me as a person in like my earlier


---------45:10----------
years


---------45:11----------
more like maybe that's like what's


---------45:12----------
coming through but it's


---------45:14----------
it's not like it active


---------45:17----------
thing that i'm like against i i get that


---------45:20----------
i i don't i don't i'm not trying to


---------45:22----------
demonize your dad or try to convince you


---------45:24----------
that you hate him because i genuinely do


---------45:25----------
think you're in a good place i do hate


---------45:26----------
him now


---------45:27----------
he convinced me i hate him now but i i


---------45:31----------
so tell me a little bit about um what it


---------45:33----------
was like


---------45:34----------
after they got divorced and what it was


---------45:37----------
like


---------45:37----------
yeah uh with the family well


---------45:41----------
uh they would like take turns like


---------45:43----------
custody like sometimes


---------45:44----------
i think there's like one time like me


---------45:45----------
and my older sister stay with my dad


---------45:47----------
for a couple of years and then like my


---------45:49----------
little sisters would stay with my mom or


---------45:50----------
like


---------45:51----------
like my mom would have like full custody


---------45:53----------
of all of us and like


---------45:54----------
they're like constantly fighting in


---------45:56----------
courts about like random financial stuff


---------45:58----------
and


---------45:58----------
like they were literally like always


---------46:00----------
going to court


---------46:01----------
and always like always fighting and


---------46:05----------
um yeah so i pretty much just like


---------46:08----------
deflected from all that i took up the


---------46:12----------
whole like just shot myself in my room


---------46:14----------
play video games all the time you know


---------46:15----------
like


---------46:16----------
i got starcraft i got a cable modem like


---------46:18----------
let's go you know like


---------46:19----------
and then i started interacting with


---------46:22----------
people


---------46:23----------
people like minecraft us uh protoss


---------46:27----------
nice yeah um but uh yeah so it's like


---------46:31----------
i i had the internet i had the internet


---------46:33----------
like at a very early time like when it's


---------46:35----------
like fledging state


---------46:36----------
and i was like interacting with people


---------46:38----------
in there like making friends on there


---------46:40----------
and


---------46:41----------
basically using it like that that world


---------46:43----------
is like it as a form of escape


---------46:45----------
sure and so what were you escaping from


---------46:49----------
just dealing with like my family like


---------46:51----------
fighting all the time


---------46:53----------
and just i just like didn't


---------46:56----------
i guess i didn't know how to like


---------46:57----------
process it all and i just


---------47:00----------
and also like i just really liked


---------47:02----------
playing games


---------47:03----------
like uh i i like the the


---------47:06----------
puzzle solving aspect you know like i'm


---------47:08----------
trying to like figure out how


---------47:10----------
to to solve this puzzle like to win like


---------47:13----------
at all costs kind of thing


---------47:15----------
so do you have a sense of i mean what


---------47:17----------
like so you said


---------47:19----------
dealing with it do you like what was it


---------47:22----------
like when you had to deal with it what


---------47:24----------
was it like to go to court


---------47:25----------
and i never went to court with them but


---------47:28----------
like


---------47:28----------
you would always always hear about it


---------47:30----------
and then my parents would always be


---------47:32----------
complaining about like oh your mom or


---------47:34----------
your dad


---------47:34----------
and then like and i would never see them


---------47:36----------
half the time anyways it's like i said


---------47:38----------
they'd come home from work


---------47:39----------
they'd be like super tired and


---------47:42----------
i i never really felt like i had like uh


---------47:47----------
deep or meaningful conversations with my


---------47:48----------
parents at any point like in my younger


---------47:50----------
years you know like not in like the way


---------47:52----------
of like


---------47:53----------
that i think like your normal person


---------47:54----------
does like


---------47:56----------
there was no birds in the beast


---------47:57----------
conversation you know there's no like


---------48:00----------
life conversations or anything like that


---------48:01----------
so like nothing like preparing me for


---------48:03----------
anything like that kind of stuff


---------48:04----------
and i definitely feel like that kind of


---------48:06----------
like carried over into


---------48:08----------
into like my interactions with people


---------48:10----------
and you know there was like no parenting


---------48:12----------
going on there


---------48:13----------
you know it was just like well uh we fed


---------48:16----------
you


---------48:16----------
like go have that air like we you know


---------48:18----------
got your school supplies like good luck


---------48:22----------
yeah what was it like to grow up without


---------48:25----------
parents


---------48:27----------
um i mean it's like i said i just


---------48:31----------
it's just like figure it out on your own


---------48:32----------
kind of thing so


---------48:35----------
uh and yeah just


---------48:38----------
it's like definitely like trial and


---------48:40----------
error kind of thing you know yeah


---------48:43----------
certainly sounds like a fair amount of


---------48:44----------
error yeah fair amount of error


---------48:47----------
so we got there and


---------48:50----------
and what was it like being in high


---------48:52----------
school can you tell me a little bit


---------48:53----------
about that


---------48:55----------
uh high school i would literally just


---------48:59----------
stay up all night


---------49:00----------
i was i was like a decent student i was


---------49:02----------
in like honors classes and all that


---------49:04----------
mess um but like


---------49:07----------
yeah i was gifted but not using it so i


---------49:10----------
would like when i was in school i would


---------49:12----------
literally


---------49:12----------
be asleep like 75 of the time so i would


---------49:15----------
just stay up all night and like play


---------49:17----------
games


---------49:18----------
and uh


---------49:20----------
[Music]


---------49:21----------
yeah and then then i just came to a


---------49:23----------
point where like i said like my parents


---------49:24----------
are at work all the time


---------49:26----------
like they would like are you gonna go on


---------49:27----------
the bus or like your friend would pick


---------49:29----------
you up for school


---------49:30----------
and then one day i just like just


---------49:31----------
stopped going and i just


---------49:34----------
like i'm feeling going to school anymore


---------49:36----------
i just stopped going to school


---------49:38----------
and uh that was like my senior year i


---------49:41----------
just like stopped going and then they


---------49:42----------
said like all right you know you failed


---------49:45----------
you failed you failed high school uh you


---------49:46----------
get to like take this year over again


---------49:48----------
and then i just


---------49:49----------
said screw it i just got my ged and then


---------49:52----------
started doing the community college and


---------49:53----------
all that


---------49:54----------
do you remember how you felt in senior


---------49:56----------
year of high school


---------49:59----------
uh that was when i was playing world of


---------50:00----------
warcraft and so i was


---------50:02----------
just addicted itself like i was


---------50:06----------
you know i just that's all i wanted to


---------50:07----------
do um


---------50:09----------
that's like the only thing that mattered


---------50:10----------
me i was like real lost in the sauce


---------50:13----------
okay so i i remember like i was dating


---------50:15----------
this girl at the time


---------50:16----------
and this is when the game just came out


---------50:18----------
i was like hey i'm like the first level


---------50:20----------
whatever hunter


---------50:21----------
50 hunter on my server you know and i


---------50:23----------
didn't talk to her or see her for like


---------50:24----------
two weeks straight i was like so lost in


---------50:26----------
the sauce


---------50:27----------
she's just like oh that's nice like i


---------50:29----------
think we need to break up


---------50:31----------
i was like what yeah


---------50:34----------
so uh yeah it's just like


---------50:37----------
i just became like super lost in the


---------50:39----------
sauce um


---------50:41----------
and then i let like all my like real


---------50:43----------
world like uh


---------50:44----------
like i had a small group of friends but


---------50:46----------
the friends just became like people that


---------50:47----------
i just played the games with you know so


---------50:50----------
like all my real world relationships


---------50:52----------
like suffered like heavily because of it


---------50:54----------
yeah so i'm curious during that time


---------50:56----------
when you were lost in the sauces you put


---------50:58----------
it were you


---------50:59----------
overwhelmed by thoughts of the future


---------51:01----------
and past


---------51:02----------
when you stepped out of the sauce


---------51:06----------
oh definitely like i didn't i definitely


---------51:09----------
wasn't enjoying school


---------51:10----------
and i didn't know like future wise what


---------51:14----------
i wanted to do i had like


---------51:15----------
you know like that's like when the time


---------51:17----------
when people like well i'm gonna go major


---------51:18----------
in this and


---------51:20----------
gonna become this and that and it's like


---------51:21----------
i don't know what the hell i want to do


---------51:23----------
you know


---------51:24----------
and obviously i can't have that


---------51:26----------
conversation with my parents


---------51:28----------
because they're just like mia so


---------51:31----------
it's just like well i'm just not gonna


---------51:33----------
deal with this i'm gonna go


---------51:35----------
braid blackwing layer yeah so like


---------51:38----------
that's like that's just like basically


---------51:40----------
like what was going on


---------51:41----------
so those dragons ain't gonna farm


---------51:43----------
themselves you know what i'm saying


---------51:44----------
exactly man yeah exactly


---------51:49----------
ragnaros isn't gonna isn't gonna


---------51:52----------
down himself you have to do it you gotta


---------51:55----------
pay the bills on


---------51:56----------
azeroth yeah um


---------52:00----------
so just kind of thinking about it a


---------52:02----------
little bit


---------52:03----------
i'm wondering uh brandon if like so


---------52:06----------
sometimes like you know when we think


---------52:07----------
about


---------52:08----------
kid who's not going to class at all


---------52:11----------
skipping classes like sure there's a


---------52:13----------
certain amount of world of warcraft


---------52:15----------
escapism but


---------52:16----------
you know the word depression pops into


---------52:18----------
my mind when i hear about that situation


---------52:20----------
what do you think about that word


---------52:23----------
i'm gonna say i was sad but it's like


---------52:26----------
you were sad or you weren't sad


---------52:29----------
i the only thing that bothered me in


---------52:30----------
like that sense was that


---------52:34----------
uh well it's like we talked i talked


---------52:37----------
about earlier like


---------52:37----------
i've had a very difficult time with


---------52:39----------
empathy so if i did have a real world


---------52:41----------
friendship


---------52:42----------
and i didn't understand how to have the


---------52:44----------
friendship in the sense of like


---------52:47----------
getting the value out of it that like


---------52:49----------
you should have from like a real


---------52:51----------
friendship


---------52:51----------
like because i didn't understand like


---------52:53----------
the value behind like the shared


---------52:55----------
experiences


---------52:56----------
um caring about the other person like


---------52:59----------
deeply you know


---------53:00----------
like their their well-being all that


---------53:01----------
kind of stuff and it's like uh


---------53:04----------
so because i didn't i didn't have that


---------53:06----------
um emotional and mental capacity at the


---------53:09----------
time


---------53:10----------
it kind of like made those type of


---------53:13----------
friendships like devoid of meaning for


---------53:14----------
me


---------53:15----------
and that's like i don't want to say i


---------53:16----------
was sad about it but it's like


---------53:18----------
i felt like definitely something was


---------53:20----------
missing there you know so you did feel


---------53:21----------
like something was missing


---------53:23----------
yes yes and then so like because that


---------53:26----------
thing is missing


---------53:28----------
uh i would go like play wow and then


---------53:30----------
it's like my value becomes like oh


---------53:32----------
you're really good at doing dps in this


---------53:33----------
rage so i wanna you know like i wanna


---------53:35----------
have this person around or like


---------53:37----------
or like that person's funny you know


---------53:40----------
like that's how i'm creating


---------53:41----------
yeah i'm creating value to the people


---------53:43----------
like in that way you know


---------53:45----------
so it's it's a silly thing but yeah


---------53:48----------
i don't think it's very silly at all


---------53:51----------
well the whole situation is definitely


---------53:52----------
silly


---------53:53----------
what's silly about the situation uh


---------53:57----------
it's just like the way that you can the


---------54:00----------
way that i was like talking to another


---------54:01----------
friend about this


---------54:02----------
uh recently and it's like he said he


---------54:04----------
picked up all these uh


---------54:05----------
hobbies and like skill sets because he


---------54:08----------
thought


---------54:09----------
that like that's how he would he'd be


---------54:11----------
useful to people like they want him


---------54:12----------
around you know


---------54:14----------
and it's like uh and he said he says he


---------54:16----------
like still like carries that to this day


---------54:18----------
but it's like it detracts from like his


---------54:20----------
real relationships with people


---------54:22----------
because it's like in the back of his


---------54:23----------
mind it's like oh this person maybe


---------54:25----------
wants me because like i'm good at music


---------54:26----------
or like


---------54:27----------
i can fix this thing and he's like he's


---------54:30----------
that's always something in the back of


---------54:31----------
his mind


---------54:34----------
yeah so that's another one of those


---------54:35----------
statements that i think you say to mean


---------54:37----------
one thing but i'm in hearing a different


---------54:39----------
interpretation


---------54:41----------
what do you do the acquisition of real


---------54:43----------
life skills makes potentially your


---------54:45----------
relationships based on


---------54:47----------
shallowness and what you can bring to


---------54:48----------
the other person well no like that's


---------54:50----------
what he's telling himself but he


---------54:52----------
it's not actually true okay okay yeah


---------54:54----------
it's not actually true


---------54:55----------
but like that's how he feels yeah yeah


---------54:58----------
and whereas


---------54:59----------
in your case i mean i i i don't think


---------55:01----------
that i didn't think that was silly at


---------55:03----------
all because in your case


---------55:04----------
what i'm hearing is a you know kid who


---------55:06----------
doesn't have value in the real world


---------55:08----------
and you get to be someone that people


---------55:10----------
want to be around and who care about you


---------55:11----------
and want you to show up every day


---------55:13----------
because like you know when you don't go


---------55:15----------
to class for a week


---------55:16----------
like what do the teachers do


---------55:21----------
uh i mean when i was did y'all had to


---------55:23----------
sleep so they just like left me a lot


---------55:25----------
right so like when


---------55:28----------
when you did not hold up to your


---------55:30----------
responsibilities


---------55:31----------
who cared exactly


---------55:34----------
nobody cared and then it in wow


---------55:39----------
when you miss click and


---------55:42----------
you know i don't know what hunters do


---------55:45----------
that could wipe a raid but


---------55:47----------
you know when you don't pull properly or


---------55:49----------
whatever like


---------55:51----------
they care right like people care


---------55:54----------
either in a good way or a bad way but


---------55:56----------
i'm hearing that you were like


---------55:57----------
i could see that your presence was noted


---------56:00----------
in some way


---------56:02----------
yes whereas like if when you went to


---------56:04----------
school like you might


---------56:05----------
i mean they might as well been robots


---------56:07----------
like for as much as people seem to


---------56:08----------
notice


---------56:09----------
or give a [ __ ] yes


---------56:12----------
i can definitely see what you're talking


---------56:13----------
about did you act out at all


---------56:17----------
uh when i was in middle school in


---------56:19----------
elementary school


---------56:20----------
like when the divorce and stuff was


---------56:22----------
first happening i was like


---------56:23----------
very class clown kind of just always


---------56:26----------
just saying random stuff


---------56:28----------
and trying to make people laugh like


---------56:30----------
that was like my value that i


---------56:32----------
that's why i like mentioned value before


---------56:33----------
is like i i kind of mentally noted that


---------56:35----------
as like


---------56:36----------
it's like why did i do that it's like


---------56:37----------
because i'm looking for a way of giving


---------56:39----------
value to people


---------56:40----------
right and like that's the way that like


---------56:43----------
that basically became like the


---------56:44----------
interaction it's like i'd make people


---------56:46----------
laugh


---------56:47----------
so it's like that was like my purpose i


---------56:49----------
don't know but then


---------56:50----------
yeah it's like once i got into games i'm


---------56:52----------
like sleeping all the time so i can't


---------56:54----------
even do that


---------56:55----------
yeah but yeah and so what about the ice


---------56:59----------
beside an


---------57:00----------
interview kind of like resonated with


---------57:02----------
you


---------57:03----------
it's a class clown thing and then like


---------57:06----------
he was talking about how you like


---------57:07----------
asperger's and stuff and like


---------57:09----------
just a lot of the is this


---------57:12----------
i mean i've like read up on this type of


---------57:14----------
stuff before like i i genuinely think


---------57:16----------
that like


---------57:17----------
most professional gamers are have been


---------57:20----------
are on the spectrum in some way


---------57:21----------
like in the sense of like the way that


---------57:24----------
like obsessive


---------57:26----------
behavior like and uh and a lot of them


---------57:29----------
have like empathy issues


---------57:30----------
a lot of them a lot of like them like


---------57:33----------
social cues


---------57:34----------
like social skills really hard and like


---------57:36----------
this


---------57:37----------
all can develop in like some way shape


---------57:38----------
or form right so


---------57:40----------
it's definitely something i've like i


---------57:43----------
like i've noted of myself and like other


---------57:45----------
people i've interacted with


---------57:46----------
like throughout the years and it's and


---------57:48----------
it's like something


---------57:49----------
i don't know if it's like learned


---------57:51----------
behavior it's like i missed out on the


---------57:53----------
ability to learn about this stuff from


---------57:54----------
like previous


---------57:55----------
points in my life or it's because it's


---------57:57----------
something i was born with


---------57:59----------
but it's definitely like something i've


---------58:01----------
had to like adjust and deal with


---------58:04----------
um and yeah and that's like


---------58:07----------
i guess like the parallels that like


---------58:08----------
that was like pulling from that sure


---------58:11----------
yeah so you know my take on that it's


---------58:12----------
something i think about a lot i've also


---------58:14----------
worked with a fair number of pro gamers


---------58:16----------
um you know my money's actually more on


---------58:18----------
the learned behavior part


---------58:20----------
so while it's possible that like you


---------58:22----------
know all the pro gamers out there are on


---------58:24----------
the autism spectrum


---------58:25----------
or a fair number of them i i think that


---------58:28----------
especially with


---------58:29----------
so the


---------58:32----------
confusion around empathy and building


---------58:35----------
social


---------58:36----------
relationships that symptom


---------58:39----------
has multiple diagnoses that can lead to


---------58:41----------
it


---------58:42----------
yes being on the spectrum is one of them


---------58:46----------
but i think that like i know for myself


---------58:49----------
like i


---------58:50----------
i don't know i mean i certainly wasn't


---------58:51----------
very empathic as a


---------58:53----------
you know like in high school and stuff


---------58:54----------
and i was [ __ ] confused when it came


---------58:56----------
to college


---------58:58----------
like i didn't know how to talk to a girl


---------58:59----------
i didn't really know how to make friends


---------59:02----------
like my friends in high school like the


---------59:04----------
reason i made friends with them is


---------59:05----------
because none of us knew how to make


---------59:06----------
friends with anyone else


---------59:09----------
yeah right that's what i mentioned it's


---------59:11----------
like i don't know if it's like a learn b


---------59:13----------
yep it might in both of our instances it


---------59:15----------
could be learned behavior


---------59:16----------
it could be something like in my case


---------59:18----------
i'm like born with but it could be like


---------59:19----------
a mixture of both like


---------59:21----------
absolutely so i think that there's


---------59:23----------
there's enough consistency


---------59:25----------
and if you look at the statistics around


---------59:27----------
like how common autism is


---------59:28----------
or some being on the autism spectrum you


---------59:31----------
know i'd guess that


---------59:33----------
this is a pattern that is so autism is


---------59:36----------
in the minority of the population


---------59:38----------
[Music]


---------59:39----------
playing video games is now in the


---------59:41----------
majority of population


---------59:43----------
and having social difficulties and


---------59:45----------
difficulty with empathy is also


---------59:47----------
in the majority of gamers yeah so just


---------59:50----------
looking at that


---------59:51----------
at that statistically it makes me lean


---------59:54----------
towards


---------59:55----------
things like um


---------59:58----------
so like you know i


---------60:02----------
like let me just share like an a theory


---------60:04----------
that i have for lack of a


---------60:06----------
better i i'm just gonna toss this out


---------60:08----------
hopefully it'll illustrate the point is


---------60:09----------
that okay


---------60:10----------
yeah go for it so when we form online


---------60:12----------
relationships


---------60:14----------
so like like i guess this is why gamers


---------60:17----------
are socially anxious okay


---------60:18----------
so when we form online relationships we


---------60:21----------
tend to form


---------60:22----------
like there are parts of our brain that


---------60:24----------
govern like empathy


---------60:25----------
and like you know understanding social


---------60:28----------
cues and things like that


---------60:30----------
that actually like get rusty because


---------60:32----------
when i


---------60:33----------
talk to you on discord like i don't see


---------60:34----------
your face i don't understand your body


---------60:36----------
language


---------60:37----------
i get a little bit of tone so i spend a


---------60:39----------
lot of time playing video games


---------60:41----------
and there's also like a set of


---------60:44----------
um things in the game


---------60:48----------
that make me know whether i'm valued or


---------60:51----------
not


---------60:52----------
right like if i'm crushing mid like i


---------60:54----------
know that people are gonna like me


---------60:56----------
right like it's it's it's easy like i


---------60:58----------
understand


---------60:59----------
what my value is in this given situation


---------61:02----------
i also don't have to deal with like


---------61:04----------
facial expressions and stuff like that


---------61:07----------
also games tend to be like really really


---------61:08----------
logical so what happens is like


---------61:10----------
when i interact with people online it


---------61:12----------
seems to be easier because my brain sort


---------61:14----------
of knows how to do that


---------61:15----------
and then what happens when gamers go and


---------61:17----------
like they interact with real people


---------61:19----------
is like something weird happens so


---------61:20----------
generally speaking the regular humans


---------61:23----------
automatically


---------61:24----------
their brain interprets things like body


---------61:26----------
language and tone


---------61:28----------
and like other kinds of things that


---------61:31----------
reassure


---------61:31----------
the regular human the problem with the


---------61:34----------
gamer is that all of those circuits have


---------61:36----------
been like


---------61:37----------
turned off for a while so we are not


---------61:39----------
able to be reassured


---------61:41----------
by like the signals that are like other


---------61:44----------
human brains are able to be reassured by


---------61:46----------
and so what we do in our minds is fill


---------61:49----------
it in with logical processing


---------61:51----------
so then it becomes a problem to be


---------61:52----------
solved and we're like hyper analyzing


---------61:55----------
every interaction so since the emotional


---------61:57----------
part of our brain is not able to like


---------61:59----------
interpret a signal of like you know if


---------62:02----------
someone


---------62:04----------
you know like invites me like we just


---------62:05----------
can't process all of these like


---------62:07----------
empathic signals so instead what we do


---------62:10----------
is we become hyper anxious which is like


---------62:12----------
overly logical


---------62:13----------
reasoning into all of these different


---------62:15----------
random things


---------62:16----------
and the problem is that you know logical


---------62:18----------
processing is just not a good way to


---------62:20----------
interpret bodily signals


---------62:22----------
it's like how you get into all this kind


---------62:24----------
of you know weird like


---------62:26----------
dating pickup artist like if the girl


---------62:28----------
does this it means it's like all this


---------62:30----------
it's it's a logical construction that's


---------62:32----------
a substitute


---------62:33----------
for a far better empathic circuit that


---------62:35----------
is like


---------62:36----------
rusty what do you think about that


---------62:39----------
i can agree with that and uh


---------62:43----------
i i definitely understand where coming


---------62:44----------
from and i'll just like


---------62:46----------
i'll i guess i'll like exp to talk about


---------62:48----------
experience so yeah i'd love to hear that


---------62:50----------
okay so we had uh like one of our teams


---------62:53----------
like counter logic gaming


---------62:55----------
you know we're the or the turbo sweaty


---------62:56----------
nerds and uh


---------62:58----------
we ended up going off to korea to like


---------63:00----------
play in this turn


---------63:02----------
this a couple month long tournament so


---------63:04----------
we're all living together


---------63:06----------
right and so we're living together for


---------63:09----------
months


---------63:10----------
and it's like these there's like major


---------63:12----------
issues of like


---------63:13----------
fighting all the time like and that's


---------63:15----------
like why i bring up like the social cue


---------63:16----------
thing is it's not just like


---------63:18----------
restricted to like online but it's like


---------63:21----------
when we are in in in person it's like


---------63:25----------
literally we like can't even like


---------63:26----------
process each other you know it's like


---------63:28----------
we're just a bunch of like


---------63:28----------
malfunctioning robots


---------63:30----------
like yeah so it's


---------63:34----------
it's like i feel like it probably does


---------63:37----------
talk a lot


---------63:38----------
about like what you're saying where it's


---------63:39----------
like our


---------63:41----------
we've been online so long and like we've


---------63:42----------
had those relationship online and we


---------63:44----------
know how to interact online


---------63:45----------
now like once we're in person and


---------63:48----------
there's like the


---------63:49----------
the cues and stuff like the facial


---------63:51----------
expressions the


---------63:53----------
body language all that kind of stuff


---------63:55----------
like that's like out the window right


---------63:57----------
and


---------63:59----------
yeah and then i remember like at the end


---------64:02----------
of the trip like after we got done with


---------64:03----------
the tournament


---------64:04----------
one of the like the players on the team


---------64:06----------
they're like what we need to do now is


---------64:07----------
like we need to go back and get a gaming


---------64:08----------
house and live with each other it's like


---------64:10----------
no yeah


---------64:14----------
so it's like yeah like after all that


---------64:17----------
kind of stuff


---------64:19----------
so it's just i mean and then i've seen


---------64:21----------
it like i've you know coached teams and


---------64:23----------
been around teens for a long time you


---------64:24----------
see like all these other gamers like


---------64:26----------
living with each other


---------64:27----------
and i feel like a lot of them like can't


---------64:30----------
process like


---------64:32----------
dealing with each other in any or like


---------64:34----------
any situation


---------64:35----------
and it's like i don't know i just like


---------64:38----------
seeing it too much you know


---------64:40----------
yeah so it's interesting because i i've


---------64:41----------
seen a lot of it too it's it's amazing


---------64:43----------
how much


---------64:44----------
how long of a way a little bit of


---------64:46----------
instruction goes


---------64:48----------
so there's data that supports so like


---------64:50----------
they did a good


---------64:52----------
a trial on i think like 12 000 students


---------64:56----------
from grade 1 to 12 maybe


---------64:59----------
what what yeah you seem like you're


---------65:02----------
thinking something funny


---------65:04----------
no i just glanced over a chat and


---------65:06----------
somebody's like nopers


---------65:09----------
so so there there's data that shows that


---------65:11----------
if you take


---------65:12----------
i think they did a trial where they took


---------65:14----------
12 000 students and 6 000 of the


---------65:16----------
students were taught


---------65:17----------
social and emotional skills training as


---------65:20----------
a class


---------65:21----------
like in addition to history and


---------65:22----------
mathematics and things like that the


---------65:24----------
interesting thing is that if you teach


---------65:25----------
people how to like interact with each


---------65:27----------
other


---------65:28----------
it's worth one letter grade


---------65:31----------
so their gpa actually goes up by


---------65:34----------
1.1 points like


---------65:37----------
this is something that would never


---------65:38----------
happen in america right is this class


---------65:40----------
this is a


---------65:41----------
trial that was done in america i think


---------65:42----------
it was done in america oh okay okay


---------65:44----------
this doesn't sound like america it


---------65:46----------
doesn't sound like america but it


---------65:47----------
i i think the trump show is in america


---------65:49----------
i'd have to find the reference again but


---------65:51----------
i think it was


---------65:52----------
done here um maybe europe but it's


---------65:55----------
interesting because when i you know when


---------65:56----------
i work with esports teams it's like well


---------65:58----------
we'll like spend some time like learning


---------66:00----------
how to communicate and boy does it help


---------66:03----------
um you know the the sample size is still


---------66:05----------
relatively small but i would love to do


---------66:06----------
a study that actually the problem is


---------66:08----------
that there's so much variability in


---------66:10----------
performance


---------66:11----------
you know in terms of like tournament


---------66:12----------
placement there are so many factors that


---------66:14----------
it's hard to say that this is


---------66:15----------
responsible for an improvement


---------66:17----------
but well a lot of a lot of teams have


---------66:19----------
like mental coaches and


---------66:21----------
like psychologists and a lot of a lot of


---------66:24----------
people that are like do it it's


---------66:25----------
definitely come a long way since like


---------66:27----------
when i was


---------66:27----------
playing so it's definitely it's there


---------66:30----------
people know about it so


---------66:32----------
yeah and it's it's it's crazy to see


---------66:34----------
like how


---------66:35----------
far a little bit of education goes and


---------66:39----------
like


---------66:39----------
processing and and teaching people like


---------66:41----------
how to communicate


---------66:42----------
and recognize each other's like issues


---------66:45----------
how it really brings a team together


---------66:47----------
it's it's been interesting to


---------66:49----------
see that but um


---------66:52----------
yeah so it sounds like you were can you


---------66:55----------
tell me a little bit about the the navy


---------66:57----------
and how you decided to do that


---------67:00----------
uh well i was going to community college


---------67:02----------
at the time


---------67:03----------
all my friends had like moved off to


---------67:05----------
like go to state school


---------67:07----------
um and so i like didn't have any friends


---------67:10----------
at the time like in the area and like


---------67:12----------
all they only able to hang out with


---------67:13----------
those like online playing games


---------67:15----------
and i was gonna like do the two years


---------67:16----------
and then go to like state school like do


---------67:18----------
like transfer program


---------67:20----------
um and i was just like really cause it


---------67:23----------
just felt like


---------67:24----------
high school to sequel you know where


---------67:25----------
it's like i gotta go and i gotta do


---------67:26----------
these stupid classes


---------67:28----------
and then i'd like just play games all


---------67:30----------
night and


---------67:31----------
it's literally just like i'm just


---------67:33----------
carrying out the same experience except


---------67:34----------
this time i don't have my irl friends


---------67:36----------
to like help me deal with it you know so


---------67:39----------
one day i just like saw a pamphlet


---------67:42----------
when i was like walking out of class and


---------67:44----------
yeah they got me man the brainwashing


---------67:47----------
yeah and i just like i was like all


---------67:49----------
right i want to change my life


---------67:50----------
dramatically i'm like so i just got to


---------67:52----------
get out of here right


---------67:54----------
and i just told my my mom like i'm going


---------67:57----------
to go i signed up for the navy like i'm


---------67:58----------
i'm going to leave in a month and i


---------68:03----------
just went off the boot camp and had it


---------68:05----------
it was definitely


---------68:08----------
uh well i mean i wasn't going i wasn't


---------68:11----------
like being in the army of marines i'm


---------68:13----------
not like going off like shoot people


---------68:14----------
like my job was


---------68:15----------
you know i was more the technical side


---------68:17----------
so she was like at first she was like


---------68:19----------
now i can explain to her like this is


---------68:21----------
what i'm going to be doing and she's


---------68:22----------
like okay


---------68:23----------
like just be careful you know like that


---------68:25----------
kind of thing


---------68:27----------
so um yeah then i went off in the


---------68:29----------
military


---------68:30----------
which is definitely an interesting


---------68:32----------
experience like


---------68:34----------
there's a lot of crazy people in the


---------68:35----------
military in like some way shape or form


---------68:39----------
uh and it's you definitely experience


---------68:41----------
like people from all walks of life


---------68:44----------
and you're like kind of forced into this


---------68:45----------
like jumbled mess together


---------68:47----------
and yeah and i got to travel a lot


---------68:50----------
which is a good experience you know i


---------68:52----------
got to like experience a lot of


---------68:53----------
different cultures


---------68:55----------
and a lot of life experiences um


---------68:59----------
but it was definitely extremely


---------69:00----------
stressful it was probably like


---------69:04----------
most stressful experience of my life


---------69:05----------
just what was stressful what was


---------69:07----------
stressful about it


---------69:08----------
you have no okay let's say


---------69:12----------
i'm like hey you need to go here


---------69:14----------
tomorrow or whatever


---------69:15----------
it's like you can't say no like you need


---------69:16----------
to do this you can't say no


---------69:18----------
so like basically no matter what you


---------69:21----------
have to do like whatever's happening or


---------69:22----------
going on or what's saying


---------69:24----------
but you have no control over your life


---------69:26----------
does that make sense


---------69:28----------
um so it's like you're at the whim of


---------69:31----------
other people


---------69:32----------
and the military doesn't have a lot of


---------69:34----------
smart people


---------69:35----------
are there smart people in there there's


---------69:37----------
a lot of people in the military that


---------69:39----------
are just in there in their position


---------69:40----------
because of time they're like well i've


---------69:42----------
been in here for a lot of years


---------69:44----------
and it's like oh no this guy's in charge


---------69:47----------
of me in its way


---------69:50----------
yeah like that kind of stuff so wow it's


---------69:52----------
just


---------69:53----------
yeah it's it's a zoo for sure


---------69:56----------
um and then it's all the normal stuff


---------69:58----------
like you have to like train for


---------70:00----------
like combat and like yeah


---------70:04----------
the one thing in the navy you get like


---------70:06----------
gas chambered


---------70:07----------
whatever you like get you get tear gas


---------70:10----------
and


---------70:11----------
like all a bunch of stuff like that like


---------70:13----------
and then boot camp is really stressful


---------70:16----------
um stressful you know it's not a word


---------70:19----------
that i usually hear


---------70:21----------
used to describe boot camp like


---------70:24----------
mental turmoil like what what what can


---------70:27----------
you help me understand that what was


---------70:29----------
what's the turmoil in boot camp like


---------70:31----------
i've heard it's hard but


---------70:33----------
usually when i think like stress i think


---------70:34----------
like paying bills at the end of the


---------70:36----------
month or


---------70:37----------
maybe i'm going to get kicked out of


---------70:39----------
college or like i think about stress


---------70:41----------
yeah go ahead so when you [ __ ] up they


---------70:43----------
do what's called beating you


---------70:45----------
where they just like work you out into


---------70:46----------
the ground to where it's like


---------70:48----------
literally the only way that those that


---------70:50----------
you they'll stop you from working out


---------70:52----------
is you get carried away in an ambulance


---------70:55----------
and then you get charged for the


---------70:56----------
ambulance


---------70:57----------
or something like that yeah that's like


---------71:01----------
so like yeah like and it's like i don't


---------71:03----------
want to have that happen it could be


---------71:05----------
they'd like beat you over like random


---------71:06----------
stuff like this button isn't button


---------71:09----------
this many centimeters to like this


---------71:11----------
degree


---------71:12----------
all right we're going to beat you for


---------71:13----------
three hours it's like no


---------71:17----------
it's like some stuff that does sound


---------71:20----------
quite traumatic


---------71:21----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah so and you can't say


---------71:24----------
no


---------71:24----------
like you have to do it or also like


---------71:26----------
discharge you it's just like it's just


---------71:28----------
random stuff like that and then


---------71:30----------
uh i don't know yeah so that's like on


---------71:33----------
top of like the the training you're


---------71:35----------
going through already


---------71:36----------
so yeah so it sounds like no control


---------71:40----------
over your life and getting like


---------71:41----------
arbitrarily punished


---------71:44----------
yeah but that sounds like they call it


---------71:46----------
like breaking people down so they can


---------71:48----------
build them back up it's like all right


---------71:49----------
you broke everyone down like pretty good


---------71:52----------
here yeah


---------71:55----------
and did that prepare you yeah go ahead


---------71:57----------
you ever seen the movie full metal


---------71:58----------
jacket


---------71:59----------
uh yeah i think that many many years ago


---------72:02----------
i don't really remember


---------72:03----------
much about it but it's just like


---------72:04----------
collectively like everyone like beating


---------72:06----------
it's just like beating people down until


---------72:07----------
they're like


---------72:08----------
and some people don't deal with it like


---------72:09----------
very well so yeah that kind of thing


---------72:11----------
anyways going on


---------72:13----------
no what does that mean some people don't


---------72:14----------
deal with it well what what are they


---------72:16----------
well the guy


---------72:16----------
the guy in the movie ends up committing


---------72:18----------
suicide so like


---------72:19----------
the military has like an enormous like


---------72:22----------
that more people die of suicide in the


---------72:23----------
military than


---------72:24----------
combat or anything like that or of


---------72:26----------
anything else like the suicide rate is


---------72:28----------
insanely high like i've known like so


---------72:30----------
many people to commit suicide in the


---------72:32----------
military


---------72:33----------
and like that's something you have to


---------72:33----------
deal with too it's like these guys can't


---------72:36----------
deal with it and they're like


---------72:37----------
checking out like these are people like


---------72:39----------
that are like on my ship with me like


---------72:41----------
they're


---------72:41----------
like how am i like how am i dealing with


---------72:43----------
this you know it's like


---------72:44----------
oh my god yeah yeah so


---------72:48----------
you're dealing with like statistic is


---------72:50----------
actually true that more people in the


---------72:51----------
military die of suicide than combat


---------72:54----------
i'm pretty sure that's still true like a


---------72:56----------
non and not during non-combat times


---------72:58----------
is definitely true so like literally


---------73:00----------
every other week we'd have like some


---------73:03----------
suicide prevention training or some like


---------73:06----------
talk about


---------73:07----------
yeah it was just like always like being


---------73:10----------
talked about


---------73:12----------
so did it help


---------73:15----------
well in the military it's like you're


---------73:18----------
basically


---------73:18----------
just it's like one of those things like


---------73:20----------
you have to go to this class like it's


---------73:22----------
just another thing you have to do


---------73:23----------
you know what i mean and and the people


---------73:25----------
that are instructing it


---------73:27----------
are like it's like i said the people


---------73:29----------
that are in charge of you are


---------73:30----------
probably not the smartest people or like


---------73:32----------
emotionally developed people


---------73:33----------
so you have like bubba gump senior


---------73:37----------
lpo whatever like all right guys now you


---------73:39----------
think about


---------73:40----------
killing yourself no all right you know


---------73:43----------
we're gonna sit in this class for an


---------73:44----------
hour now like


---------73:46----------
it's like yeah it's just like people


---------73:50----------
people that are not qualified to be


---------73:52----------
talking about this stuff like trying to


---------73:53----------
help you deal with this stuff you know


---------73:55----------
you know it's it's funny i'm noticing an


---------73:57----------
interesting connection so


---------73:58----------
on wednesday we actually had the mods


---------74:01----------
from live stream fails


---------74:03----------
yeah kind of talking about reddit's


---------74:07----------
like mental health support dm


---------74:11----------
bot oh god that's pretty much yeah that


---------74:13----------
was that was what was going on


---------74:15----------
so i'm hearing like this theme like i


---------74:17----------
didn't think that you know there'd be


---------74:18----------
anything relating to your interview in


---------74:20----------
in their interview that would be


---------74:22----------
connected and the thing that connects it


---------74:24----------
is like


---------74:25----------
it seems like there are a lot of


---------74:26----------
organizations out there that check a box


---------74:28----------
in terms of oh this is a problem let's


---------74:31----------
do something


---------74:32----------
let's do something that allows us to say


---------74:34----------
that we're doing something about the


---------74:36----------
problem


---------74:37----------
exactly that's pretty much what's going


---------74:38----------
down and instead of doing


---------74:40----------
something yeah it's like did you fill


---------74:42----------
out the pamphlet


---------74:43----------
that detect that i didn't it's like you


---------74:45----------
don't want to kill yourself it's like


---------74:46----------
all right nice


---------74:47----------
work here is done yes


---------74:51----------
like yeah it's interesting i worked at a


---------74:55----------
prison


---------74:56----------
that had a very interesting approach to


---------74:58----------
suicide prevention


---------75:01----------
they punished people for being suicidal


---------75:04----------
so


---------75:04----------
if you kind of get evaluated and you're


---------75:07----------
suicidal


---------75:08----------
they essentially put you in solitary


---------75:10----------
confinement


---------75:11----------
with like paper clothing they give you


---------75:14----------
like a paper gown so you can't like hang


---------75:16----------
yourself


---------75:17----------
there's no [ __ ] way you can hang


---------75:18----------
yourself because there's one person


---------75:20----------
watching like six cells


---------75:23----------
and and so they just like stick people


---------75:25----------
in there and then they get like


---------75:26----------
periodically evaluated


---------75:28----------
and as long as they were better


---------75:30----------
afterwards right they got yeah yep


---------75:32----------
yep and i was the one doing the


---------75:33----------
evaluations so


---------75:35----------
it was like are you are you not suicidal


---------75:38----------
or do you want to stay another day by


---------75:40----------
yourself with no tv


---------75:41----------
nothing to do 24 hours of solitary


---------75:44----------
confinement for your own safety


---------75:46----------
and it was it was terrifying but also


---------75:50----------
eye-opening this is america


---------75:53----------
yeah i i i don't even know how much i


---------75:57----------
like


---------75:57----------
as much as we bash america like things


---------76:00----------
are actually


---------76:00----------
pretty good here compared to most places


---------76:02----------
in the world


---------76:03----------
i'll agree i agree but we still got some


---------76:07----------
weird problems


---------76:08----------
yeah um yeah so brandon how you feeling


---------76:12----------
about this conversation because i'm kind


---------76:13----------
of noticing like i'm


---------76:14----------
really enjoying hearing like your


---------76:16----------
experiences and stuff but


---------76:17----------
i i just want to check in with you about


---------76:19----------
you know whether this is a good use of


---------76:20----------
our time or you wanted to talk about


---------76:22----------
something else or


---------76:24----------
i feel good and i mean my main purpose


---------76:26----------
on coming onto the show is like


---------76:28----------
obviously i wanted to talk about some of


---------76:29----------
my things and


---------76:30----------
i've never done therapy before or


---------76:31----------
anything like that like in the


---------76:32----------
traditional sense


---------76:34----------
um so like and i know this isn't like


---------76:37----------
therapy but it's like talking to


---------76:38----------
somebody that does therapy


---------76:40----------
and it's like i feel like i've been


---------76:43----------
i've been through a lot of stuff and


---------76:44----------
i've like messed my life up in a lot of


---------76:46----------
ways


---------76:46----------
and i learned from it and i hope to like


---------76:49----------
share that with people and like help


---------76:50----------
other people in that sense


---------76:51----------
yeah that's really awesome not that you


---------76:54----------
messed your life up but that you're


---------76:55----------
trying to


---------76:56----------
that's the last thing right and


---------77:00----------
out of curiosity anything keep you from


---------77:03----------
doing therapy or


---------77:04----------
trying it or uh


---------77:09----------
no i just uh i like


---------77:12----------
tinkering with the cogs myself i guess i


---------77:14----------
don't know


---------77:15----------
and i've done it in like a bunch of


---------77:16----------
different ways like


---------77:18----------
obviously like the ways we're talking


---------77:19----------
about earlier like psychedelics and


---------77:22----------
uh that kind of stuff too and it should


---------77:25----------
i feel like that


---------77:26----------
that has that actually helped me a lot


---------77:28----------
like so


---------77:30----------
it's like that's working for me so it's


---------77:31----------
like i'm just gonna keep going with that


---------77:34----------
and like i'm gonna mentally i feel like


---------77:35----------
i'm in a good place right now


---------77:36----------
sure yeah


---------77:40----------
and um so did you want to talk about


---------77:42----------
like focus


---------77:43----------
or or like you know how your mind works


---------77:48----------
yeah well i mean the the focus thing


---------77:52----------
kind of like goes with the


---------77:55----------
i guess like when i first started uh


---------77:57----------
being a pro gamer


---------77:58----------
like i could get in this like hyper


---------78:00----------
focused state right


---------78:02----------
and like i'd be like dialed in


---------78:05----------
and then i think like over the years


---------78:07----------
it's like i was like drinking and like


---------78:09----------
smoking and all that kind of stuff it's


---------78:10----------
like


---------78:11----------
i would like have like a blip like my


---------78:14----------
brain would like randomly like lag


---------78:16----------
like a computer you know i would like


---------78:18----------
and i would just i would jump out of


---------78:20----------
that hyper focus state


---------78:22----------
and it'd be like in a game and i just


---------78:24----------
like randomly run it down you know i


---------78:25----------
just like


---------78:26----------
die in the game just and it could be


---------78:28----------
like anything and then i find him


---------78:29----------
and then eventually i found like myself


---------78:32----------
having like those moments in like real


---------78:34----------
life where it's like


---------78:36----------
i'd be focused in on something and then


---------78:38----------
it's like my brain lags


---------78:41----------
and it's like it just i don't know it's


---------78:44----------
like when your computer lies or like you


---------78:45----------
get like pink spike


---------78:46----------
it's like almost that same experience so


---------78:49----------
yeah i'm not sure really it's just


---------78:53----------
and i i don't know and obviously i've


---------78:55----------
like read about it and like talked about


---------78:56----------
or


---------78:57----------
talked to people about us like and it's


---------78:58----------
always like because like you need to


---------78:59----------
practice mindfulness or like


---------79:02----------
um like be in the moment more to like


---------79:05----------
yeah it's because it's like that lag is


---------79:07----------
like your brain trying to get it


---------79:08----------
something else like subconsciously right


---------79:10----------
or like moving into like another


---------79:12----------
is it i don't know well i think i think


---------79:14----------
it is it's like


---------79:15----------
it could be like something random like


---------79:18----------
uh


---------79:19----------
like i'm focused in on the game or like


---------79:20----------
this conversation i have somebody and


---------79:22----------
then my brain


---------79:23----------
could like random subconsciously try to


---------79:26----------
go off into something


---------79:27----------
of like the past or the future or like


---------79:30----------
something that's like


---------79:31----------
in the back of my mind you know like i'm


---------79:33----------
i could be worried about or


---------79:36----------
anything like at least that's my


---------79:37----------
understanding like what's going on


---------79:39----------
it's just in terms of what breaks your


---------79:42----------
hyper-focused state


---------79:44----------
yeah it's well i know it's like hard for


---------79:46----------
me to focus anymore like that


---------79:47----------
but it's it's like yeah it's like


---------79:50----------
something is put like snapping me out of


---------79:52----------
it you know like right


---------79:54----------
i like lose that focus and i can't


---------79:57----------
and i feel like it's like been


---------79:58----------
deteriorating over time you know


---------80:01----------
that's how you know like well it's


---------80:04----------
not in like uh well you know like people


---------80:06----------
say that


---------80:08----------
uh dis gamers 22 he's passed his prime


---------80:11----------
for being a pro gamer you know like that


---------80:13----------
kind of thing


---------80:14----------
i think that it's not that um


---------80:17----------
you know they're like your fingers don't


---------80:18----------
work anymore all that kind of stuff and


---------80:19----------
like as a player ages


---------80:21----------
i don't think it has anything to do with


---------80:22----------
that it's more like i think


---------80:24----------
all like high level gamers i can like


---------80:27----------
reach that focus state right


---------80:29----------
and i think a lot of that has to do with


---------80:32----------
in their earlier age like their number


---------80:34----------
one main priority like the things


---------80:36----------
they're thinking about and all they care


---------80:37----------
about is like that game right


---------80:38----------
and it's like as you go through life


---------80:41----------
more


---------80:42----------
things like you start to care about more


---------80:44----------
things than the game


---------80:45----------
like the other things start like to come


---------80:46----------
into the picture right


---------80:48----------
and i think that it's your brain like


---------80:51----------
subconsciously


---------80:52----------
like thinking about those other things


---------80:55----------
that like pulls you out of that state


---------80:57----------
and i feel like that's why like a lot of


---------80:58----------
pro gamers like get bad


---------81:00----------
or get worse as as they get older it has


---------81:02----------
nothing to do with like


---------81:04----------
hands or like ability or anything like


---------81:07----------
that it's that


---------81:08----------
it's that focus level and like i i see


---------81:11----------
you know a lot of people


---------81:13----------
um that are like older and insane but


---------81:16----------
it's like i see that


---------81:16----------
same i see what they it's not that same


---------81:19----------
focus level


---------81:20----------
you know they can still like dial it in


---------81:22----------
like that's why they're like able to


---------81:23----------
like keep doing it


---------81:26----------
interesting can i just think about that


---------81:29----------
for a second


---------81:30----------
yeah go for it


---------81:34----------
so you're saying that as the scope of


---------81:37----------
your life expands


---------81:40----------
your mind is less able to focus on video


---------81:42----------
games


---------81:43----------
because it's not like monolithic it's


---------81:45----------
not one-dimensional


---------81:47----------
so your mind has others


---------81:50----------
and i don't think that's the same for


---------81:52----------
everybody but i feel like that's what


---------81:54----------
started happening to me


---------81:55----------
and i've seen definitely seen it happen


---------81:56----------
like with a lot of like other


---------81:58----------
like people in the scene that ended up


---------82:00----------
retiring or like falling off


---------82:03----------
it's like their brain is like pulling


---------82:06----------
them away


---------82:08----------
like they could be worried about like


---------82:09----------
school or


---------82:11----------
not that's cool like job kind of stuff


---------82:13----------
or like relationship


---------82:15----------
or you know any of the normal like life


---------82:17----------
stuff and it's like those things instead


---------82:19----------
of just


---------82:20----------
before they were like way like in the


---------82:22----------
back it's like


---------82:24----------
and then the game is like way up here


---------82:25----------
like as far as like value and meaning


---------82:28----------
and it's and then they eventually start


---------82:30----------
to come up so


---------82:31----------
i mean we do have a good understanding


---------82:33----------
of like how to attain that hyper-focused


---------82:35----------
state from like a


---------82:36----------
neuroscience and and level like


---------82:40----------
um it'd be really interesting to look


---------82:42----------
into the mechanisms of why


---------82:45----------
professional gamers are young um i think


---------82:48----------
league of legends and


---------82:49----------
and dota uh are


---------82:53----------
good examples dota especially is like a


---------82:55----------
good example of like


---------82:56----------
the top tier teams all like tend to have


---------83:01----------
like old captains like way older than


---------83:04----------
most esports


---------83:05----------
dota i i don't know too much about like


---------83:06----------
what would you say is the average


---------83:08----------
lifespan of a league of legends player


---------83:11----------
like a professional no like three to


---------83:14----------
four year stops


---------83:15----------
and maybe like five to six they're like


---------83:18----------
super elite


---------83:20----------
yeah so i think dota feels longer than


---------83:23----------
that


---------83:24----------
so if you look at some top i mean the


---------83:25----------
average may actually be closer to like


---------83:27----------
two to four years but


---------83:29----------
there are a lot of like professional


---------83:31----------
dota players that have been playing some


---------83:34----------
form of moba competitively for like


---------83:37----------
yeah well that also has to do with


---------83:38----------
player population so like as the game


---------83:40----------
has like a larger


---------83:41----------
player population there's more people


---------83:43----------
that can come and buy for that spot


---------83:46----------
yeah interesting it becomes like far


---------83:48----------
more competitive so like you know


---------83:49----------
i'm sure like you're aware of like


---------83:51----------
everybody prefers like


---------83:52----------
uh western games gaming to like eat you


---------83:55----------
know


---------83:56----------
korea try and all that and you look at


---------83:58----------
their rank populations


---------84:00----------
they're like far they're you know two to


---------84:02----------
three like wait even like more


---------84:04----------
more than that like times the population


---------84:06----------
so as there's like a larger population


---------84:07----------
to like buy for your spot


---------84:09----------
like the bar gets raised like you know


---------84:12----------
it keeps getting raised


---------84:13----------
and dota dota has like i think it's like


---------84:17----------
the same like community still playing


---------84:18----------
the game yeah like obviously there's


---------84:20----------
like some


---------84:20----------
new players that trickle in but it's


---------84:22----------
like that new player has to


---------84:24----------
fight against like multiple years of


---------84:26----------
experience to like


---------84:28----------
break in right and dota is a very


---------84:29----------
complex game too


---------84:31----------
so it's like you have to learn all that


---------84:33----------
cumulative knowledge


---------84:34----------
and then you also have to like catch up


---------84:36----------
and then progress like beyond that


---------84:38----------
person right


---------84:39----------
yeah so and the same can be set for like


---------84:42----------
traditional sports too


---------84:44----------
so so yeah so i mean and i'm i'm hearing


---------84:47----------
you say that like


---------84:49----------
you think that a lot of your hyper focus


---------84:52----------
has gotten


---------84:53----------
harder as you've started to care about


---------84:55----------
other things


---------84:57----------
yes definitely i i definitely can't hang


---------85:00----------
in like league or any of those games


---------85:01----------
anymore


---------85:03----------
and what keeps you from hanging the


---------85:05----------
inability to gain hyper


---------85:07----------
focus yeah like being that like


---------85:10----------
before i could like dial myself in i


---------85:13----------
could


---------85:13----------
i could play for like 20 hours straight


---------85:16----------
like in


---------85:17----------
i would be like in i'd be like in the


---------85:19----------
zone the whole time


---------85:20----------
you know and uh i talked to like some


---------85:23----------
other doctors about this like for some


---------85:26----------
like summit like a while ago


---------85:28----------
and they were talking kind of like about


---------85:29----------
the difference you know like a


---------85:30----------
traditional sport


---------85:32----------
i can't click a button at two o'clock in


---------85:33----------
the morning and get into a game of like


---------85:37----------
nfl football you know all the other


---------85:39----------
players right


---------85:40----------
but a game like a video game i can click


---------85:42----------
a button at two o'clock in the morning


---------85:44----------
and i can be at people end of like a


---------85:46----------
full-fledged game with people relative


---------85:47----------
to my skill


---------85:49----------
and like any time i want right so


---------85:52----------
you have limitless amount of like


---------85:53----------
training time and the only thing holding


---------85:55----------
you back


---------85:56----------
is your ability to be focused in that


---------85:57----------
training time


---------85:59----------
so that's like that's what your com


---------86:02----------
that's what you're


---------86:03----------
fighting against and there's people that


---------86:05----------
will like keep pushing that boundary


---------86:06----------
like keep pushing it


---------86:08----------
yeah so that that's where i totally i've


---------86:10----------
gotten that as well i


---------86:11----------
so i trained at a place that had this


---------86:14----------
you know the


---------86:15----------
the sports psychologists and


---------86:17----------
psychiatrists for


---------86:19----------
the new england patriots and the boston


---------86:20----------
red sox


---------86:22----------
so it was interesting to it was a good


---------86:24----------
professional opportunity to be able to


---------86:25----------
work with those folks and


---------86:26----------
and talk to them about what their


---------86:28----------
experience of working with these like


---------86:30----------
you know top tier sports organizations


---------86:32----------
are


---------86:33----------
definitely there you know one of the


---------86:34----------
interesting things that came up was this


---------86:36----------
idea that like you can


---------86:37----------
only practice football for like


---------86:40----------
four hours a day yeah there's physical


---------86:44----------
yeah there's like a physical limitation


---------86:46----------
that there's clearly a diminishing


---------86:47----------
return


---------86:49----------
after like four hours of practice a day


---------86:51----------
let's say


---------86:53----------
and and so you know sports organizations


---------86:55----------
will do all kinds of things like hot


---------86:56----------
tubs and


---------86:57----------
and these magnetic machines and massages


---------86:59----------
and stuff like that


---------87:00----------
to try to get their players to like


---------87:02----------
practice for four and a half hours right


---------87:04----------
because if you can like heal the body a


---------87:05----------
little bit faster it gives you power up


---------87:08----------
yes and but in esports like i still


---------87:11----------
remember


---------87:12----------
one of my earliest engagements which i


---------87:14----------
guess is still under nda


---------87:16----------
is with a particular sport that i was


---------87:18----------
actually working for the company that


---------87:20----------
runs the sp that owns the game and and


---------87:23----------
talking to their


---------87:25----------
um so they had like an event where


---------87:28----------
a lot of their all their teams were


---------87:30----------
basically there


---------87:32----------
and so i was there and talking to the


---------87:33----------
coaches and it was interesting to hear


---------87:35----------
that they were saying like yeah like you


---------87:36----------
know we can


---------87:37----------
there's no physical limitation to the to


---------87:40----------
how much you play


---------87:41----------
now the interesting thing that we kind


---------87:43----------
of got into was


---------87:44----------
whether eight hours of playing pubs or


---------87:47----------
12 hours of playing pubs


---------87:48----------
i like whether those extra four hours of


---------87:51----------
playing pubs


---------87:51----------
actually does anything to improve your


---------87:53----------
skill just goes back to focus


---------87:56----------
like if it's focus practice it'll do


---------87:58----------
something but


---------87:59----------
like that's something that's the when


---------88:01----------
you notice like a true super elite


---------88:03----------
game like person in gaming it's the


---------88:05----------
focus thing every time


---------88:06----------
like you're like bjergsen you had him on


---------88:08----------
the show right like he is like


---------88:10----------
focused all the time when he's playing


---------88:12----------
like


---------88:13----------
it's like there's a difference between


---------88:15----------
just i'm gonna queue up 20 hours in a


---------88:17----------
row and just like


---------88:17----------
autopilot and like that's what a lot of


---------88:20----------
people do right that's the difference


---------88:21----------
between like the real elite


---------88:23----------
and the and it's being able to reach


---------88:25----------
that


---------88:26----------
and it it's like i felt it's like


---------88:28----------
there's a point where i could reach that


---------88:30----------
before


---------88:30----------
i just can't do it anymore and it's like


---------88:34----------
i felt it just slipped away from me


---------88:36----------
and it's like yeah


---------88:40----------
how do you feel about that uh


---------88:44----------
it was definitely difficult to deal with


---------88:46----------
at the time because it's like i was


---------88:47----------
really good at


---------88:48----------
and this is like on top of all the stuff


---------88:49----------
we talked about before it's like my


---------88:51----------
value was that i was really good at this


---------88:52----------
game right


---------88:53----------
and then i was in the i got thrown into


---------88:56----------
like the limelight and all that and


---------88:58----------
uh you know i i was like streaming like


---------89:01----------
i was like


---------89:02----------
people like light you know liked me and


---------89:04----------
all that um same thing like any of these


---------89:06----------
other like streamers deal with


---------89:07----------
and it's like then i feel my ability


---------89:08----------
like slipping right


---------89:10----------
i'm like my ability to be focused and


---------89:13----------
it's like i feel like my value is


---------89:14----------
slipping


---------89:14----------
you know and like this is before like i


---------89:17----------
had built like all


---------89:19----------
like the deal with like the empathy all


---------89:21----------
that kind of stuff so it's like


---------89:22----------
it was definitely very tough for me to


---------89:24----------
deal with at the time how did you deal


---------89:26----------
with it


---------89:28----------
not very well do you remember what


---------89:32----------
what kind of thoughts you would have in


---------89:33----------
your head


---------89:35----------
i was just like very unstable like both


---------89:38----------
emotionally and like


---------89:40----------
mentally so like the stress is also


---------89:42----------
kicking in too right you have like the


---------89:43----------
stress on top of like


---------89:44----------
not knowing what cause like you're like


---------89:48----------
all in like if you


---------89:48----------
if you're gonna be like a pro gamer


---------89:50----------
you're all in right you have to you


---------89:51----------
commit to it fully


---------89:53----------
so it's like i'm dealing with the stress


---------89:55----------
from that where it's like


---------89:57----------
[ __ ] do i i'm gonna go back to school


---------89:59----------
like what am i gonna do like all the you


---------90:00----------
know that kind of stuff and then it's


---------90:02----------
like


---------90:02----------
also you've alienated a lot of like your


---------90:05----------
relationships that you've had like both


---------90:06----------
like friendship


---------90:07----------
significant otherwise to like put this


---------90:10----------
game as a priority right


---------90:12----------
and so it's like the thing that you put


---------90:13----------
is like your priority is like slipping


---------90:15----------
like you're you're like not able to like


---------90:18----------
do it


---------90:18----------
you know so it's like very tough to like


---------90:21----------
come to terms with


---------90:23----------
so yeah do you remember what kind of


---------90:26----------
thoughts you would have


---------90:29----------
um just stress like more so like well


---------90:32----------
like what am i going to do like how can


---------90:33----------
i fix this


---------90:35----------
uh that's why i started reading about


---------90:37----------
like you know


---------90:38----------
sports performance psychology all that


---------90:40----------
that's like when i started getting to


---------90:41----------
that like philosophy


---------90:42----------
it's like i'm gonna do like anything i


---------90:44----------
can to like try to like get this state


---------90:46----------
back but it's like


---------90:47----------
like nothing i could do like a give me


---------90:48----------
back and i think it's just because i


---------90:51----------
like lost


---------90:51----------
that like obsession with the game you


---------90:54----------
know and instead of doing it


---------90:56----------
because i like really really enjoyed it


---------90:58----------
i was doing it just because like


---------90:59----------
this is my habit i'm like playing this


---------91:02----------
game because like this is and it's the


---------91:03----------
same as like anything i did like


---------91:04----------
drinking smoking


---------91:05----------
all it's like i'm doing this and trying


---------91:07----------
to keep doing this


---------91:09----------
because like this is what i do you know


---------91:11----------
yeah i'm also hearing


---------91:13----------
so i think what also shatters the focus


---------91:15----------
as he used to do it


---------91:16----------
out of potentially passion for the game


---------91:19----------
yeah i love the game


---------91:20----------
and and what i'm hearing is that you


---------91:22----------
started doing it


---------91:25----------
to hold on as opposed to love for the


---------91:28----------
game exactly


---------91:30----------
it's a job it becomes a joke i mean it


---------91:32----------
comes to draw for everybody like that


---------91:33----------
gets into pro


---------91:34----------
well i think i think it's the attachment


---------91:36----------
to like holding on that i think actually


---------91:38----------
negatively impacts the focus and may


---------91:40----------
create a vicious cycle


---------91:42----------
that the longer the the more you try to


---------91:44----------
hold on the harder it becomes to like


---------91:47----------
enter the flow state of mind of like


---------91:49----------
hyper focus


---------91:50----------
because you're trying to like grab


---------91:52----------
something from the past


---------91:54----------
and as we started off with you know


---------91:57----------
being in the present


---------91:58----------
is better i think and when you're hyper


---------92:01----------
focused i'd assume that you'd call that


---------92:03----------
a present focused state like you're in


---------92:04----------
the present


---------92:05----------
at that time yeah


---------92:08----------
flow state yeah that's like an


---------92:10----------
interesting thing to read about too it's


---------92:12----------
like


---------92:12----------
everybody's like trying to reach the


---------92:14----------
flow state yeah so i i think that's that


---------92:17----------
also is where like


---------92:18----------
you know it's interesting you were


---------92:19----------
saying that there are the more things


---------92:20----------
that you care about


---------92:21----------
or the wider the scope of your your life


---------92:25----------
the harder it is to get into the state


---------92:27----------
of hyper focus so it's been my


---------92:28----------
experience that


---------92:30----------
sometimes when i work with a team


---------92:32----------
there's like


---------92:34----------
emotional bad blood that needs to be


---------92:37----------
worked through


---------92:39----------
and like occupies like your subconscious


---------92:41----------
ram


---------92:42----------
and like the more that your subconscious


---------92:45----------
ram it's like all this


---------92:46----------
like all these process old processes


---------92:48----------
from tournaments long past that are just


---------92:50----------
like minimized


---------92:52----------
into this tray and that as you work


---------92:55----------
through that stuff and you start closing


---------92:57----------
down those processes you kind of


---------92:59----------
apologize forgive or even own that i


---------93:03----------
will never forgive you for this


---------93:05----------
interestingly enough they start to play


---------93:07----------
better the focus starts to return


---------93:09----------
yeah and you don't necessarily have to


---------93:12----------
have a happy ending but you do


---------93:13----------
have to do some amount of emotional


---------93:15----------
processing and like close all that


---------93:17----------
crap that you've got minimized


---------93:20----------
yeah and when i played there was like no


---------93:23----------
coaches


---------93:24----------
there was like nobody supporting you in


---------93:26----------
that stuff so it's like


---------93:28----------
it's like well go deal with yourself


---------93:31----------
this is definitely tough yeah go deal


---------93:34----------
with it yourself sounds like the story


---------93:36----------
of your life brandon


---------93:38----------
fun times that's really good though


---------93:42----------
yeah no it's it's interesting right


---------93:44----------
because that's like


---------93:46----------
you know i'm hearing that that's what


---------93:48----------
happened growing up i'm hearing that's


---------93:49----------
what happened in the military i'm


---------93:50----------
hearing


---------93:52----------
you know that's what happened when you


---------93:54----------
were a professional wall player


---------93:55----------
and i'm hearing that maybe the reason


---------93:57----------
you're happy is because you're not


---------93:58----------
dealing with it with


---------93:59----------
yourself anymore uh


---------94:03----------
well no i'm silly yeah like uh


---------94:07----------
oh i'm happy because i'm not dealing


---------94:08----------
with myself yeah yeah yeah sharing


---------94:10----------
experiences like yeah


---------94:12----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean we haven't


---------94:14----------
really talked about what that means but


---------94:15----------
i've noticed use the phrase sharing


---------94:17----------
experiences many times


---------94:19----------
and what i'm doing is like make i'm


---------94:22----------
equating those two things that there's


---------94:25----------
there's brandon that


---------94:27----------
did it himself and had to do it himself


---------94:30----------
which i think it's reasonable for you to


---------94:32----------
have some degree of


---------94:34----------
sadness towards regret about


---------94:37----------
feels bad man sad yeah


---------94:41----------
you know and then there's brandon who


---------94:43----------
now


---------94:45----------
is is it solo queuing anymore not so


---------94:48----------
like you anymore we're in the flex queue


---------94:51----------
what does flex q mean uh it's this like


---------94:55----------
pretty much just like you could team up


---------94:56----------
with your friends and like me


---------94:58----------
yeah yeah


---------95:01----------
any questions for me right


---------95:05----------
no i'm good i'm fine i think i talked


---------95:08----------
about a lot of stuff i want to talk


---------95:09----------
about i mean there's like a bunch of


---------95:10----------
stuff i could go into but


---------95:12----------
quite a long time so it's fine yeah i


---------95:14----------
mean i i sort of try to


---------95:15----------
you know we usually do this for about


---------95:17----------
two hours at a stretch like somewhere


---------95:18----------
around there


---------95:19----------
um no this is good yeah i appreciate it


---------95:22----------
uh


---------95:23----------
and you know if you have questions or


---------95:24----------
things that you want to talk about we


---------95:25----------
still have time it's just


---------95:27----------
you know i want to be call attention you


---------95:30----------
know just be aware of like


---------95:32----------
what this you know how how long is this


---------95:34----------
game of law going to last


---------95:36----------
yeah yeah um hmm


---------95:40----------
let's talk about i mean i i still feel


---------95:43----------
like a lot of these things like carry


---------95:44----------
over into like my


---------95:45----------
like i say i'm good now but like it's


---------95:46----------
not a lot of these things like carry


---------95:47----------
over and it's like still


---------95:49----------
things like i'm like constantly


---------95:50----------
tinkering with and like like what


---------95:53----------
uh just like relationships with people


---------95:56----------
or like


---------95:57----------
uh like like


---------96:00----------
like friendships like it's still like


---------96:03----------
because of like my past experiences the


---------96:06----------
concept of like what a friendship is is


---------96:08----------
still like even to this day something


---------96:10----------
i'm like figuring


---------96:13----------
out you know what i mean and i'm like


---------96:15----------
i'm a grown man you know and it's like


---------96:17----------
i'm still figuring that out to this day


---------96:19----------
you know can you give me an example of


---------96:22----------
what you're what you're figuring out or


---------96:24----------
a situation in which it's clear that you


---------96:26----------
haven't figured everything out yet


---------96:28----------
[Music]


---------96:31----------
ah how to explain it it's like i feel


---------96:34----------
like


---------96:36----------
uh i feel like uh


---------96:40----------
even my close friendships are like at an


---------96:43----------
arm's length


---------96:44----------
you know i'm not ex it's really


---------96:47----------
explained


---------96:48----------
that it's like uh i think it's more


---------96:52----------
like to do with like how people are in


---------96:54----------
like


---------96:56----------
modern times like i don't say modern


---------96:58----------
times but like


---------97:00----------
uh i'm


---------97:04----------
i'm really having a hard time like it's


---------97:06----------
yep so i feel like


---------97:07----------
brandon here's the here's the problem


---------97:10----------
i think you're trying to piece it


---------97:12----------
together so you're speaking in


---------97:13----------
abstractions


---------97:15----------
and my instinct is that if you want to


---------97:17----------
understand this better


---------97:18----------
stop speaking in abstractions because


---------97:21----------
yeah i'm trying to find like an exact


---------97:23----------
like instance it's more so like i feel


---------97:25----------
like my friendship should be closer than


---------97:26----------
they are


---------97:27----------
okay good that's a good statement well


---------97:29----------
like with the amount of effort i put in


---------97:31----------
but i don't think i don't actually don't


---------97:33----------
put that much effort in actually i'm


---------97:34----------
lazy


---------97:35----------
yeah so it's like i i would like to have


---------97:37----------
like closer friendships with people but


---------97:39----------
i feel like it's like


---------97:42----------
i'm so used to being by myself you know


---------97:44----------
that it's like difficult for me to


---------97:46----------
to match like people's effort and uh


---------97:50----------
yeah you know so we're gonna we're gonna


---------97:53----------
try to speed run this okay


---------97:54----------
okay so i think there's a lot of value


---------97:57----------
here i think it's really important to


---------97:58----------
talk about i don't want to leave the


---------98:00----------
conversation without giving it a shot


---------98:02----------
okay go for it all right so the first


---------98:04----------
thing is


---------98:06----------
so you feel like your relationships are


---------98:08----------
closer than they should


---------98:10----------
should be closer than they are that even


---------98:13----------
the people you consider close friends


---------98:16----------
you kind of keep at arm's length yes


---------98:21----------
so when i say that to you i'm seeing


---------98:22----------
emotion in your face


---------98:24----------
yes yes okay so


---------98:28----------
what what am i saying that's triggering


---------98:30----------
something in you


---------98:32----------
um what's up basically uh i'll just like


---------98:35----------
summarize that community


---------98:36----------
basically i'm so used to being alone in


---------98:38----------
my life and like on my own doing my own


---------98:40----------
thing


---------98:41----------
like figuring out my own [ __ ] that even


---------98:43----------
when i do have people in my life


---------98:44----------
that like want to share experiences


---------98:47----------
i can't even like process it you know


---------98:50----------
because i'm like


---------98:51----------
this doesn't make sense like in my mind


---------98:53----------
it's like


---------98:54----------
i'm too used to being on my own you know


---------98:57----------
um


---------98:59----------
so like i can't like i can't like


---------99:01----------
process like that friendship


---------99:03----------
what does that mean you can't process


---------99:04----------
that friendship


---------99:06----------
it's like there could be a moment where


---------99:08----------
i'm supposed to be close to that person


---------99:10----------
and i still like i feel like it's like


---------99:13----------
alien you know it's like i shouldn't


---------99:16----------
it's like i feel like i shouldn't be


---------99:17----------
feeling this


---------99:18----------
you know what should you be feeling or


---------99:21----------
what are you feeling that you shouldn't


---------99:22----------
be feeling


---------99:24----------
or it's like i feel like i should be


---------99:26----------
closer with them


---------99:27----------
like in those moments you know i feel


---------99:29----------
like i should be feeling closer


---------99:31----------
but it's like i'm so used to being alone


---------99:34----------
like feeling alone


---------99:36----------
and like dealing with [ __ ] on my own


---------99:38----------
that


---------99:39----------
i don't know how to like mentally


---------99:43----------
and like emotionally like go through


---------99:45----------
that with that person to like connect


---------99:46----------
that moment


---------99:47----------
you know it's like uh


---------99:50----------
i didn't read the i didn't read like


---------99:52----------
friendships for dummies you know


---------99:54----------
so i read that book i'm hearing that you


---------99:56----------
don't know how to be a friend


---------99:59----------
yes i feel like i don't


---------100:03----------
i see like other people's friendships


---------100:04----------
and it's like i feel like


---------100:07----------
what's like oh i should i should like i


---------100:09----------
feel like like the way they spend time


---------100:10----------
together all day like


---------100:12----------
i have a good friend group like don't


---------100:13----------
get me wrong i have a lot of friends


---------100:16----------
but it's like i don't feel like that


---------100:18----------
it's


---------100:19----------
at i don't feel like our interactions


---------100:21----------
are like at


---------100:23----------
uh it's like not a like i don't feel


---------100:24----------
like the closeness is there like as it


---------100:26----------
should be you know and i think it's like


---------100:28----------
my fault


---------100:29----------
you know okay


---------100:33----------
what makes you think it's your fault or


---------100:35----------
what's your fault in this


---------100:37----------
because um


---------100:42----------
i'm like my brain is like off in its own


---------100:45----------
world all the time


---------100:46----------
or like uh the social cue thing


---------100:49----------
are like i'm here still different you


---------100:52----------
feel difficult


---------100:54----------
yeah i feel deficient because just


---------100:56----------
because it's like


---------100:58----------
first 25 years of my life i'm like not


---------101:00----------
doing this right


---------101:01----------
so i want you to brandon you yes


---------101:05----------
learn how to stop doing this thing


---------101:08----------
sometimes i'll ask you a question


---------101:10----------
and you'll give me an answer and then


---------101:12----------
you'll give me an explanation


---------101:14----------
okay okay okay what we need is if you


---------101:17----------
want to make


---------101:18----------
progress here forget about everything


---------101:20----------
after the word because


---------101:22----------
okay do you understand what i'm saying


---------101:25----------
yes right so like when you feel a


---------101:28----------
particular way like if i ask you


---------101:30----------
do you feel deficient what does your


---------101:32----------
mind do


---------101:34----------
tries to explain my mind tries to


---------101:37----------
explain why i'm deficient


---------101:39----------
yeah like i try to come up with a


---------101:40----------
logical reasoning of it yep


---------101:42----------
right but that sort of doesn't


---------101:46----------
it's not that it doesn't matter it's


---------101:47----------
just that i don't think that that's


---------101:49----------
where


---------101:49----------
the work you need to do is yes


---------101:53----------
so i know this sounds kind of weird but


---------101:56----------
like


---------101:58----------
what is it like


---------102:02----------
why do you think that your mind does


---------102:04----------
that


---------102:05----------
the explaining yeah i mean that's just


---------102:09----------
who i am as a person like when i'm


---------102:11----------
playing a game i'm like trying to


---------102:12----------
logically figure it out right


---------102:14----------
yep or like do anything i'm like trying


---------102:16----------
to logically figure it out to come to a


---------102:18----------
conclusion


---------102:19----------
like i'm trying to beat the game yep and


---------102:21----------
these these friendships are a game


---------102:23----------
almost in the way it's like i'm trying


---------102:24----------
to beat the game of friendships


---------102:26----------
yep very well said it's who you are and


---------102:29----------
that's what needs to change


---------102:31----------
because you've been trying to beat the


---------102:33----------
game of friendships for a while so i


---------102:35----------
think we got to teach you a different


---------102:36----------
way


---------102:38----------
can i think for a second go for it


---------102:43----------
i'm glad you mentioned this by the way


---------102:51----------
what should your relationships be like


---------102:58----------
uh


---------103:02----------
i feel like uh hmm


---------103:06----------
i see like some friends have like


---------103:08----------
they're like literally like life


---------103:09----------
partners


---------103:10----------
like they want to experience life


---------103:12----------
together you know like that's the best


---------103:14----------
way to have life right


---------103:16----------
is you're just sharing life experiences


---------103:19----------
all the time right


---------103:20----------
in like a positive way negative way it


---------103:22----------
doesn't matter


---------103:24----------
and i feel like i miss out on a lot of


---------103:25----------
those experiences


---------103:27----------
how long have you felt lonely brandon uh


---------103:30----------
i don't wanna say


---------103:31----------
okay i don't wanna use the word lonely


---------103:32----------
cause like that's not the right


---------103:34----------
way to describe it but it's like


---------103:38----------
i think the deficiency is like the right


---------103:39----------
way to say it it's like i feel like


---------103:43----------
i'm at like a six or a five and like i


---------103:45----------
want to be at like a nine or ten


---------103:47----------
you know what i mean and


---------103:51----------
what made you a five or six instead of a


---------103:53----------
nine or a ten


---------103:56----------
um i feel like i'm playing ketchup


---------104:00----------
you know it's like you know when we


---------104:01----------
talked about the cumulative knowledge


---------104:02----------
thing with like the games


---------104:04----------
it's like i feel like i'm playing


---------104:06----------
catch-up in like the


---------104:09----------
human interaction thing why did i play


---------104:12----------
catch-up in the first place


---------104:14----------
because i


---------104:17----------
didn't have those experiences when i


---------104:19----------
just put myself on the computer and


---------104:21----------
pretty much like isolated myself for


---------104:23----------
like the first 20 years of my life


---------104:25----------
whose fault is it that you're playing


---------104:27----------
catch up


---------104:28----------
well i mean my own of course like i'm


---------104:31----------
the one who decided to do


---------104:32----------
that like i could like deflect and like


---------104:34----------
put them like oh my parents are like


---------104:36----------
you know this it it always comes back to


---------104:38----------
yourself like you're the ultimate


---------104:40----------
person responsible for yourself and like


---------104:42----------
your life like


---------104:44----------
so it's like i understand like what i


---------104:46----------
did and it's like


---------104:48----------
now we go back to like the mindset of i


---------104:49----------
need to beat the game so like i'm trying


---------104:51----------
to figure out


---------104:53----------
mentally how to like


---------104:56----------
you know tinker with my brain all the


---------104:57----------
stuff you talk about inner monologue all


---------104:59----------
that kind of junk


---------105:00----------
to like have better experiences with


---------105:02----------
people and like


---------105:03----------
create better experiences for them you


---------105:05----------
know


---------105:10----------
okay i think for a second go for it


---------105:18----------
[Music]


---------105:20----------
you know blaming yourself you got some


---------105:23----------
snot by the way yeah sorry yeah it's all


---------105:27----------
good i'm just


---------105:27----------
you know uh i'm gonna get it now kid


---------105:56----------
all right i'm back welcome back brendan


---------106:00----------
yeah so i'm gonna say something kind of


---------106:02----------
weird okay so i think you're good at


---------106:04----------
figuring things out


---------106:06----------
okay and so if you're stuck somewhere


---------106:11----------
i think that it's not a problem of like


---------106:13----------
not being able to solve the problem i


---------106:15----------
think you're trying to solve the wrong


---------106:16----------
problem it's a problem of misdiagnosis


---------106:20----------
and one of the hardest things to do


---------106:24----------
if you blame yourself and you try to fix


---------106:26----------
things one of the saddest things that i


---------106:29----------
routinely see is when people blame


---------106:32----------
themselves for something that's not


---------106:34----------
actually their fault so


---------106:37----------
they're never able to fix it because the


---------106:40----------
fault doesn't lie with you


---------106:42----------
and as long as you own the faults of


---------106:44----------
other people


---------106:47----------
like that's not something that can ever


---------106:49----------
be fixed


---------106:52----------
does that make sense yeah it makes sense


---------106:55----------
i understand what you're trying to say


---------106:59----------
so i i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------107:00----------
like the idea that you were


---------107:03----------
deficient the idea that it's all your


---------107:06----------
fault on the one hand is helpful


---------107:08----------
is adaptive right because if everything


---------107:10----------
is your fault


---------107:13----------
you have it within your your power to


---------107:15----------
fix it


---------107:18----------
yes and and so there's something


---------107:20----------
actually bizarrely comforting


---------107:22----------
about beating yourself up because then


---------107:25----------
like and i


---------107:26----------
honestly i see this in cases of like


---------107:28----------
abuse and neglect where like


---------107:30----------
people learn to think it's their fault


---------107:32----------
and i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------107:34----------
why does that happen so much it's


---------107:35----------
because


---------107:36----------
actually the alternative is like way


---------107:38----------
harder


---------107:40----------
like like dealing with a world where


---------107:43----------
you're in the situation that you're in


---------107:46----------
because you didn't not because of


---------107:48----------
something that you did wrong but


---------107:50----------
because other people did something wrong


---------107:53----------
is like a terrifying world to live in


---------107:56----------
there's so much uncertainty because if


---------107:58----------
you're not to blame then can you ever


---------108:00----------
fix it like i don't know


---------108:02----------
like taking away power from yourself in


---------108:03----------
that situation absolutely


---------108:08----------
and and this is the kind of thing where


---------108:09----------
i would be really careful


---------108:13----------
because i mean like sure you played a


---------108:16----------
bunch of video games but like


---------108:19----------
and and i know that like we sort of talk


---------108:20----------
about like holding on to resentment


---------108:23----------
is a bad thing but i think that you're


---------108:25----------
doing something really really bizarre


---------108:27----------
which is if you accept if you're not if


---------108:30----------
you accept more blame than what you're


---------108:31----------
responsible for


---------108:32----------
you're in a like an unsolvable situation


---------108:38----------
okay that makes sense right so i get


---------108:42----------
that you


---------108:43----------
feel deficient but i think you've got to


---------108:44----------
be careful about


---------108:48----------
the logical plan of action that you


---------108:51----------
build


---------108:52----------
rooted in an emotion that you are not


---------108:54----------
good enough


---------108:55----------
that you are deficient in some way


---------109:00----------
because like all of that thinking starts


---------109:02----------
from like that


---------109:03----------
emotional core


---------109:06----------
and i think the reason that you've made


---------109:08----------
progress and i'm sure you'll continue to


---------109:10----------
make progress i think you'll make


---------109:11----------
progress


---------109:12----------
faster if you understand like


---------109:16----------
like the reason you feel deficient


---------109:20----------
now we're speed running so you know you


---------109:22----------
know i may recommend a couple of other


---------109:23----------
things to you


---------109:25----------
at the top of the list is we're


---------109:26----------
releasing a guide on mental health which


---------109:28----------
i think there are one or two videos that


---------109:29----------
you should definitely watch


---------109:31----------
because your textbook um


---------109:35----------
but but it's kind of interesting because


---------109:37----------
like if you think about how long have


---------109:38----------
you felt deficient


---------109:42----------
i mean my whole life obviously like it's


---------109:47----------
yeah right all right yeah


---------109:50----------
so if you think about it that's


---------109:51----------
something that you carry with you


---------109:54----------
right it shapes like all of the way that


---------109:56----------
you look at the world


---------109:58----------
and if you want to form like healthy


---------110:00----------
relationships


---------110:01----------
like it's going to be really hard if you


---------110:03----------
don't believe that you're someone that's


---------110:06----------
form


---------110:06----------
worth forming a healthy relationship


---------110:08----------
with


---------110:10----------
like what keeps your friends at arm's


---------110:12----------
length


---------110:14----------
because you keep on saying i'm used to


---------110:16----------
being on my own like yeah i get you're


---------110:18----------
used to it but it's not what you want


---------110:22----------
i feel like part of me does want to be


---------110:24----------
on my own though you're right


---------110:26----------
why it's like comforting because it's


---------110:29----------
the normality


---------110:30----------
not just the normality it's like my


---------110:33----------
routine


---------110:34----------
so i think there's value to routine but


---------110:37----------
what would it be like


---------110:39----------
to not keep people at arm's length


---------110:42----------
what do you gain by keeping them at


---------110:44----------
arm's length


---------110:49----------
just the same thing so save the same


---------110:51----------
routine same


---------110:52----------
same thing don't get anything i think


---------110:55----------
you gain more than that


---------110:57----------
so i want you to think about a time


---------110:59----------
where you could get closer to someone


---------111:02----------
okay and you don't


---------111:07----------
why not um


---------111:12----------
i feel like we don't share the same


---------111:15----------
like uh i don't feel like the


---------111:18----------
feeling is shared so it's like i


---------111:21----------
i pull back you know


---------111:24----------
yeah so


---------111:28----------
let's think about that for a second


---------111:36----------
why do you have to pull back if the


---------111:37----------
feeling isn't shared


---------111:40----------
wouldn't you like some other people i


---------111:42----------
don't know have you smothered people


---------111:44----------
before


---------111:46----------
i've definitely experienced people


---------111:47----------
smothering me so it's like i don't want


---------111:48----------
them to experience that


---------111:49----------
as well you know when like somebody's


---------111:51----------
like


---------111:54----------
too pushy about like being in your life


---------111:56----------
or like


---------111:57----------
you know what i mean yeah and it's like


---------112:00----------
i just want to be on my own


---------112:02----------
or to do my own thing so you want to i


---------112:04----------
don't i don't


---------112:05----------
i don't want to put that burden on other


---------112:06----------
people yeah i'm going to use like uh


---------112:09----------
i'm going to use exaggerated terms okay


---------112:11----------
because we're speed running


---------112:13----------
okay so you don't want to you're it


---------112:16----------
almost sounds like you're protecting


---------112:17----------
them from yourself


---------112:19----------
yeah because it's like it's like it's


---------112:22----------
like the


---------112:24----------
i'm trying to i guess i'm just gonna say


---------112:26----------
it's like i'm logically trying to like


---------112:29----------
ah it's like i don't want yeah i'm yeah


---------112:31----------
i'm protecting it for myself because i


---------112:33----------
i don't like that experience sometimes


---------112:35----------
right it's like i don't want them to


---------112:37----------
have that experience


---------112:38----------
you know and what exactly are you


---------112:40----------
protecting them from


---------112:42----------
i don't want to like push myself into


---------112:45----------
life too much you know


---------112:47----------
or like i don't want to be like the


---------112:49----------
little eager kid with like a oh this is


---------112:51----------
like a little like a butterfly and then


---------112:53----------
swish it you know what i mean


---------112:56----------
yeah yeah and so how do you


---------112:59----------
how do you view yourself in that


---------113:01----------
interaction like what


---------113:02----------
what are you what are you insulating


---------113:05----------
them from


---------113:08----------
i just want to give them their space


---------113:10----------
like it's like


---------113:12----------
uh i didn't ask them i didn't ask what


---------113:14----------
you want to do for them i'm asking what


---------113:15----------
are you


---------113:17----------
what am i i'm just somebody that


---------113:20----------
i feel like i'm an intense person like


---------113:22----------
when i


---------113:24----------
just because of a lot of my experiences


---------113:27----------
throughout my life and


---------113:28----------
and i know i shouldn't be like just


---------113:30----------
because i know we talked about that but


---------113:32----------
good yeah it's but it's like that's


---------113:35----------
or it can be an intense person and it's


---------113:37----------
like i want


---------113:38----------
to i'm like trying to pull back from


---------113:40----------
that intensity you know


---------113:42----------
i understand i can be an intense person


---------113:44----------
okay


---------113:45----------
what do you mean by intense person


---------113:49----------
well it's because like before i didn't


---------113:52----------
feel any of these things


---------113:54----------
and it's like once i open the floodgate


---------113:56----------
it's like


---------113:57----------
i feel these things like i mean i'm


---------113:58----------
freaking crying on streams and stuff


---------114:00----------
right you know


---------114:00----------
like once i do feel something or like


---------114:02----------
something does happen


---------114:04----------
i feel like it's like magnified tenfold


---------114:07----------
so it's like it's very difficult for me


---------114:09----------
to


---------114:10----------
uh i don't want to say control it but


---------114:13----------
it's like


---------114:14----------
it can it can be overwhelming yeah


---------114:16----------
absolutely


---------114:17----------
and what's wrong with you being


---------114:20----------
overwhelmed when you're with someone


---------114:22----------
else i don't want them to be overwhelmed


---------114:24----------
by


---------114:25----------
this experience that like i can't even


---------114:27----------
control myself because like i'm not in


---------114:29----------
control of myself in that situation


---------114:31----------
yep so it's like i don't want to like


---------114:34----------
boil that over onto them you know


---------114:37----------
expose them to your nastiness yeah


---------114:41----------
they don't they don't deserve to deal


---------114:43----------
with this


---------114:44----------
overwhelming bundle of emotions that is


---------114:47----------
you


---------114:48----------
this busted kid who never learned how to


---------114:50----------
make friends and you don't want to show


---------114:52----------
that to them and


---------114:53----------
why should they have to deal with


---------114:54----------
someone who you know is such a


---------114:57----------
deficient human being yes


---------115:02----------
pretty much there you go you got it yep


---------115:04----------
so i'm gonna say something weird brandon


---------115:07----------
you're an arrogant prick yeah i've been


---------115:10----------
told that


---------115:11----------
yeah so here's the thing it's not your


---------115:15----------
place to control


---------115:19----------
their reactions you're taking the


---------115:21----------
decision away from them


---------115:23----------
that makes you arrogant and controlling


---------115:25----------
okay


---------115:27----------
right so like what you need to do is


---------115:28----------
like because like it's interesting right


---------115:30----------
because you're really controlling this


---------115:31----------
interaction


---------115:32----------
you're not giving them the choice to


---------115:34----------
accept you or reject you


---------115:36----------
you're making that choice for them and


---------115:39----------
as long as you make that choice for


---------115:40----------
them they're going to be at arm's length


---------115:43----------
yes


---------115:45----------
so like the reason like they're at arm's


---------115:48----------
length because you're


---------115:49----------
keeping them there if they get so this


---------115:52----------
is where i'd like venture like there are


---------115:54----------
times where it's not just about you


---------115:55----------
getting close to them


---------115:57----------
sometimes they come close to you and i


---------115:59----------
think you push them away


---------116:02----------
yes that does happen so i know it's


---------116:05----------
going to be terrifying


---------116:08----------
but i would let someone


---------116:12----------
let him have it let them have it


---------116:17----------
right give them the chance to be a


---------116:20----------
friend


---------116:21----------
because right now you're controlling it


---------116:24----------
you're not giving them the chance mm-hmm


---------116:29----------
it's like you can't have a friendship


---------116:31----------
that is like where one person has all


---------116:33----------
the power okay


---------116:43----------
what do you think about that


---------116:47----------
i can agree with it um


---------116:51----------
i don't want to give you a just because


---------116:52----------
but like also something that


---------116:54----------
goes into my mind with that is like


---------116:58----------
the scene we're in is like i don't want


---------117:01----------
to say very superficial but it's like


---------117:05----------
i feel like there are there are a lot of


---------117:07----------
superficial like relationships with


---------117:09----------
people


---------117:09----------
and like yep because


---------117:12----------
and there's a lot of friendships that


---------117:14----------
get created in this scene as well


---------117:16----------
like i it's just


---------117:19----------
i don't know it's very hard to tell like


---------117:21----------
genuine interactions you know


---------117:24----------
yeah so that that you know that's


---------117:26----------
something that


---------117:27----------
i think you should you should be very


---------117:29----------
careful about because


---------117:30----------
when it comes to like the streaming


---------117:31----------
world


---------117:33----------
friendship becomes a business yes


---------117:36----------
and i don't want it to become bad so


---------117:39----------
that that i can i can


---------117:41----------
you know i i can not only meet you


---------117:44----------
halfway i can meet you all the way


---------117:45----------
i'll come all the way over to your


---------117:47----------
concern there


---------117:49----------
but i i really do think brandon that


---------117:50----------
like if you want to feel connected to


---------117:53----------
someone


---------117:57----------
you know like like you see like it feels


---------118:01----------
to me like there's ugliness inside you


---------118:03----------
that


---------118:03----------
you don't want to burden other people


---------118:05----------
with


---------118:07----------
but as long as like you're not willing


---------118:09----------
to let them see who you are


---------118:10----------
like you're nev you're always going to


---------118:13----------
feel


---------118:15----------
that degree of distance and the whole


---------118:18----------
point i mean here you are crying in


---------118:19----------
front of thousands of people like


---------118:21----------
what what would you think i mean i know


---------118:23----------
this stream is a little bit of a


---------118:24----------
different place but like


---------118:26----------
when your mind considers situations like


---------118:28----------
this like what is it afraid of


---------118:32----------
i mean i'm not afraid to show my emotion


---------118:34----------
that


---------118:35----------
i'm never i'm never afraid of that like


---------118:36----------
i don't care okay okay like i don't


---------118:38----------
feel any insecurity with it it's more so


---------118:41----------
like


---------118:43----------
i just uh i guess


---------118:46----------
maybe i am afraid of like the


---------118:49----------
disingenuous


---------118:50----------
uh i see a lot of like disingenuous


---------118:54----------
oh i got a good way explaining it all my


---------118:57----------
previous friendships from before were


---------119:00----------
friendships that i was like it's like


---------119:02----------
so let's say i'm on a team with somebody


---------119:04----------
right it's like we're living together


---------119:05----------
i'm on a team


---------119:06----------
we're friends why are we friends because


---------119:08----------
we're just here living together it's


---------119:09----------
because of circumstance you know


---------119:11----------
or like i'm in the military it's like


---------119:12----------
we're here we're stuck with each other


---------119:14----------
now we're friends


---------119:16----------
i'm friends because i'm stuck there with


---------119:17----------
that person right and it's like


---------119:21----------
i almost have like that same mindset


---------119:23----------
it's like now i'm not stuck with people


---------119:26----------
right so it's like i've it's hard for me


---------119:29----------
to tell like what a genuine


---------119:31----------
non like i'm stuck here with you


---------119:33----------
friendship is or


---------119:35----------
sure yeah maybe that's maybe that's it i


---------119:36----------
don't know that's explained so well but


---------119:38----------
yeah it's like very difficult for me to


---------119:40----------
like i'm afraid of that like that


---------119:42----------
i'm stuck with you friendship i don't


---------119:44----------
want to have that you know


---------119:45----------
and it's like now i'm not stuck with


---------119:47----------
anybody i'm like trying to like


---------119:49----------
cultivate like real friendships and


---------119:52----------
relationships


---------119:53----------
and it's like it's just a very different


---------119:56----------
experience so


---------119:57----------
and it's i'm not trying to navigate that


---------119:59----------
yeah so i think there's a lot of


---------120:01----------
practical stuff there


---------120:02----------
and there's potentially a date like a


---------120:04----------
dangerous isn't the right word there's


---------120:05----------
like an interesting undercurrent there


---------120:08----------
so when i envision someone who views


---------120:10----------
themselves as deficient


---------120:11----------
and they have friends due to


---------120:13----------
circumstances


---------120:15----------
i could imagine like that blending


---------120:18----------
together


---------120:19----------
to where like the only reason these


---------120:21----------
people are my friends


---------120:22----------
is because we're all stuck on a boat


---------120:24----------
together the


---------120:26----------
only reason that these people are my


---------120:28----------
friends is because they're my teammates


---------120:30----------
because do you see how like the


---------120:31----------
circumstance plus your deficiency


---------120:33----------
could create like a hybrid kind of thing


---------120:38----------
yes i mean i understand what's going on


---------120:40----------
and it's like


---------120:42----------
yeah it's and because because i i i


---------120:44----------
think actually like i would even go as


---------120:46----------
far as to say that your conception that


---------120:48----------
the only re


---------120:49----------
you didn't use the word only but i think


---------120:51----------
that when your mind says the


---------120:53----------
you know the reason we're friends is


---------120:54----------
because we're stuck together that


---------120:56----------
implies to me that you don't acknowledge


---------120:59----------
that there's like a genuine value and


---------121:01----------
there's just circumstance it's karma


---------121:04----------
right but like when you think about


---------121:05----------
friends like that's how friends get made


---------121:07----------
like so friends are made through


---------121:10----------
repeated unplanned interactions and


---------121:12----------
common cause


---------121:14----------
yes but what i'm really hearing is like


---------121:17----------
i think that you know the next time you


---------121:20----------
have a good day or a bad


---------121:22----------
day or there's something that you think


---------121:25----------
that someone else


---------121:26----------
doesn't want to hear i think you should


---------121:29----------
try sharing it with them


---------121:32----------
all right what do you think about that


---------121:36----------
i try to do that but it's just like i


---------121:38----------
still hold back you know


---------121:40----------
yep so what do you hold back i just


---------121:43----------
don't talk about


---------121:44----------
i just stay off on my own like so a lot


---------121:46----------
of time i'll try to talk to people but


---------121:48----------
it's like yep so so what i'm talking


---------121:50----------
about is not what you already do it's


---------121:52----------
what you hold back yeah


---------121:54----------
i just don't do it as much as i should


---------121:56----------
like i don't say i'm lazy but it's like


---------121:58----------
i don't put the effort in that i should


---------122:01----------
and then no i i don't don't be


---------122:04----------
self-judgmental i'm gonna discount


---------122:05----------
anything because that's like anything


---------122:07----------
that's self-blaming


---------122:08----------
or implies a deficiency i'm gonna


---------122:10----------
sidestep as best as i can


---------122:12----------
well doesn't it take two to tango like i


---------122:15----------
have people reach out to me


---------122:17----------
okay you know it's like i don't feel


---------122:20----------
like i reciprocate in the same way that


---------122:23----------
they're coming to me you know what


---------122:26----------
what keeps you from reciprocating just


---------122:29----------
i'm too used to being on my own kind of


---------122:31----------
thing you know like


---------122:33----------
that's my normal that's my normality


---------122:35----------
it's like i'm off on my


---------122:36----------
world i'm sure that habit has something


---------122:38----------
to do with it but


---------122:39----------
i would say like you know so for example


---------122:41----------
today


---------122:42----------
can you think of a single person that


---------122:44----------
you can reach out to


---------122:46----------
after we're done talking of course


---------122:49----------
and will you do that


---------122:53----------
yes okay and


---------122:56----------
what is going to be the purpose of you


---------122:58----------
reaching out to them


---------123:00----------
to talk to them okay i don't i don't


---------123:02----------
like having


---------123:03----------
ultimate terrier motives or anything


---------123:04----------
yeah you know and and so like what is


---------123:06----------
something can you think of a person that


---------123:09----------
there's something that a part of you


---------123:11----------
wanted


---------123:12----------
there's a part of you that wanted to


---------123:14----------
share but you held back with a


---------123:16----------
particular person can you think of a


---------123:17----------
scenario like that


---------123:21----------
um like ideally within the last like


---------123:23----------
week or two


---------123:24----------
because it can be weird if it's like a


---------123:25----------
six month old interaction but


---------123:29----------
i mean just like i'm just like talking


---------123:32----------
about something like


---------123:33----------
maybe something silly like just


---------123:34----------
something that happened like that kind


---------123:35----------
of you know like i'm not gonna give like


---------123:37----------
a specific example but


---------123:38----------
it's just those are the kind of moments


---------123:40----------
you know like i just never reach out to


---------123:42----------
people


---------123:42----------
yeah so i i so here's what i would


---------123:46----------
recommend to you


---------123:47----------
brandon is do that today


---------123:50----------
reach out to someone and do whatever


---------123:52----------
whatever you normally do


---------123:54----------
do more and this is the the main thing


---------123:57----------
so this is not going to be about


---------123:58----------
forming friendships this is actually


---------124:00----------
going to be a part of your


---------124:02----------
meditation practice okay


---------124:06----------
okay so what i want you to do is as you


---------124:09----------
reach out to someone so i want you to


---------124:10----------
think about something that


---------124:12----------
you have kept hidden from someone else


---------124:14----------
like it doesn't have to be like


---------124:15----------
deep dark secret you know but like you


---------124:17----------
know that voice in your mind that tells


---------124:19----------
you like oh they don't want to hear


---------124:20----------
about that


---------124:22----------
like i just made a bunch of money on amc


---------124:25----------
or i lost a bunch of money on


---------124:27----------
dogecoin like you take your pick right


---------124:31----------
and or even it's it and like i would


---------124:34----------
take


---------124:35----------
something that you're uncomfortable with


---------124:36----------
sharing something and this is where the


---------124:38----------
meditation practice comes in


---------124:39----------
as you think about the interaction your


---------124:43----------
mind


---------124:43----------
is going to tell you reasons not to do


---------124:46----------
it


---------124:47----------
your mind is going to tell you oh they


---------124:48----------
don't want to hear about that


---------124:50----------
oh that's gonna be too much like that's


---------124:52----------
gonna sound pathetic i'm gonna like


---------124:54----------
like you know like i'm gonna it's so


---------124:56----------
pathetic i'm so pathetic if i say that


---------124:58----------
to them


---------125:00----------
and notice it aware it oh become aware


---------125:03----------
of it


---------125:04----------
in the moment and sit with that feeling


---------125:07----------
don't try to explain oh this i'm just


---------125:08----------
doing this because it's my habit


---------125:11----------
like like and then like you're gonna


---------125:12----------
notice the because pop up


---------125:14----------
just sit with that feeling which makes


---------125:16----------
you feel for lack of a better term ugly


---------125:19----------
it's a feeling of ugliness


---------125:22----------
right like it's like deformity


---------125:24----------
deficiency like it's something


---------125:27----------
and then i know it's gonna sound weird


---------125:28----------
but i want you to watch


---------125:30----------
so then i want you to share whatever it


---------125:33----------
is that you don't want to share


---------125:35----------
and if you can't share it that's


---------125:37----------
actually okay


---------125:39----------
just notice what it is that keeps you


---------125:41----------
from sharing


---------125:42----------
notice that feeling of deformity and


---------125:44----------
ugliness and deficiency


---------125:46----------
is so powerful that you can't actually


---------125:48----------
like


---------125:50----------
get the words out or


---------125:54----------
share it and as you share it notice what


---------125:58----------
happens to that feeling


---------126:00----------
watch it don't even worry about what


---------126:02----------
they say just watch yourself


---------126:07----------
okay what do you think about that


---------126:10----------
i can do this quest accepted


---------126:15----------
okay awesome


---------126:19----------
yeah i i think brandon this has a lot to


---------126:21----------
do with you man i mean i know i said


---------126:23----------
this self you know i know some of what


---------126:25----------
i'm saying is gonna sound


---------126:26----------
not hypocritical but contradictory it's


---------126:29----------
tangled up


---------126:32----------
but i think you're sure it's all about


---------126:34----------
you but not about you


---------126:36----------
yeah so your shortcoming is that you


---------126:38----------
accept more shortcomings than you're


---------126:39----------
responsible for


---------126:43----------
i can agree with that but yeah okay


---------126:46----------
never mind


---------126:46----------
yeah yeah yeah so it's fine to have the


---------126:49----------
butt right like i'm not


---------126:50----------
disputing the butt has value i think in


---------126:53----------
your case you just


---------126:54----------
lean too much on what's on the other


---------126:57----------
side of the butt


---------126:59----------
let's get taken out of context i do lean


---------127:02----------
to the butt a lot


---------127:03----------
yeah right the butt the because


---------127:07----------
the the like and and that's where like


---------127:10----------
because


---------127:10----------
when you get into the logic like you


---------127:12----------
move away from that feeling and what you


---------127:13----------
need to do is sit with that feeling


---------127:16----------
because that's the feeling that like you


---------127:18----------
know like when you were failing out and


---------127:20----------
like


---------127:21----------
yeah you know what did your parents do


---------127:22----------
when they found out that you had to


---------127:23----------
repeat a year they didn't care


---------127:27----------
right because i had i just like told


---------127:29----------
them like i'm gonna do this


---------127:30----------
and then they're like okay so like like


---------127:33----------
it's hard but like


---------127:35----------
it's hard to give people the opportunity


---------127:38----------
to care about you


---------127:41----------
when you've learned over and over again


---------127:43----------
that people don't give a [ __ ]


---------127:46----------
so you don't want to overwhelm them but


---------127:48----------
like in overwhelming them like you're


---------127:50----------
giving them the opportunity to like


---------127:52----------
give a [ __ ] but you don't want that


---------127:57----------
because people have had a lot of


---------127:59----------
opportunity like


---------128:00----------
did anyone ever ask like what's wrong


---------128:02----------
with this kid does this kid need help


---------128:04----------
like why isn't he coming to class


---------128:08----------
not really right so like no one has


---------128:10----------
cared about you before


---------128:11----------
why would they care about you now


---------128:15----------
and it's hard it's hard because as long


---------128:18----------
as you don't ask like that


---------128:19----------
truth like you don't open up to people


---------128:22----------
because like


---------128:23----------
right now you've convinced yourself that


---------128:25----------
that's a question mark maybe people do


---------128:27----------
care about me i'm dating someone clearly


---------128:29----------
right so like someone cares me you have


---------128:30----------
a cat there's there's like my cat cares


---------128:33----------
about me


---------128:34----------
there's there's a certain amount of like


---------128:36----------
ambiguity about like


---------128:38----------
am i worth caring about or not but if


---------128:41----------
you go back to opening up to people like


---------128:43----------
and you learn that lesson again then all


---------128:45----------
hope is lost


---------128:49----------
okay sorry i'm just like i feel like


---------128:51----------
emotionally exhausted right now


---------128:53----------
yeah yep i think we're done for day


---------128:55----------
today yeah yeah


---------128:57----------
okay i mean i appreciate this and it was


---------129:00----------
definitely a good experience


---------129:01----------
and hope like it helped anybody out


---------129:05----------
there that


---------129:05----------
also may be going through stuff like


---------129:07----------
this so


---------129:09----------
yeah thanks thanks for the time gg


---------129:12----------
yeah see you later


---------129:18----------
yeah good awareness there i'm


---------129:20----------
emotionally exhausted too how about


---------129:22----------
y'all chat


---------129:23----------
sometimes people dodge for like the


---------129:25----------
first two hours


---------129:27----------
no but he wasn't dodging i i think we


---------129:29----------
both genuinely that was a little bit of


---------129:31----------
a joke
