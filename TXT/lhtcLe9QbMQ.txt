---------00:12----------
my name is Alec connage and I'm a


---------00:14----------
psychiatrist who practices in Boston


---------00:16----------
Massachusetts in my day job I'm an


---------00:20----------
addiction psychiatrist at a place called


---------00:22----------
McLean Hospital and I'm also faculty at


---------00:26----------
Harvard Medical School where I'm an


---------00:27----------
instructor in psychiatry I'd like to


---------00:30----------
share with you guys a little bit about


---------00:31----------
how I got into the helping people with


---------00:34----------
video game addiction and it actually


---------00:35----------
starts with me and when I was pretty


---------00:37----------
young I grew up playing video games


---------00:39----------
played a lot of video games when I was


---------00:40----------
in Middle School in high school and


---------00:42----------
almost failed out of college for playing


---------00:45----------
too many video games my first year of


---------00:47----------
college I had less than a 2.0 GPA second


---------00:50----------
year wasn't a whole lot better and I I


---------00:52----------
did things like slept through my fan


---------00:53----------
Spanish final because I was played


---------00:56----------
playing too many video games the night


---------00:57----------
before and finally ended up graduating


---------00:59----------
with about a 2.5 or 2.6 GPA and really


---------01:04----------
started to try to figure out like what


---------01:05----------
was going on in my life and like what


---------01:07----------
what was the deal with playing all these


---------01:09----------
games and took me a couple of years but


---------01:11----------
I ended up going to medical school and


---------01:14----------
ended up training to become a


---------01:15----------
psychiatrist here in Boston at a place


---------01:18----------
called Massachusetts General Hospital


---------01:19----------
and McLean Hospital both of which are


---------01:22----------
Harvard Medical School teaching


---------01:23----------
affiliates and so really had some an


---------01:25----------
amazing had an amazing opportunity to


---------01:28----------
become a psychiatrist had some brilliant


---------01:29----------
teachers and I'm grateful that I was


---------01:32----------
able to train there because they really


---------01:33----------
taught me a lot about psychiatry and


---------01:36----------
human beings and how to help people and


---------01:37----------
while I was training I I kind of went to


---------01:40----------
these people who were kind of the


---------01:41----------
brightest minds in psychiatry and like


---------01:43----------
experts in the field and I asked them


---------01:46----------
you know can you tell me a little bit


---------01:47----------
about video game addiction or can you


---------01:49----------
tell me how to help people who have


---------01:50----------
problems with video games and none of


---------01:52----------
them really seem to know and the more


---------01:55----------
people that I ask the more I realized


---------01:57----------
like oh the leaders in the field of


---------02:00----------
Psychiatry are all in their 50s 60s and


---------02:02----------
70s and so they've actually never played


---------02:05----------
a video game you know the people that


---------02:08----------
teach us psychiatry the people who are


---------02:09----------
experts in depression and anxiety and


---------02:11----------
addictions are all sort of at the end of


---------02:15----------
their career or middle of their career


---------02:16----------
and they've actually never really played


---------02:19----------
a video game so they don't really know


---------02:20----------
what it's like and so then I I was


---------02:24----------
trying to figure out you know how can I


---------02:26----------
learn about this because my teachers you


---------02:28----------
know they don't really know too much


---------02:29----------
about it and so I started just talking


---------02:31----------
to gamers I started working with gamers


---------02:33----------
I started talking to gamers from all


---------02:35----------
over the world through the internet and


---------02:37----------
people from the Middle East and South


---------02:39----------
Korea and North America and I just


---------02:42----------
started working with them and trying to


---------02:44----------
figure out you know trying to understand


---------02:46----------
why do you play video games and the more


---------02:48----------
that I understood about you know talking


---------02:50----------
to them the more I learned about video


---------02:52----------
game addiction and the more that I got


---------02:55----------
you know the more I learned about being


---------02:57----------
a psychiatrist and how to help people I


---------02:59----------
realized like maybe I actually can help


---------03:01----------
these people because a lot of them had


---------03:03----------
seen psychiatrists or therapists but


---------03:05----------
what happens is they get diagnosed with


---------03:07----------
something like depression or anxiety and


---------03:10----------
they get started on an antidepressant


---------03:11----------
and they go home and they take their


---------03:12----------
pill and they keep playing video games


---------03:14----------
because their problem while they are


---------03:16----------
depressed the problem really isn't that


---------03:18----------
they are depressed their problem is that


---------03:21----------
they play too many video games and so I


---------03:23----------
started to work with these people and


---------03:25----------
tried to help them and as the years went


---------03:27----------
by and I worked with more and more


---------03:28----------
gamers I started to get better at it and


---------03:31----------
so now I feel like I know a little bit


---------03:33----------
about what I'm talking about but I have


---------03:35----------
to admit that you know the disease is


---------03:37----------
relatively new we don't really know a


---------03:39----------
whole lot about it there hasn't been


---------03:41----------
years or decades of research the way


---------03:44----------
that there has been on cancer treatment


---------03:45----------
or treatment for depression but at this


---------03:49----------
point I do feel confident that I can


---------03:51----------
help you some or at least that's my hope


---------03:52----------
my hope is that I can take those years


---------03:56----------
of experience helping gamers and helping


---------03:59----------
parents of gamers and helping spouses of


---------04:01----------
gamers and my years of training is a


---------04:04----------
psychiatrist and to be able to put those


---------04:05----------
two together and to help you in some way


---------04:09----------
and I really hope that I can
