---------00:00----------
so now I'm seeing a couple of questions


---------00:02----------
about mental health so let's let's talk


---------00:04----------
about this the first question I'll get


---------00:07----------
into borderline personality disorder in


---------00:09----------
abusive behavior in a second but first


---------00:11----------
question is what's the difference


---------00:12----------
between bipolar and borderline


---------00:14----------
personality disorder great question and


---------00:16----------
people get really confused because


---------00:17----------
sometimes both of them are abbreviated


---------00:19----------
with BPD so bipolar disorder is a mood


---------00:23----------
disorder so it's something that happens


---------00:25----------
to you so I think about mood disorders


---------00:28----------
as being somewhat like independent of


---------00:30----------
who you are so if we think about


---------00:32----------
something like the flu like the flu


---------00:33----------
happens to you you're not you know


---------00:35----------
you're not the flu you're a person who


---------00:37----------
gets the flu and when I think about


---------00:39----------
depression and bipolar disorder I think


---------00:42----------
about people who get depressed or become


---------00:45----------
bipolar but it doesn't change kind of


---------00:47----------
who they are as a person and


---------00:51----------
[Music]


---------00:52----------
so bipolar disorder is characterized by


---------00:55----------
mood swings that last for weeks to


---------00:58----------
months at a time so this isn't like I


---------01:01----------
have a really volatile mood swing in


---------01:03----------
terms of I'm super happy at like 12 noon


---------01:07----------
and then at 2 p.m. I'm super pissed off


---------01:09----------
and at 4 p.m. I'm crying that's not


---------01:11----------
bipolar disorder bipolar disorder is


---------01:13----------
characterized by persistent moods


---------01:16----------
that are either elevated or depressed


---------01:18----------
for like weeks at a time so people in


---------01:23----------
bipolar disorder sometimes experience


---------01:25----------
depression so they'll feel like


---------01:26----------
depressed for weeks to months at a time


---------01:28----------
pretty much like most days for most of


---------01:32----------
the day they'll feel like sad or they'll


---------01:33----------
feel like they have something called low


---------01:37----------
self attitude which means that they


---------01:38----------
think that they're like bad people they


---------01:40----------
think their burdens to other people they


---------01:42----------
kind of have these thoughts like other


---------01:44----------
people would be better off without me


---------01:45----------
they kind of have like these these kind


---------01:47----------
of persistent negative thoughts they can


---------01:50----------
also have low energy levels so that it's


---------01:52----------
like hard for them to get up and get out


---------01:54----------
of bed some people describe it to me is


---------01:56----------
like walking through molasses like


---------01:58----------
normal normally when we walk we're just


---------02:00----------
like walking through air and there's


---------02:01----------
like no resistance to walk but when I've


---------02:04----------
worked with depressed people they'll say


---------02:05----------
like even walking becomes really really


---------02:07----------
hard and so that's kind of the


---------02:11----------
depressive side and then the manic or


---------02:13----------
hypomanic side is kind of the opposite


---------02:15----------
of depression so people who are


---------02:17----------
hypomanic will need less sleep they have


---------02:20----------
tons of energy they have really great


---------02:22----------
ideas they kind of like think that


---------02:25----------
they're they they're able to perform


---------02:27----------
actually at a very high level


---------02:28----------
interesting side note is that at Harvard


---------02:31----------
College which is the undergrad the


---------02:33----------
incidence of of people who are hypomanic


---------02:36----------
and bipolar is like three times the


---------02:38----------
average population so sometimes bipolar


---------02:41----------
disorder people are actually like way


---------02:42----------
more productive than the average human


---------02:45----------
being which is kind of bizarre but


---------02:47----------
so they can have periods of time of like


---------02:48----------
kind of hyperactivity as well as


---------02:51----------
depression and then then you get up into


---------02:53----------
true mania which is like when you're so


---------02:55----------
high that like you don't think straight


---------02:58----------
so people who are manic


---------03:01----------
we'll sort of like think that they can


---------03:03----------
do things that other people can't do


---------03:04----------
they'll feel superhuman they'll have all


---------03:07----------
these amazing ideas they'll wake up one


---------03:08----------
day and say I know how to solve like


---------03:10----------
global climate change like I have the


---------03:12----------
idea and I know how to do it I can fix I


---------03:15----------
can transcend time they'll say like all


---------03:16----------
kinds of like really bizarre things a


---------03:18----------
big a characteristic of hypomania and


---------03:21----------
mania is also reduced amounts of sleep


---------03:23----------
so people who are hypomanic can usually


---------03:25----------
run in a pretty high like a libera in


---------03:28----------
terms of efficacy with like four hours


---------03:31----------
of sleep a night whereas people who are


---------03:33----------
truly manic will be able to go days with


---------03:36----------
sleeping very little to no sleep like


---------03:38----------
one to two hours this isn't like I've


---------03:40----------
only got two hours of sleep and


---------03:42----------
overnight because I was tossing and


---------03:43----------
turning a lot of people have something


---------03:45----------
called sleep misperception syndrome


---------03:47----------
where you didn't actually sleep two


---------03:48----------
hours you probably slept like six to


---------03:50----------
eight and it was interrupted and it felt


---------03:52----------
like two but people are truly manic will


---------03:55----------
go like will only sleep like two hours a


---------03:57----------
night or even less so that's bipolar


---------04:00----------
disorder so with people with bipolar


---------04:03----------
disorder unless they're depressed or


---------04:05----------
manic they are like completely normal so


---------04:08----------
like I could have bipolar disorder and


---------04:10----------
I'm completely fine today and tomorrow


---------04:12----------
I'll be depressed I'll be depressed for


---------04:14----------
a couple months


---------04:14----------
I'll come out of it and I'll be


---------04:16----------
completely


---------04:21----------
some people are asking yeah is it so


---------04:25----------
people are asking about timeframes so


---------04:26----------
yes so bipolar disorder so in order to


---------04:29----------
be diagnosed with like depression and


---------04:31----------
bipolar disorder you need like two week


---------04:33----------
you need like a two week block where


---------04:35----------
you're pretty much depressed most days


---------04:38----------
in for mania it's like lasts it's like


---------04:41----------
one week and can you self-identify as


---------04:45----------
having bipolar disorder I mean you can


---------04:46----------
so I do think that I think a lot of


---------04:49----------
times physicians like underestimate how


---------04:51----------
meant how much like non medically


---------04:53----------
trained people can like know about


---------04:55----------
medicine and psychiatry so for example I


---------04:58----------
mean I've learned so much about cancer


---------05:00----------
chemotherapy from family members of


---------05:02----------
patients do you think that an oncologist


---------05:04----------
knows everything about chemotherapy but


---------05:06----------
it's amazing how much a dedicated person


---------05:08----------
with like no official training can learn


---------05:12----------
about a scientific skill so you could


---------05:15----------
self-identify or self diagnosed yourself


---------05:18----------
with bipolar but I really wouldn't


---------05:19----------
recommend it because there are a lot of


---------05:21----------
nuances that kind of go into the


---------05:23----------
diagnosis and there also a lot of things


---------05:25----------
that can interfere with it for example


---------05:26----------
if you're using marijuana or any other


---------05:28----------
substances you may not have bipolar


---------05:29----------
disorder because all that [ __ ] is going


---------05:31----------
to be messing with your brain


---------05:34----------
now to kind of go to BPD which is


---------05:37----------
borderline personality disorder so in


---------05:40----------
psychiatry we talk about two different


---------05:42----------
classes of illnesses we talk about sort


---------05:46----------
of like things that happen to you like I


---------05:48----------
was saying earlier are things that you


---------05:50----------
are so if we think about someone who's


---------05:52----------
like a narcissist you don't wake up one


---------05:54----------
day and for two weeks like exist exhibit


---------05:57----------
a narcissistic behavior and then the


---------05:59----------
narcissism goes away like an arson


---------06:01----------
narcissism is sort of like part of your


---------06:03----------
personality structure doesn't mean it


---------06:05----------
can't change doesn't mean it can't get


---------06:06----------
better but it's sort of like part of the


---------06:08----------
way that your psychological makeup is in


---------06:10----------
borderline personality disorder is like


---------06:13----------
that so it's part of someone's like


---------06:15----------
psychological makeup and so every day


---------06:18----------
when they wake up they have some


---------06:19----------
experiences that are different from


---------06:21----------
other people and in my opinion sort of


---------06:24----------
the foundation of borderline personality


---------06:25----------
disorder is not understanding like who


---------06:29----------
you are on the inside


---------06:32----------
so if I'm walking down the street I gave


---------06:34----------
this example recently on stream and


---------06:36----------
someone like you know calls me an idiot


---------06:38----------
then I have a sense of self and I know


---------06:42----------
I'm not an idiot so I'm just gonna


---------06:43----------
ignore what they say right so like when


---------06:46----------
when other people give me feedback about


---------06:48----------
Who I am as a person that's going to


---------06:50----------
conflict with like my sense of self and


---------06:54----------
so if a lot of people call me an idiot


---------06:57----------
then my sense of self will start to


---------06:59----------
change right if everyone calls me an


---------07:01----------
[ __ ] I'm gonna start to feel like bad


---------07:02----------
and then over time I can come to learn


---------07:05----------
and believe that I'm an [ __ ] for


---------07:08----------
people with BPD the the thing that's on


---------07:12----------
the inside is like really really really


---------07:14----------
weak or even they don't really think


---------07:16----------
it's there at all so they don't have


---------07:18----------
like a persistent sell sense of who they


---------07:20----------
are as a person and so what that means


---------07:22----------
is that the way they feel is determined


---------07:25----------
by how other people reflect them so if


---------07:29----------
people treat me well I feel like a good


---------07:32----------
person and if people treat me poorly I


---------07:34----------
feel like a piece of [ __ ] and this is


---------07:36----------
true of all people like everyone's gonna


---------07:38----------
feel a little bit bad but with BPD the


---------07:40----------
swings are huge so if for example I send


---------07:43----------
a text to the person that I'm dating and


---------07:47----------
they don't respond I start to think that


---------07:49----------
like oh my god this person like doesn't


---------07:51----------
care about me at all they're gonna break


---------07:53----------
up with me they don't care about me even


---------07:55----------
though it's just like they just didn't


---------07:56----------
respond to a text right away not that


---------07:57----------
big of a deal but for the person with


---------07:59----------
BPD they over interpret that because if


---------08:02----------
you think about like if I send a text


---------08:04----------
and then no one responds and like why


---------08:07----------
don't I get freaked out about it it's


---------08:08----------
because I have a sense of basic


---------08:10----------
confidence that Who I am as a person


---------08:12----------
matters and that this other person cares


---------08:14----------
about me like I'm sort of settled in


---------08:16----------
that belief people in BPD don't have


---------08:19----------
that foundation so when they send a text


---------08:21----------
in no one responds to them they start


---------08:23----------
freaking the [ __ ] out and they feel like


---------08:24----------
oh my god like this person doesn't like


---------08:26----------
me they're kind of not really like doing


---------08:29----------
they don't care about me or anything


---------08:31----------
like that and so when people with BPD


---------08:34----------
what starts to happen is they get like


---------08:35----------
really erratic in their behavior because


---------08:38----------
they'll do in order for them to feel


---------08:39----------
good people have to treat them with hair


---------08:42----------
and they'll sort of start to learn that


---------08:45----------
like okay these are the things that I


---------08:47----------
can do to get people to like exhibit


---------08:49----------
brand gestures of care so a lot of


---------08:52----------
people with BPD for example will have


---------08:54----------
like pair of suicidal gestures they'll


---------08:57----------
experience suicidality and they'll


---------08:58----------
threaten to kill themselves or they'll


---------09:00----------
cut and the reason for that is because


---------09:02----------
when I threatened to kill myself


---------09:04----------
everyone drops what they're doing and


---------09:06----------
sweeps in and says oh my god like are


---------09:09----------
you okay like tell me like how can I


---------09:11----------
help you


---------09:11----------
oh my god you're such an amazing person


---------09:13----------
and so over time what happens is like


---------09:15----------
they get they reinforce behaviors that


---------09:18----------
kind of encourage people to like


---------09:20----------
drastically come to their aid and then


---------09:22----------
they run into problems because people


---------09:23----------
get tired of that [ __ ] after a while


---------09:26----------
like when when you get called by a


---------09:28----------
friend of yours and they say oh my god


---------09:29----------
you have to come over right now or I'm


---------09:30----------
gonna kill myself you're gonna drop


---------09:32----------
everything that you do you go there and


---------09:33----------
you're like oh my god please don't do


---------09:34----------
that you care about them so much you you


---------09:37----------
work them through it the next morning


---------09:38----------
after you've been talking to them for 12


---------09:40----------
hours you leave and you feel good you


---------09:43----------
feel good about yourself you're like man


---------09:44----------
that was really exhausting and tough but


---------09:46----------
like I was really there for them you


---------09:47----------
feel like a good friend they feel better


---------09:49----------
everyone feels great two days later they


---------09:52----------
call you again and then you show up and


---------09:54----------
you talk them through the night and then


---------09:56----------
two days later they call you again and


---------09:58----------
at some point you get burnt out and


---------10:00----------
you're like I can't deal with the [ __ ]


---------10:01----------
in and then what happens is you you say


---------10:04----------
look I can't help you anymore I'm done


---------10:06----------
and then the person with BPD feels like


---------10:10----------
[ __ ] because instead of like saving them


---------10:11----------
you're abandoning that and then that


---------10:14----------
like makes the cycle like way worse and


---------10:16----------
then what they need to do is like


---------10:18----------
escalate even further so if they tell


---------10:19----------
you like if you say hey I can't come


---------10:21----------
over I'm busy right now


---------10:22----------
then they're gonna even escalate they're


---------10:24----------
gonna say like they're gonna send you a


---------10:25----------
picture with like them in a bottle of


---------10:28----------
pills and they'll do whatever they need


---------10:30----------
to to get you to comment like comfort


---------10:32----------
because if you exhibit comfort towards


---------10:34----------
them they feel like warm and fuzzy on


---------10:37----------
the inside and without you they feel


---------10:38----------
empty


---------10:39----------
that's BPD


---------10:45----------
I'm gonna just take a second to look at


---------10:48----------
so BPD it's not that it's not curable


---------10:50----------
it's just that it doesn't have standard


---------10:52----------
I mean it has standard treatment but


---------10:54----------
it's not like medication isn't gonna fix


---------10:55----------
it


---------10:56----------
BPD is something that that is like it


---------10:58----------
has to do with your personality


---------10:59----------
structure so your personality can change


---------11:02----------
over time right like you can be an


---------11:03----------
[ __ ] feeder in a game and like you


---------11:05----------
can learn how to like not do that and


---------11:07----------
resolve your own toxicity and even over


---------11:09----------
time your personality can change people


---------11:11----------
can become less narcissistic they can


---------11:13----------
become more confident in it selves they


---------11:15----------
can become like less borderline it can


---------11:17----------
definitely happen it just takes a lot of


---------11:19----------
time and it seems like the best there


---------11:21----------
are some evidence-based treatments but


---------11:23----------
it seems like just having someone kind


---------11:25----------
of like really be stable and comforting


---------11:28----------
for you but not respond to your ups and


---------11:31----------
downs in a differential way is the best


---------11:33----------
way to sort of help people come out of


---------11:35----------
beep


---------11:37----------
and someone just be really low in


---------11:39----------
self-esteem in this dude apparently


---------11:40----------
being afraid of their partner leaving


---------11:42----------
absolutely man that's exactly what I


---------11:44----------
mean


---------11:44----------
not everyone who has that has BPD but


---------11:46----------
that's the essence of BPD so low


---------11:48----------
self-esteem


---------11:50----------
that's just like think through this for


---------11:51----------
a second okay so this is the question


---------11:53----------
can someone just be really low in sulfa


---------11:55----------
steam and thus do the paranoid behavior


---------11:57----------
of being afraid of their partner leaving


---------11:59----------
absolutely so let's just think through


---------12:02----------
what what happens in that person's head


---------12:07----------
so if I don't feel like I'm a valuable


---------12:12----------
person like if I feel on the inside that


---------12:14----------
like I'm just not a good person then I


---------12:18----------
think that if someone recognizes me for


---------12:21----------
what I am that they're more likely to


---------12:24----------
leave right like people with low


---------12:26----------
self-esteem


---------12:27----------
basically sometimes feel like they've


---------12:29----------
tricked their partners into being with


---------12:31----------
them and that if their partner really


---------12:33----------
understood how much of a piece of [ __ ]


---------12:35----------
they were they would leave because


---------12:36----------
there's something better down the street


---------12:38----------
and so that that's like logical like you


---------12:42----------
guys it's really important to understand


---------12:43----------
this most of what people think of as


---------12:45----------
mental illness is that someone's not


---------12:47----------
thinking right but the crazy thing is


---------12:50----------
that in my experience most of mental


---------12:52----------
illness is thinking logically it's just


---------12:54----------
like a perversion of logic like when we


---------12:57----------
go back to Henry remember how he's


---------12:59----------
saying like oh if I quit Clash of Kings


---------13:00----------
again it's not gonna go well like that's


---------13:02----------
not logical I think he's right because


---------13:04----------
he's tried it right and he was like


---------13:05----------
wound up depressed and in the hospital


---------13:07----------
and being like involuntary hospitalized


---------13:09----------
with a bunch of shrinks so the person


---------13:12----------
who feels like they have low self-esteem


---------13:14----------
their logical conclusions that follow or


---------13:17----------
accurate and then what happens is like


---------13:20----------
they they really do think that if this


---------13:23----------
person figures out who I really am


---------13:25----------
they're gonna leave and then they start


---------13:28----------
exhibiting paranoid behavior right


---------13:29----------
because they try to control for that and


---------13:31----------
so they try to go like really out of


---------13:33----------
their way to like control what their


---------13:36----------
partner does and what their partner sees


---------13:38----------
and how their partner responds and they


---------13:40----------
kind of think like oh if I'm not a good


---------13:42----------
person if my partner goes out and meets


---------13:46----------
other people they're going to realize


---------13:48----------
that I am NOT a good person


---------13:50----------
and that they can do better than me and


---------13:53----------
so then they start to exhibit like


---------13:55----------
paranoid controlling behavior right


---------13:56----------
because they're like oh my god I don't


---------13:57----------
want you to spend time with like other


---------13:59----------
people because then you're gonna realize


---------14:01----------
that I'm not good enough and that's


---------14:03----------
where the paranoid and controlling


---------14:05----------
behavior kicks in so it's actually


---------14:06----------
incredibly logical and that's exactly


---------14:08----------
right a call 101 or 1001 that someone


---------14:12----------
who has low self-esteem is going to


---------14:14----------
exhibit paranoid and controlling


---------14:16----------
behavior out of a fear of abandonment in


---------14:19----------
the really crazy thing is that the more


---------14:22----------
paranoid behavior they exhibit the


---------14:24----------
further they drive their partner away


---------14:26----------
and if they succeed in driving their


---------14:28----------
partner away that just serves to


---------14:31----------
reinforce them that they were right all


---------14:32----------
along


---------14:33----------
like that's the crazy thing when their


---------14:35----------
partner breaks up with them they're like


---------14:37----------
oh all of my thoughts cuz somewhere


---------14:39----------
along the way someone told them actually


---------14:41----------
you're a wonderful person and you're not


---------14:43----------
a piece of [ __ ] but when they drive


---------14:44----------
their partner way through paranoid


---------14:45----------
behavior they realize like oh I was


---------14:48----------
right all along


---------14:49----------
I actually am a piece of [ __ ] because if


---------14:51----------
I wasn't a piece of [ __ ] they wouldn't


---------14:53----------
have left you enter the second


---------14:55----------
relationship and that feeling is even


---------14:57----------
stronger the paranoid behavior is even


---------15:00----------
stronger and then you drive them away


---------15:01----------
even harder and then the cycle repeats


---------15:03----------
itself and this is why people who have


---------15:06----------
like these kind of psychological


---------15:07----------
constructs like gamers included this is


---------15:10----------
why everyone feels [ __ ] stuck because


---------15:12----------
your mind works in a way where like it


---------15:14----------
tells you that what you believe is


---------15:17----------
correct even though it's not


---------15:21----------
let me just think


---------15:25----------
uh-huh okay so domination time asks how


---------15:29----------
do you break that cycle of the person


---------15:31----------
threatening suicide and increasing what


---------15:32----------
they do for attention


---------15:34----------
you separate the stimulus from the


---------15:37----------
response so we have to talk about


---------15:40----------
Pavlov's dogs for a second okay like


---------15:42----------
behavioral reinforcement so when like


---------15:46----------
remember there's this guy named like


---------15:48----------
Pavlov who basically like every time he


---------15:50----------
fed dogs he would ring a bell before he


---------15:52----------
feeds the dogs so he'd like ringing a


---------15:54----------
bell and then he'd give them dog food


---------15:55----------
and the dogs would like smell the dog


---------15:57----------
food they'd start to salivate and then


---------15:59----------
to eat the food over time what he


---------16:01----------
realized is that all he had to do is


---------16:03----------
ring the bell and he doesn't even give


---------16:04----------
them food and they start salivating so


---------16:07----------
we have this tendency to like connect


---------16:09----------
actions and responses so when we think


---------16:13----------
about someone who threatens suicide and


---------16:15----------
when their suicidal behavior gets


---------16:17----------
reinforced by someone dropping


---------16:19----------
everything in expressing care and love


---------16:21----------
for them what they're looking for is the


---------16:23----------
care in love and if I exhibit suicidal


---------16:25----------
behavior and that leads to care and love


---------16:27----------
that's going to reinforce the behavior


---------16:29----------
of suicidal like threatening by the way


---------16:33----------
you guys like if you guys are dealing


---------16:34----------
with something like this you should


---------16:35----------
actually seek a medical professional


---------16:36----------
like you shouldn't try to do this at all


---------16:38----------
just to be very clear about that and now


---------16:40----------
let's use like a simpler example so when


---------16:43----------
my kids throw a temper tantrum giving in


---------16:46----------
to the temper tantrum is gonna teach


---------16:48----------
them that Oh a temper tantrum is the way


---------16:50----------
to get what I want so instead what we do


---------16:53----------
is we retrain


---------16:55----------
how they get what they want so instead


---------16:57----------
of my kid is like throwing a temper


---------16:58----------
tantrum and is like throwing things I'll


---------17:01----------
stop and I'll just be patient I won't


---------17:02----------
respond to the temper tantrum I'll say


---------17:06----------
do you want this cupcake and the kid


---------17:10----------
will be like that and I'm like do you


---------17:12----------
want the cupcake and then uh then I'll


---------17:14----------
say like how do we ask for cupcakes and


---------17:16----------
then the kid will kind of calm down and


---------17:18----------
they'll say can I have the cupcake


---------17:19----------
please and then you go


---------17:20----------
here you go and then that reinforces


---------17:23----------
asking so the first time we did that it


---------17:25----------
took me like five minutes to get them to


---------17:27----------
ask for the cupcake the second time it


---------17:29----------
took four minutes the third time it took


---------17:31----------
three minutes now they throw a temper


---------17:32----------
tantrum thirty seconds later I'm like


---------17:34----------
how do we ask for things and they're


---------17:35----------
like can I have this please and that


---------17:38----------
that's how you reinforce the behavior so


---------17:40----------
in the case of someone a BPD like in my


---------17:42----------
patients with BPD


---------17:43----------
you know when they call me and they're


---------17:45----------
in a crisis if I spend if I drop what


---------17:47----------
I'm doing and spend like two hours with


---------17:49----------
them on the phone like calming them down


---------17:50----------
they're gonna call me again the next day


---------17:52----------
so the question that I ask practically


---------17:55----------
and this is like medical stuff so you


---------17:56----------
guys really should not be dealing with


---------17:57----------
but you know what I'll say is like hey


---------18:00----------
can this like I can see you tomorrow


---------18:02----------
morning at 10 a.m. do you think you can


---------18:04----------
make it through the night and let's like


---------18:06----------
meet tomorrow at 10:00 and then they


---------18:07----------
come in at 10:00 and then we talk


---------18:10----------
through things and they feel better when


---------18:11----------
they leave and so then what happens is


---------18:13----------
they they'll like so now what happens is


---------18:14----------
I get a text and it'll be like hey do


---------18:16----------
you have any time over the next I know


---------18:18----------
we were supposed to meet on Friday but


---------18:20----------
do you have any time on like Monday or


---------18:21----------
Tuesday to me and then I'll say yes I do


---------18:23----------
and then I'll make the time for them so


---------18:26----------
you provide the care and support that


---------18:27----------
they need because that's just like a


---------18:29----------
good human thing to do but you provide


---------18:31----------
it independent of their behavior so if


---------18:33----------
you have someone who's like really


---------18:35----------
struggling and they kind of like reach


---------18:36----------
out to you you just set aside time for


---------18:38----------
them like on a regular basis you say


---------18:41----------
like hey men like I know this is a tough


---------18:43----------
time for you and that sometimes you call


---------18:45----------
me when you're like blackout drunk and


---------18:47----------
you're like you're you're pissed off


---------18:49----------
that that this chick broke up with you


---------18:51----------
why don't we just have brunch every


---------18:53----------
Sunday and just like check in and see


---------18:55----------
how you're doing because BPD is like


---------18:57----------
it's sort of it's a disorder but every


---------19:00----------
human being has that kind of like


---------19:03----------
that has that structure within them


---------19:04----------
right we all respond well to certain


---------19:07----------
kinds of things behavioral change can be


---------19:09----------
modified like in all of us so it's all


---------19:12----------
kind of I mean everyone has that I think


---------19:15----------
it's just really important to think


---------19:16----------
about what is the behavior that you want


---------19:18----------
to reinforce and not be a dick about it


---------19:19----------
I mean sometimes you have to but really


---------19:21----------
to try to be compassionate and sort of


---------19:23----------
like okay what do I want to like what do


---------19:25----------
I want to reward my child for doing when


---------19:27----------
they come to me and they say hey Dad can


---------19:30----------
I please play with this like the last


---------19:31----------
like hey can I please watch TV


---------19:33----------
and if they ask super nicely then I'll


---------19:35----------
be like okay fine and I'll relent even


---------19:38----------
though they're not supposed to but if


---------19:39----------
they ask super nice I'll relent because


---------19:40----------
I want them to like ask for things


---------19:42----------
nicely and then sometimes if they ask


---------19:45----------
nicely and I say no and then they


---------19:47----------
hissy-fit then there's no way but if


---------19:50----------
they ask nicely and I say no and they


---------19:51----------
stay calm about it then I'll be like


---------19:53----------
thank you for for understanding that we


---------19:55----------
can't watch right now since you did such


---------19:57----------
a good job like why don't we read an


---------19:59----------
extra story tonight and so you still


---------20:01----------
want to reinforce the behavior without


---------20:02----------
sort of giving into it all right sorry


---------20:05----------
you want to provide like you want to


---------20:06----------
reinforce the behavior that you want to


---------20:08----------
like you want to see more of


---------20:09----------
[Music]


---------20:13----------
so let me just go do you know the best


---------20:19----------
yeah so Monte like that's what I'm


---------20:21----------
saying right so so there's a great book


---------20:23----------
called walking with it walking on


---------20:25----------
eggshells I think which is about working


---------20:27----------
with people with BPD but I think the


---------20:30----------
most important thing to remember is that


---------20:32----------
like you should be relatively neutral


---------20:34----------
and caring so you kind of let people


---------20:37----------
know that you have boundaries and limits


---------20:39----------
and that when you don't compromise your


---------20:41----------
boundaries it doesn't mean that you


---------20:43----------
don't care so if you get a frantic text


---------20:45----------
from someone like kind of like know what


---------20:47----------
I was saying earlier like the way that I


---------20:48----------
deal with patients say I understand


---------20:50----------
you're in crisis right now


---------20:52----------
do you think you can make it through the


---------20:53----------
night and if they say no then I'll say


---------20:55----------
like okay well I'm with my children


---------20:58----------
right now and it's not that I don't care


---------20:59----------
about you but I have a responsibility my


---------21:01----------
kids too if you really can't make it


---------21:03----------
through the night you should go to the


---------21:04----------
emergency room and that's not what


---------21:06----------
they're looking for right like so if


---------21:08----------
they really are in danger they will go


---------21:09----------
to the emergency room talk to them about


---------21:10----------
hey


---------21:12----------
um and the other thing is to to sort of


---------21:16----------
recognize that like they're going to


---------21:18----------
interpret benign stuff that has nothing


---------21:20----------
to do with them is a personal insult you


---------21:23----------
didn't respond to my text that means you


---------21:25----------
don't give a [ __ ] about me no man like


---------21:27----------
I'm just I was taking a [ __ ] like I


---------21:28----------
can't be on I can't be texting you


---------21:30----------
constantly and so what you've got to do


---------21:33----------
is just be like really stable and then


---------21:35----------
try to explain to them that I really do


---------21:37----------
care about you but sometimes I just have


---------21:39----------
other things going on and it can't be


---------21:41----------
available to all this do you feel like


---------21:43----------
you need someone 24/7 to help you and


---------21:46----------
then kind of have a conversation sort of


---------21:48----------
about that and what you can what you can


---------21:51----------
do and what what you can't do


---------21:55----------
um


---------22:01----------
so aww underscore L asks while I


---------22:05----------
understand there's some crossover is


---------22:07----------
that to suggest that those with the


---------22:09----------
depression are resistant to compliments


---------22:10----------
and those with BPD are somewhat


---------22:11----------
dependent actually that's a great


---------22:13----------
characterization so yeah so people with


---------22:16----------
with depression have a cognitive bias


---------22:18----------
and we'll see this on stream like I'm


---------22:21----------
sure we'll see it on stream I'll try to


---------22:23----------
point it out to you the next time you


---------22:24----------
wear some people who have low attitudes


---------22:27----------
and like low feelings of self-worth like


---------22:29----------
if you try to tell them that you think


---------22:31----------
that are made an amazing person they'll


---------22:33----------
say like they'll just think you're wrong


---------22:34----------
so have they have this idea that they're


---------22:37----------
really just not valuable and that if


---------22:39----------
other people are telling them that they


---------22:41----------
just can't accept it it's just not it's


---------22:44----------
just not true like in their mind it's


---------22:45----------
just not true


---------22:46----------
they have a really powerful cognitive


---------22:47----------
bias whereas in BPD what happens is the


---------22:51----------
way they feel about themselves is the


---------22:52----------
way that other people treat them


---------22:54----------
and so if other people people treat them


---------22:57----------
really well like then that's great and


---------22:59----------
that's kind of like I mean you can think


---------23:00----------
about celebrities like that's also true


---------23:01----------
I think a lot of celebrities have some


---------23:04----------
kind of like borderline like structure


---------23:07----------
it doesn't mean that they have BPD


---------23:09----------
but as our psychology gets bombarded and


---------23:13----------
streamers have this - as our psychology


---------23:15----------
gets bombarded with other people's


---------23:17----------
opinions of us we start to like our


---------23:20----------
psychology just can't keep up with it


---------23:22----------
and it starts to like appreciate those


---------23:24----------
things more and more yes sir a


---------23:28----------
correlation between narcissistic


---------23:29----------
behavior in gaming I have a [ __ ]


---------23:31----------
lutely man so in so many ways man like


---------23:35----------
this is a whole different topic I think


---------23:37----------
we could spend an entire stream on it


---------23:39----------
let me just lay it out like very simply


---------23:41----------
so the first thing is this thing called


---------23:44----------
the dunning-kruger effect and this is


---------23:46----------
this idea that like the more ignorant


---------23:48----------
you are on something the more you


---------23:50----------
recognize the less likely you are to


---------23:52----------
recognize that you're ignorant so this


---------23:55----------
is like when you're a noob who plays a


---------23:57----------
game like you think you understand why


---------24:00----------
you guys lost the game but because


---------24:02----------
you're a [ __ ] noob you really have no


---------24:04----------
idea why you lost the game but trying to


---------24:06----------
convince someone who's bad at a game


---------24:08----------
that their analysis of a game is


---------24:11----------
incorrect because they're bad like just


---------24:13----------
doesn't work like it just doesn't work


---------24:15----------
right so that's kind of a narcissistic


---------24:18----------
thing and dunning-kruger basically says


---------24:20----------
that the worse you are the game the less


---------24:22----------
likely you are to understand how bad you


---------24:25----------
and then as you get better at something


---------24:27----------
you begin to see the gaps in your


---------24:29----------
knowledge and your more accurately be


---------24:31----------
able to judge your own skill and at the


---------24:34----------
top end of the spectrum you're very good


---------24:36----------
at judging how good you are because you


---------24:38----------
understand the game really well so if


---------24:40----------
you think about like if I'm a noob at


---------24:42----------
chess my ability to gauge whether


---------24:44----------
someone else is good or bad at chess is


---------24:46----------
not very good if I'm a grandmaster at


---------24:48----------
chess I can play like five moves or


---------24:50----------
three moves against someone and I can


---------24:52----------
sort of accurately rate how good they


---------24:54----------
are so the ability to judge skill starts


---------24:58----------
with skill but in games what people


---------25:01----------
don't understand people are making


---------25:02----------
judgments all the time about like other


---------25:04----------
players and why people lose games but


---------25:07----------
they suck and so they lack the the skill


---------25:10----------
to like recognize why people are good


---------25:13----------
and why people are bad that in and of


---------25:15----------
itself is a narcissistic behavior the


---------25:18----------
other thing that happens in games and


---------25:19----------
this is kind of a completely different


---------25:20----------
dimension is that a lot of gamers have a


---------25:23----------
lack of confidence which in turn means


---------25:25----------
that they're egotistical because


---------25:27----------
remember that confidence and ego like we


---------25:30----------
kind of think about them sometimes in


---------25:32----------
the same realm but they're inversely


---------25:33----------
proportional so the higher the more


---------25:35----------
confident I am them the less egotistical


---------25:38----------
and if we think about what's the


---------25:40----------
between confidence and ego confidence it


---------25:44----------
kind of goes back to BPD so ego is


---------25:47----------
someone who requires other people to


---------25:51----------
validate who they think they are and


---------25:53----------
confidence doesn't require people so the


---------25:56----------
self-worth of an egotistical person


---------25:58----------
comes from outside and the self-worth of


---------26:02----------
a confident person comes from the inside


---------26:04----------
and so what happens in gaming is that if


---------26:08----------
people are not like if people are not


---------26:11----------
confident and who they are because a lot


---------26:13----------
of times gamers aren't like Henry is


---------26:14----------
like a decent guy for example but you


---------26:16----------
know a lot of gamers like aren't doing


---------26:18----------
great in life so they don't like jump


---------26:20----------
around and think that they're amazing


---------26:21----------
people and so it conversely like their


---------26:24----------
ego is pretty high and then that that


---------26:26----------
manifests is like narcissistic stuff in


---------26:28----------
game where people get super bent out of


---------26:30----------
shape they call other people [ __ ] if


---------26:33----------
someone calls you a [ __ ] you get bent


---------26:34----------
out of shape whereas like if you're


---------26:36----------
confident in who you're all like when I


---------26:37----------
get when people rage at me in a game


---------26:39----------
like I don't really care it's like these


---------26:41----------
guys are just they're just raging in a


---------26:42----------
game like they have no idea who I am


---------26:43----------
like they don't understand anything


---------26:45----------
about me and if they're raging at me in


---------26:47----------
a game like that's all coming from them


---------26:48----------
it has nothing to do with me but if


---------26:50----------
you're affected by like other people's


---------26:52----------
rage then that's like kind of a


---------26:54----------
narcissistic structure that you have


---------26:57----------
um


---------27:01----------
so there's another question from Ziya


---------27:04----------
which is you talked about mood swings


---------27:07----------
earlier and how with people with bipolar


---------27:08----------
it's usually for like weeks and months


---------27:10----------
but when people do have it like you said


---------27:13----------
from 12 p.m. to p.m. like 6 p.m. when


---------27:15----------
people have mood swings from like hours


---------27:17----------
what is that is that something called


---------27:18----------
emotional lability and I think a lot of


---------27:21----------
that actually has to do with gaming so


---------27:25----------
when we like when we play video games


---------27:27----------
it's sort of suppresses our emotional


---------27:29----------
circuitry and those emotions are kind of


---------27:31----------
like floating right beneath the surface


---------27:33----------
so what happens is like when you have


---------27:35----------
stuff that's right beneath the surface


---------27:37----------
it can explode and it can also calm down


---------27:39----------
it can explode and it can calm down but


---------27:41----------
I think the reason that people have


---------27:43----------
those kinds of mood swings is because


---------27:44----------
they never truly process their emotions


---------27:46----------
right like if you get if you get into a


---------27:49----------
fight with your mom because like you


---------27:51----------
didn't take out the trash and you like


---------27:53----------
rage and you guys get into this huge


---------27:55----------
fight about a little thing and then two


---------27:57----------
hours later like both y'all are like


---------27:58----------
civil with each other like where did


---------28:01----------
that emotion go and then like the next


---------28:03----------
day you guys like get into another


---------28:05----------
stupid fight it's because it's the same


---------28:07----------
amount of that emotion that just keeps


---------28:09----------
resurfacing it's just bobbing to the


---------28:11----------
surface and so a lot of mood swings are


---------28:13----------
about like not processing emotions but


---------28:16----------
just burying emotions and then like


---------28:18----------
they're like a geyser like the pressure


---------28:20----------
builds up and they burst and then they


---------28:22----------
calm down and then they burst and so


---------28:25----------
what you really got to do if you want to


---------28:26----------
stop a geyser from exploding like you


---------28:28----------
have to vent it out right you have to


---------28:29----------
get all the pressure out and that's


---------28:31----------
accomplished in things like therapy


---------28:33----------
through meditation and things like that


---------28:36----------
Chinn time was saying yeah just curious


---------28:37----------
I had a situation back in freshman year


---------28:39----------
in college where a friend was suicidally


---------28:41----------
depressed I ended up falling into the


---------28:42----------
cycle of always being there for him and


---------28:44----------
making the situation worse as he


---------28:46----------
escalated yeah man that's tough like


---------28:49----------
that's exactly what that's the situation


---------28:51----------
right that you become this person's


---------28:54----------
pressure valve and then as they vent


---------28:57----------
their pressure into you you start


---------29:00----------
getting exhausted you can't be their


---------29:02----------
pressure valve anymore and then they


---------29:04----------
escalate


---------29:06----------
and the more they escalate then you like


---------29:09----------
dig deep and even though you've been


---------29:10----------
talking them through the night every


---------29:12----------
night for three days in a row when they


---------29:14----------
say like yeah this is the time man this


---------29:16----------
is the time I really need you if you


---------29:18----------
can't come over I'm really gonna do it


---------29:19----------
then you go over there and you're just


---------29:21----------
reinforcing that behavior


---------29:24----------
and so


---------29:27----------
someone at Scot Marx asked to any help


---------29:30----------
on any tips on helping a friend with


---------29:31----------
paranoid delusions look guys I really


---------29:32----------
can't give you medical advice over the


---------29:35----------
internet so I'd say if your friend


---------29:36----------
actually has paranoid delusions or if


---------29:38----------
you know people who are suicidal like


---------29:41----------
you should not try to fix this like it's


---------29:42----------
one thing to be a friend and it's one


---------29:44----------
thing to understand behavioral


---------29:46----------
reinforcement but if you have really


---------29:48----------
have people who are suicidal that you're


---------29:49----------
talking to you should really encourage


---------29:51----------
them to get professional help and same


---------29:53----------
with paranoid delusions like I think


---------29:55----------
that you know twitch chat is brilliant


---------29:58----------
and can accomplish all kinds of things


---------29:59----------
but we're really talking about like


---------30:01----------
tried-and-true suicidality and paranoid


---------30:04----------
delusions and even BPD for that matter


---------30:05----------
like they need professional help and so


---------30:08----------
that's what you guys should really be


---------30:09----------
doing and encourage them to do that


---------30:10----------
because they're much more likely to


---------30:12----------
listen to you than they are to like


---------30:14----------
actually listen to a clinician so many


---------30:17----------
of the people that actually end up in my


---------30:18----------
office or because someone they care


---------30:20----------
about and someone that cares about them


---------30:22----------
and someone that they trust told them


---------30:24----------
they're like hey I really think you


---------30:26----------
should see a psychiatrist and then they


---------30:27----------
like wind up in my office and thank God


---------30:30----------
that that person existed because without


---------30:32----------
that friend like that person would have


---------30:34----------
never sought help so I think the most


---------30:36----------
important thing that you can do is


---------30:38----------
instead of trying to tackle it all on


---------30:39----------
your own because you may be able to you


---------30:41----------
may not be able to you may be doing your


---------30:43----------
friend a disservice it may be bigger


---------30:44----------
than you realize there may be issues


---------30:47----------
that you don't even know to think about


---------30:48----------
like is this person being abused are


---------30:50----------
they using drugs like you may not know


---------30:52----------
that stuff and all that stuff factors in


---------30:54----------
send them to a professional and


---------30:55----------
encourage them to do that or send them


---------30:57----------
to the stream and show them that


---------30:59----------
hopefully professionals are scary


---------31:02----------
so then a call 1001 asks however how can


---------31:05----------
you control for external factors I'm


---------31:09----------
assuming in this factions in that


---------31:10----------
situation for example if someone is


---------31:12----------
getting into the cycle if the targeted


---------31:14----------
person doesn't give them the positive


---------31:15----------
reinforcement then the instigator just


---------31:18----------
goes off for someone else who does give


---------31:20----------
them that you can't control for that


---------31:21----------
right like so first of all you can't


---------31:23----------
control what someone else does and so


---------31:25----------
when dealing with BPD like I think it's


---------31:28----------
I mean so what I do I don't try to


---------31:29----------
control the person's family what I


---------31:32----------
really try to do is show the person


---------31:34----------
themselves the pattern and once you show


---------31:37----------
the person the pattern if you can get


---------31:39----------
them to recognize that then real change


---------31:42----------
starts to happen like BPD doesn't work


---------31:44----------
great I mean there is a lot of value in


---------31:47----------
terms of like helping caregivers and


---------31:50----------
family members like sort of get on the


---------31:51----------
same page there's a lot of value in that


---------31:53----------
but ultimately remember that like what


---------31:55----------
you need to change are the person who


---------31:56----------
needs to do any kind of changing is the


---------31:59----------
person who's suffering that's the person


---------32:01----------
who needs to change it's not like you


---------32:03----------
have to line up everyone else to make


---------32:05----------
them change you've got a you know


---------32:07----------
they've got to be the ones that do the


---------32:08----------
change


---------32:09----------
um and that's actually so if you look at


---------32:12----------
sort of like look up the criteria for


---------32:14----------
for BPD you'll see that one of them is a


---------32:16----------
history of intense and unstable


---------32:19----------
relationships and it's exactly for the


---------32:21----------
reason that a call 1001 said because


---------32:24----------
what happens is like one person doesn't


---------32:26----------
give them the positive reinforcement so


---------32:28----------
they like ghost that person and latch on


---------32:31----------
to someone else and they get like really


---------32:33----------
intense with someone they're like


---------32:34----------
telling people that oh I love you like


---------32:36----------
I've been dating with you like you've


---------32:38----------
been dating a week and they fall over


---------32:39----------
head-over-heels they're like moving in


---------32:40----------
one month later and then things just


---------32:42----------
like implode and then they move out and


---------32:46----------
then they find someone else and it's


---------32:47----------
really sad but that's like what happens


---------32:49----------
so people with BPD have a history of


---------32:52----------
unstable and intense relationships


---------32:54----------
because people just can't handle them


---------32:56----------
for like an extended period of time
