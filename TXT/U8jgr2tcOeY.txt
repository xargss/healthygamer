---------00:00----------
but the interesting thing is when people


---------00:02----------
chase confidence what they chase


---------00:04----------
if they're looking to be more confident


---------00:06----------
what they chase is achievement


---------00:08----------
right they think oh if i achieve then i


---------00:10----------
will be more confident


---------00:12----------
which is missing the point because


---------00:13----------
that's actually what it actually does is


---------00:15----------
places


---------00:16----------
your value in yourself to be conditional


---------00:20----------
on your success and that actually is the


---------00:22----------
opposite of confidence


---------00:29----------
yeah so how you been again thank you for


---------00:32----------
coming back


---------00:34----------
yeah thanks for having me


---------00:37----------
yeah is there something in particular


---------00:39----------
you wanted to talk about


---------00:40----------
or today uh


---------00:44----------
not like specific specific um


---------00:52----------
yeah nothing like particular mind may be


---------00:55----------
like


---------00:55----------
slightly about confidence perhaps but


---------00:59----------
other than that like there's no clear


---------01:00----------
general direct or


---------01:01----------
no clear direction i guess yeah so let's


---------01:04----------
i think confidence is a great place to


---------01:06----------
start what do you think


---------01:08----------
okay sure yeah yeah so tell me a little


---------01:10----------
bit about


---------01:11----------
uh confidence and


---------01:14----------
you know what you were what you were


---------01:16----------
thinking about when you


---------01:19----------
um i just feel like i have


---------01:23----------
very low confidence and i um


---------01:27----------
and just really not just want to explore


---------01:30----------
that i guess i don't really know


---------01:31----------
why or like how maybe it was like


---------01:35----------
how i was raised i don't know yeah


---------01:38----------
absolutely dude


---------01:39----------
that's such an awesome topic um because


---------01:42----------
i


---------01:42----------
i think confidence is like something


---------01:44----------
that we don't really understand right so


---------01:46----------
we like know that some people have


---------01:48----------
confidence


---------01:49----------
some people feel like they don't have


---------01:51----------
confidence but like what is it where


---------01:53----------
does it come from


---------01:54----------
why do some people have it why do some


---------01:55----------
people not have it


---------01:57----------
um how to get it if you don't have it


---------01:59----------
those all sound like really really


---------02:01----------
important things to explore to me what


---------02:02----------
do you think


---------02:04----------
yeah okay so tell me a little bit about


---------02:07----------
what when you say you may not have very


---------02:09----------
high confidence what


---------02:11----------
let's start with this how do you know


---------02:13----------
what do you experience


---------02:15----------
that makes you think that you don't have


---------02:16----------
low confidence


---------02:18----------
well well toast says have some more


---------02:22----------
confidence you [ __ ]


---------02:24----------
like i think that's like one to start


---------02:27----------
um i feel


---------02:30----------
like basically a lot of my friends will


---------02:33----------
say a lot of great things about me


---------02:36----------
whenever i struggle to i guess


---------02:40----------
have a positive view of myself and i


---------02:42----------
just


---------02:43----------
i'm very much like huh like i don't


---------02:45----------
really see it the same way that they do


---------02:48----------
um and


---------02:51----------
yeah i don't know that's just like oh


---------02:54----------
yeah i


---------02:55----------
uh kind of don't really see


---------02:58----------
like much of what i've done as


---------03:01----------
accomplishments i see them more as like


---------03:04----------
like things i'm supposed to do or like


---------03:06----------
things that like just


---------03:08----------
happen and stuff like that i see so it


---------03:11----------
sounds like


---------03:13----------
what other people seem to think is like


---------03:16----------
praiseworthy


---------03:17----------
you think is like pretty run-of-the-mill


---------03:20----------
yeah i think it's very like very


---------03:23----------
standard or very


---------03:25----------
i'm like just doing my job or um i got


---------03:28----------
really lucky with like


---------03:30----------
my group of friends and the people that


---------03:31----------
i know um


---------03:33----------
yeah okay so so what do your friends say


---------03:36----------
about you that they think is great that


---------03:38----------
you think is pretty standard


---------03:40----------
can you give us an example um


---------03:42----------
[Music]


---------03:44----------
maybe like if they say that i'm good at


---------03:46----------
doing my job like


---------03:47----------
i work at offline tv um and stuff and


---------03:50----------
then they'll be like oh


---------03:51----------
like you're doing great like you do this


---------03:53----------
and that but i'm like


---------03:54----------
oh i i mean i'm just doing what like you


---------03:58----------
know job


---------03:58----------
you like you know you go to work you


---------04:00----------
have like a job description of like


---------04:01----------
stuff that you're supposed to do i'm


---------04:02----------
just doing like


---------04:04----------
or i'm trying my best to do like


---------04:05----------
everything that's that i'm supposed to


---------04:07----------
do and then also like


---------04:09----------
there's always things that you could do


---------04:10----------
more of and i


---------04:12----------
don't even necessarily have all the time


---------04:14----------
to try to do that


---------04:16----------
or necessarily there's always something


---------04:17----------
more you could do in like every


---------04:19----------
and everything i guess yeah that's true


---------04:23----------
so it sounds like people say you know


---------04:26----------
good


---------04:26----------
things about you that you think are not


---------04:29----------
really


---------04:30----------
deserved or like you don't deserve


---------04:31----------
praise for him


---------04:33----------
it's like standard yeah and


---------04:36----------
what do you think would be like


---------04:37----------
appropriate for you


---------04:39----------
like you know what would qualify as


---------04:41----------
something that's like


---------04:42----------
okay to be proud of like what would you


---------04:44----------
have to do to feel


---------04:45----------
confident or proud of what you've done


---------04:49----------
[Music]


---------04:50----------
maybe if i was like really really good


---------04:53----------
at a game


---------04:54----------
then if people ever complimented me in


---------04:56----------
that i would feel like


---------04:57----------
a little more confident or validated


---------05:00----------
or if i would had like


---------05:03----------
i don't know a skill like a specific


---------05:07----------
skill set or talent or something


---------05:09----------
or yeah i don't know


---------05:12----------
don't really know what i'm good at i


---------05:14----------
guess yeah


---------05:16----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but what


---------05:18----------
what makes you think that


---------05:21----------
having your job at ota otv and doing


---------05:24----------
what you do is not a specific skill or


---------05:26----------
talent


---------05:29----------
uh i guess i think of it like if


---------05:32----------
someone else were to be in my position


---------05:35----------
like could they do the same thing and


---------05:37----------
possibly


---------05:38----------
yeah like yeah possibly better and i


---------05:41----------
just think like


---------05:42----------
yeah you know there's so many people out


---------05:43----------
there there's what i do


---------05:45----------
i feel like is not very


---------05:49----------
like special i guess or um


---------05:54----------
but my housemates tell me that like


---------05:58----------
no like not i guess it's


---------06:01----------
they're more concerned about i think


---------06:03----------
like getting along with everyone and i


---------06:04----------
can get along with everyone


---------06:06----------
and stuff but that's like uh


---------06:10----------
i mean i feel like if you just hired


---------06:12----------
like a really nice


---------06:14----------
really nice person too who also like


---------06:16----------
could work like that could also be the


---------06:18----------
same thing right


---------06:20----------
so how hard do you think it is to get


---------06:22----------
along with everyone


---------06:24----------
um


---------06:29----------
i mean it doesn't seem like the hardest


---------06:35----------
thing in the world possibly but maybe


---------06:37----------
it's like


---------06:39----------
i guess you just have to mesh it's it's


---------06:41----------
hard to say i think it's a


---------06:44----------
vibe or personality i don't know yeah so


---------06:47----------
like


---------06:49----------
here's so here's the tricky thing we'll


---------06:51----------
get to like past and stuff like that but


---------06:53----------
one observation that i've made is that


---------06:55----------
people tend to


---------06:56----------
take for granted what they're natural at


---------07:00----------
so like when you're a natural it feels


---------07:02----------
natural to you it doesn't feel


---------07:03----------
special right but the whole point of


---------07:07----------
like


---------07:07----------
like you know if i was like a chess


---------07:09----------
prodigy let's say and i was just a


---------07:11----------
natural attack


---------07:12----------
chest and like people were like hey man


---------07:14----------
you're really amazing at chess


---------07:16----------
but i was like i'm like it's not that


---------07:18----------
big of a d


---------07:19----------
it just feels easy like i don't think


---------07:21----------
it's that big of a deal


---------07:23----------
yeah and does that make sense so i've


---------07:25----------
just noticed that people tend to


---------07:26----------
undervalue


---------07:28----------
what feels natural at and actually


---------07:29----------
bizarrely therefore


---------07:31----------
the things that they tend to be the best


---------07:33----------
at are the things that they devalue the


---------07:34----------
most


---------07:35----------
because there's a perception that what


---------07:39----------
people


---------07:39----------
should value is correlated with


---------07:42----------
difficulty


---------07:44----------
right like the more we value things the


---------07:46----------
harder the like the harder something is


---------07:48----------
the more we value it


---------07:49----------
and therefore we can kind of create this


---------07:51----------
weird situation where like the more


---------07:52----------
natural i am at something


---------07:54----------
the more likely i am to like undervalue


---------07:56----------
because it feels easy to me


---------07:59----------
does that make sense yeah so because i i


---------08:02----------
would say that you know getting along


---------08:04----------
with someone is exceedingly


---------08:06----------
getting along with everyone is actually


---------08:08----------
like exceedingly difficult to do


---------08:12----------
and then if you look at most problems


---------08:15----------
in like content creator groups or even


---------08:17----------
friend circles


---------08:20----------
that like a lot of people a lot of the


---------08:22----------
reason a lot of the drama


---------08:23----------
like if you were a drama reducing


---------08:25----------
influence like you are worth your weight


---------08:27----------
in gold


---------08:28----------
what do you think about that


---------08:32----------
yeah i agree with that are you a drama


---------08:34----------
reducing influence


---------08:38----------
i hope so but i don't know i feel like


---------08:41----------
that's


---------08:42----------
difficult for me to say more for like


---------08:43----------
easier for other people to say


---------08:45----------
i think they and i think they do say


---------08:47----------
that


---------08:49----------
right well they never said that


---------08:52----------
specifically


---------08:53----------
yeah but i think yeah but when they say


---------08:56----------
you're good at getting along with people


---------08:58----------
i think that they don't know how to i


---------09:00----------
think part of the issue is that


---------09:01----------
they may not be able to articulate what


---------09:03----------
the value they see in you


---------09:05----------
is but if i had to bet money just


---------09:08----------
you know having seen a little bit of


---------09:10----------
like what different groups of


---------09:12----------
like he's like why do content creators


---------09:13----------
break apart


---------09:15----------
because of drama yeah and like what is


---------09:18----------
the otv


---------09:19----------
like turnover in terms of people coming


---------09:22----------
on and people leaving


---------09:23----------
like pretty low right yeah


---------09:26----------
and and so i mean i i i don't know i


---------09:29----------
mean maybe i'm wrong here maybe


---------09:31----------
but i can definitely see i think i think


---------09:33----------
you're it's easy to undervalue like


---------09:36----------
what you're good at first of all it's


---------09:38----------
just an interesting dynamic of the mind


---------09:39----------
and if you're if you're kind of like


---------09:41----------
smooth things over and you get along


---------09:42----------
with everyone like that's not easy to do


---------09:44----------
and that's actually very valuable to me


---------09:47----------
um how do you how do you feel about what


---------09:49----------
i'm saying


---------09:51----------
uh it makes a lot of sense it's like


---------09:54----------
when


---------09:54----------
you say it it's like okay like that does


---------09:57----------
make sense and that


---------09:58----------
makes it easier for me to like digest


---------10:01----------
that


---------10:02----------
like what i do bring some sort of value


---------10:04----------
when it's again


---------10:05----------
explained in that way so it's it's like


---------10:08----------
you're uh


---------10:08----------
you know if we think about drama


---------10:12----------
as like i'm trying to think about what


---------10:14----------
the right video game analogy is


---------10:17----------
you're like a cleanse for otv right


---------10:19----------
there's like


---------10:20----------
like poison ticks and as people create


---------10:23----------
content together like


---------10:24----------
you stack up the poison stacks yeah and


---------10:27----------
and like you need something like you


---------10:28----------
need a healer


---------10:29----------
right and the interesting thing is like


---------10:31----------
the thing about like someone who's


---------10:32----------
specifically it's not even like a healer


---------10:33----------
it's like a cleanser


---------10:35----------
is when the cleanser does their job


---------10:37----------
right like sort of no one really notices


---------10:38----------
but when they do their job wrong


---------10:40----------
like everything just starts like


---------10:41----------
everyone's like sitting around at half


---------10:43----------
health in the raid and everything is


---------10:44----------
falling apart


---------10:46----------
you know you don't even see like because


---------10:47----------
even if you look at the end when you


---------10:48----------
look at the you know the heel meters


---------10:51----------
yeah the cleanser doesn't have like


---------10:53----------
looks they haven't healed for anything


---------10:54----------
and like some other heel meters are like


---------10:56----------
oh you know i healed for like 20k like


---------10:58----------
the cleanser sitting there like i'm just


---------11:00----------
spamming cleanse


---------11:01----------
you don't see it on the heel meter so


---------11:03----------
it's sometimes hard to recognize


---------11:05----------
but anyway i suspect that your


---------11:08----------
confidence has more to do


---------11:10----------
you know there's more to it than that


---------11:11----------
what do you think yeah


---------11:14----------
probably yeah um


---------11:17----------
let me just think for a second yeah so


---------11:20----------
how long have you felt like


---------11:22----------
uh i mean do you feel like you don't


---------11:24----------
have confidence or that's just what


---------11:25----------
other people tell you um


---------11:29----------
i do i do feel like that a lot um i


---------11:32----------
didn't realize it until


---------11:35----------
it was more prominent and in my head


---------11:37----------
more when one day i had a call


---------11:40----------
um and i was like talking to


---------11:45----------
i was talking to toast and then he was


---------11:48----------
just


---------11:48----------
i can't remember i was like kind of he


---------11:51----------
was someone was saying something good


---------11:53----------
about me or he was saying something good


---------11:54----------
i can't remember and i was like oh no


---------11:56----------
it's like it's not like i was playing it


---------11:58----------
down a lot i guess


---------11:59----------
and then he was just like hey like


---------12:01----------
that's my friend you're talking about


---------12:03----------
right now


---------12:04----------
like he be like


---------12:08----------
like and i made me think like why am i


---------12:10----------
so


---------12:11----------
mean to myself in a way and


---------12:14----------
yeah that was just where it mostly like


---------12:15----------
stemmed from and what when you say


---------12:18----------
you're


---------12:18----------
mean to yourself like what kind of


---------12:20----------
thoughts do you does your mind produce


---------12:22----------
about you


---------12:24----------
um i guess just not really thinking too


---------12:28----------
highly of myself


---------12:29----------
like anything that i


---------12:33----------
maybe possibly accomplish or do well i


---------12:36----------
attribute to a bunch of other things


---------12:39----------
and um


---------12:43----------
i guess i just don't really


---------12:46----------
see what i did as like that amazing or


---------12:50----------
hard or


---------12:51----------
so many layers of it um so what what is


---------12:54----------
can you give me an example of like


---------12:56----------
something that


---------12:59----------
maybe people thought was praiseworthy or


---------13:01----------
an accomplishment and like literally


---------13:03----------
what your mind


---------13:04----------
said um


---------13:10----------
i guess like one of the things was like


---------13:12----------
i


---------13:14----------
got masters in league and i had like a


---------13:16----------
bunch of my friends who are


---------13:18----------
like really happy for me


---------13:21----------
and i had a bunch of my friends who are


---------13:23----------
also like pro players who are like oh my


---------13:25----------
god like you work so hard and like


---------13:26----------
you're actually


---------13:28----------
i like i had to ask them like do you


---------13:30----------
think i'm actually like a


---------13:32----------
masters player and they're like yeah


---------13:33----------
like you're act like you're


---------13:36----------
caitlin is actually like really really


---------13:37----------
good and i but like


---------13:39----------
i still couldn't like i


---------13:42----------
couldn't get that validation so like i


---------13:45----------
couldn't feel it myself


---------13:47----------
and um or people's


---------13:50----------
say like my friends will come up to me


---------13:53----------
like oh my god yvonne like you're so


---------13:54----------
pretty but like i never


---------13:55----------
feel like i actually am like i don't


---------13:58----------
like how i


---------13:59----------
look a lot of the time so i don't feel


---------14:02----------
like i'm actually


---------14:03----------
when people compliment my looks i almost


---------14:05----------
like never believe them


---------14:07----------
what does your mind tell you about why


---------14:09----------
they're saying that


---------14:11----------
um i think i don't know there's always


---------14:15----------
like different reasons for it they're


---------14:16----------
either


---------14:17----------
like my friends so they're they like


---------14:19----------
love me no matter what


---------14:21----------
um or they're biased or


---------14:24----------
other people who are just really


---------14:26----------
supportive


---------14:28----------
like viewers and stuff just very


---------14:29----------
supportive or just like yeah


---------14:31----------
so yeah so just to


---------14:35----------
i'm gonna see if i understand so like if


---------14:37----------
i were to tell you


---------14:38----------
yvonne i think you're quite pretty you


---------14:39----------
would say your mind would say oh that's


---------14:41----------
dr k


---------14:42----------
he's gonna say that it has nothing to do


---------14:45----------
with you


---------14:45----------
it has everything to do with me right


---------14:49----------
they're just they're just saying that um


---------14:52----------
i mean


---------14:53----------
it's not like i think that everyone


---------14:56----------
is just saying that like they would lie


---------14:59----------
to me or


---------15:00----------
just say something like you know just to


---------15:02----------
make me feel better but i just


---------15:04----------
never like believe it okay


---------15:07----------
i don't know if it's like it's like that


---------15:09----------
doesn't necessarily have like a


---------15:10----------
correlation but like in my brain i still


---------15:13----------
won't really like


---------15:15----------
believe it okay i like believe that they


---------15:19----------
mean it but i won't believe myself that


---------15:22----------
i'm like pretty


---------15:23----------
if that makes sense yeah okay that


---------15:26----------
that's thank you so much i think that's


---------15:28----------
a really important nuance let me see if


---------15:29----------
i got it


---------15:31----------
so


---------15:35----------
it's almost like you're you don't


---------15:37----------
discount what they're saying like you


---------15:39----------
think that


---------15:40----------
they actually do believe you're pretty


---------15:43----------
they're not


---------15:43----------
just saying yeah they could right


---------15:45----------
they're not just saying that because


---------15:47----------
they're your friend


---------15:49----------
you can understand that people outside


---------15:50----------
of you may consider you to be pretty or


---------15:52----------
good at league or whatever


---------15:54----------
but you just don't believe that about


---------15:55----------
yourself like they're entitled to their


---------15:57----------
beliefs but they're just


---------15:59----------
you know it doesn't affect the way that


---------16:01----------
you feel about yourself


---------16:04----------
what do you think about your league play


---------16:11----------
i think in the beginning i was a lot


---------16:14----------
more unsure but as time goes on


---------16:18----------
you see a lot of players and like the


---------16:21----------
same rank i think like you know what


---------16:23----------
maybe i


---------16:24----------
am best or was masters at that time when


---------16:26----------
i got it


---------16:27----------
because i see the other players i'm like


---------16:29----------
oh man


---------16:31----------
what is this and then that's what i


---------16:33----------
believed it was but it was through


---------16:35----------
seeing


---------16:35----------
other people you know not really through


---------16:38----------
myself


---------16:39----------
sure but yeah so i've also


---------16:43----------
i think like at some point just trusted


---------16:46----------
my friends as well


---------16:47----------
because i feel like i kept asking them


---------16:50----------
like no bias like


---------16:52----------
serious judge like can you tell me like


---------16:54----------
if you think like


---------16:56----------
and then they a lot of them will always


---------16:57----------
say yes so that like


---------16:59----------
made me feel better but it took time i


---------17:02----------
didn't


---------17:03----------
it wasn't something that i believed i


---------17:05----------
actually think like i just recently


---------17:07----------
like what they said i just absorbed it


---------17:10----------
and was just like


---------17:11----------
okay like i believed it a bit more


---------17:14----------
that sounds so interesting yvonne can


---------17:16----------
you help me understand how one goes


---------17:18----------
about


---------17:18----------
absorbing what other people say


---------17:22----------
it might go along with like observing


---------17:25----------
more like seeing like


---------17:26----------
other players who are the same and like


---------17:28----------
just over time um


---------17:30----------
thinking about i guess more


---------17:34----------
like how much i know about the game when


---------17:36----------
i'm talking about it with people


---------17:37----------
or um playing it and like just


---------17:44----------
i guess sometimes when you lean against


---------17:45----------
other people you just know see


---------17:47----------
like the skill difference and so i felt


---------17:50----------
like i was


---------17:51----------
freaking a lot more a lot worse than i


---------17:54----------
was because i'm comparing myself to my


---------17:56----------
friends who are


---------17:56----------
who are pro players you know like that's


---------17:59----------
my my


---------18:00----------
league circle is like a lot of them are


---------18:02----------
pro players so it's like i'm


---------18:04----------
i'm never gonna see that or like try to


---------18:07----------
go for that so why am i comparing myself


---------18:09----------
to them you know


---------18:10----------
so i always felt like i was so bad


---------18:12----------
because i can't


---------18:14----------
do this like kind of similar things that


---------18:17----------
they do


---------18:18----------
not realistic yeah so that sounds kind


---------18:22----------
of weird


---------18:22----------
i'm i'm gonna repeat the question that i


---------18:25----------
asked and i'm gonna repeat your question


---------18:27----------
you're going to i'm going to share a


---------18:28----------
couple of tidbits from your answer back


---------18:30----------
at you


---------18:32----------
and then i'm going to ask you one more


---------18:33----------
question okay so i asked


---------18:35----------
what allows other people's words to sink


---------18:37----------
in


---------18:38----------
and the interesting thing is that you


---------18:40----------
said it's observing more


---------18:42----------
and it sounds like and then you started


---------18:44----------
to say things that happened


---------18:45----------
in your own mind and really don't have


---------18:47----------
anything to do with what other people


---------18:48----------
are saying


---------18:51----------
like your answer was like when i play a


---------18:53----------
game and i really pay attention and i


---------18:54----------
realize that


---------18:56----------
this scrub is a master's level player oh


---------18:58----------
maybe i really am masters level


---------19:02----------
right yeah like if you could be this bad


---------19:05----------
and wind up in masters i certainly


---------19:07----------
deserve to be here


---------19:10----------
yeah the things that you know i would


---------19:11----------
believe on my own if it didn't have like


---------19:14----------
other people that


---------19:16----------
well but the interesting thing is that


---------19:17----------
it sounds like for other people's words


---------19:19----------
to sink in it actually has nothing to do


---------19:21----------
with what they say


---------19:24----------
it has everything to do with what you


---------19:25----------
observe


---------19:28----------
possibly yeah and then like what they


---------19:30----------
say starts to make


---------19:32----------
more i start to agree with or that makes


---------19:34----------
more sense


---------19:35----------
exactly right but so that's you agreeing


---------19:38----------
with it


---------19:39----------
but that conclusion you formed by


---------19:41----------
yourself


---------19:43----------
so the first thing is like there's a


---------19:44----------
really important principle here because


---------19:46----------
people will say things to you and


---------19:48----------
whether you


---------19:49----------
deflect or dodge or whether you accept


---------19:53----------
them


---------19:54----------
doesn't actually have to do with what


---------19:55----------
they say it has to do with like what you


---------19:57----------
internally believe


---------20:00----------
so that's kind of interesting so


---------20:04----------
is it okay if i ask you about your


---------20:06----------
appearance some like


---------20:08----------
like we're talking about league like it


---------20:09----------
i i just want to be a little bit careful


---------20:11----------
here because


---------20:12----------
you know i know that especially in our


---------20:14----------
society today


---------20:15----------
especially streamers female streamers


---------20:19----------
get judged a lot on their appearance


---------20:22----------
um that there's a lot of like value and


---------20:25----------
self-worth


---------20:26----------
that society will attribute will be


---------20:28----------
placed on you


---------20:29----------
or that you will place on yourself


---------20:30----------
depending about your appearance


---------20:33----------
and i just want to kind of make sure


---------20:34----------
that it's okay that i ask you questions


---------20:36----------
about that because talking about you


---------20:38----------
know


---------20:38----------
how you don't suck at league feels safer


---------20:40----------
to me


---------20:42----------
then no um i actually am okay with that


---------20:45----------
i think it'd also be helpful to other


---------20:48----------
like girls or people out there who just


---------20:50----------
struggle with anything similar as well


---------20:53----------
so yeah i don't mind yeah so what do you


---------20:56----------
think about


---------20:57----------
uh are you pretty


---------21:00----------
uh i can


---------21:04----------
feel pretty at times like when i put on


---------21:06----------
makeup or do whatever but then like i


---------21:08----------
look and i'm like oh


---------21:09----------
not as ideal as how i want to look


---------21:13----------
and that's just how i feel like i just


---------21:15----------
think like oh like


---------21:17----------
sometimes like my face is too like round


---------21:20----------
or


---------21:20----------
uh i just don't like a lot of


---------21:24----------
it i don't know what it is i just yeah


---------21:27----------
how do you feel about not liking a lot


---------21:30----------
of the way that you look


---------21:33----------
um i feel like it's


---------21:36----------
a big struggle


---------21:40----------
in terms of being in this space because


---------21:43----------
i think if i wasn't in this space i


---------21:45----------
would feel


---------21:46----------
better like i because there's not as


---------21:48----------
much emphasis i think on


---------21:50----------
on how you look but being


---------21:53----------
on in like photos videos everything


---------21:57----------
like you naturally want to look good if


---------22:00----------
you can


---------22:00----------
especially just for me like as as a


---------22:03----------
female i want to


---------22:04----------
like look good all my friends are


---------22:06----------
freaking beautiful


---------22:09----------
and it's just like


---------22:12----------
i don't know it just sucks not


---------22:16----------
really feeling like you're pretty as


---------22:19----------
well


---------22:21----------
sounds like it sucks yeah


---------22:24----------
i mean it also sounds like you may even


---------22:26----------
think you're pretty but


---------22:27----------
compared to your pro-level league


---------22:30----------
players who are freaking beautiful


---------22:34----------
you know i'm almost noticing a


---------22:35----------
correlation there that like


---------22:37----------
your standard of comparison on the one


---------22:40----------
hand you compare yourself to pro level


---------22:41----------
league players and on the other hand you


---------22:43----------
compare yourself to people who are as


---------22:45----------
you put it freaking beautiful


---------22:47----------
i'm sort of noticing a correlation there


---------22:49----------
what do you think


---------22:51----------
yeah i think so


---------22:55----------
and so help me understand when you look


---------22:58----------
in the mirror what does your mind tell


---------23:00----------
you


---------23:01----------
or when you see photos of yourself


---------23:06----------
um


---------23:11----------
it could be anything i guess


---------23:14----------
like to be like completely candid like


---------23:18----------
i'll just look at a photo sometimes be


---------23:19----------
like oh like i wish i was taller or


---------23:21----------
like you know sometimes you just look


---------23:23----------
short or then


---------23:25----------
um or like my face will look like


---------23:28----------
really oh it'll look fine sometimes but


---------23:31----------
some days


---------23:32----------
it'll look like more round and i would


---------23:35----------
just be like i wish i was more


---------23:36----------
consistent


---------23:37----------
like i wish i could just like take


---------23:39----------
pictures and not worry about how i look


---------23:41----------
after


---------23:41----------
but that's also a thing that i could


---------23:44----------
also


---------23:44----------
work on if i just like for example


---------23:48----------
they worked out more or like did


---------23:50----------
something to improve


---------23:52----------
like uh or lost weight and stuff like


---------23:54----------
that like that could also


---------23:56----------
help so it's something that i could


---------23:59----------
complain about but i can also


---------24:00----------
actively do something about the same


---------24:02----------
time so


---------24:05----------
yeah i'm noticing some self-judgment


---------24:08----------
there


---------24:09----------
you're saying in a weird way right


---------24:11----------
because you're saying like


---------24:12----------
oh i don't


---------24:15----------
i shouldn't complain because i could fix


---------24:17----------
this if i tried harder


---------24:19----------
yeah i mean i think


---------24:22----------
i don't like complaining if it's


---------24:24----------
something that i can do about it


---------24:26----------
although i still do at times but it's


---------24:29----------
like uh you can technically do something


---------24:31----------
about this so


---------24:32----------
so you don't deserve to complain if it's


---------24:34----------
within your control


---------24:36----------
just complain less you know don't


---------24:38----------
complain as well


---------24:39----------
yeah about it so let me so we're talking


---------24:42----------
about confidence right


---------24:44----------
so let me ask you something if you were


---------24:46----------
pretty or do you think you'd be more


---------24:47----------
confident


---------24:52----------
i'm not sure to be honest because i feel


---------24:55----------
like


---------24:56----------
even if i was prettier there's probably


---------24:57----------
like something else


---------24:59----------
i'd be like you know i think you're


---------25:02----------
right


---------25:03----------
in the picky about yeah right so i i


---------25:06----------
i would say that you know i know it's


---------25:08----------
it's kind of harsh but i think that our


---------25:10----------
society sort of


---------25:11----------
can objectively rate people's


---------25:12----------
attractiveness or people can


---------25:14----------
agree you know out of a statistical


---------25:16----------
sample and my experience has been that


---------25:20----------
you know oddly enough confidence doesn't


---------25:22----------
seem to correlate with attractiveness


---------25:26----------
in fact if you look at you know


---------25:27----------
instagram reality


---------25:30----------
arguably the people who are even like


---------25:32----------
objectively in the top one percent of


---------25:34----------
physical attractiveness


---------25:36----------
feel very very like a big lack of


---------25:39----------
confidence


---------25:40----------
and will need to photoshop the [ __ ] out


---------25:42----------
of their pictures


---------25:44----------
because they're not confident in the way


---------25:46----------
that they look


---------25:48----------
does that what do you think about that


---------25:50----------
yeah i totally agree with that i


---------25:53----------
really don't think that even if i was


---------25:55----------
like


---------25:56----------
even if all my problems were solved like


---------25:58----------
if i thought i was like super pretty rfi


---------26:01----------
like


---------26:01----------
was really good at games that like there


---------26:03----------
wouldn't be other aspects


---------26:05----------
in life that would make that could make


---------26:07----------
me still feel


---------26:08----------
not confident so


---------26:12----------
oh yeah i would even disagree with that


---------26:13----------
just a tiny bit which is that


---------26:15----------
you're assuming that if you were


---------26:17----------
objectively better at league


---------26:18----------
or objectively prettier that your mind


---------26:21----------
would feel


---------26:22----------
not confident about other stuff is that


---------26:24----------
what you're saying


---------26:25----------
possibly yeah and what i'm telling you


---------26:28----------
having worked with a fair number of


---------26:29----------
league pros


---------26:30----------
is that even if you're objectively


---------26:33----------
better you can still lack confidence


---------26:36----------
and even if you're objectively prettier


---------26:38----------
you can still lack confidence


---------26:40----------
yeah so then that begs the question


---------26:42----------
yvonne


---------26:44----------
if you were prettier and you still sort


---------26:46----------
of like if there are


---------26:47----------
people who are prettier than you are


---------26:49----------
that are still lacking a ton of


---------26:50----------
confidence in their appearance


---------26:52----------
even though on paper theoretically they


---------26:54----------
shouldn't then where does that


---------26:56----------
confidence come from


---------27:06----------
i don't know maybe through other things


---------27:10----------
that they


---------27:11----------
are good at because the thing is for me


---------27:14----------
i feel like i'm not good at anything


---------27:16----------
like you know i'm like okay like you


---------27:18----------
know yeah so we can play this game as


---------27:21----------
long as we want to


---------27:23----------
and i can tell you that you are better


---------27:25----------
at me than league


---------27:26----------
that you are prettier than i am and you


---------27:29----------
do a better job at otv than 99 of people


---------27:32----------
that i know


---------27:34----------
and it's not gonna matter right because


---------27:36----------
earlier we already discovered that until


---------27:38----------
you were ready you're gonna swat away


---------27:39----------
what people say


---------27:42----------
and oddly enough i know it sounds kind


---------27:44----------
of weird but like


---------27:48----------
if you really observe people what you


---------27:49----------
find is that they can be anywhere they


---------27:51----------
want to


---------27:52----------
in terms of objective attractiveness but


---------27:54----------
they their confidence can still


---------27:55----------
is almost like independent of that does


---------27:58----------
that make sense


---------27:59----------
yeah so let's try to understand that


---------28:02----------
like what do you think


---------28:03----------
let's dig in yeah okay so how long have


---------28:06----------
you


---------28:06----------
felt uh can you i think you had told me


---------28:10----------
a little bit about like where you grew


---------28:12----------
up and how you grew up


---------28:13----------
but can you tell me a little bit about


---------28:14----------
that again can you refresh my memory


---------28:16----------
yeah so i grew up back in canada


---------28:20----------
in calgary with my parents


---------28:23----------
and i was an only child


---------28:27----------
they were kind of strict on me growing


---------28:29----------
up because i was the only child and i


---------28:31----------
was a girl


---------28:32----------
so my mom very much was very strict


---------28:36----------
and tried to like make like


---------28:40----------
check up on who i was hanging out with


---------28:41----------
all the time and stuff like that but


---------28:43----------
basically how i was raised was um they


---------28:46----------
always tried me


---------28:47----------
obviously like to do well in school um


---------28:52----------
always tried like in chinese school they


---------28:54----------
would always like


---------28:55----------
try to


---------28:58----------
make it so that i get positive


---------29:00----------
reinforcement for getting like first


---------29:02----------
second or third place it's like a top


---------29:03----------
three in the class


---------29:05----------
um so every time i got like a top


---------29:08----------
something i would get like a


---------29:09----------
sort of reward of some sort and then


---------29:13----------
uh i also they also signed me up for


---------29:16----------
like a bunch of tutoring classes for


---------29:18----------
like


---------29:18----------
math and other things i always had to do


---------29:21----------
something that was like a couple grades


---------29:23----------
above


---------29:23----------
or ahead of what i was actually so like


---------29:26----------
grade three i'd be doing like grade five


---------29:28----------
math books or something


---------29:30----------
um but it i


---------29:33----------
feel like in a lot of asian or chinese


---------29:36----------
cultures


---------29:37----------
it's very much like


---------29:41----------
uh work hard like you do what you're


---------29:43----------
supposed to do keep your head down and


---------29:45----------
like you just


---------29:46----------
like try to succeed in life somehow


---------29:49----------
ideally be a doctor


---------29:51----------
or a lawyer so um


---------29:54----------
yeah there's a lot of that and also they


---------29:57----------
always


---------29:58----------
like kind of talk down on you in front


---------30:01----------
of their friends but they praise like


---------30:03----------
the other kids so it's like oh yeah


---------30:05----------
so-and-so is doing like so well in


---------30:06----------
school but


---------30:08----------
uh like yvonne you look at you you never


---------30:10----------
cleaned the house look at this person


---------30:12----------
they're cleaning up after themselves so


---------30:14----------
it's like that kind of thing but for


---------30:16----------
like everything


---------30:17----------
um so i think a lot of it


---------30:21----------
probably did stem from that in terms of


---------30:23----------
if you even if you


---------30:25----------
do do well even if you do get like first


---------30:27----------
second third place whatever it is like


---------30:30----------
you can always either do better or like


---------30:33----------
don't


---------30:34----------
get too ahead of yourself type of thing


---------30:38----------
help me understand don't get too ahead


---------30:40----------
of yourself


---------30:41----------
like don't get too overconfident and


---------30:43----------
then just like


---------30:45----------
think you're like i'm i'm great i'm like


---------30:48----------
doing grade five math right and i get to


---------30:50----------
grade five i'm kind of like i'm chilling


---------30:52----------
and i don't think not


---------30:53----------
like you know progressing or doing


---------30:55----------
anything after that it's kind of like


---------30:57----------
don't get too comfortable like you can


---------31:00----------
still work hard and like try to get


---------31:02----------
ahead


---------31:04----------
yeah i hated it though tell me about


---------31:07----------
what you hated about it


---------31:09----------
oh i just hated doing extra work and


---------31:11----------
math and stuff like i was a kid i just


---------31:13----------
wanted to like


---------31:14----------
you know play games or like go outside


---------31:18----------
or something


---------31:20----------
but instead i had to do all these math


---------31:23----------
pages


---------31:23----------
like and then but at the time it just


---------31:27----------
felt like something i had to do and i


---------31:28----------
just did it it didn't it didn't really


---------31:30----------
feel like i had an option anyway


---------31:32----------
no or i want to watch tv can't watch tv


---------31:39----------
so yvonne this may sound weird but like


---------31:43----------
can you hm hold on let me think about


---------31:45----------
how to ask this


---------31:54----------
so what was it like so i'm actually


---------31:57----------
detecting that you didn't have a choice


---------32:02----------
right yeah i mean i was yeah and had to


---------32:04----------
listen to my parents


---------32:06----------
yeah and so sort of like your feelings


---------32:09----------
didn't matter


---------32:10----------
right and so i know it sounds kind of


---------32:13----------
weird but


---------32:14----------
like how much did you hate doing that


---------32:18----------
ah


---------32:22----------
i didn't like hate it because i don't


---------32:24----------
recall in my memory


---------32:26----------
despising it that much i think i did


---------32:28----------
enjoy


---------32:29----------
like i mean i had nothing else to do if


---------32:32----------
they didn't let me


---------32:33----------
go watch tv or do other things it's like


---------32:35----------
well


---------32:36----------
like i guess i have time to do this you


---------32:39----------
know


---------32:39----------
yeah i don't talk can i toss out what


---------32:42----------
i'm sort of feeling and then you let me


---------32:44----------
know but this is like definitely leading


---------32:46----------
okay so this could be wrong


---------32:47----------
so i'm hearing that you actually hated


---------32:49----------
it a lot


---------32:51----------
but that you felt like you didn't have a


---------32:53----------
choice so there's no point in hating it


---------32:56----------
so you kind of turn down the volume on


---------32:58----------
the hate that you felt


---------33:00----------
yeah i think so i am very good at like


---------33:03----------
minimizing things or yeah


---------33:07----------
like your accomplishments


---------33:11----------
i think i probably and now that you're


---------33:14----------
saying


---------33:14----------
i do minimize in everything in life


---------33:18----------
which is yeah which i think is what do


---------33:21----------
you think


---------33:22----------
what other aspects do you minimize in


---------33:26----------
literally everything i


---------33:30----------
i mean event things that happened to me


---------33:34----------
things that um how i'm feeling


---------33:39----------
uh or


---------33:42----------
[Music]


---------33:44----------
and when you minimize your feelings what


---------33:47----------
do you


---------33:47----------
tell yourself to justify that


---------33:50----------
minimization


---------33:57----------
i'm not really sure i think it's


---------34:00----------
different for everything


---------34:02----------
okay um certain things it's like want to


---------34:05----------
maintain relationships so we'll minimize


---------34:08----------
that


---------34:08----------
another thing might be like


---------34:12----------
this is just what i have to do for like


---------34:14----------
work you know it's like current pain for


---------34:16----------
future gain


---------34:17----------
so it's like yeah i gotta just work hard


---------34:20----------
do this


---------34:21----------
um try to get ahead um


---------34:24----------
uh well i don't know if i should think


---------34:26----------
of trying to get ahead any


---------34:27----------
more i know that's what my parents


---------34:29----------
wanted me to do but actually like


---------34:30----------
that thought itself never crosses my


---------34:33----------
mind almost


---------34:34----------
i never do work to get ahead i do work


---------34:36----------
because i just want to like


---------34:39----------
have a better future but maybe that's


---------34:41----------
the same thing yeah i was going to say


---------34:44----------
current pain for future gains sounds to


---------34:45----------
me like trying to get ahead oh


---------34:48----------
i guess i don't see it it never like


---------34:50----------
registered the same way because i don't


---------34:52----------
think of like trying to get ahead of


---------34:54----------
others i just think of just trying to


---------34:55----------
have a comfortable life later


---------34:59----------
yeah but it's like one is almost i guess


---------35:01----------
they're the same thing but it just


---------35:03----------
one feels like you're trying to like get


---------35:05----------
ahead of other people


---------35:06----------
yeah but i'm not trying to get ahead of


---------35:08----------
other people i just want to like


---------35:09----------
make sure like i'm okay and like my the


---------35:12----------
people i care about will be okay and


---------35:13----------
then


---------35:14----------
yeah i'm not hearing that there's like a


---------35:16----------
race against others but i


---------35:18----------
am hearing a lot about delayed


---------35:20----------
gratification


---------35:22----------
sacrificing the present for the future


---------35:25----------
and how you feel in the moment isn't


---------35:27----------
actually that important


---------35:29----------
because getting ahead not of other


---------35:32----------
people but


---------35:32----------
in your like and i think it's


---------35:34----------
interesting because that's probably part


---------35:35----------
of the reason why you're


---------35:37----------
you know a drama cleanser does that make


---------35:40----------
sense


---------35:41----------
yeah like help me understand


---------35:44----------
i'm seeing some connections there i'm


---------35:45----------
curious do you see any connections


---------35:47----------
between


---------35:48----------
minimizing your own feelings and like


---------35:49----------
being a soothing


---------35:51----------
presence for other people


---------35:55----------
uh yeah there could be a connection help


---------35:58----------
me understand that


---------36:00----------
um i mean i ultimately just want


---------36:04----------
everyone to get along and for things to


---------36:06----------
just be okay because i think when that


---------36:08----------
happens like we're just


---------36:12----------
uh i don't know how to describe but i


---------36:15----------
just


---------36:16----------
think everything's just better i mean


---------36:19----------
yeah i mean that's just ideal right like


---------36:20----------
we ideally we just want everything


---------36:24----------
and everyone to get along yeah and i


---------36:26----------
would even i would venture


---------36:27----------
so let me know if you think this is


---------36:29----------
related but that sometimes like you're


---------36:30----------
willing to set your own feelings aside


---------36:32----------
or minimize your own feelings


---------36:34----------
for the sake of harmony of the group


---------36:38----------
uh yeah that's that's happened but not


---------36:41----------
in like a bad way it's like


---------36:43----------
always in a positive way everyone


---------36:44----------
sacrifices somehow


---------36:46----------
to like for


---------36:49----------
the happiness of the group


---------36:53----------
yeah i i think i didn't i didn't want to


---------36:55----------
imply that it was


---------36:57----------
bad or that the group is like predatory


---------36:59----------
on you and they're like oh my god


---------37:00----------
they're all


---------37:01----------
you know pooping all over you all the


---------37:02----------
time but i i do think that when it comes


---------37:04----------
to successful relationships


---------37:06----------
you know a certain amount of


---------37:08----------
minimization of your own feelings is


---------37:10----------
like


---------37:11----------
generally speaking there's a healthy


---------37:13----------
amount of that


---------37:14----------
and as long as everyone's doing it to


---------37:16----------
the same amount it doesn't become toxic


---------37:19----------
yeah and even sometimes it doesn't have


---------37:21----------
to be to the same amount it's like you


---------37:22----------
know 70 30 is usually like


---------37:24----------
what you can get away with and still


---------37:26----------
maintain a healthy relationship


---------37:28----------
what do you think yeah i mean it's just


---------37:30----------
how like


---------37:31----------
friends you know just like how it works


---------37:34----------
like


---------37:34----------
everyone no one is perfect but it's like


---------37:38----------
how you


---------37:38----------
work together and how you like how much


---------37:41----------
you love each other and everything that


---------37:42----------
like makes it all


---------37:44----------
like work out yeah so


---------37:48----------
i'm gonna just switch gears on you for a


---------37:49----------
second if that's okay and go back to


---------37:51----------
something you said earlier


---------37:52----------
what did it feel like getting first


---------37:54----------
second or third


---------37:57----------
uh it was nice it made me feel


---------38:00----------
like though that i had to like keep


---------38:03----------
maintaining that though so that was


---------38:06----------
pressure


---------38:09----------
and what did it feel like to not get


---------38:11----------
first second or third


---------38:18----------
disappointing


---------38:22----------
can you help me understand more about


---------38:25----------
what


---------38:25----------
would happen if you didn't get first


---------38:27----------
second or third


---------38:30----------
um i don't think


---------38:34----------
anything would have happened but it was


---------38:36----------
just like


---------38:38----------
i was just getting it like somewhere in


---------38:40----------
the top three all the time


---------38:42----------
and then it's like if i didn't get it


---------38:45----------
then it's like


---------38:46----------
what's going on type of thing you know


---------38:48----------
and it's not like


---------38:51----------
i guess maybe if i was never for a


---------38:53----------
second or third maybe that pressure


---------38:54----------
would have never been there


---------38:56----------
but uh okay so


---------39:00----------
did you ever relax


---------39:06----------
like mentally um


---------39:09----------
could you ease up on the gas pedal


---------39:16----------
i don't think i ever really relax


---------39:19----------
except for when i first


---------39:23----------
graduated university and i just like


---------39:27----------
told my mom i was taking a month off to


---------39:29----------
just take a break


---------39:30----------
before looking for work and i digen play


---------39:33----------
league for like a month


---------39:35----------
and i think that was when i relax but


---------39:37----------
prior to that i would say


---------39:38----------
no unless i was ever like on vacation or


---------39:41----------
something i never really like


---------39:43----------
relaxed it was always just school


---------39:46----------
to work to like stressing about finding


---------39:49----------
work


---------39:50----------
after university because it was so


---------39:52----------
difficult to


---------39:53----------
after and then to also


---------39:57----------
moving tally and then all this as well


---------40:00----------
so what


---------40:04----------
let me just think for a second and


---------40:10----------
when did you start to have thoughts


---------40:11----------
about your appearance


---------40:14----------
and being unsatisfied with the way you


---------40:16----------
looked um


---------40:18----------
[Music]


---------40:20----------
i mean i never liked how i looked all my


---------40:23----------
life


---------40:24----------
or never thought i was one of like


---------40:30----------
it sounds oh it sounds very dramatic


---------40:31----------
when i say it like that


---------40:33----------
but it's i just never like grew up


---------40:35----------
thinking like


---------40:36----------
wow i look pretty or i'm good like it


---------40:40----------
just it was never like a


---------40:43----------
oh i like woke up very uh i asked my mom


---------40:47----------
before i was like mom can you honestly


---------40:48----------
tell me


---------40:49----------
how you think i like do you think


---------40:52----------
because i wasn't sure i was a kid


---------40:53----------
basically and i asked her like um


---------40:56----------
do you think i'm like pretty or am i


---------40:59----------
average and my mom was like


---------41:01----------
i think you're average i was like oh


---------41:03----------
okay i'm average


---------41:04----------
and then that was just like a no is and


---------41:07----------
then um


---------41:09----------
i also had a bunch of friends


---------41:13----------
back then and like maybe i also had like


---------41:16----------
a long-term


---------41:17----------
boyfriend at the time as well and


---------41:21----------
so i never got it's not like i got


---------41:22----------
validation through other people telling


---------41:24----------
me i was prettier like through


---------41:25----------
other guys like potentially like going


---------41:29----------
after i was in a long-term relationship


---------41:31----------
and like he always called me


---------41:32----------
ugly girl as a joke i know it sounds


---------41:36----------
weird


---------41:37----------
but it was like a it was like a


---------41:41----------
yeah he just always said that and then


---------41:43----------
um


---------41:46----------
uh i guess


---------41:50----------
i don't know i'm trying to think um


---------41:53----------
i just never felt like i really got


---------41:58----------
or really was pretty i do think i got


---------42:02----------
i looked better when i started in this


---------42:05----------
space because i


---------42:06----------
started caring more about my my


---------42:08----------
appearance a bit more


---------42:09----------
but it's not like i think i just like


---------42:12----------
was prettier than before that's just it


---------42:16----------
that's like the one thing that i got


---------42:19----------
in comparison to before so i gotta ask


---------42:22----------
about the ugly girl thing


---------42:25----------
right i don't even remember that that's


---------42:28----------
so long ago


---------42:30----------
yeah do you have a sense of like


---------42:33----------
what was going on there like was that


---------42:35----------
like a term of endearment where he sort


---------42:37----------
of meant the opposite is sort of what


---------42:39----------
i'm feeling


---------42:40----------
yeah i think he like is trying to mean


---------42:43----------
the opposite but he doesn't say it so he


---------42:46----------
said the other thing


---------42:48----------
to make it easier to say all the time


---------42:52----------
i'm sorry i lost you there like i think


---------42:56----------
he just called me like ugly girl to like


---------42:59----------
tease or


---------43:00----------
try to like be like obviously implied


---------43:03----------
that i'm not but just like


---------43:04----------
saying that yeah because he wouldn't say


---------43:08----------
that if you were really ugly


---------43:10----------
yeah that's what i think was intended


---------43:12----------
when he called me that


---------43:13----------
in our during a relationship how did


---------43:16----------
getting called ugly girl make you feel


---------43:18----------
pretty


---------43:21----------
nope but it it was just like


---------43:26----------
no it didn't make me feel pretty but it


---------43:27----------
didn't make me feel awful at the same


---------43:29----------
time


---------43:30----------
how did that make you feel


---------43:33----------
it felt like it was just like a nickname


---------43:36----------
okay


---------43:37----------
did it make you feel loved


---------43:43----------
not necessarily but i didn't feel like


---------43:46----------
it was really mean at the time either


---------43:49----------
it sounds mean when i say it now but


---------43:51----------
yeah it didn't feel mean


---------43:53----------
at the time how old were you if you


---------43:56----------
don't want me asking when you were in


---------43:57----------
this relationship


---------43:59----------
uh from when i was like 16 to 22.


---------44:02----------
okay so oddly enough i think that makes


---------44:04----------
a lot of sense because i think when


---------44:06----------
you're 16


---------44:07----------
you don't really know how to communicate


---------44:10----------
with yeah


---------44:10----------
a significant other right yeah it's


---------44:14----------
you just haven't learned yet yeah so


---------44:16----------
instead what you do is you tend to


---------44:19----------
say like insulting things in an


---------44:21----------
endearing manner


---------44:23----------
because actually saying something


---------44:25----------
endearing makes you feel like vulnerable


---------44:27----------
and exposed and especially if you're a


---------44:28----------
dude like you have trouble doing that


---------44:32----------
you want to sound tough and you want to


---------44:34----------
keep things playful


---------44:35----------
and you want to keep things i don't know


---------44:38----------
it feels safe somehow


---------44:40----------
to you know


---------44:48----------
um


---------44:52----------
and are you do you mind if i ask about


---------44:54----------
like


---------44:55----------
dating recently mm-hmm


---------44:58----------
like it isn't you it's okay for me to


---------45:01----------
ask or it's not okay for me to ask


---------45:03----------
yeah you can ask okay so are you in a


---------45:05----------
relationship now


---------45:07----------
uh now i am yeah and how do you feel


---------45:11----------
in that relationship


---------45:15----------
uh happy


---------45:18----------
do you feel confident in the way that


---------45:20----------
you look


---------45:23----------
um not necessarily in the way that i


---------45:25----------
look


---------45:27----------
i think i just


---------45:31----------
i don't know i don't feel worse though


---------45:34----------
okay


---------45:35----------
i'm gonna ask you a weird question


---------45:36----------
yvonne is it okay


---------45:38----------
can you be confident and not being very


---------45:41----------
pretty


---------45:44----------
yeah i think i've been i've been trying


---------45:46----------
my best to do that


---------45:47----------
i'm kind of just like going my way


---------45:50----------
through being like


---------45:51----------
you know what i don't look the priest


---------45:52----------
but it's okay like just


---------45:55----------
you know you copy it's like that


---------45:59----------
that's how i feel yeah is that actually


---------46:01----------
how you feel though are you okay


---------46:03----------
okay not being the prettiest yeah i'm so


---------46:06----------
i'm


---------46:06----------
like there are obviously days where i


---------46:08----------
wish i was free i don't expect myself to


---------46:10----------
be the priest


---------46:11----------
at all i think i'm just like trying my


---------46:14----------
best to like get through


---------46:16----------
with just being okay with myself and


---------46:18----------
like i'm


---------46:19----------
there are days where i'm completely okay


---------46:22----------
and obviously there's gonna be days


---------46:23----------
where you feel


---------46:24----------
lower but yeah what's the difference


---------46:28----------
between those days


---------46:30----------
um well the difference


---------46:39----------
i'm not sure uh


---------46:43----------
not very helpful but uh


---------46:47----------
i guess some days i just worry more


---------46:49----------
about my parents those are the days that


---------46:50----------
i don't like us


---------46:51----------
where i'm like i just i yeah so when you


---------46:55----------
worry about your appearance what kind of


---------46:57----------
thoughts do you have


---------47:00----------
like i'm very thankful that there's


---------47:02----------
masks


---------47:03----------
now so i cover like most of my face okay


---------47:07----------
so i know this sounds kind of weird i'm


---------47:08----------
gonna ask you sort of a leading question


---------47:10----------
but


---------47:12----------
i would guess i'm just going to say it i


---------47:15----------
would guess that on the days that you


---------47:16----------
don't


---------47:18----------
feel confident in your appearance you're


---------47:20----------
thinking about what other people think


---------47:24----------
but yeah possibly and on the days where


---------47:27----------
you


---------47:29----------
feel more confident in yourself you're


---------47:31----------
not thinking about what other people


---------47:32----------
think


---------47:34----------
yeah or i care less about what other


---------47:37----------
people think i'm like ah


---------47:38----------
if it doesn't matter some some days have


---------47:41----------
a really


---------47:42----------
like effort mentality and other days i'm


---------47:45----------
like uh


---------47:45----------
yeah i mean i don't wanna i don't like


---------47:48----------
how i look something yeah


---------47:53----------
let me just think for a second so i i


---------47:56----------
feel yvonne


---------47:57----------
i i don't know i mean are you are you


---------47:59----------
wanting to have some kind of like deep


---------48:01----------
emotional catharsis today like do you


---------48:03----------
want me to help you cry on stream


---------48:05----------
is that what we're shooting for oh god


---------48:08----------
i've


---------48:09----------
i was looking at the difference between


---------48:11----------
i actually looked at our last session


---------48:14----------
a little bit before this i was looking


---------48:15----------
like oh wow i


---------48:17----------
look freaking depressed or sad or


---------48:20----------
something i don't know it was so


---------48:22----------
it looked so different to how i feel now


---------48:26----------
compared to before how


---------48:33----------
feel so much better yeah so i i was just


---------48:37----------
at


---------48:38----------
just to i'm gonna ask again do you do


---------48:40----------
you want me to help you have


---------48:43----------
a deep emotional catharsis uh sure


---------48:46----------
i'm up for anything i didn't come back


---------48:48----------
wasn't expecting anything


---------48:49----------
in particular so here's here's the thing


---------48:52----------
i i've got like a fork in the road here


---------48:53----------
okay i'll let you pick okay


---------48:55----------
so we can talk about you know if you


---------48:57----------
want to


---------48:59----------
we can talk about like you know how your


---------49:01----------
parents sort of taught you like


---------49:04----------
that your value is not intrinsic right


---------49:06----------
so what i'm sort of hearing from you is


---------49:08----------
that


---------49:08----------
you can never rest so i think like


---------49:11----------
confidence comes from like


---------49:13----------
the ability to like be where you are


---------49:15----------
right so confidence is not about being


---------49:17----------
prettier actually


---------49:18----------
in fact it's the opposite it's about


---------49:20----------
being okay with however pretty you are


---------49:23----------
whether you're on the ugly end of the


---------49:24----------
spectrum


---------49:24----------
or the freaking beautiful end of the


---------49:26----------
spectrum yeah


---------49:28----------
um and so it's interesting but then then


---------49:30----------
the question of like you know why


---------49:32----------
where did you


---------49:35----------
how did you learn that it's not okay to


---------49:38----------
be you


---------49:39----------
because that's what i think confidence


---------49:40----------
comes back to


---------49:44----------
you know and so so this is where it's


---------49:46----------
kind of interesting because when you


---------49:47----------
talk a little bit about your upbringing


---------49:49----------
and stuff like


---------49:50----------
it was never okay to chill right like


---------49:52----------
you had to work harder because what you


---------49:54----------
were


---------49:55----------
you weren't there yet you always needed


---------49:57----------
to be better


---------49:59----------
got to be better got to be smarter got


---------50:01----------
to do higher level math


---------50:03----------
you know it's never enough like even


---------50:05----------
like basically what i'm hearing is like


---------50:07----------
you were never enough


---------50:10----------
yeah and so we can talk about that right


---------50:13----------
so we can share stories and stuff and


---------50:15----------
you may have a good cry


---------50:17----------
it you know or what we can do is like


---------50:20----------
since you are better i feel like it's


---------50:21----------
sort of almost


---------50:22----------
it feels a touch predatory to me to like


---------50:24----------
go down that direction and like give


---------50:26----------
everyone something fun to watch


---------50:29----------
and and on the flip side is like we


---------50:31----------
could actually like


---------50:32----------
learn something about confidence and


---------50:35----------
help you sort of like


---------50:36----------
understand how it's built so it's sort


---------50:39----------
of like we can be


---------50:39----------
entertaining or we can be helpful and it


---------50:42----------
sort of depends on


---------50:44----------
what you're looking for


---------50:47----------
hmm um


---------50:52----------
yeah uh


---------51:00----------
i don't really know i also feel like


---------51:04----------
at this point i'm not even sure if it's


---------51:07----------
like a


---------51:08----------
nitty-gritty thing that we could get at


---------51:09----------
because i feel like the confidence thing


---------51:11----------
like you said before it's just something


---------51:13----------
i have to probably


---------51:15----------
or like something that i just like have


---------51:17----------
to believe in i don't know if that's


---------51:18----------
not saying that's what you said sorry


---------51:20----------
but like or something i just have to


---------51:21----------
slowly come to a realization of


---------51:23----------
in a sense for other things maybe


---------51:26----------
yes you don't want to believe in it


---------51:29----------
that might that might be like a thing


---------51:31----------
that that's a terrible


---------51:32----------
that's a terrible idea that's what


---------51:34----------
happens when people


---------51:36----------
tell you something that you disagree


---------51:38----------
with is you rely on belief


---------51:42----------
right confidence is not about belief in


---------51:44----------
fact it's the exact opposite


---------51:45----------
it's like knowing that you're good


---------51:49----------
right like like you you can try so hard


---------51:51----------
to believe what everyone tells you about


---------51:53----------
how pretty you are but like


---------51:54----------
if you're confident you don't need to


---------51:56----------
try to believe what other people say


---------51:57----------
like you just know it yourself


---------51:59----------
does that make sense so i don't want you


---------52:01----------
to believe anything i i want you to


---------52:02----------
naturally come to the conclusion


---------52:05----------
that i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------52:07----------
that you may not be the prettiest person


---------52:09----------
on the planet and there ain't no problem


---------52:10----------
with that


---------52:11----------
yeah right i feel like that's just like


---------52:15----------
a work in progress


---------52:16----------
i don't know if that's like is it i


---------52:19----------
think so


---------52:22----------
what do you think yeah i think


---------52:25----------
i think it's manageable like it's not


---------52:27----------
like a huge


---------52:29----------
it doesn't feel like it's a big


---------52:30----------
crippling part of my


---------52:33----------
mental although it does happen pretty


---------52:35----------
frequently but i can still like


---------52:37----------
do everything yeah and still do what i


---------52:40----------
need to do


---------52:41----------
and yvonne are you enough


---------52:46----------
uh


---------52:52----------
in in what way in all of the ways


---------52:58----------
in all the ways i can ask you


---------53:02----------
yeah okay go ahead


---------53:08----------
maybe i'm not sure


---------53:12----------
are you enough for your boyfriend


---------53:18----------
yeah i think so are you enough for otv


---------53:22----------
uh


---------53:26----------
i think i could be more it's not what i


---------53:29----------
asked


---------53:31----------
oh oh um


---------53:37----------
i maybe okay


---------53:40----------
do you feel like you're enough for your


---------53:42----------
boyfriend


---------53:44----------
um yeah but that's only because


---------53:48----------
he's like very this


---------53:51----------
to me like what does that mean


---------53:54----------
um like he's extremely loyal and like


---------53:58----------
sees me in like


---------53:59----------
very positive ways that he would like


---------54:01----------
only


---------54:04----------
like he makes me feel like i am like


---------54:08----------
that's just it just like what i want


---------54:10----------
what he wants


---------54:15----------
okay so i know it sounds kind of weird


---------54:17----------
yvonne


---------54:19----------
that's a little bit concerning because


---------54:22----------
what i'm hearing you say is is


---------54:24----------
that if he was less loyal i wouldn't be


---------54:26----------
enough


---------54:28----------
oh oh


---------54:32----------
because you're doing that thing where i


---------54:34----------
ask you a question about you


---------54:36----------
and you respond with someone else's


---------54:38----------
attitude


---------54:40----------
i see do you see how you did that


---------54:44----------
whether you're enough doesn't depend on


---------54:46----------
your boyfriend's loyalty


---------54:50----------
i feel like it's just different in


---------54:52----------
relationships because


---------54:54----------
you know sometimes you're not enough for


---------54:56----------
some people and sometimes you are first


---------54:58----------
it's just like


---------54:58----------
so it's like that's that's well


---------55:03----------
yeah yeah so so let me just think about


---------55:07----------
what i was saying earlier and whether


---------55:08----------
maybe i was wrong


---------55:15----------
how do you feel about yourself


---------55:20----------
in that relationship um myself in the


---------55:23----------
relationship


---------55:32----------
i think i


---------55:39----------
um i'm not sure how to describe it i


---------55:42----------
guess


---------55:43----------
i just say that i'm i think i'm like a


---------55:46----------
pretty understanding or pretty


---------55:48----------
decent girlfriend


---------55:52----------
are you a catch


---------55:59----------
yes do you really believe that


---------56:06----------
yes good help me understand why


---------56:11----------
what makes you a catch okay well


---------56:15----------
uh that i think i am


---------56:18----------
decently like independent i don't really


---------56:22----------
i like have my own stuff going on so i'm


---------56:25----------
fairly


---------56:27----------
busy and don't need to like have someone


---------56:30----------
like joined at the hip


---------56:32----------
all the time no we all can like do our


---------56:34----------
own thing which i think is healthy


---------56:36----------
um and


---------56:40----------
i think i'm fairly reasonable when it


---------56:42----------
comes to


---------56:44----------
anything general like just talk it out


---------56:46----------
or like discuss or anything


---------56:47----------
um


---------56:52----------
like it's a that's a i don't know so


---------56:55----------
yvonne i'm noticing a couple of


---------56:57----------
different things okay the one


---------56:59----------
one thing i'm noticing is that i i i'm


---------57:01----------
asking you


---------57:02----------
challenging questions that i think


---------57:04----------
you're giving good answers to


---------57:06----------
that you genuinely believe and


---------57:09----------
i'm noticing that you have to work to


---------57:11----------
get there


---------57:13----------
does that make sense i could be wrong so


---------57:15----------
like i like just if i pay attention to


---------57:17----------
your body language and stuff


---------57:19----------
it's like when i ask you the question


---------57:21----------
i'm almost seeing like a flash of one


---------57:23----------
answer in your mind


---------57:25----------
which then creates a war with like


---------57:27----------
another part that has gotten stronger


---------57:30----------
and then you're like deeply


---------57:31----------
uncomfortable for like three seconds and


---------57:32----------
then you come out with a yes i actually


---------57:34----------
like am awesome in this relationship and


---------57:36----------
i am a catch


---------57:37----------
which i do genuinely think you believe


---------57:39----------
but i


---------57:40----------
is is it fair to say that you have to


---------57:41----------
work to get there


---------57:45----------
yeah i mean it feels a little weird


---------57:47----------
being like


---------57:49----------
i'm a [ __ ] catch you know what it is


---------57:52----------
yeah so what


---------57:53----------
i have to be like well i think about it


---------57:55----------
for a second at least think about it you


---------57:57----------
know like


---------57:58----------
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so so here's


---------58:01----------
the thing


---------58:03----------
you'll be confident when it no longer


---------58:05----------
feels weird


---------58:09----------
yeah i think i think so i think it's


---------58:11----------
just like a working


---------58:13----------
yeah so so help help me understand what


---------58:15----------
is that initial feeling of like why is


---------58:17----------
it hard


---------58:18----------
at the very beginning to say yes like


---------58:20----------
what is that


---------58:24----------
because i absolutely agree that this is


---------58:26----------
a work in progress and you seem to have


---------58:28----------
come


---------58:28----------
a long and very healthy way i do


---------58:31----------
genuinely believe that like you see the


---------58:33----------
value you bring to the relationship


---------58:34----------
you're absolutely a catch


---------58:36----------
you know it he knows it we all know it


---------58:38----------
and yet


---------58:39----------
there's that little barrier you have to


---------58:41----------
get over to be


---------58:43----------
secure in that does that make sense


---------58:46----------
help me understand what what's that


---------58:48----------
barrier


---------58:51----------
i just don't wanna


---------58:54----------
for one seem super conceited because i


---------58:57----------
don't feel that way


---------58:59----------
but also too is like um


---------59:03----------
there's always room for improvement or


---------59:06----------
there's always just


---------59:07----------
something you can do better possibly or


---------59:11----------
in any aspect not necessarily a


---------59:12----------
relationship but i just don't think that


---------59:15----------
you should be like oh yeah like i'm


---------59:18----------
chill and i'm good from here on out type


---------59:21----------
of thing because i


---------59:23----------
that's just how i feel because i think


---------59:26----------
um like you don't really grow as a


---------59:29----------
person


---------59:30----------
maybe since if you just feel like you're


---------59:33----------
good


---------59:34----------
so i i'm totally with you like i think


---------59:36----------
that there's and i'm wondering where


---------59:38----------
there's like nuance here


---------59:40----------
like are you okay with where you are


---------59:45----------
actually let me rephrase that can i


---------59:46----------
rephrase that


---------59:48----------
are you um let me think about


---------59:52----------
i was something i wanted to modify in


---------59:53----------
that question


---------59:59----------
not is it oh are you okay with where you


---------60:02----------
are


---------60:05----------
is it okay to come as far as you have


---------60:12----------
yes


---------60:14----------
are you okay with where you are


---------60:18----------
yes


---------60:21----------
so when you feel like you're not


---------60:23----------
confident


---------60:24----------
what do you think the answer to those


---------60:26----------
questions are can you help me understand


---------60:27----------
that


---------60:30----------
um


---------60:30----------
[Music]


---------60:35----------
so when i don't feel as confident i


---------60:38----------
think


---------60:40----------
like other people in my position would


---------60:43----------
have done better


---------60:46----------
i think


---------60:50----------
that what i do is replaceable


---------60:54----------
or that


---------60:58----------
i just don't


---------61:01----------
see myself as that great okay


---------61:05----------
so those yeah i think i think i


---------61:08----------
stumbled upon something let me ask you


---------61:10----------
something are you re


---------61:12----------
can your boyfriends find someone else


---------61:15----------
who's as good as you are


---------61:21----------
i always thought he was like the type of


---------61:23----------
person who could get along with like


---------61:25----------
like so many people he's just that


---------61:29----------
like i mean i think he can meet someone


---------61:33----------
else and also be like


---------61:34----------
oh you're pretty cool type of thing and


---------61:36----------
like they could


---------61:38----------
do well i don't know if they'd be as


---------61:39----------
compatible


---------61:41----------
i think we're very compatible um


---------61:44----------
but i think he could definitely find


---------61:45----------
someone who's great as well


---------61:49----------
yeah that makes a lot of sense i think


---------61:51----------
you know all of us could


---------61:52----------
find some you know where there's not


---------61:54----------
just one person unless you know


---------61:55----------
depending on what you believe that love


---------61:57----------
yeah but or do you feel replaceable in


---------62:00----------
that relationship


---------62:05----------
i think it's different i think because


---------62:07----------
people are so different it's very


---------62:09----------
hard to feel like you could be replaced


---------62:11----------
in a relationship


---------62:13----------
because that's a lot more intimate and


---------62:14----------
there's so many more layers to it


---------62:17----------
um so


---------62:20----------
yeah yeah so then let me ask you this


---------62:23----------
how long


---------62:24----------
how how long have you felt replaceable


---------62:26----------
like how long is the feeling of being


---------62:28----------
replaceable been something that you kind


---------62:30----------
of lived with


---------62:33----------
um


---------62:37----------
it's not necessarily something that's so


---------62:39----------
prevalent like i never think like


---------62:41----------
at all the time like wow i'm i'm so


---------62:43----------
replaceable but i think like


---------62:45----------
the work that i do maybe or


---------62:49----------
i'm not sure it's that like i feel like


---------62:51----------
tasks are very replaceable like


---------62:53----------
you need someone to order something like


---------62:55----------
someone else could do that


---------62:56----------
job sort of thing here here's what i'm


---------62:59----------
here's what i'm kind of detecting so


---------63:00----------
first of all i feel like you're


---------63:02----------
well on your road to becoming confident


---------63:04----------
what do you think


---------63:07----------
yeah i think um it gets better and it's


---------63:10----------
it's not getting worse yep i i see that


---------63:13----------
so here's what i'm here's the way i


---------63:15----------
would describe your lack of confidence


---------63:19----------
so in your brain there is


---------63:22----------
replaceable.exe


---------63:25----------
and on some days your brain is like


---------63:28----------
turn on replaceable.exe and it runs like


---------63:30----------
a script


---------63:32----------
and over time what is happening in your


---------63:35----------
life


---------63:36----------
is that the number of times that you


---------63:38----------
click replaceable.exe appears to be


---------63:40----------
going down


---------63:43----------
what do you think


---------63:46----------
yeah i think so and and so it's not that


---------63:50----------
on a cosmic level you feel like


---------63:52----------
oh my god i'm so blissful like you're


---------63:55----------
starting to


---------63:56----------
see that you have value and like you


---------63:57----------
know in in real relationships


---------64:00----------
but that there are times where like this


---------64:02----------
it's almost like a script that like


---------64:03----------
activates in your mind where your mind


---------64:05----------
is telling you like oh you could have


---------64:06----------
done better


---------64:07----------
someone else could have done it better


---------64:09----------
and it seems like your boyfriend doesn't


---------64:11----------
really like trigger


---------64:12----------
replaceable.exe yeah but there are some


---------64:15----------
circumstances or people or situations


---------64:18----------
that trigger replaceable.exe


---------64:21----------
right so if we think about confidence


---------64:23----------
what i'm sort of detecting


---------64:25----------
in you and also from your story


---------64:28----------
is that like early on like like someone


---------64:31----------
wrote the script for replaceable.exe


---------64:35----------
does that make sense do you have a sense


---------64:39----------
of when that


---------64:40----------
script was written or how it got written


---------64:49----------
i think so can you help me understand


---------64:51----------
that or explain that to me


---------64:55----------
um


---------65:05----------
i think it's stemmed from


---------65:10----------
how


---------65:15----------
it's something a little more complicated


---------65:18----------
but i don't


---------65:22----------
know if you follow like


---------65:26----------
a bunch of the drama and stuff that's


---------65:28----------
happened in the past


---------65:31----------
but um


---------65:36----------
i think at some point i was going to


---------65:40----------
leave otv and as i was going through


---------65:44----------
like the job description and everything


---------65:48----------
everything that i was listing in the job


---------65:51----------
description


---------65:51----------
felt very uh like someone else could do


---------65:55----------
this


---------65:58----------
and i remember like that was a really


---------66:01----------
sad time for me because


---------66:05----------
yeah it just felt like


---------66:09----------
someone else could do it


---------66:13----------
but it was like a position that i valued


---------66:15----------
a lot


---------66:21----------
so i thought we were going down the


---------66:25----------
non-emotional


---------66:27----------
route sorry


---------66:30----------
that i'm talking about maybe my time of


---------66:33----------
the month is coming you know


---------66:34----------
i did a little emotional it's sure it


---------66:38----------
started coming in the last 60 seconds


---------66:41----------
it kind of just random yeah we came


---------66:44----------
you're just you're over he's like boom


---------66:46----------
ovulation time here we go yeah


---------66:48----------
maybe so i i want you to pay attention


---------66:50----------
to that feeling yvonne


---------66:52----------
like remember how you felt


---------66:56----------
right and like what i want you to really


---------66:58----------
think about is like in your mind


---------67:00----------
whether when i ask you are you enough


---------67:02----------
for your boyfriend


---------67:05----------
whether that's the lump that kind of


---------67:07----------
rises up


---------67:08----------
and then you're actually like no you


---------67:10----------
don't belong here


---------67:11----------
i'm you don't belong here but is that


---------67:15----------
like


---------67:16----------
the quality of the feeling that kind of


---------67:18----------
comes to the surface


---------67:20----------
does that make sense


---------67:24----------
is that what it is


---------67:28----------
i can try asking you again


---------67:31----------
uh like sorry just to


---------67:35----------
i guess re-ask the questions to make


---------67:37----------
sure i got it right it's like


---------67:39----------
do i belong here type of feeling when i


---------67:42----------
ask you are you enough for your


---------67:44----------
boyfriend remember how we talked about


---------67:47----------
you come to the answer that yeah i'm


---------67:50----------
enough i'm great it's awesome


---------67:52----------
we're chilling it's all good but


---------67:56----------
in order to get to that you had to do a


---------67:58----------
little bit of work right you had to like


---------68:00----------
move past something


---------68:01----------
is that fair yeah so what i'm curious


---------68:04----------
about is that thing that you


---------68:06----------
moved past does it feel


---------68:10----------
look taste or smell


---------68:13----------
like what you felt when you were going


---------68:14----------
over the otv job description


---------68:22----------
um


---------68:24----------
[Music]


---------68:27----------
i don't know if this answers it but i


---------68:29----------
feel


---------68:30----------
like now there are fewer people


---------68:33----------
who can do like what's listed in the job


---------68:37----------
description


---------68:38----------
um but i think maybe it just takes more


---------68:41----------
of like


---------68:44----------
there's just different aspects to it i


---------68:46----------
guess like


---------68:47----------
that i do believe that there is


---------68:49----------
something some value that i bring that's


---------68:52----------
more


---------68:52----------
but that's just also based off my


---------68:56----------
friends and my roommates that constitute


---------68:59----------
like constantly


---------69:01----------
reassuring me and validating on it too


---------69:05----------
so like as time goes on i like believe


---------69:08----------
it more and more


---------69:10----------
yeah i think that makes sense so i'm


---------69:12----------
gonna ask you once again about the job


---------69:14----------
description so like


---------69:15----------
that feeling that you had when you were


---------69:17----------
looking at it can you tell me a little


---------69:19----------
bit more about


---------69:20----------
what was happening what was in your head


---------69:22----------
or what you were feeling


---------69:25----------
um


---------69:28----------
well when i was looking over it it just


---------69:30----------
felt sad because it's like


---------69:32----------
oh like you're leaving


---------69:36----------
this stuff behind for like someone else


---------69:39----------
to do and they're all stuff that you


---------69:40----------
used to do


---------69:41----------
and


---------69:45----------
i don't know it's just like that just it


---------69:48----------
was a sad feeling that's all i could


---------69:49----------
really attribute to it there's not


---------69:52----------
a whole lot other than it was a really


---------69:55----------
difficult time and i was


---------69:57----------
it wasn't even about the job description


---------69:59----------
i think it was


---------70:00----------
more like leaving the people that i'd


---------70:03----------
grown


---------70:04----------
really attached to and that i value a


---------70:06----------
lot because that's also part of the job


---------70:09----------
um but


---------70:13----------
yeah is


---------70:17----------
i just remember thinking like i


---------70:21----------
wouldn't really have a general direction


---------70:23----------
to walk towards anymore


---------70:26----------
like if i at twitchcon or any event


---------70:29----------
i always have like a general direction i


---------70:31----------
always walk towards


---------70:33----------
like otv


---------70:37----------
and that's like a very i was thinking


---------70:40----------
about that a lot i remember


---------70:44----------
crying to


---------70:47----------
an old housemate of mine about that


---------70:50----------
about how like


---------70:52----------
there's no one or like i wouldn't have a


---------70:54----------
general direction to walk to anymore


---------70:58----------
and then it's fine because he said that


---------71:02----------
at the very end when he was moving out


---------71:04----------
that he thinks back to what i said a lot


---------71:08----------
because now it applies to him


---------71:18----------
wow


---------71:24----------
when you say general direction to walk


---------71:26----------
towards can you help me understand that


---------71:30----------
uh it's almost like you go to an event


---------71:34----------
you see like a group of people you're


---------71:35----------
comfortable with and you naturally would


---------71:36----------
gravitate and like walk towards them


---------71:38----------
to hang out talk it's


---------71:43----------
it's just like feeling like you belong


---------71:45----------
or that you're involved somewhere


---------71:47----------
in the group yeah i think i know what


---------71:50----------
you're talking about


---------71:52----------
it's the exact opposite of going to a


---------71:54----------
party and not knowing anyone


---------71:56----------
yeah right you're just sitting there


---------71:58----------
like maybe you've got a drink in your


---------72:00----------
hand and you're like i don't have anyone


---------72:01----------
to talk to do people think i'm weird


---------72:03----------
i don't know like should i approach


---------72:04----------
these people sound like they're having


---------72:06----------
fun would i be intruding


---------72:08----------
it's the relief of all of those feelings


---------72:12----------
yeah a lot of comfort and


---------72:16----------
just feeling like safe or like


---------72:20----------
yeah comfortable


---------72:28----------
i'm not really hearing anything about


---------72:30----------
confidence there


---------72:33----------
i think it kind of went off a bit um


---------72:37----------
but yeah it's different


---------72:41----------
i mean did you feel like they were ready


---------72:44----------
to discard you


---------72:48----------
i'm not trying to trash them or anything


---------72:50----------
like that i'm just curious i'm just


---------72:51----------
trying to think about


---------72:52----------
how that could relate to someone's


---------72:53----------
confidence and the best that i can come


---------72:55----------
up with is like


---------72:57----------
if you you know if they were like if


---------72:59----------
they could just you know


---------73:01----------
you could move on and it wouldn't make a


---------73:03----------
big difference to them like they're fine


---------73:04----------
like it's like whatever


---------73:06----------
um no


---------73:09----------
no i think it was like


---------73:14----------
i don't feel that way right now


---------73:18----------
i think back then obviously i felt like


---------73:20----------
i was leaving so sad


---------73:21----------
but they actually made it


---------73:25----------
very like


---------73:28----------
they didn't seem like they really wanted


---------73:31----------
me to go


---------73:38----------
yvonne do you have any questions for me


---------73:43----------
[Music]


---------73:45----------
in um of anything anything like yeah i


---------73:48----------
feel like we've covered a lot of


---------73:49----------
different


---------73:50----------
ground and and i was about to sort of


---------73:52----------
share what i've learned from you but


---------73:54----------
kind of before we go there


---------73:55----------
i was just curious whether you wanted to


---------73:57----------
talk more about something


---------73:58----------
or um you know if there were


---------74:02----------
any anything that i should have asked


---------74:04----------
more about or you wanted to talk more


---------74:05----------
about


---------74:11----------
not off the top of my head necessarily


---------74:15----------
but can i go to the bathroom quickly


---------74:17----------
yeah absolutely


---------74:18----------
okay thank you i'm sorry i have a really


---------74:20----------
small bladder


---------74:28----------
it never it never oh


---------74:32----------
testing testing one two three


---------74:36----------
oh there we go okay it never ceases to


---------74:39----------
amaze me how um


---------74:41----------
how people apologize for needing to use


---------74:44----------
the restroom


---------74:48----------
i think i lagged there for a second chat


---------75:07----------
sorry dr k i have a kidney yeah man how


---------75:10----------
dare you


---------75:28----------
yeah right


---------75:44----------
i'm just reading chat i guess i should


---------75:46----------
be responding i i really


---------75:47----------
um there's so much interesting stuff


---------75:49----------
here


---------75:50----------
blatter related stuff um


---------75:55----------
yeah it's weird right like in school how


---------75:56----------
we we kind of we talk about


---------75:59----------
you know like using the restroom is like


---------76:01----------
punishable it's like a punishment it's


---------76:03----------
like


---------76:03----------
i remember when i was in middle school


---------76:05----------
like we would have a certain amount of


---------76:06----------
time to like


---------76:07----------
go to our locker and then presumably pee


---------76:12----------
and we had these like gigantic textbooks


---------76:15----------
so you really had to map out your day


---------76:17----------
because like you know peeing a couple


---------76:18----------
times a day would be a real problem


---------76:20----------
because every


---------76:21----------
class you have to go back to your locker


---------76:22----------
put away like one textbook grab the next


---------76:24----------
textbook it was idiotic


---------76:33----------
i'm back welcome back so


---------76:36----------
yvonne here's what i was kind of


---------76:37----------
thinking is um


---------76:39----------
you know so it seems i understand that


---------76:42----------
you've got


---------76:43----------
sometimes you've got like confidence


---------76:45----------
issues but it seems to me like um


---------76:48----------
you're working on those and they're


---------76:50----------
growing i was thinking actually


---------76:53----------
since you're so sometimes when people


---------76:55----------
have confidence issues there's like some


---------76:57----------
kind of root


---------76:58----------
thing which we can kind of talk a little


---------77:00----------
bit about i think we could sort of touch


---------77:02----------
on that a little bit


---------77:03----------
but what i was actually feeling from


---------77:04----------
today is is we can sort of almost put


---------77:07----------
together a lot of what you've shared


---------77:08----------
about your


---------77:10----------
journey so far and see if we can


---------77:12----------
understand a few principles


---------77:15----------
about where confidence comes from so


---------77:18----------
that


---------77:18----------
as you continue to walk this journey you


---------77:20----------
can maybe be a little bit more mindful


---------77:22----------
or focused about building your


---------77:24----------
confidence


---------77:25----------
how does that sound yeah sounds good


---------77:28----------
okay so it may not be i know we had a


---------77:30----------
little bit of emotion there but it may


---------77:31----------
not be like


---------77:32----------
oh my god the reason you're not


---------77:33----------
confident at the age of seven like


---------77:36----------
you you know someone like yeah like


---------77:38----------
there's a dog that was walking down the


---------77:40----------
street


---------77:40----------
and it was about to lick your hand but


---------77:42----------
it went and it preferred another human


---------77:45----------
and then i don't know if my brain can


---------77:47----------
even like i don't even know if i


---------77:48----------
remember


---------77:49----------
like a freaking story like i could even


---------77:52----------
pinpoint that yeah


---------77:53----------
like that so so we'll get to that right


---------77:56----------
so we'll


---------77:56----------
so the first thing is i want you to just


---------77:59----------
look at your mind


---------78:01----------
and recognize that sometimes people say


---------78:03----------
things to you


---------78:05----------
and your mind like swats them away


---------78:08----------
right or it like makes excuses and it's


---------78:11----------
like oh this person is saying this


---------78:12----------
because he is loyal


---------78:14----------
this person is saying this because they


---------78:16----------
are my friends


---------78:17----------
that what they're saying doesn't have as


---------78:20----------
much merit


---------78:21----------
is like the fact that they are the ones


---------78:23----------
that sang it


---------78:24----------
and so it's almost like your mind kind


---------78:26----------
of like discounts it right


---------78:29----------
um the second thing is that we do have a


---------78:31----------
tendency generally speaking to


---------78:33----------
undervalue what we're natural at


---------78:36----------
so like you know you may think that this


---------78:39----------
is something that anyone can do but like


---------78:41----------
really it's not the case


---------78:43----------
like a lot of people may be able to


---------78:45----------
theoretically do what's in the job


---------78:47----------
description but to do it like


---------78:49----------
as well as you do and as


---------78:53----------
you know because people can do it and


---------78:54----------
still be like complete pains in the ass


---------78:57----------
mm-hmm does that make sense like i it's


---------79:00----------
hard to describe but like i


---------79:02----------
you know i think it's very easy to


---------79:03----------
undervalue like what people are natural


---------79:05----------
at


---------79:07----------
um and then the third thing is i want to


---------79:09----------
point out that you know when you were


---------79:10----------
talking about like


---------79:12----------
when you feel more confident there seems


---------79:15----------
to be a correlation between


---------79:18----------
when you think about other people and


---------79:20----------
when you don't think about other people


---------79:22----------
so when you compare yourself more the


---------79:24----------
confidence goes down


---------79:26----------
when you observe like when the focus


---------79:28----------
when the


---------79:29----------
telescope is pointed towards you


---------79:32----------
confidence will actually increase


---------79:34----------
and when the telescope is pointed


---------79:36----------
towards other people it'll actually


---------79:38----------
decrease


---------79:39----------
so that can look like comparison or it


---------79:41----------
can look like what will people think


---------79:43----------
oh my god it's so nice that i have to


---------79:45----------
wear a mask because now people don't


---------79:46----------
have to look at my face


---------79:48----------
right it's kind of a brutal thought but


---------79:50----------
it's like literally what your mind will


---------79:51----------
say


---------79:52----------
the point though is that like confidence


---------79:55----------
you know it's kind of


---------79:56----------
people say stuff oh that confidence


---------79:58----------
comes from within like literally it does


---------79:59----------
come with it from within


---------80:00----------
yeah and then people get confused


---------80:02----------
because but people don't understand like


---------80:03----------
the mechanism of how do i get the


---------80:05----------
confidence within


---------80:06----------
and literally it is like the more time


---------80:08----------
your mind spends thinking about other


---------80:10----------
people


---------80:11----------
are thinking about what other people


---------80:12----------
think the less time you will be


---------80:13----------
confident


---------80:15----------
now you also said that you exist in a


---------80:17----------
space


---------80:18----------
where there's a lot of inherent


---------80:20----------
comparison


---------80:22----------
right and that's tough so what i see and


---------80:24----------
this is like what we found so we have


---------80:26----------
you know a content creator program at


---------80:29----------
healthy gamer and what we've found


---------80:31----------
is that absolutely like the more that we


---------80:34----------
can help content creators


---------80:36----------
see themselves as like individuals as


---------80:38----------
opposed to like comparisons like the


---------80:40----------
more that we can help content creators


---------80:42----------
not think about what other people are


---------80:44----------
doing or how this person oh my god this


---------80:46----------
person is completely blowing up


---------80:48----------
and even though i'm growing at a steady


---------80:50----------
clip i feel bad about myself because i'm


---------80:52----------
not blowing up


---------80:54----------
so there's like a lot of comparison that


---------80:57----------
will


---------80:58----------
negatively impact your confidence the


---------81:02----------
next thing to kind of think a little bit


---------81:03----------
about is that i do


---------81:04----------
think there's something about


---------81:07----------
you not being enough or replaceable


---------81:11----------
which was like definitely like it's just


---------81:13----------
part of the asian upbringing


---------81:16----------
you know and and it's funny like you


---------81:18----------
kind of said


---------81:19----------
you know like it's like be a doctor or a


---------81:21----------
lawyer otherwise


---------81:22----------
you don't deserve to be confident like


---------81:24----------
you were literally taught that


---------81:27----------
you get to chill when you get into


---------81:28----------
medical school and not a day before


---------81:31----------
i mean literally my dad told me when i


---------81:33----------
was nine years old


---------81:34----------
and my brother was 12. he was like one


---------81:37----------
of y'all is gonna be a doctor and one of


---------81:38----------
y'all is gonna be a lawyer


---------81:41----------
and then i used like that was not like


---------81:42----------
he wasn't kidding


---------81:44----------
yeah he was like those are the options


---------81:47----------
and also that we both couldn't choose


---------81:49----------
the same thing because he's like


---------81:51----------
together we will be the uber family


---------81:54----------
because of y'all will be a doctor and


---------81:56----------
one of you all will be a lawyer so we


---------81:57----------
will have both


---------81:59----------
boxes checked so if someone runs into


---------82:02----------
legal trouble one of the two y'all can


---------82:03----------
handle that and if someone runs into


---------82:05----------
medical trouble one of the two y'all


---------82:06----------
will handle that that is that's crazy


---------82:10----------
and so yeah he became a lawyer i became


---------82:14----------
a doctor oh my god


---------82:16----------
that works that just works you don't


---------82:19----------
give him another option


---------82:20----------
it works uh yeah i think it i don't i


---------82:24----------
actually don't really think the two were


---------82:25----------
related


---------82:27----------
but i will say like so when i was in med


---------82:29----------
school people would ask me right because


---------82:30----------
when you interview for med school


---------82:32----------
they're like why do you want to become a


---------82:34----------
doctor and i would tell them this story


---------82:36----------
and then i would say my brother was


---------82:37----------
older so he chose he got to choose first


---------82:40----------
and he went to law school so here i am


---------82:42----------
and then we'd laugh about it and then i


---------82:44----------
wouldn't have to answer the question why


---------82:46----------
i was there because i didn't have a good


---------82:47----------
reason


---------82:50----------
okay that's good that's a good one yeah


---------82:53----------
um but but i i do think i see this a lot


---------82:56----------
where people like struggle with


---------82:57----------
being confident and because like this is


---------83:00----------
the this is the lesson you were taught


---------83:01----------
right like you were taught like


---------83:03----------
they're like there's like the best


---------83:05----------
they're the perfect kids


---------83:07----------
they're the great kids and they're the


---------83:09----------
good kids


---------83:10----------
and whether you're confident is


---------83:13----------
determined by which


---------83:14----------
group you fall into right and so the


---------83:17----------
interesting thing is that let's say for


---------83:19----------
a second i'm not going to try to be mean


---------83:21----------
or anything here but i'm going to say


---------83:22----------
something that maybe some people will


---------83:23----------
find mean


---------83:24----------
let's say you're not the prettiest


---------83:26----------
person on twitch


---------83:28----------
which i will agree with like if you were


---------83:30----------
to say


---------83:31----------
dr k i don't think i'm the prettiest


---------83:33----------
person on twitch i would say yvonne i


---------83:35----------
think you are correct


---------83:36----------
yeah and the issue though is that if you


---------83:39----------
were to tell me like


---------83:40----------
dr k i wasn't perfect in school i will


---------83:43----------
also agree with you


---------83:44----------
if you were not valedictorian you were


---------83:45----------
not perfect that's fine you were


---------83:48----------
you were not the best i will agree with


---------83:50----------
you


---------83:51----------
i will not try to convince you otherwise


---------83:53----------
the difference is i will say


---------83:55----------
that's actually okay that you don't have


---------83:58----------
to be the prettiest person on twitch


---------83:59----------
you don't have to be perfect and that


---------84:02----------
actually if you want to give like the


---------84:03----------
most


---------84:04----------
value you have in the world and the most


---------84:07----------
benefit you can give to the world


---------84:09----------
is not by living up to an external


---------84:11----------
standard but being


---------84:12----------
confident in who you are and there's an


---------84:15----------
interesting point


---------84:16----------
here because it doesn't mean that you


---------84:17----------
can't be better that you shouldn't be


---------84:18----------
better i don't think you should chill


---------84:19----------
this is the other thing that


---------84:20----------
you know the asian upbringing gives you


---------84:22----------
is the idea that unless you're grinding


---------84:24----------
you're chilling it's like


---------84:25----------
there's two groups there's the people


---------84:28----------
who are two years ahead in math


---------84:30----------
and they're the deadbeat potheads and


---------84:32----------
there's nothing in the middle


---------84:34----------
and if you're not one you're the other


---------84:36----------
does that make sense


---------84:37----------
yeah right that's the way we were raised


---------84:40----------
it's like if you're not


---------84:41----------
ahead you're behind yeah like it's weird


---------84:44----------
it's like there's no


---------84:45----------
there's no like being just where you are


---------84:47----------
and it's like okay to be where you are


---------84:49----------
yeah it's just and and so i think it's


---------84:52----------
kind of interesting because like in your


---------84:53----------
mind you're gonna have all these


---------84:55----------
different like exes it's gonna be like


---------84:57----------
you know when you when you it's going to


---------85:00----------
be your boot order and like your


---------85:01----------
your processes that boot up when you


---------85:03----------
load up windows and there's going to be


---------85:05----------
a lot of that crap in there


---------85:07----------
and so when it comes to confidence i


---------85:08----------
know it sounds kind of weird but like


---------85:10----------
there's a part of me that says you know


---------85:11----------
the next time you feel like


---------85:13----------
you're not very pretty instead of trying


---------85:15----------
to convince yourself that you should be


---------85:17----------
prettier or that these people are


---------85:19----------
prettier than you or whatever


---------85:20----------
i would encourage you to think a little


---------85:22----------
bit about what's wrong with that


---------85:26----------
right like i would question the


---------85:27----------
structure that your mind is telling you


---------85:29----------
because i think when it comes to people


---------85:31----------
like your boyfriend


---------85:32----------
when it comes to the people who really


---------85:33----------
care about you like you don't need to be


---------85:35----------
prettier


---------85:36----------
like what do you think what does your


---------85:38----------
mind say when i say that


---------85:42----------
yeah i agree i just uh


---------85:46----------
it would just be nice to be so


---------85:49----------
i'm going to the gym and like all this


---------85:52----------
stuff to try to like


---------85:53----------
at least feel better about myself which


---------85:55----------
i do so going to the gym


---------85:57----------
has actually recently been very nice


---------85:59----------
because i at least feel like


---------86:01----------
no matter what you go to the gym you


---------86:02----------
make progress you never like


---------86:04----------
regress so so i think that's that's like


---------86:07----------
super


---------86:08----------
healthy and i would encourage that


---------86:10----------
because it's not about living


---------86:11----------
because the interesting thing there is


---------86:13----------
that it's not about living to a standard


---------86:14----------
right it's just saying


---------86:16----------
hey like i can that's where confidence


---------86:18----------
comes from it's sort of like looking at


---------86:20----------
your life and saying like


---------86:21----------
this could be better i'm gonna do


---------86:23----------
something about that


---------86:25----------
and so the interesting thing is that the


---------86:27----------
confidence doesn't come from your


---------86:29----------
progress at the gym


---------86:30----------
the confidence actually comes from


---------86:32----------
because like if you're thinking about


---------86:34----------
progress at the gym i know it sounds


---------86:35----------
kind of weird but then you're thinking


---------86:36----------
about other people


---------86:37----------
oh if i go to the gym three times a week


---------86:38----------
then people will think i'm sexy


---------86:40----------
as long as that's the thought process in


---------86:42----------
your mind you actually won't gain


---------86:43----------
confidence


---------86:44----------
yeah and that's not it


---------86:48----------
for me at least that's


---------86:51----------
um i feel better i feel healthier


---------86:54----------
i feel like uh


---------86:59----------
it's it's just like having the


---------87:00----------
discipline that makes me feel


---------87:02----------
good that i went is


---------87:05----------
like the battle is really just get


---------87:08----------
getting up and going and leaving your


---------87:10----------
house so when i already do that i feel


---------87:12----------
better


---------87:13----------
and then also just like you feel


---------87:15----------
yourself making progress or getting


---------87:17----------
stronger because it's


---------87:17----------
visible and then so like that feels


---------87:20----------
really good


---------87:21----------
so who are you thinking about where is


---------87:23----------
the telescope pointed when you go to the


---------87:25----------
gym


---------87:27----------
um not thinking about other people


---------87:30----------
absolutely and that's why it leads to


---------87:33----------
confidence


---------87:34----------
and i've i've worked like so the let me


---------87:36----------
just think about this for a second


---------87:40----------
one of the hardest if not the hardest


---------87:42----------
patients


---------87:43----------
i have ever worked with are people who


---------87:46----------
are bodybuilders with body dysmorphic


---------87:48----------
disorder


---------87:50----------
so like these are people that like no


---------87:52----------
matter how like it is the


---------87:55----------
like it's hard to describe but is like


---------87:59----------
it is the the mental illness that is


---------88:01----------
like the hardest to displace


---------88:04----------
like i can convince psychotic people


---------88:06----------
that they're wrong i can convince


---------88:07----------
depressed people that


---------88:08----------
they should live i can even convince


---------88:11----------
from time to time manic people that they


---------88:13----------
have not figured out


---------88:14----------
you know the grand unified theory of


---------88:16----------
physics the one person that i have never


---------88:19----------
succeeded in convincing


---------88:20----------
is like the bodybuilder with body


---------88:22----------
dysmorphic disorder no matter how hard


---------88:24----------
i've tried i cannot make a dent


---------88:27----------
that despite being one of the most


---------88:29----------
absurdly chiseled people on the planet


---------88:31----------
that it is enough and it's so weird


---------88:35----------
it's like the hardest thing to treat


---------88:39----------
like i feel pretty confident treating


---------88:40----------
just about everything else but like


---------88:42----------
body dysmorphia specifically in body


---------88:44----------
even women with body dysmorphia i do a


---------88:45----------
pretty good job


---------88:46----------
it's like men with body dysmorphia that


---------88:48----------
like it's impo like


---------88:49----------
as long as they're thinking about the


---------88:50----------
other person they can be in the best


---------88:52----------
shape of their life which is the other


---------88:53----------
interesting thing about confidence is


---------88:55----------
that as long as you're thinking about


---------88:57----------
becoming prettier you're not going to be


---------88:58----------
confident


---------89:00----------
right so this is a very common


---------89:02----------
misconception about confidence is that


---------89:03----------
people think that confidence comes from


---------89:05----------
achievement or success


---------89:07----------
what do you think


---------89:11----------
i mean it could help i just don't think


---------89:13----------
it's like the one


---------89:16----------
like solving factor i guess yeah


---------89:20----------
which which i and i think it can help


---------89:22----------
too


---------89:23----------
but the interesting thing is when people


---------89:24----------
chase confidence what they chase


---------89:27----------
if they're looking to be more confident


---------89:29----------
what they chase is achievement


---------89:31----------
right they think oh if i achieve then i


---------89:33----------
will be more confident


---------89:35----------
which is missing the point because


---------89:36----------
that's actually what it actually does is


---------89:38----------
places


---------89:39----------
your value in yourself to be conditional


---------89:43----------
on your success and that actually is the


---------89:46----------
opposite of confidence


---------89:48----------
so like your parents basically you know


---------89:52----------
i'm not trying to bash your parents here


---------89:53----------
my parents were sort of the same way


---------89:55----------
right it's asian parents and they were


---------89:57----------
like or jewish parents or nigerian


---------89:59----------
parents it's


---------90:00----------
it's not exclusively asian as well yeah


---------90:02----------
but they were basically like


---------90:04----------
you know you we will be proud of you not


---------90:06----------
based on who you are as a person but


---------90:08----------
based on your achievements


---------90:10----------
and so that's where like asian people


---------90:12----------
like i've worked with thousands of eight


---------90:14----------
not thousands hundreds of you know asian


---------90:16----------
and indian kids


---------90:18----------
who like they are taught like they have


---------90:19----------
troubles with confidence because they


---------90:21----------
are taught that your value as a human


---------90:22----------
being is dependent on your performance


---------90:26----------
and so i think like that's where it


---------90:27----------
started and then i think you have had a


---------90:29----------
couple of these other


---------90:30----------
experiences where you felt like


---------90:32----------
replaceable and then the third thing if


---------90:34----------
i wanted to understand your confidence


---------90:35----------
was that i think you live in an


---------90:37----------
environment that causes you


---------90:38----------
your mind to compare more yeah and that


---------90:41----------
the more you look towards yourself your


---------90:42----------
confidence will grow


---------90:44----------
and the last bit that i would say is


---------90:46----------
just pay attention to the next time


---------90:48----------
you feel you notice that your mind is


---------90:50----------
like swatting things away


---------90:52----------
and then like the more that you look and


---------90:54----------
observe that within yourself because


---------90:55----------
when we asked you how did you gain


---------90:57----------
confidence you were like oh i started to


---------90:58----------
observe myself


---------91:00----------
i started to make my own observations


---------91:02----------
instead of thinking about like i started


---------91:03----------
like watching players and be like


---------91:05----------
these people suck right


---------91:08----------
and so the more you make your own


---------91:10----------
observations


---------91:12----------
the better off you're going to be


---------91:13----------
because if you really think about it


---------91:15----------
when you swat away someone's compliment


---------91:18----------
you're not making an observation


---------91:21----------
it's a conclusion that you're putting


---------91:24----------
forth does that make sense do you


---------91:25----------
understand what i'm saying there


---------91:28----------
it's like a reflexive pushing something


---------91:30----------
away without actually like objectively


---------91:32----------
looking at it


---------91:34----------
yeah like a reflex exactly


---------91:37----------
so it's not like it's a reflex it's not


---------91:40----------
an observation


---------91:42----------
and so the more that you observe the


---------91:45----------
more you go to the gym


---------91:46----------
the more that you look at yourself like


---------91:48----------
the more your confidence will grow


---------91:50----------
and i think you're well on your way


---------91:53----------
what do you think yeah i think so


---------91:56----------
i think like just doing small things


---------91:59----------
along the way


---------92:00----------
definitely helps and it's not like i'm


---------92:02----------
instantly gonna


---------92:05----------
be there but i'm getting there i think


---------92:07----------
and just


---------92:08----------
like i'm i'm not trying to be like super


---------92:11----------
mega confident


---------92:12----------
like i can accomplish anything but i


---------92:15----------
just want to be


---------92:15----------
more than where i am right now and i


---------92:17----------
think that's like achievable


---------92:20----------
are you okay with where you are right


---------92:21----------
now um


---------92:23----------
i'm fairly okay with it um i would like


---------92:26----------
to be


---------92:28----------
like improve overall in general but like


---------92:32----------
other than that like


---------92:34----------
i can't complain too much


---------92:38----------
so yvonne you sound confident to me


---------92:43----------
i do yeah


---------92:48----------
well maybe right now


---------92:52----------
do you do you feel confident


---------92:55----------
uh i mean not necessarily


---------92:59----------
but uh do you feel a lack of confidence


---------93:04----------
it comes in waves like


---------93:08----------
yeah so i i feel very like


---------93:12----------
normal right now there's not like a


---------93:14----------
fluctuation


---------93:15----------
not like up or down very yeah so i know


---------93:18----------
it sounds weird but it's that normality


---------93:21----------
which i think is actually the essence of


---------93:22----------
confidence


---------93:24----------
oh you know


---------93:28----------
it sounds kind of weird but it's like


---------93:32----------
as you go into different places like


---------93:34----------
when you meet your boyfriend


---------93:36----------
and you feel normal like


---------93:39----------
that's what a healthy relationship looks


---------93:41----------
like right like that's how you feel


---------93:44----------
like it's not feeling is if your mind is


---------93:47----------
like oh i should be prettier or


---------93:49----------
i'm hot [ __ ] he is so lucky to have me


---------93:51----------
like both of those like one of those is


---------93:53----------
ego


---------93:54----------
one of those is a lack of confidence


---------93:57----------
yeah


---------93:59----------
which he may be i mean it sounds seems


---------94:00----------
like he's a lucky dude tbh


---------94:06----------
yeah yeah i'll show him this clip


---------94:10----------
what do you think oh i mean i think i'm


---------94:14----------
lucky too


---------94:15----------
i mean i'm like just as lucky so as soon


---------94:17----------
as i said that you crossed your arms how


---------94:19----------
are you feeling did it pop up again


---------94:23----------
um i don't know because it could just be


---------94:26----------
embarrassing


---------94:27----------
because i complimented you or it could


---------94:29----------
be like which one was it um


---------94:32----------
was it an awesome oh stop it


---------94:35----------
i mean i think like i think also like


---------94:38----------
it's not just


---------94:39----------
me you know i think he's i'm also or i


---------94:42----------
think i'm also very lucky because he's


---------94:43----------
also like why the [ __ ]


---------94:45----------
are we thinking about you though i don't


---------94:47----------
know


---------94:48----------
why can't you just dude he's a lucky


---------94:50----------
dude like what


---------94:52----------
why can't why can't you just bestow upon


---------94:55----------
him the awesomeness that is yvonne


---------95:00----------
i because maybe i just see it like both


---------95:02----------
it goes both ways you know relationships


---------95:04----------
is just like like you compliment each


---------95:06----------
other i may not be lucky


---------95:08----------
like i may not be a good girlfriend to


---------95:11----------
someone else


---------95:13----------
right yeah i'm i i'm really confused now


---------95:17----------
because


---------95:18----------
there's a part of me that's like


---------95:22----------
you know if he's a lucky dude like you


---------95:24----------
think he's a lucky dude


---------95:40----------
i know that sounds like a really simple


---------95:42----------
question but i'm just like i mean


---------95:47----------
i don't know what would you have to be


---------95:50----------
for him to be a lucky dude


---------95:55----------
what would have to be different


---------95:59----------
ah i'm not sure


---------96:03----------
i'm not even maybe if i was like


---------96:07----------
better in like every aspect a little bit


---------96:11----------
be like oh yeah they're really like you


---------96:13----------
know like no


---------96:14----------
we're not like uh they're just


---------96:17----------
each other yeah so it's interesting


---------96:20----------
right because i think it's like it's


---------96:21----------
weird because it's like


---------96:22----------
it's 50 there yeah because there's a


---------96:26----------
part of me that's like you know what


---------96:27----------
you're you sound confident i think it's


---------96:29----------
there but there's also some resistance


---------96:31----------
like you can't


---------96:32----------
you feel like you need to be better in


---------96:34----------
every dimension for him to be lucky


---------96:38----------
i just never think like damn you're so


---------96:41----------
lucky to have me that's like never a


---------96:44----------
type of thought yeah that


---------96:45----------
that that sounds like that that sounds


---------96:48----------
yeah it's


---------96:49----------
just very much like oh i think we just


---------96:51----------
like get along and complement each other


---------96:53----------
well


---------96:53----------
okay so i don't know if that's like a i


---------96:56----------
don't look at like


---------96:57----------
my criteria or like my resume and be


---------97:00----------
like


---------97:01----------
that they're lucky to have me it's


---------97:04----------
always just like a compatibility thing


---------97:06----------
or like a okay so like the other it's a


---------97:09----------
different thing


---------97:10----------
for me yeah i i hear you so i think what


---------97:12----------
was happening there is that i was trying


---------97:14----------
to apply


---------97:14----------
a particular like system to your


---------97:16----------
relationship which is just not the way


---------97:18----------
that you see your relationship


---------97:20----------
yeah so it's not necessarily yeah


---------97:23----------
yeah i don't know i don't know that it


---------97:24----------
was actually like a lack of confidence


---------97:26----------
thing


---------97:26----------
it was just more like a lack of


---------97:28----------
arrogance thing and just sort of like uh


---------97:30----------
this is how relationship work


---------97:32----------
relationships work i just don't think of


---------97:33----------
him


---------97:34----------
it is like i'm you know god's gift to


---------97:37----------
this particular person i don't think i'd


---------97:40----------
be like that for anyone you know it's


---------97:42----------
just


---------97:42----------
like do you guys get along like how well


---------97:46----------
do you mesh and i think that's like the


---------97:48----------
a huge essence as to like whether a


---------97:50----------
relationship works out or not not really


---------97:52----------
like


---------97:53----------
is this guy or girl freaking


---------97:56----------
attractive af and like all these other


---------97:58----------
things got it so that actually sounds to


---------98:00----------
me like if you had said yeah yeah so it


---------98:02----------
sounds like you're moving away from an


---------98:03----------
objective standard and just appreciating


---------98:05----------
what you have


---------98:07----------
yeah i i don't feel like a huge emphasis


---------98:10----------
when it comes to like


---------98:12----------
about above the things that we discuss


---------98:14----------
like in that role in this relationship


---------98:16----------
yeah i i get that so i think that was me


---------98:18----------
trying to apply


---------98:19----------
a particular set of language to that


---------98:22----------
doesn't seem to fit


---------98:25----------
so it was just weird though because i i


---------98:28----------
thought when i


---------98:29----------
you know i mentioned something that


---------98:30----------
seemed like a compliment like it was


---------98:32----------
hard for you to take what do you think


---------98:35----------
oh yeah it's been like that


---------98:38----------
with a lot of things in general every


---------98:41----------
time there's like a compliment i think


---------98:43----------
like


---------98:45----------
it's just so hard for me to take


---------98:46----------
compliments i can't and just


---------98:49----------
yeah so what are we supposed to do when


---------98:51----------
you receive a compliment


---------98:53----------
like pay attention to your mind think


---------98:56----------
about what you're thinking we're going


---------98:57----------
to try again


---------98:58----------
okay oh gosh and i want you to pay


---------99:01----------
attention to what your mind says


---------99:03----------
if you can think out loud


---------99:06----------
all right so you ready yes it's gonna be


---------99:09----------
a tough one


---------99:13----------
you're very pretty


---------99:18----------
what is your mind doing


---------99:31----------
it's like 50 okay so tell me what it's


---------99:35----------
saying


---------99:37----------
you're saying like oh like


---------99:41----------
i just i just think in my hand like oh


---------99:43----------
thanks and then like that's like


---------99:47----------
my confidence doesn't waver but it


---------99:49----------
doesn't like i don't feel


---------99:53----------
there's not like a huge up or down


---------99:57----------
hey does it make you feel uncomfortable


---------99:59----------
when i say that


---------100:03----------
but that is mainly because i'm


---------100:05----------
uncomfortable with compliments or i


---------100:06----------
don't like accept them right away


---------100:08----------
yeah yeah so so what's what pushes back


---------100:10----------
tell me what pushes back


---------100:13----------
um i think i just don't


---------100:17----------
okay it's weird like i just don't hear


---------100:20----------
it very often that someone will say that


---------100:24----------
outright to me


---------100:25----------
yep yeah so you're on so should we try


---------100:29----------
again


---------100:30----------
no not that's not what i meant so let's


---------100:32----------
let's we're gonna we're gonna


---------100:33----------
teach you how to okay i mean like


---------100:37----------
nobody like looks at me and says


---------100:41----------
go like that that's awesome here we


---------100:47----------
[Music]


---------100:49----------
meant go this is we're going


---------100:52----------
on a really awesome at league


---------100:55----------
oh am i now


---------100:59----------
yeah not anymore


---------101:04----------
even if i was i haven't played in a


---------101:06----------
while so


---------101:07----------
you used to be really awesome at league


---------101:13----------
how's that one


---------101:23----------
so where's that thought coming from


---------101:25----------
right well it's coming from the bad


---------101:27----------
games that i've had i've seen them all


---------101:29----------
you know when it's you you've seen all


---------101:30----------
the good and yeah


---------101:32----------
but your mind is not going to the good


---------101:34----------
games


---------101:36----------
it's automatically going to the bad game


---------101:38----------
so we're going to try one more time so


---------101:39----------
what's what's your


---------101:40----------
what's your job description at otv


---------101:44----------
uh how do i name him


---------101:48----------
yeah like what like what's your what's


---------101:49----------
your job like


---------101:51----------
what's like what's not description title


---------101:56----------
uh like a manager okay so you're an


---------101:59----------
awesome manager


---------102:01----------
that i feel pretty confident in what


---------102:03----------
does your mind do there


---------102:07----------
i think i'm decent but i could do better


---------102:11----------
right so like i want you to notice like


---------102:14----------
what


---------102:15----------
your mind is doing right like where is


---------102:17----------
it getting those thoughts


---------102:20----------
um i just think it's


---------102:23----------
the truth i think if i had like i could


---------102:26----------
there are always things i could do to do


---------102:29----------
better in that aspect like there's so


---------102:31----------
much


---------102:32----------
um i could learn or that i could put


---------102:34----------
time into


---------102:36----------
um yeah i could do better but i'm still


---------102:40----------
awesome


---------102:40----------
why can't you be both


---------102:45----------
i could be both but


---------102:48----------
i just don't feel entirely


---------102:52----------
there yet maybe but i feel like i'm


---------102:56----------
putting my heart into it


---------102:57----------
just like


---------103:00----------
my capabilities or experience wise may


---------103:04----------
not be there


---------103:05----------
if that makes sense like i'm not like uh


---------103:08----------
there's other areas that i'm not as


---------103:11----------
interested in or that i'm not as like


---------103:13----------
experienced in which is just you know


---------103:16----------
natural and


---------103:17----------
i think that's okay


---------103:22----------
but i could be better in those areas


---------103:27----------
okay well you so you said something that


---------103:30----------
was really interesting to me you put


---------103:31----------
your heart into it


---------103:34----------
that seems really amazing to me


---------103:39----------
what do you think


---------103:43----------
uh well i think that mainly just goes


---------103:46----------
into like caring about the people in it


---------103:48----------
so i like i think what makes you an


---------103:50----------
awesome manager is that you care so much


---------103:52----------
about the people that you work with


---------104:00----------
how is that


---------104:03----------
yeah i can agree with that


---------104:07----------
and what are you feeling now emotional


---------104:11----------
what's the emotion


---------104:15----------
well um seriously i think what's it's


---------104:18----------
awesome like i think that's why everyone


---------104:20----------
around you appreciates you so much


---------104:22----------
because there may be people who have


---------104:24----------
more skills there may be people who have


---------104:26----------
more experience


---------104:28----------
but you care so damn much and you give


---------104:31----------
it everything you've got


---------104:32----------
and they can count on you to do that


---------104:35----------
and that's what really sets you apart


---------104:37----------
that's why you're irreplaceable


---------104:51----------
i cry every time one i want to hear


---------104:54----------
there we go how do you feel about it


---------105:00----------
it feels better i feel better


---------105:03----------
hearing that yeah it's weird like but i


---------105:07----------
i think that that's something that i can


---------105:08----------
feel you


---------105:09----------
own


---------105:12----------
which is good i think you're on your


---------105:15----------
road to con like


---------105:16----------
because that's that's a hefty one right


---------105:17----------
i was like really like


---------105:20----------
i mean that was some high praise right


---------105:21----------
there that's some good [ __ ]


---------105:24----------
i mean i can only believe because i feel


---------105:26----------
the emotions very intensely than that


---------105:29----------
it's like


---------105:30----------
yeah so so i and i think that's that's


---------105:33----------
where it's like it's it's what you feel


---------105:34----------
in here like that's when we say like


---------105:36----------
confidence comes from within that's what


---------105:38----------
it is because that was


---------105:39----------
that was clearly i think a better


---------105:40----------
compliment than anything else i've said


---------105:43----------
was the best yeah that was like the best


---------105:45----------
thing


---------105:46----------
yeah and and so i i don't know where we


---------105:50----------
are now but i feel like we've learned


---------105:51----------
something i just don't know what i did


---------105:56----------
but i think we're getting there and


---------105:58----------
honestly i


---------105:59----------
appreciate that so much more than


---------106:01----------
someone telling me that i'm pretty


---------106:04----------
i like that like so much more


---------106:08----------
i don't know it's a correlation or


---------106:10----------
anything but


---------106:12----------
like i yeah i'm gonna meme with you here


---------106:15----------
but if i went into as much detail about


---------106:17----------
why i think you're pretty that would be


---------106:18----------
a tos violation and we all have


---------106:20----------
to go home so okay we gotta


---------106:24----------
stay with safe professional stuff it yes


---------106:27----------
you know


---------106:28----------
yeah any questions you want


---------106:32----------
um no i


---------106:36----------
yeah nothing that comes to mind


---------106:39----------
um what about you i i mean i


---------106:42----------
i think not really i mean i shared what


---------106:45----------
i


---------106:45----------
i've loved talking to you i think it's


---------106:47----------
been awesome i think it's been really


---------106:49----------
interesting because


---------106:50----------
what we see is people who are at the


---------106:53----------
beginning of their confidence journey


---------106:56----------
and we see people who are confident i


---------106:58----------
think it's been an


---------106:59----------
absolute pleasure to talk to someone


---------107:02----------
who's like


---------107:03----------
halfway there um i


---------107:06----------
i was really really happy to see that


---------107:08----------
you can actually like receive like


---------107:10----------
authentic praise that's well deserved i


---------107:13----------
think it demonstrates to me that


---------107:16----------
you know you have your mind will latch


---------107:18----------
on to whatever justification in a sense


---------107:20----------
that it has that maybe


---------107:22----------
someone can do stuff better but that you


---------107:24----------
can genuinely see


---------107:25----------
like what you are worth to otv


---------107:28----------
you can genuinely see what you're worth


---------107:30----------
to your boyfriend you can genuinely see


---------107:33----------
you know what you're worth to like the


---------107:35----------
twitch community and


---------107:36----------
and other people and that it you don't


---------107:38----------
have to be the smartest person


---------107:40----------
you don't have to have the most


---------107:41----------
followers you don't have to be the


---------107:43----------
prettiest


---------107:44----------
you can just be you and that's like


---------107:47----------
awesome um


---------107:50----------
and so i i think it's cool to really


---------107:52----------
like talk to you and see


---------107:54----------
exactly where those barriers of like


---------107:56----------
what you can take and what you can't


---------107:58----------
right like what feels natural and like


---------108:00----------
okay and what doesn't


---------108:02----------
and that's the tricky thing is we think


---------108:03----------
about confidence i have confidence if


---------108:05----------
it's binary


---------108:07----------
but it's not binary right it's like a


---------108:09----------
slow process


---------108:10----------
and i think you really did an awesome


---------108:12----------
job of illustrating especially when you


---------108:13----------
talk about going to the gym it's not


---------108:15----------
about being prettier because like when


---------108:16----------
you hear yourself talking about it's not


---------108:18----------
you know it's like i'm doing something


---------108:20----------
that i can be proud of and that's where


---------108:22----------
confidence comes from it's all internal


---------108:24----------
mm-hmm it's very much like for me


---------108:27----------
progression


---------108:28----------
helps me build like confidence if i


---------108:30----------
could like


---------108:31----------
see it or feel it yeah and i think the


---------108:34----------
really tricky thing is when people lack


---------108:36----------
confidence they swat away the


---------108:39----------
progression


---------108:42----------
right because there's there's this voice


---------108:43----------
in your head that for some people when


---------108:45----------
you go to the


---------108:46----------
gym it says it's not enough you could be


---------108:49----------
doing more


---------108:49----------
you could be doing more you could be


---------108:51----------
doing more and so it's interesting


---------108:53----------
because we can hear


---------108:54----------
actually in specific cases where your


---------108:57----------
mind defaults to i


---------108:59----------
you could be doing more and where it's


---------109:00----------
like you know what i'm actually pretty


---------109:02----------
great


---------109:04----------
could i do more absolutely but i feel


---------109:06----------
okay with what i've done i'm genuinely


---------109:07----------
like bringing


---------109:08----------
value so that's what i really enjoyed


---------109:10----------
about this it's kind of nuanced


---------109:12----------
but yeah


---------109:18----------
last thoughts or questions before we


---------109:19----------
wrap up


---------109:21----------
[Music]


---------109:26----------
nothing but i'm just really glad that


---------109:31----------
like i don't know the two i feel like


---------109:34----------
the two sessions that we had were so


---------109:37----------
different obviously but like i feel


---------109:41----------
really happy that we had this session


---------109:43----------
like just like


---------109:44----------
very like one year later and like


---------109:50----------
yeah it's been i think it's been a


---------109:52----------
little over a year


---------109:58----------
but uh you just helped me so much the


---------110:01----------
first time i really appreciate it you


---------110:02----------
like hit the nail on the head a lot


---------110:05----------
of how i felt and


---------110:08----------
put a lot of like i guess feelings that


---------110:11----------
i had in my head into words


---------110:13----------
that like perfectly described it so


---------110:16----------
yeah just wanted to thank you for that


---------110:21----------
yeah yvonne i'm debating i'm just gonna


---------110:25----------
go ahead and say this so the first thing


---------110:26----------
is that


---------110:27----------
i'm incredibly proud of the progress


---------110:29----------
you've made in the last year i think


---------110:31----------
it's truly amazing i think


---------110:32----------
what you have managed to do with


---------110:34----------
yourself and the person that we're


---------110:36----------
talking to


---------110:37----------
is a testament to like the resilience of


---------110:39----------
the human spirit


---------110:41----------
um and you know


---------110:44----------
the other thing is that sometimes


---------110:47----------
particular events will happen to people


---------110:49----------
that will shatter their confidence


---------110:52----------
you know and it doesn't necessarily have


---------110:54----------
to happen in your upbringing but like


---------110:56----------
there are particular things that can


---------110:58----------
happen to people that can really


---------111:00----------
shake the way that they feel about


---------111:01----------
themselves and be confident about


---------111:03----------
themselves


---------111:03----------
and it's been really nice to see like


---------111:05----------
how confident and comfortable you are


---------111:08----------
it's cool like it gives me hope for


---------111:10----------
humanity


---------111:12----------
so thank you for being you


---------111:15----------
yeah well you too thanks for helping a


---------111:18----------
lot of people as well


---------111:19----------
you're most welcome um


---------111:25----------
i guess that's it


---------111:26----------
[Laughter]


---------111:31----------
well best of luck to you yvonne you know


---------111:33----------

---------111:35----------

---------111:37----------

---------111:40----------
there at some point and want to share


---------111:42----------
with us that's totally fine or if


---------111:43----------

---------111:45----------

---------111:48----------
so keep crushing it thank you


---------111:52----------
you're welcome take care thank you


---------111:58----------
oh [ __ ] i forgot meditation yeah i


---------112:01----------
completely flubbed


---------112:02----------
i forgot that i i was i need to ask you


---------112:04----------
if you want to meditate today


---------112:06----------
okay i've never done it before but i'm


---------112:08----------
happy to try


---------112:10----------
okay um let's start with this what do


---------112:12----------
you


---------112:13----------
what would be the goal of you meditating


---------112:16----------
what do you want meditation to do for


---------112:18----------
you


---------112:19----------
maybe to de-stress but i feel stressed a


---------112:22----------
lot


---------112:23----------
okay um and when you get stressed what


---------112:26----------
what happens to you


---------112:31----------
i just


---------112:34----------
hey i lay down or something i don't know


---------112:38----------
okay so you feel like mentally


---------112:40----------
overwhelmed and you become like


---------112:42----------
inert like you don't move around


---------112:45----------
um it depends sometimes i feel stress


---------112:48----------
and i work


---------112:49----------
so then i feel less stressed because i'm


---------112:51----------
productive and have done stuff


---------112:53----------
um and then sometimes i just like


---------112:56----------
feel stressed or tired so i lay in bed


---------112:58----------
and just like take a break


---------113:00----------
for a bit


---------113:03----------
okay um i'm gonna teach you


---------113:06----------
a meditation practice called bellows


---------113:10----------
breath okay


---------113:12----------
okay so it's a particular kind of


---------113:14----------
breathing practice that is going to be


---------113:16----------
forceful inhalation followed by forceful


---------113:19----------
exhalation


---------113:20----------
and we're going to breathe like


---------113:21----------
relatively rapidly and then kind of calm


---------113:23----------
down a little bit afterward


---------113:25----------
for people who have watched this before


---------113:26----------
i actually got the names confused so


---------113:28----------
this is different


---------113:29----------
from actually what i used to teach is


---------113:32----------
called breath of fire but


---------113:34----------
so bellows breath i want you to sit up


---------113:36----------
straight i'm gonna blow my nose


---------113:38----------
i think you should too i got teary


---------113:41----------
towards the end


---------113:42----------
oh yeah and got caught up with how


---------113:46----------
awesome you are


---------113:47----------
oh god


---------113:51----------
i'm just going to toss those out


---------113:57----------
okay okay so i want you to sit up


---------113:59----------
straight


---------114:02----------
super straight okay so


---------114:05----------
are your knees lower than your hips


---------114:09----------
no i'm saying cross-legged so no oh


---------114:13----------
okay so that can be good do you have a a


---------114:15----------
small


---------114:16----------
like pillow or bro blanket that you can


---------114:18----------
sit on if you're sitting cross-legged


---------114:20----------
but just i have this yeah so can


---------114:23----------
fold it up


---------114:27----------
oh it's a rope yeah oh i thought it was


---------114:30----------
a blanket


---------114:31----------
well it's a blanket room okay


---------114:34----------
can you sit on top of that yes


---------114:38----------
but not under your knees you want to put


---------114:40----------
it under your


---------114:42----------
hips okay


---------114:45----------
and then sitting across like this good


---------114:46----------
so now you may notice if you sit


---------114:48----------
cross-legged are you sitting up


---------114:49----------
straighter


---------114:50----------
now that you're sitting on the robe okay


---------114:53----------
so


---------114:53----------
this this technique is actually super


---------114:55----------
simple so what it's going to hopefully


---------114:56----------
help you do


---------114:57----------
is kind of calm you down and energize


---------115:00----------
you at the same time


---------115:01----------
so what we're going to do is i'm gonna


---------115:04----------
breathe in


---------115:10----------
got it


---------115:14----------
okay so this is um


---------115:17----------
yeah so what we're going to do is like


---------115:18----------
15 breaths so i'm going to close my eyes


---------115:20----------
and i'm going to demonstrate one round


---------115:21----------
so


---------115:22----------
and you kind of want to do like one


---------115:23----------
second in one second out so one


---------115:25----------
two one two okay but you're going to


---------115:28----------
count for like 15 breaths


---------115:29----------
so i'll demonstrate


---------115:55----------
then you're gonna be like super chill


---------115:57----------
afterward okay


---------116:00----------
all right you ready yes i don't know if


---------116:03----------
i'm going to do it right though


---------116:04----------
you're of course you're not going to do


---------116:05----------
it right it's your first time okay who


---------116:07----------
does something right the first time


---------116:10----------
uh really talented people


---------116:13----------
basically no one all right okay okay so


---------116:16----------
close your eyes sit up straight


---------116:18----------
and then begin


---------116:36----------
okay were you breathing out pretty hard


---------116:40----------
like in and out hard or could you could


---------116:42----------
you give it more oomph


---------116:45----------
it felt hard but i don't know how hard


---------116:48----------
i'm supposed to go because i feel like


---------116:50----------
if i went harder it wouldn't be very


---------116:54----------
it wouldn't feel very nice go harder


---------116:58----------
go harder okay okay we're gonna do 15


---------117:00----------
rounds


---------117:01----------
okay so i have i was i wasn't sure how


---------117:04----------
many times do i do i get 15


---------117:06----------
yeah okay or if you want me to i can


---------117:10----------
keep track and i'll tell you


---------117:12----------
oh you want me to count with you would


---------117:13----------
that help


---------117:16----------
okay okay so close your eyes


---------117:19----------
and go hard this time okay okay three


---------117:23----------
two one go


---------117:26----------
one two three


---------117:30----------
four five six


---------117:34----------
seven eight nine


---------117:38----------
10 11 12


---------117:41----------
13 14 15.


---------117:48----------
now just sit


---------118:15----------
how do you feel that's really comfy


---------118:20----------
he's really relaxing were you exhaling


---------118:23----------
hard too


---------118:24----------
it seemed like you were putting


---------118:25----------
everything into the inhale i


---------118:27----------
i think oh well yes but i feel tired


---------118:34----------
yeah so it's like i think i think it


---------118:37----------
worked right


---------118:37----------
is it supposed to make you tired after


---------118:40----------
well i think if you


---------118:41----------
inhale really hard and you don't exhale


---------118:44----------
as hard


---------118:45----------
it may have a slightly different effect


---------118:48----------
okay


---------118:48----------
well i felt like i was chilling yeah you


---------118:51----------
were chilling that's good


---------118:52----------
so you can have a chilling so if you


---------118:54----------
want to be if you want to balance the


---------118:56----------
energizing a little bit better


---------118:58----------
i would push out practice a little bit


---------119:00----------
more on


---------119:01----------
on pushing out the exhalation okay


---------119:04----------
because let me let me think about what


---------119:05----------
this is doing


---------119:10----------
yeah you may be becoming slightly hyper


---------119:13----------
carbic


---------119:14----------
which is the opposite of


---------119:16----------
hyperventilation


---------119:19----------
if you're not exhaling forcefully enough


---------119:21----------
if you're just like sucking in a bunch


---------119:22----------
of air like if you're sucking in more


---------119:24----------
air


---------119:25----------
then you're exhaling you may actually


---------119:26----------
start to feel a little bit


---------119:28----------
trippy is that when you say


---------119:32----------
relax or we stop talking to like a


---------119:33----------
little bit woozy trippy


---------119:36----------
or more just just relaxed i think just


---------119:39----------
relax


---------119:40----------
okay yeah okay you want to try one more


---------119:43----------
time


---------119:44----------
with hard exhalations are you done you


---------119:47----------
can be done


---------119:48----------
i might just feel too tired for it i


---------119:51----------
don't know


---------119:51----------
i feel like tired now okay so just


---------119:55----------
let's stop then so i i swear i'll do it


---------119:59----------
afterwards


---------120:00----------
yeah try again because the i mean i


---------120:03----------
guess it's this is the how to tire


---------120:05----------
yourself out meditation


---------120:06----------
i suppose we may we may have stumbled


---------120:08----------
upon a new technique which i'll have to


---------120:10----------
think about


---------120:11----------
but it might also be me waking up like


---------120:14----------
a little bit earlier than you no i mean


---------120:16----------
i had some coffee and then


---------120:19----------
it's like no i'd say it's possible


---------120:20----------
yvonne that you have you have


---------120:22----------
unknowingly stumbled upon a wonderful


---------120:24----------
technique for insomnia


---------120:27----------
because you have your coffee and you


---------120:29----------
feel tired


---------120:32----------
some coffee crash caffeine


---------120:35----------
i don't know so i'll experiment with


---------120:37----------
this i encourage if people are watching


---------120:40----------
and and practicing with you i i i wonder


---------120:42----------
if you do like


---------120:43----------
sharp inhalations with minimal


---------120:45----------
exhalation whether you feel


---------120:47----------
tired


---------120:50----------
if it's useful i'll meditate because


---------120:52----------
sometimes people want to calm down and


---------120:53----------
they want to like mentally chill out


---------120:55----------
right like they want to like


---------120:56----------
calm that down yeah that's really


---------120:59----------
helpful too so we may have stumbled upon


---------121:00----------
something i don't think i've ever seen


---------121:02----------
this


---------121:02----------
it's interesting because we have the


---------121:04----------
opposite where we have forceful


---------121:05----------
exhalation with very mild inhalation and


---------121:08----------
that


---------121:08----------
is breath of fire and then this one is


---------121:12----------
bellows breath


---------121:12----------
but i i don't think that there's a


---------121:15----------
there's an opposite version of this it's


---------121:16----------
interesting so i'm gonna experiment


---------121:18----------
thank you yvonne you may have stumbled


---------121:19----------
upon something


---------121:20----------
okay good job yeah no problem anytime


---------121:25----------
all right take care everyone yeah thank


---------121:27----------
you


---------121:28----------
bye bye


---------121:31----------
all right chat that was unexpected but


---------121:34----------
hey


---------121:34----------
evan may be super yeah breath of a


---------121:37----------
breath of fire is uh


---------121:38----------
the it's the yvonne method
