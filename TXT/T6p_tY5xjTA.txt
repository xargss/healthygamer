---------00:00----------
do you want to see my presentation


---------00:03----------
hell yeah baby you don't it's terrible


---------00:06----------
this is like something that someone with


---------00:08----------
adhd made i'm telling you yeah


---------00:16----------
do you see me now yes how are you bro


---------00:21----------
i am great bro what's going on bro um


---------00:24----------
i am getting over side effects from a


---------00:28----------
cova vaccine


---------00:29----------
which is not fun


---------00:32----------
wait wait wait wait wait you already got


---------00:34----------
the covet vaccine


---------00:35----------
yeah how'd you get it so fast


---------00:39----------
i'm a physician i'm group 1a


---------00:42----------
but you don't even if you're don't you


---------00:44----------
just sit at home you're not a


---------00:46----------
like the don't aren't positions just


---------00:49----------
doing stuff online through like skype


---------00:51----------
absolutely so why would it why would it


---------00:54----------
be important


---------00:55----------
for me to be


---------00:58----------
immune from covet if i'm not seeing


---------01:00----------
patients


---------01:02----------
great question


---------01:06----------
correct right so what happens if i get


---------01:09----------
sick


---------01:10----------
this if i end up in the icu for a month


---------01:13----------
what happens


---------01:15----------
then you need to see a doctor and then


---------01:16----------
it's just an ongoing problem


---------01:18----------
more importantly what happens to all of


---------01:21----------
my patients who are more suicidal


---------01:23----------
because


---------01:23----------
kovit is making life worse


---------01:28----------
who takes care of them if i'm sick


---------01:34----------
destiny i don't know yeah that's the


---------01:36----------
problem man so i i thought about it for


---------01:38----------
a little while and i was talking to my


---------01:39----------
friends about it because i was like


---------01:41----------
i'm not actually front line i don't


---------01:42----------
physically see patients


---------01:44----------
and then i realize like i literally


---------01:45----------
cannot afford to get sick


---------01:47----------
yeah i get that my you know people are


---------01:51----------
especially college students is who i see


---------01:53----------
at the worst end where like


---------01:54----------
people are way worse like college


---------01:55----------
students are really struggling


---------01:58----------
um i don't know exactly what it is but


---------02:00----------
we'll see


---------02:02----------
well they're probably depressed that


---------02:03----------
their college careers are already


---------02:06----------
like let's say if you're a senior or


---------02:08----------
freshman or something in the middle even


---------02:09----------
it's your college career


---------02:13----------
has essentially like people think of


---------02:17----------
college like the best years of your life


---------02:18----------
and then when you go to college and all


---------02:21----------
of a sudden for the


---------02:22----------
past year maybe even two years you're


---------02:24----------
just


---------02:25----------
wasting away and you're ruining your


---------02:27----------
whole college experience


---------02:30----------
yeah i think that's certainly a part of


---------02:32----------
it um


---------02:33----------
i think people find it incredibly


---------02:35----------
isolating because a lot of college like


---------02:37----------
you know you get a lot of support from


---------02:39----------
your people


---------02:41----------
and not being able to see people and


---------02:42----------
stuff like that i think has been tough


---------02:44----------
i don't know if you've ever tried to you


---------02:46----------
know take do class


---------02:48----------
entirely through zoom and without


---------02:50----------
interacting with professors and things


---------02:52----------
like that but that's rough man


---------02:54----------
just zoom all day every day yeah


---------02:57----------
i've done online classes but i didn't do


---------02:59----------
zoom that sounds absolutely brutal i


---------03:01----------
feel like at first it sounds fantastic


---------03:03----------
and then after like


---------03:05----------
the first couple weeks have you ever


---------03:06----------
seen the squidward thing where


---------03:09----------
squidward's really happy and then he


---------03:12----------
gets really upset


---------03:13----------
because he's a squidward is a


---------03:16----------
spongebob character or what ah crap yeah


---------03:19----------
we're completely off


---------03:20----------
yeah it's a spongebob character pretty


---------03:23----------
much he's like


---------03:24----------
in the ballpark yeah you're right you're


---------03:26----------
right there's no ballparks in spongebob


---------03:28----------
though but


---------03:29----------
he uh pretty much sponge or squidward


---------03:32----------
he's like


---------03:33----------
really happy that he has this like life


---------03:36----------
and then he just gets really depressed


---------03:37----------
after like two weeks because he's like


---------03:39----------
this sucks


---------03:40----------
hmm is that something you identify with


---------03:43----------
no not at all i'm actually i actually i


---------03:45----------
have big news i


---------03:47----------
so after i talked to you last which was


---------03:50----------
about over a year ago


---------03:52----------
um around a year ago i was on sri's


---------03:55----------
20 milligram lexapro and now i'm not on


---------03:57----------
it anymore


---------03:58----------
i'm completely off of it i went from 20


---------04:01----------
to 10 to five and now i'm at none


---------04:03----------
how do you understand that that i'm off


---------04:06----------
of it


---------04:07----------
yeah how did that happen good for you


---------04:10----------
um well i said to my you know


---------04:13----------
actually maya said it to me she's like


---------04:14----------
why are you on this if you're not


---------04:16----------
depressed


---------04:16----------
and i'm like yeah i guess you're right


---------04:19----------
and i


---------04:20----------
i really wasn't depressed anymore um


---------04:23----------
but i felt like i had a cotton ball in


---------04:26----------
my head for like the past


---------04:28----------
12 months


---------04:33----------
yeah fuzzy no i'm like my grandma died i


---------04:36----------
was like all right whatever


---------04:37----------
my you know people died i'm like


---------04:40----------
whatever


---------04:40----------
like it it's i didn't really get to


---------04:43----------
experience the emotional


---------04:46----------
waves because there just felt like there


---------04:48----------
was a cotton ball stuck in my head for


---------04:49----------
the past 12 months


---------04:50----------
and it's still there it's not going to


---------04:51----------
go away for at least a few more months


---------04:53----------
right


---------04:55----------
i i don't know are you suggesting the


---------04:56----------
cotton ball was due to the the


---------04:58----------
medication


---------04:59----------
yeah i mean 20 milligrams was a lot it


---------05:01----------
was


---------05:02----------
true i felt it but i don't know how long


---------05:05----------
does lexical last in your system


---------05:07----------
uh usually i think about an average of


---------05:10----------
like eight weeks


---------05:12----------
so if we think about the therapeutic


---------05:13----------
effect of ssris


---------05:16----------
they take about eight weeks to fully get


---------05:18----------
active in your brain


---------05:19----------
and so i think about that as sort of the


---------05:21----------
minimum amount of time that they sort of


---------05:23----------
stay with you


---------05:26----------
and and i mean i've had some people who


---------05:28----------
you know will take months


---------05:30----------
to kind of get better other people will


---------05:33----------
will get better in like a couple of


---------05:34----------
weeks actually


---------05:35----------
so it just depends on the person hmm did


---------05:38----------
you


---------05:38----------
i i assume you since you talked about


---------05:40----------
doing a taper i assumed that your


---------05:42----------
prescriber was aware that you were


---------05:44----------
coming off of the medication yeah yeah


---------05:46----------
i i told him he i mean he was really i


---------05:49----------
mean


---------05:49----------
i like went in there and he's just like


---------05:52----------
you're depressed and i'm like huh and he


---------05:54----------
just gave me ssris and then


---------05:56----------
i'm like i want to get off of this he's


---------05:58----------
like just cut them in half i'm like okay


---------06:00----------
um very


---------06:03----------
i don't know if he has takes ssris but


---------06:05----------
he was very unemotional with it he was


---------06:06----------
just like


---------06:07----------
get in get out just next um that's okay


---------06:11----------
i mean it worked i i it solved my


---------06:13----------
problems for about a year


---------06:14----------
and then uh so that was good and


---------06:18----------
i i did get off of this two days ago


---------06:22----------
and i still feel it for sure but i just


---------06:24----------
hope to have


---------06:25----------
some emotional pull with stuff compared


---------06:27----------
to what i did


---------06:28----------
but yeah it also makes me lack


---------06:32----------
creativity as much as i used to


---------06:33----------
i hate that yeah that sounds


---------06:36----------
like the medication cost you a lot


---------06:39----------
yeah it cost me a lot but it helped me a


---------06:41----------
lot because i was in a really i mean


---------06:43----------
i don't know if you remember but i was i


---------06:44----------
went to a ward i


---------06:46----------
with the depersonalization issues and it


---------06:49----------
kind of just like put a cotton ball on


---------06:50----------
my head it was just like stop


---------06:52----------
and i'm like all right so it did help it


---------06:55----------
it almost numbed the pain it was like a


---------06:58----------
it


---------06:58----------
like put a band-aid on it but uh


---------07:02----------
it didn't really heal it but now i feel


---------07:04----------
a lot better


---------07:05----------
how do you think so it sounds like you


---------07:07----------
got healed


---------07:09----------
uh yeah i i i feel like i've gotten


---------07:11----------
healed i feel a lot better


---------07:13----------
i feel like i've went from this


---------07:16----------
uh i mean i still have a lot of problems


---------07:20----------
for sure


---------07:21----------
i mean i'm a streamer for one but i


---------07:25----------
i do have a lot of problems but i think


---------07:28----------
um


---------07:30----------
i i do i'm not depressed anymore that's


---------07:32----------
for sure i i don't think i'm depressed


---------07:34----------
i don't think i i don't have any anxiety


---------07:36----------
i i i really bad anxiety where i would


---------07:38----------
just


---------07:39----------
wake up in the middle it was really at


---------07:41----------
night i don't i don't know if it's a


---------07:42----------
common thing


---------07:43----------
if it but people having anxiety only at


---------07:46----------
night


---------07:47----------
in their sleep or before they go to bed


---------07:49----------
that's all i never had anxiety during


---------07:51----------
the day


---------07:52----------
it was i didn't care about that i only


---------07:54----------
had it before i went to bed or dirt


---------07:56----------
while i was sleeping i would have


---------07:57----------
anxiety what um


---------08:00----------
miss if what would you wake up worrying


---------08:02----------
about in the middle of the night


---------08:05----------
that's the thing really nothing i i


---------08:07----------
didn't really worry or care about any


---------08:09----------
my stomach would just start feeling like


---------08:11----------
it's it's doing 360s and


---------08:13----------
i i felt pain in my stomach and i'm like


---------08:16----------
i don't know what this anxiety is from


---------08:18----------
yeah it was really bad it's not very


---------08:20----------
physiologic anxiety as opposed to a


---------08:23----------
cognitive anxiety like it was in your


---------08:25----------
body as opposed to your mind


---------08:27----------
is there is there a big difference i


---------08:28----------
guess there's a big difference what is


---------08:29----------
it what does it mean


---------08:31----------
like isn't i feel it more than yeah so i


---------08:34----------
think


---------08:34----------
you know it's funny because anxiety is


---------08:36----------
getting worse like


---------08:38----------
in the world so more people are getting


---------08:40----------
diagnosed with anxiety more people are


---------08:42----------
getting treated with anxiety the number


---------08:43----------
of people diagnosed as climbing over


---------08:45----------
time and so if we think about it like


---------08:48----------
you were about to say something no i was


---------08:50----------
gonna wonder why you think that


---------08:52----------
yeah it's an interesting question right


---------08:53----------
so like do illnesses just sort of like


---------08:55----------
especially mental health issues do they


---------08:56----------
just sort of randomly get worse like


---------08:58----------
what's going on


---------08:59----------
um oddly enough i think part of the


---------09:01----------
reason that it's happening in this


---------09:02----------
country is because we think about


---------09:04----------
anxiety as a psychiatric problem right


---------09:07----------
like we're like if you have anxiety like


---------09:08----------
go see a therapist whereas the funny


---------09:10----------
thing is that when we sort of remove the


---------09:12----------
body from the equation


---------09:14----------
then we run into people like yourself


---------09:17----------
where you go talk to a therapist


---------09:19----------
and they're gonna ask you about your


---------09:20----------
thoughts and your feelings


---------09:22----------
but you know clinical social workers


---------09:24----------
psychologists they're not going to be


---------09:26----------
like


---------09:26----------
they don't know anything about the body


---------09:29----------
and when i hear a story like this


---------09:30----------
it reminds me that you know anxiety has


---------09:32----------
two roots


---------09:34----------
it can be rooted in your body or it can


---------09:36----------
be rooted in your mind


---------09:37----------
and the two connect with each other but


---------09:39----------
i think part of the reason that


---------09:40----------
in a sense people are getting more


---------09:42----------
anxious is because we're leaving out


---------09:44----------
half of our solutions because half of


---------09:46----------
the solutions for


---------09:47----------
anxiety actually rely reside in the body


---------09:50----------
not the mind


---------09:51----------
[Music]


---------09:52----------
i see that that makes sense so you have


---------09:55----------
a physiologic anxiety so i think you


---------09:57----------
know talking about your emotions and


---------09:58----------
talking about your feelings and doing


---------10:00----------
therapy will probably help


---------10:02----------
because that is going to affect your


---------10:03----------
body it's going to lower your stress


---------10:04----------
levels it's going to lower your cortisol


---------10:06----------
things like that that will affect your


---------10:07----------
stomach


---------10:08----------
sure but if you've got you know


---------10:10----------
primarily a physical problem then


---------10:11----------
sometimes what you need is primarily a


---------10:13----------
physical solution


---------10:14----------
it's either like working out working out


---------10:17----------
is


---------10:17----------
a part of it but that's a very


---------10:19----------
untargeted solution


---------10:20----------
right so if you had like issues in your


---------10:22----------
stomach i'd say that's what you should


---------10:24----------
start with so


---------10:25----------
you know are you constipated uh


---------10:29----------
i used to be when i was a kid i used to


---------10:30----------
take uh


---------10:32----------
suppositories yeah so how are your bowel


---------10:35----------
movements now


---------10:37----------
squeaky clean i think how many how many


---------10:40----------
do you have one every day


---------10:44----------
um


---------10:46----------
i'd say about let me know if i ask you


---------10:50----------
any questions that you're uncomfortable


---------10:52----------
answering


---------10:52----------
there's nothing you could say that i


---------10:54----------
care about uh let me ask you next


---------10:56----------
question floaters or sinkers does your


---------10:57----------
poop float or does it sink


---------11:00----------
um good question i usually try to just


---------11:04----------
like flush and get the hell out of there


---------11:06----------
but i would say probably most of the


---------11:07----------
time it's it's it's


---------11:09----------
a log okay okay i remember last time he


---------11:13----------
told me to get this pill that


---------11:14----------
uh can help me with my uh began with the


---------11:17----------
sea i think it was


---------11:18----------
to try to help that certainly sounds


---------11:21----------
like medical advice i doubt i would do


---------11:23----------
that


---------11:23----------
oh okay i don't remember what it was i


---------11:26----------
said i don't know


---------11:27----------
what did i tell you i don't or maybe


---------11:30----------
have something like you put in your


---------11:31----------
drink or something


---------11:32----------
um i forgot i thought it began with the


---------11:34----------
letter c


---------11:35----------
did i tell you to take fenugreek seeds


---------11:38----------
oh that's a yeah


---------11:39----------
yeah so this is where um


---------11:43----------
you know biscuits so in ayurveda they


---------11:46----------
think that most of the


---------11:47----------
problems in our mind actually start in


---------11:49----------
our bowels


---------11:51----------
and there's growing evidence of this


---------11:52----------
actually as bizarre as that sounds


---------11:55----------
there are even trials where they'll do


---------11:57----------
stool transplants


---------11:58----------
so what they'll do is they'll take like


---------12:00----------
stool from


---------12:01----------
one organism that doesn't have anxiety


---------12:04----------
and they'll give that so they'll


---------12:06----------
transplant that stool into another


---------12:08----------
organism


---------12:08----------
and then the the recipient of the


---------12:11----------
transplant will like


---------12:12----------
feel better do you think that's because


---------12:15----------
the stool is


---------12:16----------
like it's like what they're eating yeah


---------12:18----------
absolutely


---------12:19----------
so so here's so here's what happens so


---------12:21----------
like our bowels


---------12:23----------
have bacteria right and


---------12:26----------
the bacteria are going to be selected


---------12:28----------
for based on


---------12:30----------
what i put into my stomach so one


---------12:33----------
bacteria is going to be really good at


---------12:34----------
digesting


---------12:36----------
twinkies and the other bacteria is going


---------12:38----------
to be really good at digesting broccoli


---------12:40----------
and what happens is when we eat a bunch


---------12:42----------
of twinkies we're select we're feeding


---------12:44----------
the twinkie bacteria


---------12:46----------
so that grows in our gut and then when


---------12:48----------
we eat a bunch of broccoli that grows


---------12:50----------
the bacteria


---------12:50----------
the broccoli bacteria and what we found


---------12:53----------
is that


---------12:54----------
actually we have a very symbiotic


---------12:55----------
relationship with bacteria and they


---------12:57----------
produce lots of compounds that sort of


---------12:59----------
like


---------12:59----------
you know go into our bloodstream and


---------13:00----------
stuff like that some kinds of bacteria


---------13:03----------
also cause more inflammation


---------13:06----------
and there are even some trials for


---------13:07----------
example that are exploring the use of


---------13:09----------
anti-inflammatory


---------13:10----------
agents like ibuprofen or advil for


---------13:12----------
depression


---------13:14----------
wow yeah so it's like all interconnected


---------13:17----------
and basically what people have found is


---------13:19----------
that people who have low anxiety for


---------13:21----------
example


---------13:22----------
have two kinds of bacteria in their gut


---------13:25----------
and people who have high anxiety have a


---------13:27----------
different two kinds of bacteria


---------13:29----------
so there's like pro-anxiety bacteria and


---------13:31----------
there's anti-anxiety bacteria


---------13:33----------
and if you think about how do you switch


---------13:35----------
from pro-anxiety bacteria to


---------13:36----------
anti-anxiety bacteria


---------13:38----------
one could be a stool transplant but the


---------13:41----------
other way you can do it is by altering


---------13:42----------
your diet


---------13:43----------
and this is what the folks in the


---------13:45----------
ayurvedic folks basically figured out


---------13:47----------
is that there are some kinds of foods


---------13:48----------
that you can eat that'll lower your


---------13:50----------
anxiety level


---------13:51----------
is one of them broccoli let me think


---------13:55----------
about that


---------13:56----------
i'm sure it won't hurt


---------14:01----------
i'd say the key thing about broccoli


---------14:02----------
would be to eat it cooked


---------14:04----------
if you want to lower your anxiety based


---------14:06----------
on ayurvedic theory


---------14:08----------
that's interesting yeah i could


---------14:10----------
definitely see that because a lot of


---------14:11----------
times when i had anxiety was


---------14:13----------
i felt it in my gut but i don't know if


---------14:14----------
that's related at all


---------14:16----------
but i actually have a question for you


---------14:18----------
so yeah shoot


---------14:19----------
i still have a problem and i don't know


---------14:22----------
how to solve it


---------14:23----------
and it's every day i deal with this i've


---------14:25----------
been dealing with my entire life


---------14:27----------
um i don't know what to do with my adhd


---------14:31----------
uh when it comes to


---------14:36----------
you know like a kaleidoscope


---------14:39----------
i feel like that's how i view life at


---------14:41----------
all times and i'm not


---------14:43----------
really there it feels like i'm just


---------14:46----------
watching it's like it's like life is a


---------14:48----------
movie and i'm like


---------14:49----------
watching it i don't know how to describe


---------14:51----------
it but i never feel like i'm actually


---------14:52----------
like


---------14:53----------
mentally there enjoying moments because


---------14:54----------
there's a lot of times where i should be


---------14:56----------
really happy


---------14:56----------
or a lot of times where um


---------14:58----------
[Music]


---------15:00----------
it it's like my body's there i'm like


---------15:04----------
and i could talk it's not like i'm like


---------15:07----------
you know


---------15:07----------
in like the avatar state or something


---------15:09----------
where i can't talk i could talk and i


---------15:11----------
could do everything but i just


---------15:12----------
mentally i feel like i'm in another


---------15:13----------
world where are you


---------15:16----------
uh thinking honestly what


---------15:20----------
i don't know um about random things


---------15:23----------
he'll be


---------15:23----------
just a lot of random things and i'm not


---------15:26----------
really sure exactly what usually those


---------15:27----------
things are


---------15:28----------
but we have a question where are you


---------15:30----------
from are you from california


---------15:32----------
i'm from texas dude wait you're in texas


---------15:35----------
yeah wait what oh


---------15:38----------
because the the quality of the camera's


---------15:40----------
horrible and i thought it's because


---------15:41----------
i was in texas i don't know where it is


---------15:47----------

---------15:51----------
but are you in dallas no i'm in houston


---------15:53----------

---------15:54----------
ah but yeah i see my example of


---------15:58----------
my adhd it's therapist i don't even know


---------16:00----------
what that would be yeah but let me ask


---------16:01----------
you something


---------16:02----------
so let's let's you said this has been


---------16:03----------
going on your entire life so you're


---------16:05----------
saying that your


---------16:06----------
body and parts of your mind will


---------16:08----------
participate


---------16:10----------
in regular life but that your attention


---------16:13----------
is somewhere else yes 100


---------16:17----------
um you've like you've turned on auto run


---------16:19----------
and your character


---------16:20----------
is just that that's that's actually


---------16:22----------
exactly how it feels


---------16:23----------
it feels like i am not there but


---------16:26----------
i i get everything done like i'll


---------16:29----------
stop and sometimes i'll be saying to


---------16:31----------
myself like how the hell am i doing this


---------16:33----------
like i'll be like in a run in speed


---------16:36----------
running in mario and i'll be like


---------16:38----------
under by two minutes and i'll be like


---------16:40----------
how am i even i'm not even paying


---------16:42----------
attention like


---------16:43----------
what the hell is going on and or i do


---------16:45----------
feel like i'm almost doing life


---------16:47----------
on auto and i don't and it's


---------16:50----------
like that my whole life it's not just


---------16:52----------
because now i


---------16:53----------
i can just turn on the stream and people


---------16:55----------
are there it's my whole life i feel like


---------16:57----------
it's been auto


---------16:58----------
my whole life i feel like i've been um


---------17:00----------
[Music]


---------17:02----------
i've never really gotten to enjoy the


---------17:04----------
moment and it just has that kaleidoscope


---------17:06----------
feeling


---------17:07----------
where it just feels like a billion


---------17:09----------
things are going on


---------17:10----------
and i don't i never know how to just


---------17:12----------
focus and enjoy like


---------17:14----------
i want to be able to just sit there look


---------17:16----------
outside and just feel like i'm


---------17:19----------
actually there enjoying the sun and i've


---------17:21----------
never ever


---------17:22----------
been able to do that even when i i like


---------17:24----------
um


---------17:26----------
i have like a really nice sunset at my


---------17:27----------
house it just i see it all the time and


---------17:29----------
i never really get to enjoy it because


---------17:31----------
there's always stuff going on


---------17:32----------
my head or then all of a sudden even if


---------17:35----------
i'm not thinking of anything crazy


---------17:36----------
some song will start playing like in the


---------17:38----------
back of my head just


---------17:39----------
music songs um


---------17:43----------
anything it's very odd and i i don't


---------17:45----------
know what to do


---------17:47----------
so what i'm hearing you say is that


---------17:49----------
you're not able to be present


---------17:51----------
and that you've never been able to be


---------17:53----------
present yeah i've never really


---------17:56----------
been able to be present at all and i


---------17:59----------
think that also


---------18:00----------
not being present really affects the


---------18:01----------
ability for me to


---------18:03----------
uh my ability not to present makes me


---------18:07----------
have a lack of of memory with a lot of


---------18:09----------
these things because


---------18:11----------
yeah i'm there and i'm talking to you


---------18:13----------
but my brain's in six different places


---------18:15----------
like right now i'm listening


---------18:17----------
while i'm talking to you there's like


---------18:18----------
three songs going to back my head


---------18:20----------
a tick tock that maya showed me maya


---------18:22----------
making me food and i'm thinking about


---------18:24----------
the fact that there's a guy coming with


---------18:26----------
my furniture in about 30 minutes it's


---------18:27----------
like i'm not


---------18:28----------
i'm here but i want to be present like


---------18:31----------
and i feel like i'm not fully present


---------18:34----------
have you ever been present


---------18:36----------
in your entire life really


---------18:39----------
i've have had terrible adhd and a lot of


---------18:43----------
times


---------18:43----------
uh when i'm not present it's usually me


---------18:45----------
trying to think of the next thing to say


---------18:47----------
that will make someone laugh


---------18:48----------
um it's it's usually yeah


---------18:51----------
it's usually me trying to be what can i


---------18:54----------
say or do


---------18:56----------
you ever taken a road trip and you


---------18:58----------
really really really needed to pee


---------19:02----------
yes and then when you actually pee


---------19:06----------
where's your mind in that moment where


---------19:08----------
you start


---------19:09----------
kissing are you still doing like five or


---------19:13----------
six things in your head


---------19:18----------
i don't think so i don't i don't


---------19:20----------
remember fully but i'm gonna assume no


---------19:23----------
so where is your attention then fully on


---------19:26----------
the piss


---------19:27----------
but that's because it matters right well


---------19:29----------
hold on a second


---------19:31----------
why it happens we'll figure out later


---------19:33----------
first question is does it happen


---------19:37----------
um yes it does happen where you're


---------19:40----------
fully central focused on one thing and i


---------19:43----------
i guess that


---------19:46----------
i was gonna say that happens when you're


---------19:48----------
working out but even then i remember


---------19:50----------
lifting like stuff


---------19:55----------
and um while i'm benching i'll be like


---------19:59----------
you know thinking of stupid stuff i'm


---------20:01----------
like why am i thinking of this i should


---------20:02----------
just focus on the weights


---------20:04----------
uh but yeah it does happen with the piss


---------20:08----------
i think


---------20:09----------
it's it's more so i guess that's a very


---------20:15----------
why that happens i'm assuming just


---------20:16----------
because it's


---------20:19----------
the most important thing for humans at


---------20:20----------
the time because we're


---------20:22----------
it's like our bowels moving i don't know


---------20:24----------
yeah it's it's interesting right so


---------20:26----------
let like we'll we'll figure out how to


---------20:28----------
get you there miss kiff


---------20:30----------
um but the first thing is to recognize


---------20:32----------
that you actually can be present at


---------20:34----------
times


---------20:35----------
so um but you know i'm what i'm hearing


---------20:38----------
you say is that it's practically very


---------20:40----------
hard


---------20:41----------
it's so hard and


---------20:46----------
yeah it's really hard to be present


---------20:49----------
seems like that's cost you a lot oh yeah


---------20:52----------
it's


---------20:53----------
i mean i you know all you can have all


---------20:56----------
the success in the world but


---------20:57----------
when you don't get to enjoy it it's


---------20:58----------
rough and i mean um


---------21:00----------
it's not even then it's it's uh


---------21:04----------
i it goes to the thing with the memory


---------21:06----------
problem i mean i don't remember


---------21:07----------
a single thing from my childhood not a


---------21:10----------
single my friends would be like oh


---------21:11----------
remember this


---------21:12----------
remember we did this my brother will say


---------21:14----------
stuff my sister will say stuff people


---------21:15----------
say stuff


---------21:16----------
i don't remember any of it my parents


---------21:18----------
will talk about times when we went to


---------21:19----------
the water park


---------21:20----------
i don't remember we went to a water park


---------21:22----------
my parents would talk about this


---------21:23----------
you know um my grandma recently died


---------21:27----------
i don't remember anything from her house


---------21:28----------
i remember her house i remember


---------21:30----------
you know one or two things but


---------21:34----------
i don't remember as much as i wish i did


---------21:36----------
i don't remember


---------21:38----------
a lot of the things and partially i i


---------21:41----------
wish i took more pictures


---------21:43----------
when i was younger uh but i didn't


---------21:45----------
because i had acne but


---------21:48----------
i partially think that it's because i


---------21:50----------
just i'm not i wasn't there in the


---------21:51----------
present moment thinking about it i was


---------21:53----------
thinking about other things or my future


---------21:55----------
or problems i don't know being in the


---------21:57----------
present's very hard for me it just is


---------21:58----------
yeah


---------21:59----------
and i'm also kind of noticing that it


---------22:02----------
really has cost you a lot it's almost


---------22:04----------
like your brain is like


---------22:05----------
you know a colander that's just like


---------22:07----------
leaking memories


---------22:09----------
and then you're sort of not left with


---------22:11----------
anything


---------22:13----------
yeah it doesn't feel and i i mean


---------22:18----------
yeah i mean and partially it you know


---------22:20----------
there's pros and cons to everything in


---------22:22----------
life


---------22:22----------
and one of the pros of that is i forget


---------22:25----------
everything so fast


---------22:26----------
so if something bad happens to me i


---------22:27----------
forget it in 20 minutes and i'm like


---------22:28----------
whatever


---------22:29----------
you know next thing so it's it's easier


---------22:32----------
in that way where i forget everything


---------22:34----------
but at the same time you don't really


---------22:36----------
have a lot of memories or like


---------22:37----------
like i played world of warcraft for 10


---------22:39----------
years


---------22:41----------
and i don't remember a single thing


---------22:46----------
let me ask you something if you is there


---------22:47----------
some something that happened to you that


---------22:49----------
you


---------22:51----------
really that some part of your mind


---------22:53----------
thought it was really important to


---------22:55----------
forget


---------23:00----------
like a childhood experience


---------23:03----------
it's interesting you kind of said that


---------23:05----------
you forget everything easily which is an


---------23:06----------
upside so i'm kind of curious


---------23:08----------
how has that helped you uh oh how it's


---------23:11----------
helped me to forget things


---------23:12----------
uh


---------23:16----------
i don't know like i mean like i guess an


---------23:17----------
example i could think of right now is


---------23:19----------
because of chat or like twitch chat like


---------23:20----------
let's say someone makes me really mad


---------23:23----------
uh a lot of times like i'll hear my


---------23:26----------
friends say that like oh


---------23:28----------
you know twitch was chat was terrible


---------23:30----------
today blah blah blah


---------23:32----------
and yeah sometimes my chat could get bad


---------23:34----------
too everyone scan and when it happens


---------23:36----------
for my chat for for me


---------23:39----------
i i forget about it in 20 minutes i


---------23:41----------
don't remember like oh that happened


---------23:43----------
like so let me ask you something in a


---------23:46----------
different way mskiff


---------23:47----------
if you didn't forget everything in 20


---------23:49----------
minutes what would your mind be like


---------23:52----------
what would have what would you have held


---------23:54----------
on to


---------23:56----------
memories yeah so good memories any


---------23:58----------
particular bad ones


---------24:02----------
hmm wait i realize it's kind of weird


---------24:05----------
because i'm asking you to remember that


---------24:06----------
which you


---------24:07----------
have forgot yeah and you're in a


---------24:10----------
reasonable situation i remember a lot of


---------24:13----------
bad memories with my


---------24:16----------
family not a lot of good ones though i


---------24:19----------
don't remember a lot of the good times i


---------24:21----------
just remember a lot of like


---------24:22----------
oh this person died i remember what


---------24:24----------
happened when this person died


---------24:26----------
or this guy died i don't really remember


---------24:28----------
when we had fun i just remember when he


---------24:30----------
died


---------24:31----------
or like my my dog died like a couple


---------24:34----------
months ago and i'm like


---------24:37----------
i don't remember and i remember all the


---------24:39----------
bad times like i had to go


---------24:41----------
catch him because he was in the highway


---------24:43----------
running around or


---------24:45----------
uh jumping on my neighbors and them


---------24:48----------
threatening to sue us


---------24:49----------
but i don't remember the times where you


---------24:50----------
just hang out i don't remember any of it


---------24:53----------
all i remember is him being horrible


---------24:58----------
so how do you understand that that it


---------25:00----------
seems like you actually hold on to a lot


---------25:02----------
of the bad


---------25:03----------
very little of the good yeah i don't


---------25:06----------
know


---------25:06----------
maybe it's because i i


---------25:16----------
i don't know why i do that but yeah i do


---------25:18----------
that i i think of a lot of the bad but


---------25:20----------
not the good


---------25:20----------
maybe it's because i'm


---------25:26----------
uh i don't know this might miss maybe a


---------25:29----------
stretch but


---------25:30----------
i'm very future like i i care a lot


---------25:33----------
about my future


---------25:34----------
i've always been like that like since a


---------25:35----------
young age i've always been caring about


---------25:37----------
you know what my future's gonna be like


---------25:39----------
when i'm like 30 or 40 or 50.


---------25:42----------
that's what i've cared about a lot is my


---------25:44----------
future not necessarily


---------25:46----------
my present like all


---------25:49----------
uh whether i like i was at a young age


---------25:51----------
and i was investing in stocks


---------25:53----------
i was saving money to invest in stocks


---------25:56----------
uh and


---------25:59----------
that kind of stuff so


---------26:02----------
help me understand you cared so much


---------26:05----------
about the future


---------26:06----------
why did you care so why do you care so


---------26:08----------
much uh


---------26:10----------
my parents made me tell me about that


---------26:15----------
their their accountants i mean their


---------26:17----------
their typical nine to five


---------26:19----------
go to work hate your job hate your life


---------26:24----------
mundane uh wake up at six in the morning


---------26:27----------
give your kids your food go to work at


---------26:30----------
eight o'clock


---------26:31----------
get home by six o'clock sit down watch


---------26:34----------
you know


---------26:34----------
cnn and go to bed by nine i mean it's a


---------26:37----------
very mundane boring life


---------26:40----------
and that's partially i became a streamer


---------26:41----------
because i saw that life and i'm like


---------26:43----------
god i don't want to be you because uh


---------26:47----------
you know i i know that they had a lot of


---------26:49----------
things that they really cared about and


---------26:51----------
a lot of things that they really wanted


---------26:52----------
to become and they


---------26:54----------
they never did any of it because they


---------26:57----------
were just stuck in their nine to five


---------26:59----------
jobs they never tried anything in life


---------27:03----------
sounds like yeah you weren't going to be


---------27:05----------
destined to be like that


---------27:08----------
well i actually was for a while i was


---------27:09----------
going to go to this place called


---------27:11----------
vanguard


---------27:12----------
and because i took a lot of adderall and


---------27:14----------
i was like


---------27:15----------
i took a lot of adderall i almost became


---------27:17----------
like a different person from taking it i


---------27:18----------
took it for six years


---------27:20----------
and i said to myself


---------27:23----------
like you know what i'll i'll i'll


---------27:26----------
do this route of life it's not bad


---------27:30----------
a job the nine to five is not a bad life


---------27:32----------
but


---------27:34----------
where's your mind right now i'm playing


---------27:36----------
with this thing


---------27:38----------
where's your mind though


---------27:41----------
or is it how i'm on telling the story


---------27:44----------
i'm trying to like


---------27:45----------
think of the story in my head it's like


---------27:47----------
it's like trying to like reach in my


---------27:49----------
head and


---------27:49----------
grab a story out of a out of a


---------27:53----------
container i don't know i i'm trying to


---------27:54----------
think of it it's hard yep yep so


---------27:57----------
let's pause because i think there's


---------27:58----------
something important here okay so


---------28:00----------
i i would say that oddly enough this is


---------28:02----------
the most focused you've been


---------28:04----------
since we've started talking yeah it's


---------28:07----------
because i started playing with this i'm


---------28:08----------
when i'm when i usually am playing with


---------28:10----------
something i'm


---------28:10----------
i'm focused more good how do you


---------28:13----------
understand that


---------28:14----------
uh because oddly enough when i was a


---------28:17----------
couple months ago is


---------28:18----------
all we did was play pokemon cards and


---------28:20----------
i've kept this deck


---------28:22----------
because if i'm ever feeling really adhd


---------28:26----------
i play with this deck and i just do this


---------28:29----------
and i think it almost like makes me


---------28:31----------
focus more because there's something


---------28:32----------
distracting me


---------28:34----------
i don't know i feel like a kid with


---------28:36----------
booboo keys but it i mean it does work


---------28:39----------
no no my friend you have just on your


---------28:41----------
own


---------28:42----------
discovered what's that


---------28:46----------
this one of the sanskrit words for


---------28:48----------
meditation


---------28:49----------
oh you've essentially discovered the


---------28:51----------
essence of meditation


---------28:53----------
all on your own without anyone teaching


---------28:55----------
you


---------28:57----------
it's re it's really a beautiful


---------28:59----------
discovery and i think your answer is


---------29:00----------
going to be right there


---------29:02----------
because you've learned how to focus


---------29:04----------
right so your mind is what it is we can


---------29:06----------
get upset about


---------29:07----------
whatever but what happens when you start


---------29:09----------
shuffling your pokemon cards


---------29:13----------
i it


---------29:16----------
[Music]


---------29:20----------
i don't i don't i don't know how to


---------29:22----------
describe it i don't know why it works


---------29:23----------
but it just does like when i play with


---------29:25----------
things it just makes me


---------29:26----------
focus more that i don't and i don't get


---------29:28----------
why so


---------29:29----------
the sanskrit the the yogi's had a word


---------29:31----------
for things like pokemon cards and that


---------29:33----------
strap


---------29:34----------
that word is alambana alambana means


---------29:38----------
support


---------29:40----------
so what they realize is that they're


---------29:41----------
like supports


---------29:43----------
for meditative practice and focusing the


---------29:45----------
mind


---------29:46----------
essentially i don't know exactly how


---------29:48----------
they figured this out but it must have


---------29:50----------
been some guy with adhd like yourself


---------29:52----------
who made an interesting observation


---------29:54----------
which is that when we have something


---------29:55----------
that sort of


---------29:56----------
demands our attention and we are kind of


---------29:58----------
fiddling with it


---------30:00----------
somehow that actually focuses it's like


---------30:02----------
this is the way i want you to think


---------30:03----------
about your mind miss gif


---------30:05----------
you've got a certain amount of ram the


---------30:07----------
problem is that you've got too much ram


---------30:09----------
for your own good


---------30:11----------
and then what happens is like you want


---------30:12----------
to be at 130 capacity all the time


---------30:15----------
and so like you've got these five or six


---------30:17----------
different processes that are going and


---------30:18----------
what you really need to focus


---------30:20----------
is something to take the excess mental


---------30:22----------
energy off


---------30:24----------
yeah and if you can offload some of that


---------30:26----------
excess mental energy


---------30:28----------
then you'll actually be able to focus


---------30:34----------
um


---------30:36----------
and that's you know it's interesting


---------30:37----------
when i when i'm doing speed running so


---------30:39----------
i don't know if you watch but i do a lot


---------30:40----------
of mario now when i i speed run


---------30:43----------
i actually feel more focused to my chat


---------30:48----------
than i do when i'm sitting full cam


---------30:51----------
talking to them


---------30:53----------
yep because it's almost like that fidget


---------30:56----------
thing that i'm playing with


---------30:59----------
is in a game yeah


---------31:02----------
so that's the alumna so as long as you


---------31:05----------
have


---------31:06----------
one thing so this is the way that i want


---------31:08----------
you to kind of think about it like


---------31:10----------
you run too fast for your own good so


---------31:12----------
what we need to do


---------31:13----------
is not and this is the real problem with


---------31:15----------
people with adhd is that they think that


---------31:17----------
they're like


---------31:18----------
stupid or something your problem is not


---------31:20----------
that your mind is too weak your problem


---------31:22----------
is that your mind is too strong


---------31:25----------
so in order to slow you down what we


---------31:27----------
need to do is like stick some weights on


---------31:28----------
your back we're gonna give you a


---------31:29----------
backpack full of bricks


---------31:32----------
and this is also the kind of thing where


---------31:33----------
like one of my teachers once taught me


---------31:35----------
this which is that i was failing when i


---------31:37----------
was doing like


---------31:38----------
one thing so in college i started


---------31:41----------
getting just straight f's like f-bombing


---------31:44----------
less than 1.0 gpa


---------31:46----------
i think my first semester of college and


---------31:48----------
so then my i was doing a bunch of [ __ ]


---------31:49----------
and then my dad was like you know cut


---------31:51----------
out all the extracurriculars don't run


---------31:52----------
for student government just focus on


---------31:54----------
your classes


---------31:55----------
and then i focus on my classes and my


---------31:57----------
gpa got worse


---------31:59----------
and then he's like okay like let's take


---------32:01----------
half a regular course load so like i'm


---------32:02----------
not doing any extracurriculars


---------32:04----------
not doing anything else i'm just going


---------32:05----------
to take like i'm going to be a half time


---------32:07----------
slow


---------32:08----------
you completely froze to me uh oh gg


---------32:11----------
yeah where'd i lose you there we go oh


---------32:15----------
and your camera looks so much better


---------32:18----------
do you remember where we were in the


---------32:20----------
story yes you


---------32:21----------
were saying how when you were a kid


---------32:23----------
you're


---------32:24----------
um when you were a kid you're


---------32:28----------
uh your dad told you to


---------32:31----------
when you're in college to not do all the


---------32:34----------
extra correct


---------32:37----------
all the extracurricular yep


---------32:40----------
extracurriculars yeah


---------32:42----------
and then you you stopped taking your


---------32:43----------
extracurricular activities and then you


---------32:45----------
did worse


---------32:45----------
yep and then then the next semester i


---------32:48----------
took like half a regular course load


---------32:50----------
and i still did worse and so one of my


---------32:53----------
one of my teachers i went to india then


---------32:54----------
and decided to become a monk and all


---------32:56----------
that good stuff and one of my teachers


---------32:57----------
was telling me that like


---------32:58----------
taking half a normal course load is a


---------33:00----------
terrible idea that


---------33:01----------
in order for my mind to be at peak


---------33:03----------
efficiency i need to be juggling


---------33:05----------
multiple balls


---------33:08----------
and so i think you're someone who's the


---------33:10----------
same way msgif


---------33:11----------
where like if your mind is actually


---------33:13----------
juggling multiple things you're going to


---------33:14----------
actually perform


---------33:15----------
even better and you just need


---------33:20----------
what can i do with that what how can i


---------33:22----------
be more present


---------33:25----------
you know like that like that that's my


---------33:29----------
real problem because i


---------33:30----------
i like i wish


---------33:35----------
you know like when you're eating food at


---------33:36----------
like a sushi restaurant or something


---------33:38----------
and it's like so good i don't i don't


---------33:41----------
feel that as much as like i feel like


---------33:44----------
everyone else does because i'm like


---------33:45----------
sitting i'm like i'm not enjoying this


---------33:46----------
as much as you are like


---------33:47----------
it's it's just food to me like and


---------33:49----------
that's why i'll eat literally almost


---------33:51----------
anything is because i just


---------33:52----------
to me it's just food when like people


---------33:55----------
like enjoy the tastes


---------33:56----------
and i feel like they're just there in


---------33:58----------
the moment and they're able to enjoy


---------34:00----------
that


---------34:00----------
taste and for me i can't do that i've


---------34:03----------
never been able to really enjoy it


---------34:04----------
and i that's what i really wish i could


---------34:06----------
fix is the feeling of


---------34:08----------
not being in the moment okay so


---------34:11----------
i think we can at least start you on the


---------34:13----------
road to that today


---------34:16----------
so two things that i would recommend one


---------34:18----------
is um and i'm happy to


---------34:20----------
send you one if you don't have one or


---------34:22----------
can't find one you have a set of prayer


---------34:23----------
beats


---------34:27----------
no okay so a couple things we can do


---------34:30----------
one is that i would recommend a practice


---------34:33----------
which is that you carry some prayer


---------34:34----------
beads around


---------34:35----------
and whenever you want to that is going


---------34:37----------
to be the thing that you distract


---------34:39----------
yourself with


---------34:40----------
it's going to be an alumna okay


---------34:43----------
so like what i want you to do is like


---------34:44----------
use a set of prayer beads


---------34:46----------
and if you want to i'll give you like a


---------34:48----------
mantra like a mantra or something like


---------34:50----------
that too


---------34:51----------
which is like something that you're


---------34:52----------
going to repeat to yourself as you use


---------34:53----------
the prayer beads it's going to be the


---------34:54----------
same thing as the pokemon cards


---------34:56----------
or the belt or whatever else does that


---------34:58----------
make sense


---------34:59----------
so a prayer beads it's not to pray it's


---------35:03----------
to


---------35:04----------
no it's not just to hold to hold and to


---------35:07----------
use


---------35:08----------
so i want you to repeat something to


---------35:10----------
yourself this is if you want to okay so


---------35:12----------
what i'm saying is that


---------35:13----------
instead of using random alumnis to use


---------35:16----------
one alumni and to use it over and over


---------35:19----------
and over and over and over and over and


---------35:21----------
over again


---------35:23----------
um that makes sense like a fidget thing


---------35:27----------
there's like a lot of fidget adhd toys


---------35:29----------
on on yep


---------35:30----------
exactly just like a fidget thing now


---------35:33----------
there is a particular tradition which


---------35:35----------
would argue that if you chant a


---------35:36----------
particular month or you use the set of


---------35:38----------
prayer beads


---------35:39----------
that it is superior to other kinds of


---------35:41----------
fidget things


---------35:43----------
i'll try it okay so that's one option


---------35:47----------
and so what i want you to do is just use


---------35:49----------
that as the excess ram


---------35:51----------
buffer so any amount of excess energy


---------35:53----------
that you have


---------35:55----------
you can go ahead and use that you can


---------35:56----------
carry carry it around with you you can


---------35:58----------
keep it on your wrist


---------35:59----------
the next time you eat sushi i want you


---------36:01----------
to pull it off your wrist


---------36:02----------
and then do that with one hand while you


---------36:04----------
eat the sushi with the other


---------36:06----------
i'm gonna look like i'm like like i'm


---------36:09----------
like


---------36:10----------
doing an exorcism off of my sushi but


---------36:12----------
i'll do it


---------36:13----------
try it and see what happens right so let


---------36:15----------
me ask you this if you were doing poke


---------36:17----------
if you were shuffling your pokemon cards


---------36:19----------
at the table


---------36:20----------
while you know your girlfriend fed you


---------36:22----------
sushi


---------36:23----------
do you think it would taste better


---------36:28----------
honestly probably yeah as weird as it


---------36:31----------
sounds i mean


---------36:33----------
that's why when fidget spinners came out


---------36:35----------
and people were like oh haha like this


---------36:36----------
is a funny


---------36:37----------
thing i was like this is sick


---------36:40----------
because it actually did help i remember


---------36:42----------
i had it in the hospital i'm like this


---------36:43----------
is cool because it actually


---------36:44----------
worked for me yeah um so that's


---------36:48----------
it made me feel more in the moment


---------36:52----------
i i didn't i didn't i wasn't aware that


---------36:53----------
you were in the hospital by the way but


---------36:55----------
um and then oh yeah it was


---------36:58----------
[Music]


---------37:00----------
it was it was when i i was in the


---------37:02----------
hospital for uh


---------37:06----------
i i have our condition you have what


---------37:10----------
a heart condition okay yeah it's called


---------37:13----------
viral myocarditis it's uh


---------37:15----------
because i took all my adderall for six


---------37:17----------
years and then


---------37:18----------
uh my heart got really weak and when my


---------37:21----------
heart got really weak


---------37:22----------
i started taking adderall or well that


---------37:24----------
made no sense


---------37:25----------
um i took out of all my heart got really


---------37:27----------
weak i


---------37:28----------
apparently they say i drank pool water


---------37:30----------
or something and it was contaminated


---------37:32----------
gave myself a virus in my heart and it's


---------37:34----------
there forever


---------37:36----------
and then one day while i was uh with my


---------37:38----------
friends the heart


---------37:39----------
virus came out more and i got really


---------37:42----------
really sick


---------37:43----------
uh it's hard to hear that man no yeah


---------37:46----------
it's fine i mean


---------37:47----------
i had a fidget spinner so it's okay


---------37:50----------
you said i thought you said something


---------37:52----------
about depersonalization


---------37:54----------
oh insane i i've always had


---------37:57----------
depersonalization issues


---------37:59----------
but i i think a lot of people with adhd


---------38:01----------
do it's just like um


---------38:04----------
i never feel like i'm really there it


---------38:06----------
goes back to that i just never feel like


---------38:07----------
i'm


---------38:10----------
it i i literally feel like


---------38:13----------
every day my life


---------38:17----------
it's just like


---------38:20----------
a wise man named john cerca says that


---------38:22----------
you know my life is like a movie but


---------38:24----------
for me my life feels like a movie where


---------38:26----------
i feel like i'm


---------38:28----------
not really there and i i think it's also


---------38:31----------
been personified over the past


---------38:34----------
couple years because i was once a twitch


---------38:37----------
viewer right it's all i did i just sat


---------38:39----------
there i watched twitch eight hours a day


---------38:41----------
nine hours a day i didn't type but i


---------38:42----------
just watched twitch


---------38:44----------
and over the past few years obviously


---------38:45----------
the growth has just been going up up up


---------38:47----------
up right


---------38:48----------
and um i


---------38:51----------
i think i used to say to myself when i


---------38:54----------
was in my and and


---------38:55----------
back in when a couple years ago i would


---------38:57----------
be like


---------38:58----------
man if how does justin bieber feel like


---------39:01----------
life is real


---------39:02----------
you know like how does he not feel like


---------39:04----------
that his life is


---------39:06----------
like fake or that it's some kind of like


---------39:09----------
[ __ ] because this dude's


---------39:12----------
you know got millions of dollars


---------39:14----------
everyone knows his name why him you know


---------39:16----------
same with these streamers why them and


---------39:18----------
then it makes me think like


---------39:19----------
uh i i always had to see personalization


---------39:22----------
issues but i think it's got even worse


---------39:24----------
now because it's like


---------39:25----------
why me with this massive growth of


---------39:28----------
twitch


---------39:29----------
and i don't get any of it and it makes


---------39:31----------
me feel like almost


---------39:33----------
like i like why like does that make


---------39:36----------
sense


---------39:37----------
yeah it makes a lot of sense yeah


---------39:41----------
so this is kind of going to be weird but


---------39:44----------
um you know we can talk a little bit


---------39:45----------
more about the depersonalization in a


---------39:46----------
second


---------39:47----------
the second thing that i'm going to ask


---------39:48----------
you to do is to go one level meta


---------39:51----------
so if you can't enjoy the sushi can you


---------39:54----------
at least be


---------39:54----------
present with your scattered mind


---------39:59----------
that's hard too what do you mean by that


---------40:04----------
i like as we're talking right now


---------40:08----------
it's it's just i don't know like it's


---------40:10----------
almost like there's layers


---------40:12----------
of different things that i'm think


---------40:16----------
down here like let's say up here is


---------40:19----------
present time right


---------40:20----------
and like there's just layers of stuff


---------40:23----------
that my brain is just constantly


---------40:24----------
thinking about it's not just like one


---------40:26----------
thing


---------40:27----------
right now i'm thinking of camp laszlo


---------40:29----------
and mitch jones


---------40:30----------
okay i don't know why okay biscuit


---------40:32----------
perfect so let me ask you something


---------40:35----------
how are you aware that there are layers


---------40:41----------
um because


---------40:45----------
i i guess like over like


---------40:48----------
thinking of it about it over i mean i've


---------40:50----------
had it for so long i've just thought


---------40:51----------
about it it's just


---------40:52----------
you know the idea of some things are


---------40:54----------
much more apparent in my mind right now


---------40:56----------
like i was like this is like layer one


---------40:59----------
when like layer four is like


---------41:01----------
camp laszlo or mitch jones yeah so so


---------41:05----------
you say you've thought about it sort of


---------41:08----------
right so let's be clear on


---------41:09----------
on what that means and i'm going to put


---------41:11----------
something forward because i could be


---------41:12----------
wrong here


---------41:13----------
but what i would say is that what you've


---------41:14----------
thought about is making


---------41:16----------
sense of your experience


---------41:19----------
but there still remains the fact that


---------41:21----------
you are the


---------41:22----------
the raw data of different layers of


---------41:25----------
consciousness


---------41:27----------
are there so there's still a part of you


---------41:30----------
that like is observing the surface


---------41:34----------
thoughts the deeper thoughts and like


---------41:36----------
the subsurface thoughts


---------41:41----------
yeah it feels like yeah it's like i'm


---------41:44----------
here like looking down my layers i don't


---------41:47----------
know it's so it's so complicated


---------41:49----------
yep but i i do feel like i'm like


---------41:50----------
looking at my layers so then


---------41:52----------
so let me ask you something what is the


---------41:54----------
you who is doing the looking


---------41:56----------
in that moment


---------42:00----------
like my i guess


---------42:08----------
i feel like this is an sat question i


---------42:10----------
don't know


---------42:12----------
it's it's it's what just what do you


---------42:14----------
think it is just start talking


---------42:16----------
you're more right than you realize um


---------42:19----------
when you say is right it's like


---------42:22----------
i i guess it's it's it feels like it's


---------42:24----------
probably me right


---------42:26----------
like my body and then my brain


---------42:30----------
is like the layers yep


---------42:34----------
right so i would describe it yeah so


---------42:36----------
let's just so that's a beautiful way to


---------42:38----------
put it so i'm gonna


---------42:38----------
rephrase a little bit so what you're


---------42:41----------
saying is that there's something i'm


---------42:42----------
gonna call your brain your mind


---------42:44----------
okay because you can't really see your


---------42:48----------
brain what you can see is your mind


---------42:50----------
which is like your thoughts


---------42:51----------
and then i'm i'm i'm so we're just going


---------42:54----------
to say that there's something


---------42:55----------
outside of your mind that is observing


---------42:58----------
the actions of your mind


---------43:01----------
and whereas most human beings are sort


---------43:03----------
of just aware of one layer of their mind


---------43:05----------
right like so


---------43:06----------
even if we think about something like


---------43:07----------
subconscious processing like


---------43:09----------
i'm gonna go to sleep one night i'm


---------43:11----------
gonna worry about a problem and then


---------43:13----------
when i wake up


---------43:14----------
i have no conscious recollection of it


---------43:17----------
but my unconscious is kind of working on


---------43:19----------
it and then eventually i'll come to an


---------43:20----------
answer


---------43:21----------
does that make sense


---------43:25----------
sorry okay so like most human beings are


---------43:28----------
not aware of their subconscious


---------43:29----------
processes


---------43:30----------
whereas you are oh god


---------43:37----------
that makes sense right so like let's


---------43:40----------
think about someone who's like


---------43:42----------
getting cold feet before a wedding and


---------43:44----------
they wake up the morning of and they're


---------43:46----------
like you know what i can't go through


---------43:47----------
with it


---------43:49----------
even though on the surface they've been


---------43:50----------
like planning their wedding for the last


---------43:52----------
60 days


---------43:54----------
subsurface there's been some like


---------43:58----------
churning of thoughts and feelings that


---------44:00----------
they've been completely unaware of which


---------44:02----------
is why


---------44:03----------
how they got to wedding day in the first


---------44:04----------
place but then they wake up on the day


---------44:06----------
of the wedding they're like [ __ ] it i


---------44:07----------
can't do this this person isn't right


---------44:08----------
for me does that make sense


---------44:10----------
yeah but i and i'm able to


---------44:14----------
see those layers yeah that doesn't make


---------44:16----------
sense


---------44:17----------
and so the interesting thing there is


---------44:19----------
that like if we think about someone


---------44:20----------
who's absorbed in sushi


---------44:22----------
they're just absorbed at the surface


---------44:24----------
layer of mind whereas your problem is


---------44:26----------
that


---------44:26----------
your attention is fractured by like all


---------44:28----------
of these other layers of mind that


---------44:30----------
you're observing


---------44:35----------
so what can i do it's a good question


---------44:38----------
so the first thing is can you sit with


---------44:41----------
the part of you and be present with the


---------44:44----------
part of you that


---------44:45----------
notices the fracturing


---------44:48----------
so you're saying that you're you're my


---------44:51----------
your life is like a movie


---------44:53----------
movie right and you're watching


---------44:56----------
can you be present in the and you're


---------44:58----------
looking at someone watching like you're


---------44:59----------
you're watching a movie of someone


---------45:00----------
eating sushi and you're like man like


---------45:03----------
that person on the screen is really


---------45:04----------
enjoying the sushi but i can't taste it


---------45:06----------
sitting in the theater


---------45:08----------
that's what your life is like right yeah


---------45:12----------
and so then the question is can you sit


---------45:15----------
with the person who's in the theater


---------45:16----------
fully


---------45:21----------
like fully be able to like back up and


---------45:25----------
see everything


---------45:27----------
yeah or just sit with the observer


---------45:30----------
it's so hard i've tried i've tried


---------45:32----------
everything i i've


---------45:34----------
i have tried everything when it comes to


---------45:35----------
this stuff i don't know


---------45:37----------
sure i guess i feel like i have no i


---------45:39----------
believe you


---------45:40----------
i think you've i think you've come a


---------45:42----------
very long way on your own and without


---------45:44----------
any help yeah


---------45:47----------
and i i think it's gotten worse it's


---------45:49----------
only going to get worse


---------45:50----------
for to and trying to not


---------45:54----------
trying to be like in the theater rather


---------45:56----------
than


---------45:57----------
it's it's it's honestly going to get


---------45:58----------
harder for me or it's gotten harder


---------46:00----------
because


---------46:02----------
like i mean i don't think technology


---------46:05----------
really helps i mean like there's like


---------46:06----------
seven different


---------46:07----------
monitors and like six cat cams or


---------46:09----------
whatever like there's a billion


---------46:10----------
different things that just draw your


---------46:12----------
attention as well so it's even harder to


---------46:13----------
feel like you're present or


---------46:14----------
harder to really understand your


---------46:16----------
emotions um


---------46:18----------
what i've noticed the best way to do it


---------46:20----------
is i is and to really understand what


---------46:22----------
i'm thinking about is to almost


---------46:24----------
i close my eyes a lot to understand it


---------46:29----------
so that way i'm not looking at anything


---------46:31----------
and the only thing i could possibly


---------46:32----------
focus on


---------46:33----------
is my brain or my mind


---------46:37----------
okay let me just think about this for a


---------46:41----------
second


---------46:43----------
if you have to close your eyes i get it


---------46:48----------
no so uh actually um misc if i'm like


---------46:51----------
you


---------46:52----------
and i need my i need the random sensory


---------46:55----------
input


---------46:56----------
from my eyes to offload my access ram


---------47:01----------
so it actually helps me to have eyes


---------47:03----------
open and like look at all kinds of


---------47:04----------
random things


---------47:05----------
sometimes my patients think i'm not


---------47:06----------
paying attention because my mind has to


---------47:08----------
just like


---------47:08----------
look around at random [ __ ] um that's


---------47:11----------
interesting yeah for me


---------47:12----------
it's the more random should i look at


---------47:15----------
the more i start thinking of random


---------47:16----------
stuff and the worse it gets if i close


---------47:18----------
my eyes


---------47:19----------
and i'm able to like i mean there's


---------47:22----------
there's nothing i can look at


---------47:23----------
right when my eyes are closed um


---------47:27----------
so it's a lot easier for me to think in


---------47:29----------
my mind


---------47:31----------
or try to understand or be more present


---------47:33----------
but i don't want to be blind


---------47:35----------
um yeah so it sounds like it's very hard


---------47:39----------
for you to sit with


---------47:40----------
just sitting in the theater yeah can you


---------47:44----------
start everywhere can you be present in


---------47:46----------
the theater


---------47:48----------
i'm not talking about being present with


---------47:50----------
the sushi i'm talking about being


---------47:51----------
present


---------47:52----------
with the thing that notices that you're


---------47:55----------
not present with the sushi


---------48:02----------
i don't think i've ever been present


---------48:03----------
anywhere okay


---------48:06----------
okay so you also


---------48:10----------
sound kind of hopeless to me yeah


---------48:18----------
kind of


---------48:22----------
hey i don't know i just did i


---------48:25----------
i i feel like i've tried this for so


---------48:27----------
long and i actually was excited as a kid


---------48:29----------
to grow up because i was excited that


---------48:31----------
hopefully adhd would get less


---------48:33----------
and like not as bad but it just stayed


---------48:34----------
the same and


---------48:36----------
um i feel like


---------48:40----------
i've tried so much are you still taking


---------48:43----------
stimulant medication if you don't mind


---------48:44----------
oh no no i stopped that years ago uh


---------48:48----------
like three years ago i can't uh


---------48:51----------
because my heart condition i wasn't able


---------48:52----------
to take adderall yeah


---------48:54----------
so how do you think what do you think


---------48:56----------
has happened to your attention since you


---------48:58----------
stopped the medication


---------49:00----------
uh it's gotten worse but what's crazy is


---------49:02----------
even when i was on the medication it's


---------49:04----------
not like i was like


---------49:05----------
wow like this is what real life feels


---------49:07----------
like i almost like was still


---------49:09----------
on the outer scope of myself and i'm


---------49:10----------
like inside a robot suit and the robot


---------49:13----------
was able to do everything but i was


---------49:14----------
stuck inside the robot


---------49:16----------
suit just watching myself do all the


---------49:18----------
work


---------49:19----------
um i didn't feel really even present


---------49:22----------
while on adderall i just felt like


---------49:23----------
i was able to work this is gonna be hard


---------49:26----------
but just stay with me okay


---------49:28----------
so here's the problem so you're inside


---------49:31----------
the robot suit


---------49:32----------
and what you're trying to do is grasp


---------49:34----------
the full experience of the robot


---------49:37----------
yes right so what i'm telling you to do


---------49:40----------
is instead of even trying to grasp the


---------49:42----------
full experience of the robot


---------49:44----------
grasp the full experience of the dude


---------49:45----------
inside the robot suit


---------49:47----------
so you want me to instead of trying to


---------49:50----------
yeah


---------49:50----------
so instead of trying to instead focus


---------49:54----------
yeah just focus on the inside not on the


---------49:56----------
outside yep so like i know this is gonna


---------49:59----------
sound weird


---------50:00----------
but instead of saying oh man i wish i


---------50:02----------
could really enjoy this sushi right now


---------50:05----------
say to yourself oh look i'm someone who


---------50:09----------
can't enjoy the sushi right now


---------50:13----------
that sucks


---------50:16----------
that's what it sounds like i completely


---------50:19----------
agree


---------50:20----------
it does suck


---------50:25----------
but this that this kit this is going to


---------50:28----------
be hard but follow me okay


---------50:30----------
because you're not enjoying the sushi


---------50:32----------
anyway so you're not a problem


---------50:34----------
the problem here is that you've got two


---------50:36----------
things working against you one is that


---------50:37----------
you can't enjoy the sushi


---------50:39----------
and the second is that you beat yourself


---------50:41----------
up for not being able to enjoy the sushi


---------50:44----------
yeah i all the time i even while


---------50:46----------
everyone else is enjoying the sushi i'm


---------50:49----------
so it adds another like think of the


---------50:51----------
layers it adds another layer what i'm


---------50:52----------
saying myself


---------50:54----------
like i'm already thinking of jimmy


---------50:55----------
neutron you know


---------50:57----------
mitch jones dancing add another layer


---------50:59----------
the other layer is


---------51:00----------
wow now everyone is enjoying the sushi


---------51:02----------
and having fun and i'm sitting here


---------51:04----------
in my own head and i can't think of


---------51:06----------
anything okay so let me ask you a wild


---------51:08----------
question


---------51:08----------
which of the layers do you think


---------51:10----------
interferes with your enjoyment of the


---------51:11----------
sushi the most


---------51:13----------
uh the one that's at the top which is


---------51:15----------
one


---------51:17----------
i mean they all do to a sense but


---------51:19----------
definitely the one where i'm not


---------51:20----------
i'm thinking to myself about all the


---------51:22----------
other layers and i'm like damn


---------51:24----------
that top layer i'm like i can't enjoy


---------51:26----------
this [ __ ] um


---------51:28----------
yeah so just think about that for a


---------51:30----------
second what i'm telling you to do


---------51:31----------
is accept that you can't enjoy the sushi


---------51:34----------
because the problem is that when you


---------51:36----------
beat yourself up for not enjoying the


---------51:38----------
sushi


---------51:39----------
it creates tension and a rift in your


---------51:41----------
mind


---------51:42----------
tension and rift in internal warring in


---------51:44----------
the mind is the very


---------51:46----------
opposite of mindfulness it's the very


---------51:48----------
opposite of presence


---------51:50----------
when you're warring with your mind


---------51:52----------
you're not present at all


---------51:54----------
so the issue is how how do you get rid


---------51:56----------
of that top layer


---------51:58----------
how do you get rid of beating yourself


---------52:00----------
up for not like it's kind of like a


---------52:01----------
self-defeating prophecy because you're


---------52:03----------
not enjoying the sushi so you beat


---------52:04----------
yourself up and by beating yourself up


---------52:06----------
you're not unable to enjoy the sushi


---------52:07----------
because that's the top layer of mind


---------52:10----------
yeah i feel


---------52:15----------
that's crazy i almost want to draw this


---------52:17----------
out because i feel like


---------52:20----------
hmm i wish i had like a piece of paper


---------52:22----------
go get your paper in a pen


---------52:24----------
just like last time bro go i'm going


---------52:28----------
[Music]


---------52:30----------
now we're getting somewhere


---------52:36----------
[Music]


---------52:56----------
[Music]


---------53:02----------
okay


---------53:06----------
all right so i got this


---------53:10----------
because i feel like chat or that and


---------53:12----------
people in general are not to understand


---------53:13----------
we're talking about


---------53:14----------
pretty much how it feels is let's say


---------53:20----------
this is me


---------53:23----------
right obviously my legs are a little bit


---------53:25----------
shorter but


---------53:26----------
this is how my mind feels it's like


---------53:30----------
there's layers


---------53:37----------
and this and let's say everyone is up


---------53:39----------
here enjoying sushi


---------53:42----------
having fun i feel like


---------53:46----------
most people maybe have like one or two


---------53:49----------
layers of issues


---------53:50----------
or things that they're thinking about


---------53:52----------
when for me


---------53:53----------
or someone with adhd it's like we have


---------53:58----------
you know five different layers


---------54:01----------
of problems like down here is just a


---------54:05----------
you know a random song over this one


---------54:08----------
is just like camp laszlo for some reason


---------54:11----------
i don't know why but i'm just randomly


---------54:12----------
thinking about it


---------54:14----------
and these are all constantly switching


---------54:16----------
around with my thoughts


---------54:18----------
all the time and it's just constant but


---------54:21----------
then


---------54:21----------
but the more the layers go up the more


---------54:25----------
that it's prominent in my mind at the


---------54:27----------
time this number one


---------54:29----------
is usually why can't


---------54:35----------
i'm terrible at writing i be


---------54:40----------
present and that's caused


---------54:43----------
because of all these other layers


---------54:46----------
that are making me not present so what


---------54:50----------
you're saying is instead of caring about


---------54:53----------
why can't i be present


---------54:55----------
focus on these these layers


---------54:58----------
nope that's not what i'm saying what i'm


---------55:01----------
saying


---------55:01----------
is be present with layer number one


---------55:06----------
so be present here yeah just sit with


---------55:09----------
yourself and acknowledge


---------55:12----------
oh miss gif is someone that cannot enjoy


---------55:15----------
sushi alas


---------55:16----------
i am cursed so be it look at everyone


---------55:19----------
else enjoying that sushi and here i am


---------55:21----------
being unable to enjoy it


---------55:23----------
because of the activity of my mind i


---------55:25----------
want you to be the person


---------55:26----------
in the audience who is watching the


---------55:29----------
movie where the dude is not enjoying the


---------55:32----------
sushi


---------55:34----------
because the problems huh the movie sucks


---------55:37----------
i don't want to do that


---------55:39----------
there's your problem so it sounds to me


---------55:42----------
like you've tried everything


---------55:43----------
under the sun except this


---------55:47----------
yeah so here's what you need to do to


---------55:50----------
move past it mischief


---------55:52----------
you need to grieve and i think that


---------55:55----------
you don't know how to grieve and the


---------55:57----------
reason that you don't know how to grieve


---------55:59----------
is because your mind from a very very


---------56:00----------
young age


---------56:01----------
taught you how to forget


---------56:05----------
and that's why you don't remember


---------56:09----------
so when something bad happens to you


---------56:12----------
your mind


---------56:13----------
is a survival mechanism has learned how


---------56:15----------
to forget


---------56:17----------
yeah and so what you need to do is


---------56:22----------
learn how to sit with your inability to


---------56:24----------
sit with something


---------56:27----------
and so you can still be present see like


---------56:30----------
i think this is


---------56:31----------
really good it's hard don't get me wrong


---------56:34----------
this is like


---------56:35----------
this is like the silver bullet okay and


---------56:37----------
there are going to be easier ways that


---------56:38----------
we can get you to this remember i told


---------56:40----------
you about the mala first


---------56:43----------
but if you can learn how to sit with


---------56:45----------
your inability to sit with something


---------56:48----------
what you're still doing is learning how


---------56:50----------
to sit with something


---------56:53----------
to be present with your scattered mind


---------56:56----------
yeah i i will uh so you're saying


---------57:00----------
i have always been trying to figure out


---------57:04----------
how to stop these layers


---------57:07----------
when i should realize by now


---------57:10----------
that's not gonna happen and what i


---------57:12----------
should focus on instead of


---------57:15----------
you know that is


---------57:18----------
just focus on the fact that i can't this


---------57:21----------
is


---------57:21----------
this is what yeah so i know it sounds


---------57:23----------
weird


---------57:24----------
but this is what you're trying to do so


---------57:26----------
like my kids the other day i


---------57:28----------
i told them that they were in the bath


---------57:30----------
and i told them hey i want to show you


---------57:32----------
something really cool but the water in


---------57:33----------
the bathtub has to be still


---------57:35----------
and so they're playing in the bathtub


---------57:36----------
and i'm like the water in the bathtub


---------57:38----------
has to be still before we put this boat


---------57:39----------
in the bathtub


---------57:40----------
and so what they try to do is push the


---------57:42----------
waves down and what happens when they do


---------57:44----------
that


---------57:48----------
they wait push the waves yeah down


---------57:51----------
yep they create more waves absolutely


---------57:55----------
wow that was a very beautiful way of


---------57:57----------
saying it so


---------57:58----------
here you are with the top layer of your


---------58:02----------
mind


---------58:02----------
trying to push all of the waves of the


---------58:04----------
other or the other part of the mind down


---------58:06----------
push it down baby you guys [ __ ] stop


---------58:09----------
with camp laszlo i'm trying to enjoy


---------58:10----------
sushi here


---------58:14----------
[ __ ] camp laszlo and that creates


---------58:17----------
tension in the mind


---------58:18----------
that creates a war in the mind and then


---------58:20----------
you wonder why you can't enjoy


---------58:22----------
sushi yeah


---------58:25----------
so a calm mind can enjoy things and the


---------58:27----------
problem


---------58:28----------
is that at the top the biggest thing is


---------58:30----------
why can't i be


---------58:31----------
present and what i'm telling you if you


---------58:34----------
want that to go away


---------58:36----------
accept it it'll melt yeah maybe you're


---------58:39----------
right because i i feel like my whole


---------58:41----------
life is just


---------58:42----------
it literally this is what it feels like


---------58:43----------
all the time and what's odd


---------58:46----------
is whatever i have and this is what i


---------58:47----------
think some people might understand


---------58:49----------
like let's say if i have a toy that i'm


---------58:51----------
playing with in my head


---------58:53----------
that this whole thing goes from like


---------58:55----------
five layers to just kind of almost


---------58:57----------
one or two which is toy


---------59:01----------
and then thoughts and then maybe


---------59:05----------
maybe another layer which is just like


---------59:07----------
camping


---------59:08----------
like okay okay so misskip this is


---------59:10----------
important


---------59:11----------
when you play with the toy you're not


---------59:15----------
fighting anything yeah


---------59:18----------
that's what reduces the number of layers


---------59:24----------
you're removing tension from the mind


---------59:26----------
you're offloading energy instead of two


---------59:28----------
parts warring with each other


---------59:30----------
one of the armies goes off and


---------59:33----------
spins a fidget spinner and when it goes


---------59:36----------
off


---------59:37----------
and spins a fidget the tension in the


---------59:39----------
mind reduces you remove the excess


---------59:41----------
energy and your mind is left in a calmer


---------59:43----------
state


---------59:44----------
it's almost like when your kids instead


---------59:46----------
of fighting the waves


---------59:47----------
they're just playing with the boat the


---------59:50----------
waves calm down


---------59:51----------
absolutely absolutely


---------59:54----------
so i need more toys


---------59:59----------
so the mala is one toy that you can


---------60:02----------
train to use so that


---------60:03----------
other so a couple of principles here


---------60:05----------
sure you need more toys


---------60:07----------
but there is a there's a hypothesis that


---------60:09----------
you can actually


---------60:11----------
level up with one toy and that the more


---------60:14----------
you level up with that toy


---------60:16----------
the stronger it becomes at like reducing


---------60:18----------
different layers of your mind


---------60:20----------
yeah i agree i i think uh


---------60:25----------
a good adhd toy would be nice and yeah


---------60:28----------
i i think that that makes a lot of sense


---------60:31----------
is


---------60:32----------
if i'm able instead of trying to fight


---------60:34----------
the waves just go with them


---------60:36----------
or and and the waves will melt


---------60:40----------
because if you're trying to fight waves


---------60:42----------
you can't fight the wave like


---------60:43----------
i and you're right whenever i'm in this


---------60:46----------
moment of like my friends enjoying sushi


---------60:48----------
i'm always


---------60:49----------
mainly thinking about like [ __ ] i'm not


---------60:51----------
enjoying this


---------60:52----------
at all i am not enjoying the sushi


---------60:54----------
they're enjoying it that's why it tastes


---------60:56----------
so much better to them than me


---------60:57----------
and that these problems still happen but


---------61:00----------
this one is


---------61:01----------
so prominent if i just you know


---------61:04----------
be in my mind instead yeah it can make a


---------61:06----------
big difference


---------61:08----------
let me ask you what hap the harder you


---------61:10----------
try to enjoy the sushi what happens


---------61:14----------
i the less i enjoy it because i'm


---------61:16----------
overthinking absolutely


---------61:19----------
so if the harder you try to fight it the


---------61:21----------
less your enjoyment happens what i'm


---------61:23----------
telling you to do is [ __ ] embrace it


---------61:25----------
baby


---------61:26----------
sit with yourself being unable to enjoy


---------61:28----------
it it's the


---------61:29----------
going to the opposite end of the


---------61:30----------
spectrum because the more that you add


---------61:33----------
energy to your mind the greater the


---------61:34----------
conflict is going to be


---------61:36----------
you're just pumping energy into this


---------61:38----------
existing pattern of conflict in your


---------61:39----------
mind


---------61:42----------
i won't fight it i won't fight it


---------61:45----------
anymore


---------61:45----------
i will play that episode of camp laszlo


---------61:48----------
that's been in my head


---------61:50----------
it's gonna be tough because your entire


---------61:52----------
life you have learned your mind has


---------61:54----------
become habituated to fighting it


---------61:57----------
yeah it's so bad it's all i think about


---------61:59----------
so it's i'll think about it even while


---------62:01----------
i'm streaming i'm like


---------62:02----------
why am i not like everyone's like watch


---------62:04----------
a video


---------62:05----------
and and everyone's like oh but this


---------62:07----------
happened this video and this i'm like


---------62:09----------
but miss gif bro do you get it so you


---------62:11----------
say that i do this all the time my mind


---------62:13----------
does it all the time


---------62:15----------
exactly why do you think you can't be


---------62:17----------
present ever


---------62:21----------
the two go hand in hand


---------62:25----------
yeah what are you fighting in your mind


---------62:29----------
when you take a piss when your bladder


---------62:31----------
is full


---------62:34----------
nothing there's your presence


---------62:45----------
so from now on instead of trying to


---------62:47----------
fight this


---------62:49----------
just relax and i'll relax


---------62:53----------
and i'll i'll i'll understand i will be


---------62:56----------
instead of fighting it i will go with it


---------62:58----------
which is the exact opposite yeah that's


---------63:00----------
why i've never been able to enjoy it so


---------63:02----------
instead of fighting why can't i


---------63:04----------
embrace it because it's never going to


---------63:05----------
change i'm 25 years old


---------63:07----------
and i obviously have never it's never


---------63:09----------
been able to change


---------63:10----------
embrace the fact that i can't be present


---------63:14----------
and just not be present be the guy in


---------63:16----------
the movie theater that's sitting there


---------63:18----------
be the guy that's watching everybody


---------63:20----------
else it is what it is


---------63:22----------
and that is the most present that i'll


---------63:23----------
be able to feel is because


---------63:25----------
that is who i am right yes beautiful


---------63:30----------
but toys would be good yeah so i want


---------63:32----------
you to draw an eyeball


---------63:34----------
at the top right of your board


---------63:37----------
yeah it doesn't have to be so far up but


---------63:42----------
sure


---------63:45----------
okay so this is the other thing i want


---------63:47----------
you to notice is that this eyeball


---------63:48----------
is looking at your mind right so


---------63:52----------
layers one through five and layers one


---------63:54----------
through three there is an observing


---------63:56----------
capacity the eyeball is the dude in the


---------63:57----------
theater


---------63:59----------
do you understand that yeah so what i


---------64:02----------
want you to do is


---------64:03----------
sit with the eyeball sit with the dude


---------64:06----------
in the theater


---------64:07----------
and then miss gif i'm gonna let you in


---------64:09----------
on a huge secret bro


---------64:11----------
you are watching the one movie where you


---------64:14----------
can actually taste


---------64:15----------
a little bit of the sushi


---------64:23----------
that sounds nice right


---------64:26----------
now be you know be careful because you


---------64:28----------
can fall into the same trap with


---------64:30----------
relaxing you said i'm just gonna relax


---------64:32----------
because then when you try to relax what


---------64:35----------
are you gonna do


---------64:36----------
to yourself what's your mind trained to


---------64:38----------
do


---------64:40----------
freak out yes


---------64:43----------
it's going to say oh my god miss give i


---------64:46----------
should be relaxing


---------64:47----------
why can't i relax god damn it relax


---------64:51----------
so then what you sit with is oh look


---------64:54----------
this guy on the screen is freaking the


---------64:55----------
[ __ ] out because he can't chill


---------65:00----------
this [ __ ] dude sucks for him


---------65:03----------
yeah oh you're right so i gotta focus


---------65:08----------
this eye which is me


---------65:13----------
and then hopefully more the toys i do


---------65:15----------
think the toys really do help something


---------65:16----------
to fidget with really just make a


---------65:18----------
massive difference


---------65:18----------
yep yep yep and i think that's really


---------65:22----------
good i think that actually helped me a


---------65:23----------
lot


---------65:24----------
one thing i've also noticed that helps a


---------65:25----------
lot with my depersonalization or not


---------65:27----------
feeling like i'm really there in the


---------65:28----------
moment


---------65:28----------
is touch like i will i will literally


---------65:31----------
sometimes


---------65:32----------
like i i so i was with my brother and


---------65:35----------
you know what you're actually 100 right


---------65:37----------
i was at my brother's house in jersey


---------65:39----------
and um


---------65:42----------
i was trying to force myself to enjoy


---------65:45----------
the moment because i'm so


---------65:46----------
adhd that i was like [ __ ] i am not


---------65:49----------
enjoying this moment as much as i should


---------65:51----------
i should be relaxing with my brother


---------65:53----------
that i haven't seen in so long


---------65:55----------
and just hang out with them and i


---------65:57----------
couldn't do that because the whole time


---------65:58----------
i'm thinking to myself


---------66:00----------
[ __ ] i need to relax which resulted in


---------66:02----------
the me


---------66:03----------
messing with the waves and not enjoying


---------66:05----------
it um


---------66:08----------
and what i've noticed what helped me a


---------66:10----------
little bit


---------66:11----------
is when i touched the railing at his


---------66:14----------
house it's gonna sound so weird


---------66:15----------
i started touching his railing that


---------66:17----------
sounded really weird


---------66:19----------
and um when i when i


---------66:22----------
held on the railing it the touch of


---------66:24----------
something


---------66:25----------
actually made me he's not my step bro


---------66:27----------
don't worry the the


---------66:29----------
touch of the railing made me come back a


---------66:31----------
little bit to reality


---------66:32----------
um and i also think that it was not just


---------66:34----------
the touch maybe


---------66:36----------
feel more in the present but it was also


---------66:38----------
kind of counting as a toy


---------66:40----------
because it was like yeah it almost comes


---------66:43----------
goes that toy factor


---------66:44----------
which made me feel more present yeah so


---------66:47----------
so this is


---------66:48----------
exactly because the touch is an alumni


---------66:51----------
what happens is when you touch


---------66:53----------
and you focus on the touch the excess


---------66:56----------
energy of your mind goes into your sense


---------66:58----------
of touch instead of fueling your


---------67:00----------
conflict


---------67:01----------
yeah and the moment you stop fueling


---------67:03----------
your internal conflict you start to feel


---------67:05----------
better


---------67:12----------
so just embrace it right so


---------67:16----------
and yeah i think the thing with the


---------67:17----------
relaxing is true because i think a lot


---------67:19----------
of people


---------67:20----------
in general and me too as well i'll be


---------67:22----------
sitting there being like ugh


---------67:24----------
time to relax but like i'll almost be


---------67:26----------
like oh my god i only have two hours to


---------67:27----------
relax i have to start then you start


---------67:29----------
freaking out you're like


---------67:30----------
[ __ ] i gotta relax yep yep


---------67:33----------
if i don't go to sleep now i'm going to


---------67:34----------
be tired in the morning oh [ __ ]


---------67:36----------
i better go to the start freaking out


---------67:37----------
yeah if i if i sleep now i'll still get


---------67:39----------
four hours of sleep


---------67:40----------
oh [ __ ] now i'm not even gonna get four


---------67:42----------
hours of sleep


---------67:44----------
yep it's tension fuels the conflict of


---------67:46----------
the mind


---------67:47----------
a relaxed mind and a relaxed mind


---------67:50----------
happens through acceptance so


---------67:51----------
don't get me wrong miss gif what i'm


---------67:52----------
telling you to do in a


---------67:54----------
sit with the eye is very hard yeah


---------67:57----------
this is why it's actually fascinating to


---------68:00----------
hear you say this because


---------68:01----------
there are literally books on meditation


---------68:03----------
which describe


---------68:04----------
all these techniques that you have


---------68:06----------
discovered


---------68:08----------
closing of the eyes reducing your


---------68:10----------
because you've done both where you


---------68:12----------
reduce your sensory input


---------68:14----------
and you focus your sensory input on one


---------68:17----------
thing


---------68:18----------
and i would venture that when you touch


---------68:19----------
the railing you see less


---------68:22----------
and then if you touch the yeah it's cool


---------68:25----------
like


---------68:26----------
like misc if i don't think you're cursed


---------68:27----------
i think you're gifted it's just the


---------68:29----------
problem is that you just don't know it


---------68:31----------
yet


---------68:32----------
i know i'm gifted for sure i mean i i


---------68:35----------
know there's a gift with adhd


---------68:36----------
adhd is a blessing and a curse it's a


---------68:38----------
double-edged sword i mean you you're


---------68:40----------
definitely a more creative person your


---------68:42----------
mind is definitely all over the place


---------68:43----------
and you get more creative and you're


---------68:45----------
more sporadic and um and then all that


---------68:48----------
jazz


---------68:48----------
but there's a curse to it too where it's


---------68:51----------
your


---------68:52----------
your own worst enemy and you're


---------68:54----------
constantly having to deal with these


---------68:55----------
problems


---------68:57----------
yeah so i think that that's it's a good


---------68:59----------
way of looking at it because i think at


---------69:01----------
the end of the day there's no such thing


---------69:02----------
as a gift and there's no such thing as a


---------69:04----------
curse you just are what you are it's it


---------69:06----------
is what it is


---------69:07----------
right and if we kind of extend that


---------69:09----------
thinking


---------69:11----------
you know you are what you are and if you


---------69:13----------
can't enjoy the sushi you can't enjoy


---------69:14----------
the sushi sucks for you


---------69:16----------
yeah so be it


---------69:23----------
i'm never having sushi again


---------69:26----------
why not


---------69:31----------
can't enjoy it well i can't i can't


---------69:35----------
enjoy it


---------69:36----------
because like you said it is true it's


---------69:38----------
not like it's not like i'm like


---------69:40----------
tasting the sushi and i'm like there's


---------69:41----------
nothing there's no taste but it's like


---------69:44----------
not as much just like how much everyone


---------69:45----------
else experiences it they feel like


---------69:47----------
they're


---------69:48----------
fully there i feel like i'm like 10


---------69:49----------
there 15


---------69:51----------
when everyone else is like oh wow this


---------69:52----------
is so good i'm like


---------69:54----------
missing the point mischief you've got to


---------69:57----------
have sushi


---------69:58----------
and not enjoy it if you never have sushi


---------70:01----------
again you're not accepting it


---------70:03----------
yeah you're right never having sushi


---------70:05----------
again is sitting firmly within layer one


---------70:07----------
of your mind


---------70:13----------
you see that yeah


---------70:18----------
you've got to order it and not enjoy it


---------70:28----------
do you want to see my presentation hell


---------70:31----------
yeah baby


---------70:33----------
you don't it's terrible this is like


---------70:35----------
something that someone with adhd made


---------70:36----------
i'm telling you


---------70:37----------
it looks really really good yeah this is


---------70:39----------
adhd intrusive


---------70:40----------
but this actually really helped me out a


---------70:42----------
lot i i do feel


---------70:44----------
um i i feel like it's gonna be hard for


---------70:47----------
some people to understand this but it


---------70:48----------
makes perfect sense to me


---------70:50----------
it's like i am the eye and these are all


---------70:54----------
my layers of thoughts


---------70:55----------
i have some random song playing in my


---------70:57----------
head i have


---------70:58----------
camp laszlo's theme song playing i have


---------71:01----------
mitch jones dancing you know


---------71:02----------
all these layers of things that feel


---------71:04----------
like a kaleidoscope is constantly in my


---------71:06----------
head


---------71:06----------
and i'm never gonna be able to change


---------71:08----------
that ever um


---------71:10----------
and toys do help for sure but the number


---------71:13----------
one problem with the number one layer


---------71:15----------
is me questioning why this is happening


---------71:18----------
why can't i be present and what dr k is


---------71:21----------
saying


---------71:22----------
is uh you know


---------71:26----------
to in order to to understand yeah you


---------71:28----------
can't be present you're never going to


---------71:30----------
be


---------71:30----------
fighting it's only going to make it


---------71:32----------
worse you might as well ride the wave


---------71:34----------
that you have you're


---------71:35----------
you're not going to ever be that fully


---------71:36----------
present person it's just not going to


---------71:37----------
happen


---------71:38----------
you have adhd it is what it is go with


---------71:41----------
it


---------71:42----------
rather than fight it because if you


---------71:43----------
fight it it's only gonna make it worse


---------71:45----------
not only you're gonna have a layer of


---------71:47----------
why can't i be present you're gonna be


---------71:48----------
having a


---------71:49----------
like you know trying to fight these


---------71:51----------
waves which is impossible to do


---------71:55----------
just like last time this gif beautiful


---------71:58----------
summary


---------71:59----------
i literally could not have said that


---------72:02----------
better myself


---------72:04----------
and the problem is you know it's not a


---------72:05----------
problem but i already forgot what i said


---------72:07----------
but you know what


---------72:09----------
i think it's okay so this is this is my


---------72:13----------
favorite part of interviews with you


---------72:14----------
miss gif is like


---------72:15----------
we've been at this now for an hour and a


---------72:16----------
half


---------72:20----------
yep yeah


---------72:27----------
where was your attention there


---------72:34----------
honestly


---------72:36----------
ever since i started grabbing this and


---------72:38----------
ever since i started doing this


---------72:39----------
it's been much more here yep


---------72:42----------
well played sir yeah you can get there


---------72:45----------
so the first thing that i want you to


---------72:47----------
appreciate miska for the last thing i


---------72:48----------
suppose so i think it's like it's a


---------72:50----------
great summary i


---------72:51----------
don't think we should you know keep


---------72:52----------
talking because i think you did it


---------72:55----------
is that attention can fluctuate


---------72:59----------
right yeah so you're talking about being


---------73:02----------
yep


---------73:03----------
and so like we don't know if you can


---------73:05----------
ever be fully present


---------73:07----------
but we know you can get more present and


---------73:10----------
that's enough


---------73:12----------
we're not going to attach ourselves to


---------73:13----------
being fully present because that's going


---------73:14----------
to create an expectation


---------73:16----------
it's going to create tension in the mind


---------73:17----------
it's going to create disappointment


---------73:19----------
yeah it's making me go backwards rather


---------73:22----------
than even


---------73:23----------
exactly remotely forwards but we can


---------73:24----------
have hope because today you've


---------73:26----------
demonstrated to us that you've figured


---------73:28----------
out some ways


---------73:30----------
for your mind to be more present


---------73:33----------
and we absolutely start with the toy


---------73:36----------
because that's the first step


---------73:37----------
and this this last thing that i this i


---------73:40----------
think i'm telling you


---------73:41----------
that's the last step it's the most


---------73:43----------
difficult step


---------73:44----------
yeah but it's the one that once you


---------73:47----------
learn how to do that


---------73:48----------
you're [ __ ] set bro i agree


---------73:54----------
now


---------73:58----------
last thing i don't think we should talk


---------73:59----------
about it today but i would encourage you


---------74:01----------
to think a little bit about one more


---------74:02----------
thing which is that we can


---------74:04----------
if we ever do you know we talk again in


---------74:05----------
a year um


---------74:07----------
this whole thing about you forgetting


---------74:08----------
everything and whether there really is


---------74:09----------
something to


---------74:10----------
you forgetting you know did you need to


---------74:13----------
learn how to forget


---------74:18----------
i don't know i don't i don't think so i


---------74:20----------
think the problem with me forgetting a


---------74:21----------
lot is just


---------74:22----------
when i was a kid all i thought about was


---------74:24----------
what's the next joke


---------74:26----------
so i was never really present um okay


---------74:29----------
it's not even that i forgot it was never


---------74:31----------
even in my mind because


---------74:33----------
i never really was enjoying the present


---------74:35----------
because of a lot of these layers


---------74:36----------
and you can add another layer which is


---------74:38----------
trying to make a joke um


---------74:41----------
and because of that i never really got


---------74:43----------
to enjoy moments i was more


---------74:44----------
so focusing on what do people think of


---------74:47----------
me you know what's the next thing i


---------74:48----------
could say


---------74:49----------
do these guys like hanging out with me


---------74:51----------
do these guys think i'm fun what can i


---------74:52----------
do to make them more


---------74:53----------
involved or like me more rather than


---------74:56----------
thinking to myself


---------74:57----------
of wow this is fun to hang out with and


---------74:59----------
this is fun to do


---------75:00----------
it was more so me thinking about trying


---------75:02----------
to make sure that everyone was enjoying


---------75:04----------
my presence


---------75:07----------
yeah yeah


---------75:11----------
i thought of that before yeah i i think


---------75:13----------
we've talked a little bit about it run a


---------75:14----------
bell


---------75:15----------
but cool man any last questions for me


---------75:18----------
or any other thoughts


---------75:20----------
no you're doing a great job bro so are


---------75:23----------
you we love what you do


---------75:25----------
oh my god someone is gifting just [ __ ]


---------75:28----------
loads of subs


---------75:30----------
yeah i got a twitch prime about 12


---------75:32----------
minutes ago so we're on the same boat


---------75:36----------
what nothing i think you have adhd


---------75:41----------
no dude like someone just gifted like


---------75:42----------
200 subs to


---------75:45----------
oh really yeah it's this anonymous


---------75:48----------
and anonymous gifters man and then


---------75:51----------
everyone is


---------75:52----------
talking about dodged and then someone


---------75:54----------
says someone donated 100 subs


---------75:56----------
and then people were like dodged dodge


---------75:58----------
dodged and then this guy


---------75:59----------
all right i assume the same person i


---------76:01----------
don't know if it's the same person and


---------76:02----------
then they'd gifted another 100.


---------76:05----------
jesus christ yeah i got a 12 month sub


---------76:08----------
about two minutes ago


---------76:09----------
yeah so we're both we're all doing


---------76:11----------
really well and we should be proud of


---------76:12----------
ourselves


---------76:13----------
i'm proud of you bro looks like your


---------76:16----------
furniture's here


---------76:18----------
chompy i don't know where he is no


---------76:20----------
that's not my furniture that's my


---------76:21----------
girlfriend


---------76:22----------
kind of similar oh


---------76:26----------
tell her i said hello my he says hi


---------76:32----------
she says hello yeah i i learned a lot


---------76:35----------
i'm gonna get


---------76:36----------
uh the toys um and i'm going to try


---------76:39----------
i i know what to do i'm not gonna try to


---------76:41----------
fight it because i i


---------76:42----------
totally agree with you and it's by far


---------76:44----------
the worst layers when i try to fight it


---------76:46----------
it is


---------76:46----------
the worst layer um when i try to fight


---------76:50----------
this


---------76:51----------
problem i had it it almost shadows all


---------76:53----------
the other thoughts and just me thinking


---------76:55----------
why


---------76:55----------
can't i enjoy the moment so i'm going to


---------76:58----------
stop doing that


---------76:59----------
and i'm just going to enjoy them and and


---------77:01----------
try it and embrace the fact that i can't


---------77:04----------
and i'm going to you know get a toy and


---------77:07----------
just


---------77:08----------
it's a beginning and hopefully from


---------77:10----------
there maybe i start meditating


---------77:12----------
uh do yoga i do i do think working out


---------77:15----------
definitely has helped me a lot


---------77:16----------
i need to start doing that for sure and


---------77:18----------
um


---------77:19----------
that sounds like a great idea but yeah i


---------77:21----------
think those things probably


---------77:23----------
will help out but it's a start you can't


---------77:25----------
because like what you said


---------77:26----------
you can't go to 100 it's not gonna


---------77:28----------
happen you have to take time


---------77:30----------
and slowly get results so


---------77:34----------
yeah and if you if you don't have a set


---------77:36----------
of prayer beads and you decide that you


---------77:37----------
want to go down that road


---------77:39----------
let me know and i'll i'll send you a


---------77:40----------
pair okay okay


---------77:42----------
if i can't find something good that i


---------77:44----------
like as a toy i'll just ask for the ball


---------77:45----------
is in your court bro


---------77:48----------
okay so you you let me know okay well


---------77:51----------
thanks a lot man this was


---------77:52----------
as always phenomenal phenomenal thank


---------77:55----------
you dr k


---------77:56----------
i appreciate it you helped me a lot i


---------77:58----------
think you're gifted at


---------77:59----------
explaining actually which makes this fun


---------78:01----------
for me you're gifted at listening and


---------78:03----------
you're gifted and explaining so it's


---------78:04----------
it's cool


---------78:06----------
like it's it's terrible i i don't know i


---------78:08----------
think i think if you go back and you


---------78:10----------
watch the vod


---------78:11----------
i think that your diagram is going to


---------78:12----------
make a lot more sense than


---------78:14----------
i think you've been taught that you know


---------78:18----------
people can't understand your mind but i


---------78:19----------
think it's actually a very eloquent way


---------78:20----------
of describing your mind so


---------78:22----------
thank you for doing that oh thanks take


---------78:25----------
care man


---------78:27----------
all right bye doctor k adios dude


---------78:30----------
dude that guy's next level man i'm


---------78:38----------
serious
