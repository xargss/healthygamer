---------00:15----------
week where proceeds from stream are


---------00:17----------
going to our mods


---------00:18----------
it's a way of saying thank you so


---------00:20----------
basically we have a we have a discord


---------00:22----------
right


---------00:23----------
and on our discord uh sometimes people


---------00:25----------
get banned so just so you guys know our


---------00:27----------
discord is really a place for like


---------00:30----------
people who are interested in the values


---------00:32----------
of healthy gamer


---------00:33----------
it's about like understanding yourself


---------00:35----------
better or growing as a human being


---------00:38----------
it's not about you know sharing the


---------00:40----------
dankest memes and a place for the walls


---------00:42----------
i mean we want people to have fun and


---------00:44----------
there are you know chill channels and


---------00:45----------
stuff like that


---------00:46----------
where we want people to enjoy themselves


---------00:48----------
but our our discord is really focused on


---------00:50----------
growth it's not focused on


---------00:53----------
you know fun you know what we're going


---------00:54----------
to do today is actually like talk to


---------00:56----------
people who have been banned and try to


---------00:58----------
get a sense of like


---------00:59----------
what their understanding was of why they


---------01:02----------
got banned


---------01:03----------
um and then we will let you guys kind of


---------01:06----------
vote on what we should do in terms of


---------01:08----------
letting them back onto discord or not


---------01:12----------
hello hey man oh hold on


---------01:16----------
is it if for some reason it's going


---------01:18----------
through my my vr headset


---------01:20----------
hold on okay then so what uh


---------01:23----------
what do you go by man just call me again


---------01:29----------
because my name is ganymede so just call


---------01:31----------
me ganny danny okay


---------01:33----------
so ganny can you tell us a little bit


---------01:35----------
about how you came to join the healthy


---------01:37----------
gamer community


---------01:38----------
well um initially i was watching your


---------01:41----------
streams and i was watching the


---------01:42----------
uh vods on youtube and um


---------01:46----------
initially that well the one that drew me


---------01:48----------
in uh was the


---------01:49----------
there was there was a guy i think his


---------01:51----------
name was paul or something and he was


---------01:53----------
like it was about the whole incel


---------01:54----------
conversation


---------01:56----------
and um i saw that and i


---------01:59----------
saw a few of your other streams and


---------02:00----------
stuff and i and i and i kind of liked


---------02:03----------
the sort of angle that the channel was


---------02:04----------
taking where it was like


---------02:06----------
applying the sort of mental health or


---------02:09----------
the sort of like


---------02:10----------
uh sort of mental health angle for like


---------02:13----------
the gaming community and i thought that


---------02:15----------
as somebody who


---------02:16----------
is a part like pretty active in the


---------02:18----------
gaming community and as somebody who


---------02:20----------
engages frequently with like discord and


---------02:22----------
video games that i would


---------02:24----------
benefit from being in a community that


---------02:26----------
was sort of centered around that


---------02:27----------
that's awesome man we made the community


---------02:29----------
for people like you


---------02:31----------
and so what happened when you joined the


---------02:32----------
discord how did you get yourself banned


---------02:34----------
um well a lot of the times i i think


---------02:38----------
i think it was repeated behavior i think


---------02:40----------
it was uh it was stuff that was


---------02:42----------
happening over and over and over again


---------02:43----------
where i was kind of using the using it


---------02:46----------
as a platform more event


---------02:47----------
and like people would give me advice and


---------02:49----------
people would would like uh


---------02:52----------
tell me things to do but i a lot of the


---------02:54----------
times i wouldn't say i ignored it


---------02:55----------
completely like a lot of times i would


---------02:56----------
try my best to address it


---------02:58----------
address it but a lot of the times i i


---------03:00----------
feel like the advice was either not


---------03:02----------
specific or enough


---------03:03----------
or it was kind of hard to take action on


---------03:05----------
and i was just a bit confused


---------03:07----------
sometimes so as much as i tried to sort


---------03:10----------
of take advice


---------03:10----------
i maybe wasn't the best at listening to


---------03:13----------
others


---------03:14----------
and a lot of the times the advice to me


---------03:16----------
seemed kind of cliche and seem kind of


---------03:17----------
like


---------03:18----------
uh stuff i've heard like a million times


---------03:20----------
before


---------03:21----------
and how did you respond to it well


---------03:23----------
usually i


---------03:24----------
uh what i would do is i i would try to


---------03:27----------
sort of address it or i would


---------03:30----------
i mean the thing is is when you're in a


---------03:31----------
text chat there are so many people


---------03:33----------
talking at you at once it's almost


---------03:34----------
impossible to address what everybody is


---------03:36----------
saying


---------03:37----------
but uh i wouldn't necessarily address


---------03:39----------
every single thing that was said to me


---------03:41----------
necessarily because there was just so


---------03:43----------
much of it and people would get mad at


---------03:45----------
me because they would say oh why aren't


---------03:46----------
you addressing what i'm saying


---------03:47----------
interesting and uh can i add one more


---------03:50----------
thing because


---------03:51----------
there was multiple reasons i was banned


---------03:52----------
i think i was also vain for making like


---------03:54----------
not safe for work comments as well


---------03:56----------
uh or or saying things that was uh that


---------03:59----------
were not kind of like out of place


---------04:01----------
and i'm for the most part like used to


---------04:03----------
be in communities where that stuff is


---------04:05----------
okay but i understand that like


---------04:07----------
a lot of the times it was out of place


---------04:09----------
and a lot of the times


---------04:10----------
some of the remarks i was making were


---------04:11----------
inappropriate and really


---------04:13----------
did not have to be sad all right so let


---------04:15----------
me just make sure i hear you ganny


---------04:17----------
so on the one hand it sounds like you


---------04:19----------
were maybe reaching out for support and


---------04:21----------
people would try to support you but they


---------04:23----------
would try to support you with cliche


---------04:25----------
advice


---------04:26----------
and you're saying that you would respond


---------04:29----------
in ways where you couldn't


---------04:30----------
address everyone sort of yeah okay


---------04:34----------
so generally speaking that's a little


---------04:36----------
bit confusing to me because that's


---------04:38----------
usually doesn't like at least as far as


---------04:40----------
i understand that doesn't get you banned


---------04:43----------
like usually what gets you banned is


---------04:44----------
like you know if someone gives you


---------04:46----------
advice and you respond in a toxic manner


---------04:49----------
that could get you banned so i'm curious


---------04:52----------
about the way that you responded was it


---------04:54----------
just that


---------04:54----------
hey guys i'm a little bit confused and i


---------04:56----------
can't get to everyone because that


---------04:58----------
sounds weird because that's the way


---------04:59----------
you're making it sound


---------05:00----------
i think i think a big reason too is


---------05:02----------
because i would go to the chat with the


---------05:04----------
same issue repeatedly and


---------05:06----------
people would kind of get tired of of me


---------05:09----------
sort of monopolizing or taking over the


---------05:11----------
chat and sort of


---------05:12----------
like with my issues because it would be


---------05:14----------
the same issue over and over and over


---------05:15----------
again and i think people were kind of


---------05:17----------
fed up with that


---------05:18----------
okay so it sounds like you were asking


---------05:20----------
for help but when people were trying to


---------05:21----------
help you you


---------05:22----------
i get the sense that you kind of weren't


---------05:24----------
meeting them halfway


---------05:26----------
yeah you were rejecting the help that


---------05:28----------
they offered and you kept on asking


---------05:30----------
and you kept on rejecting help yeah that


---------05:32----------
sounds right


---------05:33----------
okay and then it also sounds like you


---------05:35----------
were posting some things that were


---------05:36----------
inappropriate and


---------05:39----------
you know you're a gamer on the internet


---------05:42----------
and so a lot of times posting things


---------05:44----------
that are not safe for work


---------05:46----------
is like completely normal in some


---------05:48----------
communities but it's not okay in our


---------05:50----------
community yeah i understand that


---------05:52----------
and the other thing that i'm hearing


---------05:53----------
from you which i think is quite


---------05:55----------
insightful is that it seems like these


---------05:56----------
aren't one-time things these are like


---------05:58----------
multiple times that you were doing this


---------06:01----------
yeah like i was muted i was muted twice


---------06:03----------
before i was or


---------06:05----------
uh yeah twice before i was banned so


---------06:08----------
uh i understand like why i don't


---------06:11----------
okay i feel like the final band like it


---------06:13----------
kind of came out of nowhere i was kind


---------06:14----------
of surprised


---------06:15----------
but at the same time i understand why


---------06:17----------
after uh


---------06:18----------
repeated offenses i would be banned okay


---------06:22----------
so let's like dig into that for a second


---------06:24----------
when you get muted once and then you get


---------06:28----------
unmuted what do you what was going


---------06:31----------
through your head


---------06:32----------
like how do you get muted again well i


---------06:34----------
was muted for


---------06:35----------
different for different reasons so i


---------06:38----------
would get muted for something and then


---------06:40----------
i'd say oh i guess i'm not going to do


---------06:42----------
that again but then i wouldn't do that


---------06:43----------
again but then i get muted for like a


---------06:45----------
completely different reason or for


---------06:47----------
something else okay and then so yeah


---------06:51----------
yeah so i'm also hearing like some


---------06:52----------
degree of like


---------06:54----------
almost conflict or confusion in terms of


---------06:56----------
on the one hand like yeah you got banned


---------06:58----------
because you were muted twice


---------06:59----------
but on the other hand it sounds like you


---------07:02----------
felt like you were breaking different


---------07:03----------
rules


---------07:04----------
each time and so it sort of felt like it


---------07:07----------
came out of nowhere but on the other


---------07:08----------
hand


---------07:08----------
someone who gets muted twice and gets


---------07:10----------
banned it's like not that unreasonable


---------07:12----------
but to you it still felt like it sort of


---------07:14----------
came out of left field yeah because


---------07:16----------
there wasn't like a specific


---------07:17----------
thing i said that caused me to be banned


---------07:20----------
it was just


---------07:21----------
it was just general i mean i could read


---------07:23----------
uh i think i i still have the


---------07:25----------
the message from the bot i don't know if


---------07:27----------
you it says here


---------07:30----------
am i allowed to read it out or yeah


---------07:32----------
we'll let moses do that


---------07:33----------
yeah i think it was just mostly


---------07:35----------
inappropriate comments related to sex


---------07:37----------
was


---------07:38----------
the big one yeah that's understandable i


---------07:40----------
feel like because a lot of the issues i


---------07:42----------
was having were like not safe for work


---------07:44----------
issues so i was trying to talk about


---------07:45----------
them but


---------07:46----------
i was i wasn't really sure how to talk


---------07:48----------
about them in a way that was


---------07:50----------
uh in a way that was necessarily


---------07:54----------
uh appropriate for the server but maybe


---------07:56----------
i guess if an issue is not safe for work


---------07:57----------
and it's


---------07:59----------
probably better to talk about it


---------08:00----------
somewhere else or not talk about it at


---------08:02----------
all


---------08:02----------
i'm curious moses can we go into a


---------08:04----------
little bit more detail because that's


---------08:05----------
kind of an interesting question right


---------08:07----------
like so


---------08:08----------
sometimes people do have issues that may


---------08:11----------
not be safe for work


---------08:12----------
and like how do we want to and how do we


---------08:15----------
address those on our discord


---------08:17----------
people in chatter saying make an nsfw


---------08:22----------
channel but i feel like that would


---------08:24----------
become


---------08:27----------
for people to say all kinds of stuff and


---------08:28----------
then they're like oh it's the nsfw


---------08:30----------
channel


---------08:31----------
one comment was i just get extreme


---------08:34----------
satisfaction when people are shamed and


---------08:35----------
have negative things happen to them as a


---------08:37----------
result of sex


---------08:38----------
okay i mean that just sounds less infw


---------08:41----------
and more just like bitter and like uh


---------08:43----------
maybe


---------08:43----------
inappropriate in another way less than


---------08:45----------
an nsfw you know what i mean


---------08:47----------
i i again what i hear you saying is that


---------08:49----------
like you were trying


---------08:50----------
you're not necessarily advocating for


---------08:52----------
those feelings


---------08:54----------
you're just trying to share that you


---------08:55----------
feel a certain way and maybe you want to


---------08:57----------
work on that


---------08:58----------
am i being like too optimistic there or


---------09:00----------
you just i feel like it's a mix of both


---------09:02----------
like i do want to work on them


---------09:03----------
absolutely like i do want to see them


---------09:05----------
change


---------09:05----------
because i know they're not productive


---------09:08----------
thoughts and behaviors


---------09:09----------
but at the same time sometimes when i


---------09:11----------
let them out maybe i'm not necessarily


---------09:13----------
100 thinking about it at that in that


---------09:16----------
way in that moment but it is it is


---------09:17----------
something i want to change if that makes


---------09:19----------
any sense


---------09:19----------
yeah so what are the other ways in which


---------09:21----------
you're thinking about it that's


---------09:22----------
insightful of you to realize that there


---------09:25----------
is like something


---------09:26----------
toxic about those statements it's not


---------09:29----------
just


---------09:30----------
growth and positivity right what else is


---------09:32----------
there well i feel like part of it kind


---------09:34----------
of gets it off my chest or like


---------09:36----------
me it was sort of it's a venting as as


---------09:38----------
it said in the


---------09:39----------
ban uh the band reason it's it's venting


---------09:42----------
a lot of it is


---------09:43----------
uh a lot of it is releasing some of my


---------09:46----------
anger because a lot of the times i mean


---------09:48----------
i do harbor a lot of anger and a lot


---------09:50----------
of frustration and a lot of the times i


---------09:52----------
release it through like


---------09:53----------
inflammatory or negative comments or you


---------09:56----------
know what i mean


---------09:58----------
yeah do we want to go into more detail


---------10:00----------
about what kind of inflammatory or


---------10:02----------
negative comments those could be


---------10:04----------
i mean it's i if you want me to be


---------10:06----------
specific specifically things around like


---------10:08----------
uh sexuality or like my inability to


---------10:13----------
uh the fact that i'm not sexually active


---------10:16----------
or the fact that other people are able


---------10:17----------
to be sexually active but i'm not like


---------10:19----------
specifically that is i think the


---------10:21----------
the thing that causes uh frustration for


---------10:24----------
me


---------10:25----------
and so ganny you know just to kind of


---------10:27----------
clarify so like


---------10:29----------
when you have those feelings what have


---------10:31----------
you noticed like what has the internet


---------10:33----------
taught you


---------10:34----------
is like the appropriate way to


---------10:35----------
communicate that what is the internet


---------10:38----------
i mean the internet hasn't necessarily


---------10:42----------
taught me a lot of positive things when


---------10:43----------
it comes to dealing with that i feel


---------10:45----------
like what the internet teaches me is


---------10:47----------
that you get you post it you post


---------10:49----------
something and then a bunch of people get


---------10:50----------
frustrated at you and a bunch of people


---------10:52----------
try to argue with you


---------10:53----------
and then you you cause like a big scene


---------10:55----------
and then that's basically how you deal


---------10:57----------
with your problems rather than


---------10:58----------
you know how can i improve and how can i


---------11:00----------
uh


---------11:01----------
get better or how can i change this


---------11:03----------
right sure


---------11:05----------
so so moses anything else you want to


---------11:08----------
add in terms of like logs or


---------11:09----------
anything i mean do you feel comfortable


---------11:11----------
with me saying this


---------11:13----------
yeah i mean i think it's worth it if it


---------11:14----------
can help other people it might be going


---------11:16----------
through the same thing i think it'd be


---------11:17----------
fine to


---------11:18----------
share it or yeah i mean yeah just share


---------11:20----------
it because like here's the thing right


---------11:22----------
gandhi is like like people need


---------11:24----------
another way to think about some of these


---------11:27----------
topics and people need


---------11:29----------
to understand like what is okay to say


---------11:31----------
and what is not okay to say


---------11:33----------
yeah and i i don't know how we do that


---------11:35----------
without providing examples


---------11:37----------
okay yeah because that makes it far away


---------11:40----------
yeah


---------11:41----------
all right vlog one i honestly can't


---------11:44----------
conceive of the fact that millions of


---------11:46----------
guys literally get to have sex with


---------11:48----------
whoever they want while i raw alone


---------11:49----------
never gang to feel the touch of a woman


---------11:52----------
seems kind of unfair don't it


---------11:55----------
okay all right keep going


---------11:59----------
next log two i feel that i am treated


---------12:01----------
like a second class cis and through the


---------12:03----------
denial of sex by woman i don't think


---------12:06----------
every individual woman owes me sex but i


---------12:08----------
think i'm owed it in a fair world


---------12:10----------
log three can a trans woman get wet


---------12:15----------
that yeah that wasn't one that was one


---------12:17----------
that was pointed out to me that i


---------12:18----------
know is inappropriate for obvious


---------12:20----------
reasons uh log four


---------12:22----------
am i allowed to talk about wanting to


---------12:24----------
kms on here


---------12:26----------
and then the last log was the one i


---------12:28----------
already said when people are ashamed and


---------12:29----------
have negative things happen to them as a


---------12:31----------
result of sex


---------12:33----------
so ganny what is it what is it like when


---------12:35----------
you hear


---------12:36----------
moses read off what you've said well i


---------12:38----------
feel like when you say these things


---------12:40----------
or when i say these things i don't


---------12:41----------
really think about it before i say it so


---------12:44----------
to hear it sort of uh said back to me


---------12:47----------
after i've had some time to think about


---------12:48----------
maybe some of these things it kind of


---------12:49----------
makes me


---------12:50----------
double it makes me think again about


---------12:52----------
maybe some of the things i've been


---------12:53----------
saying and maybe how reasonable i mean


---------12:56----------
i think a lot of it sounds kind of


---------12:57----------
unreasonable and stuff i wouldn't say


---------12:58----------
again but at the same time i mean i've


---------13:00----------
said it so


---------13:01----------
it's very easy to say oh i wouldn't say


---------13:02----------
this but i've already said it so


---------13:04----------
it's just uh it doesn't seem it it seems


---------13:07----------
it's very i mean hindsight is 20 20 but


---------13:09----------
yeah no it's very it sucks to hear these


---------13:11----------
things i mean i don't i don't like to


---------13:13----------
hear these things


---------13:14----------
how do you feel about yourself hearing


---------13:16----------
these things oh


---------13:18----------
geez that's kind of harsh uh i i feel i


---------13:21----------
i honestly feel like


---------13:22----------
uh i mean i i kind of i hear what these


---------13:26----------
what this person is saying and i know


---------13:28----------
this person is me but i hear what this


---------13:29----------
person is saying and i just think of


---------13:30----------
like why is this person so angry or what


---------13:33----------
happened to this person to


---------13:35----------
make them like so bitter and so or


---------13:38----------
not maybe not what happened to this


---------13:39----------
person because that kind of but like


---------13:42----------
because i feel like when you think about


---------13:43----------
what happened to the person it's kind of


---------13:44----------
relieving them from some responsibility


---------13:46----------
but like


---------13:47----------
why why does this person have to say


---------13:49----------
these horrible things right


---------13:52----------
it's interesting that you thought my


---------13:53----------
question was harsh


---------13:55----------
um it's not harsh at all it's just uh


---------13:57----------
i'm just saying it's


---------13:58----------
it's harsh to think about for me not


---------14:00----------
necessarily yeah so so and and i i think


---------14:02----------
that it's kind of interesting because


---------14:03----------
what i'm hearing you say is that like


---------14:05----------
you recognize that this person is you


---------14:08----------
but you also recognize that like this


---------14:10----------
isn't


---------14:11----------
all of you right this is a piece of


---------14:13----------
yourself


---------14:14----------
that is angry and resentful and you're


---------14:17----------
able to like when you hear it it's like


---------14:18----------
that's not


---------14:19----------
that certainly doesn't sound like the


---------14:20----------
ganny that i'm talking to right now


---------14:23----------
right you see yeah level-headed you seem


---------14:25----------
like


---------14:26----------
thoughtful you're careful to not like


---------14:28----------
absolve yourself of responsibility


---------14:30----------
you're trying really hard to take


---------14:31----------
responsibility i hear that


---------14:33----------
right because you kind of say you know i


---------14:36----------
say that i'm not going to do it again


---------14:38----------
but then again i i did it i did it


---------14:40----------
several times


---------14:42----------
so how can i even say that i'm not going


---------14:44----------
to do it again even though in this


---------14:46----------
moment i really feel like i'm


---------14:48----------
going to do it again yeah i know that


---------14:49----------
makes sense um


---------14:51----------
i mean can i be honest about something i


---------14:53----------
think this is something i want to make


---------14:54----------
clear


---------14:55----------
uh if i am for some reason allowed back


---------14:57----------
into the server i feel like i wouldn't


---------14:59----------
necessarily talk about my issues in it


---------15:01----------
necessarily


---------15:02----------
because i feel like when i do like it it


---------15:05----------
tends to


---------15:06----------
go in a negative direction and intense


---------15:08----------
and i tend to


---------15:09----------
i tend to end up seeing things that i


---------15:10----------
regret and i'm not saying and i feel


---------15:13----------
like


---------15:13----------
like for me if i were to use the


---------15:15----------
community again i'd probably use it to


---------15:16----------
either talk about other people's issues


---------15:18----------
or


---------15:19----------
uh just have fun like just talk to


---------15:21----------
people on the vcs because honestly


---------15:23----------
i feel like when whenever i talk i talk


---------15:25----------
about things that are going through my


---------15:26----------
head i kind of go down a rabbit hole


---------15:28----------
and i kind of uh i start to hurt the


---------15:31----------
people around


---------15:31----------
me and i start to i don't know like i i


---------15:34----------
just


---------15:35----------
it's maybe like i just need to take a


---------15:37----------
break from like my


---------15:38----------
thinking so much about myself and my own


---------15:40----------
uh


---------15:41----------
my own problems i i mean oddly enough


---------15:44----------
ganny i think


---------15:45----------
um and so we'll we'll sort of ask twitch


---------15:48----------
chat


---------15:48----------
and and zach to kind of yeah so zach's


---------15:50----------
got a poll up but here's what i think so


---------15:52----------
i think that that's like a really


---------15:53----------
productive


---------15:54----------
take i do hope that our community is a


---------15:57----------
place where we can actually address some


---------16:00----------
of those feelings


---------16:01----------
but not in an like in-cell


---------16:05----------
kind of approach or language like i


---------16:07----------
think the way that you


---------16:08----------
reacted to listening to your own


---------16:11----------
language is actually the healthy way


---------16:13----------
right is to like ask yourself like where


---------16:15----------
does this anger and resentment come from


---------16:17----------
and i think if your focus is on like i


---------16:19----------
feel angry towards women and i follow my


---------16:22----------
find myself like falling into this


---------16:24----------
in-cell red pill


---------16:26----------
kind of like thinking do you guys have


---------16:28----------
any thoughts about like how i can


---------16:30----------
start to think about things differently


---------16:33----------
and i think this is going to be a more


---------16:35----------
yeah yeah so


---------16:36----------
so i mean i i do want our discord to be


---------16:39----------
a place where people can like


---------16:40----------
authentically look at the dark part of


---------16:42----------
themselves and try to change


---------16:43----------
i think in your case there's a double


---------16:44----------
doozy because it sounds like maybe you


---------16:46----------
did that


---------16:47----------
and people tried that with you right


---------16:49----------
like they tried to give you advice they


---------16:50----------
tried to talk to you


---------16:52----------
and it sounds like for whatever reason


---------16:53----------
you shot them down every single time


---------16:55----------
and so what i would really also look at


---------16:57----------
if you are on band


---------16:59----------
is to like ask yourself why do i ask for


---------17:02----------
help and then shoot it down


---------17:04----------
because that too is like angry and


---------17:06----------
resentful and hopeless


---------17:07----------
yeah no that's true so let's see what


---------17:11----------
what do you think you think twitch chat


---------17:12----------
is going to want to unban you uh i'm


---------17:14----------
going to be honest


---------17:15----------
i'm not allowed to read the twitch chat


---------17:16----------
because i don't want some no


---------17:18----------
no reading to a chat you have to tell me


---------17:21----------
what you think


---------17:22----------
i i don't think so because i feel like


---------17:24----------
some of the comments i make people are


---------17:26----------
gonna hear them and be like oh what's


---------17:27----------
this guy's problem


---------17:28----------
so interestingly enough so it seems like


---------17:30----------
twitch had 63


---------17:32----------
of twitch chat feels like you should be


---------17:34----------
unbanned


---------17:36----------
oh my god really yeah man


---------17:39----------
and frankly i'm not surprised because i


---------17:41----------
think you're not the toxic [ __ ] that


---------17:43----------
you are at times when you talk like this


---------17:46----------
like the person that we're talking to


---------17:48----------
right now ganny is i think like


---------17:49----------
absolutely allowed on her server it's


---------17:52----------
when you start to like become this other


---------17:54----------
person which you


---------17:55----------
absolutely have inside you that doesn't


---------17:58----------
belong there


---------18:00----------
because you have to understand that not


---------18:02----------
only is that not helpful towards you but


---------18:04----------
it's actually hurtful towards other


---------18:06----------
people


---------18:06----------
i know sometimes it just feels like


---------18:08----------
words to you


---------18:09----------
you know if you ask like inappropriate


---------18:11----------
questions about like transgender people


---------18:13----------
like their


---------18:14----------
transgender people come to our our


---------18:16----------
discord for like


---------18:17----------
to be like safe and accepted and you


---------18:20----------
come to our discord because you want to


---------18:21----------
be safe and


---------18:22----------
accepted so when like people are bashing


---------18:24----------
in cells like that's hurtful towards you


---------18:27----------
and when you bash on people like that's


---------18:29----------
hurtful towards them


---------18:30----------
i mean i feel like when people bash in


---------18:32----------
cells i don't really get that upset


---------18:34----------
because i don't identify myself as an


---------18:35----------
incel even though i know that


---------18:37----------
people might think i am one i don't know


---------18:39----------
i just don't really like


---------18:40----------
identify myself that way okay


---------18:44----------
mistaking a sub [ __ ] on my part yeah


---------18:48----------
all right just i'm curious now last


---------18:50----------
question how do you identify yourself


---------18:53----------
well i think i'm just uh struggling


---------18:55----------
individual who has problems who has


---------18:57----------
resentment and i feel like


---------18:58----------
like putting a label on it for


---------19:00----------
especially like an ill label from the


---------19:01----------
internet


---------19:02----------
i feel like that's not necessarily going


---------19:04----------
to help me especially when


---------19:06----------
a lot of the people who consider


---------19:07----------
themselves in cells are very like


---------19:09----------
they're not the kind of productive


---------19:10----------
people you want to surround yourself


---------19:11----------
with they're the kind of people that try


---------19:12----------
to drag you down and the kind of people


---------19:14----------
that


---------19:14----------
uh aren't like trying to get you to


---------19:16----------
improve yourself you know what i mean


---------19:18----------
sure so that sounds like a really good


---------19:20----------
answer and so i'd be really really


---------19:23----------
careful


---------19:24----------
ganny when you start using labels about


---------19:26----------
other people


---------19:27----------
because just like you're you're a


---------19:29----------
[ __ ] insult man


---------19:31----------
but like that label doesn't help right


---------19:34----------
it's like it doesn't speak to when you


---------19:36----------
talk about being entitled to sex like


---------19:38----------
that's in cell language


---------19:40----------
and at the same time you're not an


---------19:42----------
insult because you're a human being


---------19:43----------
who's struggling and has like resentment


---------19:45----------
and anger issues


---------19:46----------
and you're trying to grow as a person so


---------19:48----------
be careful the next time


---------19:50----------
you know you call someone like an


---------19:51----------
inappropriate label


---------19:53----------
because you feel angry because you're


---------19:55----------
doing the same thing to them


---------19:57----------
that people do to you and they call you


---------19:58----------
in excel which is that you're


---------20:00----------
deorganizing


---------20:02----------
and i don't think it's fair to label you


---------20:04----------
as an incel even though in a sense you


---------20:05----------
fit the bill like i don't think it's


---------20:07----------
helpful


---------20:08----------
right like i get behind your definition


---------20:10----------
which is that you're someone who's like


---------20:12----------
trying to grow as a human being and


---------20:13----------
you've got challenges


---------20:14----------
but then you should give that same


---------20:16----------
respect to other people yeah that's fair


---------20:18----------
enough


---------20:18----------
all right good luck annie thank you


---------20:21----------
thanks for coming on man


---------20:23----------
and it looks like no problem man twitch


---------20:25----------
chat in a


---------20:26----------
in a two to one ratio feels like you


---------20:29----------
should be allowed back onto the server


---------20:32----------
all right all right take care yeah


---------20:35----------
thank you bye hey man


---------20:38----------
hey what's up can you tell me um what


---------20:40----------
would you like to be


---------20:42----------
like how do you want to be referred to


---------20:43----------
what should i call you um


---------20:45----------
brecken works that's my first name can


---------20:47----------
you first start by telling me a little


---------20:48----------
bit about um


---------20:49----------
how you came to our community and and


---------20:51----------
kind of how you


---------20:52----------
why you joined the discord i saw your


---------20:55----------
streams with like reckful and a couple


---------20:57----------
others


---------20:58----------
and then i saw a link for your discord


---------21:01----------
on the


---------21:01----------
healthy gamer site because okay i went


---------21:03----------
on originally to like


---------21:05----------
uh contact you um or like see if it was


---------21:09----------
possible to set up like


---------21:10----------
uh like an actual point like medical


---------21:13----------
appointment but i didn't know if you did


---------21:14----------
like online


---------21:15----------
sure therapy like actual online therapy


---------21:17----------
like sure like medical


---------21:18----------
yeah and then i found the discord that


---------21:20----------
way okay


---------21:21----------
and so you signed up for the discord and


---------21:23----------
and you've been banned


---------21:25----------
right yes and so help me understand a


---------21:29----------
little bit about like what happened and


---------21:31----------
what's your understanding of why you got


---------21:32----------
banned


---------21:33----------
i i i in real life i've been diagnosed


---------21:35----------
with borderline


---------21:37----------
so uh i've and i'm not medicated right


---------21:40----------
now


---------21:40----------
due to a lot of other reasons but i i


---------21:43----------
don't want to like excuse


---------21:44----------
like things i did because of that but


---------21:47----------
i'd be lying if i said it didn't have to


---------21:49----------
do with it


---------21:50----------
at all sure and um


---------21:53----------
can you explain to us what borderline


---------21:56----------
means


---------21:57----------
it's almost like you get into these


---------21:58----------
states where um


---------22:00----------
you feel something like this this


---------22:03----------
creeping feeling


---------22:04----------
well up in your chest and you can't


---------22:06----------
really like let it out


---------22:07----------
through any way other than than anger


---------22:11----------
okay so you have some feeling and then


---------22:14----------
you get angry


---------22:15----------
yeah it's it's like instead of uh like


---------22:18----------
regulating your emotions normally


---------22:20----------
it's like taking it out on yourself and


---------22:22----------
others because of


---------22:24----------
just like the building up and then not


---------22:25----------
being able to release it through


---------22:27----------
like normal means and okay so what


---------22:30----------
happened on on discord


---------22:32----------
um i had brought up something about um


---------22:36----------
uh like uh being a victim of like a


---------22:39----------
sexual incident and


---------22:41----------
uh then someone um like said something


---------22:44----------
passive aggressive to me about it


---------22:46----------
and so i uh like responded like really


---------22:49----------
harshly and just attacked him


---------22:51----------
but that was that was the warning and


---------22:53----------
then the ban


---------22:54----------
was oh i attacked someone which was


---------22:57----------
completely unwarranted on their end so


---------22:58----------
it was my fault that time but


---------23:00----------
i i didn't hold back at all i just went


---------23:02----------
as hard as i could on him and i


---------23:03----------
i just thought of like the things to say


---------23:06----------
that would


---------23:06----------
hurt him the most basically so it sounds


---------23:09----------
like


---------23:10----------
you understand that you really were


---------23:13----------
not nice to him yeah and


---------23:16----------
and that you were out to hurt him yes


---------23:19----------
and


---------23:20----------
so but it also sounds like you sort of


---------23:21----------
recognized that that was bad and that


---------23:23----------
maybe you were like weren't in control


---------23:25----------
of your emotions at that time


---------23:27----------
well yeah i wasn't in control my


---------23:28----------
emotions at the time like


---------23:31----------
for example like i've broken like two or


---------23:34----------
three smartphones


---------23:35----------
and like also have


---------23:38----------
like gambling and drug addiction


---------23:40----------
problems and stuff so


---------23:42----------
uh this isn't like sounds rough this


---------23:44----------
isn't like


---------23:45----------
it isn't even something that happens


---------23:46----------
that much sounds like it happens rarely


---------23:49----------
and sometimes explosively


---------23:50----------
yeah yeah it's like whenever i'm at the


---------23:54----------
boiling point


---------23:54----------
and it just wells up in my chest it's


---------23:56----------
like primal rage


---------23:58----------
yeah and then you can't control it yeah


---------24:01----------
so on the one hand it sounds to me like


---------24:04----------
you really dealt with a lot of really


---------24:06----------
unfortunate things


---------24:07----------
and and i feel compassion for kind of


---------24:10----------
the way that


---------24:10----------
your life has been um you know i do feel


---------24:13----------
like we want to support you


---------24:15----------
and it's not fair that you've had to


---------24:17----------
deal with the things that you've had to


---------24:18----------
deal with it sounds like you have your


---------24:19----------
fair share of struggles


---------24:21----------
and our our discord is actually a place


---------24:24----------
where we want people like you


---------24:27----------
um who have struggles like that's what


---------24:29----------
the healthy gamer discord is about it's


---------24:30----------
about people who struggle and giving


---------24:32----------
them a space where they can like work on


---------24:33----------
those struggles in sort of a proactive


---------24:35----------
way


---------24:36----------
makes perfect sense so i'm i'm really


---------24:39----------
conflicted personally because on the one


---------24:40----------
hand i feel like it's a place where


---------24:42----------
you belong and we made the discord for


---------24:45----------
places for people like you


---------24:46----------
and bizarrely because we made it for


---------24:49----------
people like you


---------24:51----------
it makes it really unacceptable when you


---------24:53----------
kind of go off on them


---------24:55----------
and i'm personally i agree because you


---------24:57----------
know i see that you


---------24:59----------
recognize that you made a mistake and


---------25:01----------
and you sort of didn't feel like you


---------25:02----------
were in control of your actions


---------25:04----------
and so i i genuinely don't know kind of


---------25:06----------
what to do


---------25:08----------
like i even if i were to get unbanned i


---------25:10----------
probably wouldn't join back


---------25:12----------
simply like right now at least until


---------25:14----------
like i i just don't think


---------25:16----------
i would be ready to participate in the


---------25:18----------
community right now


---------25:19----------
and like whenever i go in there


---------25:21----------
sometimes whenever i


---------25:22----------
i i would be in like a negative state of


---------25:24----------
mind like in a lot of ways it would make


---------25:25----------
me feel like even more strange from


---------25:27----------
people just seeing


---------25:28----------
how like just seeing people's reactions


---------25:31----------
or like responses


---------25:32----------
i mean there were a couple people that i


---------25:33----------
think i helped really but


---------25:35----------
like other than that brecken i really


---------25:37----------
respect you for saying that


---------25:39----------
if you did something wrong and you feel


---------25:41----------
like you should apologize for it i think


---------25:44----------
you know you mentioned you tossed out


---------25:46----------
the phrase net negative effect


---------25:49----------
but i think by coming on here i think


---------25:51----------
you just


---------25:52----------
flipped that around because i think that


---------25:54----------
when people mess up and they like try to


---------25:56----------
make it right


---------25:57----------
my hope is that the world becomes


---------26:00----------
a net positive doesn't always happen but


---------26:03----------
i do think generally speaking that there


---------26:05----------
are not enough people who are given


---------26:07----------
an opportunity to say hey like i kind of


---------26:10----------
[ __ ] up and i'm sorry about that


---------26:12----------
i also really really commend you for


---------26:14----------
recognizing that even if you are


---------26:16----------
unbanned that maybe


---------26:17----------
your interaction with our discord is not


---------26:20----------
in its healthiest space right now


---------26:23----------
i need to address a lot of things


---------26:25----------
probably beforehand and i i don't even


---------26:26----------
know even if i'm


---------26:27----------
i don't even know in the future even


---------26:29----------
when i am technically ready if i would


---------26:31----------
be fit


---------26:32----------
so i don't know but yeah so then


---------26:35----------
i think in in a weird way this


---------26:36----------
conversation is is


---------26:38----------
on the on one hand it's productive and


---------26:40----------
on the other hand i was under the


---------26:41----------
impression this is a ban appeals stream


---------26:43----------
and what i'm hearing is there's


---------26:44----------
actually consensus between the mods and


---------26:46----------
you that maybe you need to work on


---------26:48----------
yourself for a little while and maybe


---------26:50----------
like a ban appeal


---------26:51----------
is more appropriate down the road what


---------26:54----------
do you think


---------26:55----------
even if i were to get ben though like i


---------26:57----------
said i probably wouldn't rejoin the


---------26:58----------
server


---------26:59----------
uh because i'd probably i i've come to


---------27:02----------
the


---------27:02----------
i'd already come to the conclusion


---------27:04----------
beforehand like that i just felt out of


---------27:06----------
place in the server


---------27:07----------
in general so sure so sometimes


---------27:11----------
um bracken sometimes people will


---------27:14----------
come on a banner like i can just it's


---------27:16----------
kind of weird right because like


---------27:17----------
you're on a ban appeal stream and you're


---------27:19----------
kind of saying i i'm not ready to be


---------27:21----------
unbanned i'm not ready to participate


---------27:23----------
does it feel okay to you how do you feel


---------27:25----------
right now with us saying yeah that


---------27:27----------
sounds okay to us


---------27:28----------
were you hoping or expecting us to say


---------27:32----------
no you really are ready we really want


---------27:34----------
you to be back on the community


---------27:37----------
please come back i saw this as more of a


---------27:38----------
chance to talk to you than


---------27:40----------
a ban appeal to be honest okay


---------27:43----------
that makes sense yeah yeah i'm sorry if


---------27:47----------
if you were a little bit disappointed


---------27:48----------
with how this went


---------27:50----------
no it's fine i i don't know i part of it


---------27:52----------
was just like


---------27:53----------
uh i wanted like to externalize like how


---------27:56----------
i felt myself about


---------27:59----------
my experience in the community because


---------28:00----------
like if


---------28:02----------
if i externalize it then i also get the


---------28:04----------
feedback from you guys so


---------28:06----------
it and chat so it makes it um


---------28:09----------
it just clears it up more in my mind


---------28:11----------
yeah so first of all bracken thank you


---------28:13----------
for coming on man um no


---------28:16----------
problem you know i know it sounded like


---------28:17----------
you wanted to apologize and and get some


---------28:20----------
time with me which i can totally get


---------28:22----------
and at the same time i think you


---------28:23----------
actually have made the community a


---------28:24----------
better place by doing that


---------28:26----------
i think you make it you make all the


---------28:28----------
other people who are having feelings


---------28:30----------
like maybe they don't fit


---------28:31----------
maybe they don't belong i think you


---------28:33----------
normalize their feelings


---------28:35----------
and you've let them know that hey it's


---------28:37----------
okay to like


---------28:38----------
not really connect with the community


---------28:40----------
and have times where it's like difficult


---------28:43----------
to connect and that's actually perfectly


---------28:44----------
fine i think you've also done an


---------28:46----------
awesome job of demonstrating a really


---------28:48----------
important principle which is that


---------28:50----------
sometimes you're just not ready for a


---------28:53----------
particular kind of engagement


---------28:55----------
with another person or a community and


---------28:57----------
that's okay


---------28:58----------
and it's okay to work on yourself first


---------29:00----------
and then maybe engage with a community


---------29:03----------
i'm also kind of sometimes thinking


---------29:04----------
about relationships where sometimes


---------29:06----------
people may really want a relationship


---------29:08----------
and they're just not


---------29:09----------
personally ready so thanks a lot for


---------29:12----------
coming on anyway


---------29:13----------
appreciate it man oh no thank thank you


---------29:16----------
for uh


---------29:16----------
giving me the the time to come on so and


---------29:19----------
and lastly i hope i'm not being harsh


---------29:21----------
here but


---------29:22----------
if bracken was an [ __ ] to you you


---------29:24----------
know


---------29:25----------
we can hear brecken say that he's sorry


---------29:27----------
and we hope that you can forgive him


---------29:29----------
yeah i wanted to apologize personally


---------29:31----------
the person i said to but to be honest i


---------29:33----------
don't even remember who it was so


---------29:34----------
that's okay maybe they remember maybe


---------29:36----------
they don't but i think that's enough


---------29:38----------
good cool man oh yeah thank you thanks


---------29:41----------
for coming on


---------29:43----------
hello hey man that's good


---------29:46----------
um and what are we calling you he-man


---------29:50----------
493 or just he-man


---------29:52----------
he-man so he-man tell me what's going on


---------29:54----------
i was


---------29:55----------
banned because from what he said um


---------29:58----------
i was talking about hentai and he said


---------30:01----------
that the


---------30:02----------
comment was about um me saying i hated


---------30:05----------
sisters


---------30:07----------
okay can you can you tell us he meant a


---------30:09----------
little bit about how you came to join


---------30:11----------
the healthy gamer discord


---------30:12----------
uh i came to the healthy gamer discord


---------30:15----------
because i had a gaming addiction


---------30:17----------
gaming was actually more important to my


---------30:19----------
family than my friends than anything


---------30:21----------
else


---------30:22----------
so um being in the group kind of helped


---------30:25----------
me have a lot


---------30:26----------
more perspective on what was more


---------30:27----------
important um i actually


---------30:30----------
improved very much to where i was


---------30:31----------
actually spending more time with my


---------30:32----------
family


---------30:33----------
i'm getting more projects done stuff


---------30:35----------
like that and so


---------30:37----------
so it sounds like you were addicted to


---------30:39----------
games and then you kind of came in and


---------30:40----------
were doing better


---------30:42----------
oh yeah mostly mostly addiction came


---------30:45----------
from like a lot of my um


---------30:48----------
dealing with molestation and false


---------30:50----------
allegations at my um work


---------30:52----------
was more of a coping mechanism okay and


---------30:55----------
so


---------30:55----------
what's your understanding of why you got


---------30:57----------
banned um


---------30:58----------
i honestly have no clue um


---------31:01----------
the only conversation i can think of


---------31:03----------
that i was talking about hentai was in


---------31:05----------
the context of that


---------31:07----------
um a person was talking about in cells


---------31:10----------
and how like


---------31:11----------
you know they have an issue with like uh


---------31:13----------
disrespecting women


---------31:15----------
and i was making the comparison of the


---------31:17----------
anime community


---------31:18----------
where they are very addicted to hentai


---------31:21----------
where they're very addicted to these


---------31:24----------
particular fictional characters we're to


---------31:27----------
the point where they even fall in love


---------31:28----------
with them


---------31:28----------
and they don't want to improve they


---------31:30----------
don't want to try


---------31:32----------
to be better instead it's more about hey


---------31:35----------
you know


---------31:36----------
why should i even take a shower why


---------31:38----------
should i even you know get a job when i


---------31:39----------
have this


---------31:41----------
hentai girl waiting for me at home every


---------31:42----------
single day that's


---------31:44----------
the only thing i can think of so you


---------31:47----------
were kind of


---------31:47----------
but there was a conversation about like


---------31:49----------
weebos or sorry why


---------31:53----------
yeah or something and and so you're not


---------31:55----------
you're not really sure so maybe we can


---------31:57----------
just ask moses


---------31:58----------
moses what's your understanding of of


---------32:00----------
why he-man was banned


---------32:01----------
okay so i'm gonna add the mod that


---------32:03----------
actually banned he-man


---------32:06----------
hi this one okay never mind so can you


---------32:09----------
tell us a little bit about


---------32:11----------
why he-man was banned the ban reason in


---------32:13----------
itself


---------32:15----------
did say that behavior does not fall in


---------32:17----------
line with the intention of the server


---------32:19----------
self-promotion sending not safe over


---------32:21----------
content in text channels


---------32:23----------
and being inappropriate with members of


---------32:26----------
the healthy gamer community


---------32:27----------
the truth here is that like roughly a


---------32:30----------
month ago we


---------32:31----------
got a report about he-man


---------32:34----------
and another member of our community's


---------32:37----------
interaction with them outside of the


---------32:39----------
server


---------32:40----------
we found a lot of things


---------32:43----------
do you mind if i asked what was the


---------32:45----------
report that you guys received of his


---------32:46----------
activity oh yeah


---------32:48----------
yeah so apparently there was this female


---------32:51----------
member


---------32:52----------
who you had discussed about going


---------32:56----------
to talk on some anime podcasts


---------33:00----------
yeah yeah she uh volunteered to come on


---------33:03----------
to the


---------33:04----------
uh podcast because she was interested in


---------33:06----------
joining us


---------33:07----------
and talking about anime and manga yeah


---------33:10----------
okay


---------33:10----------
that sounds correct and it seems like


---------33:14----------
what happened was that in her


---------33:16----------
description at least


---------33:17----------
she pointed out that throughout your


---------33:20----------
talk


---------33:21----------
you kept trying to initiate a rather


---------33:24----------
sexual conversation no um


---------33:27----------
i don't do that what it was was that


---------33:30----------
um apparently from what my co-host


---------33:33----------
and my partner who runs the business


---------33:36----------
she got afraid because she claimed that


---------33:39----------
she'd seen


---------33:39----------
something in there that she did not like


---------33:42----------
um


---------33:43----------
my friend tried to understand what she


---------33:45----------
was talking about


---------33:46----------
but apparently she just left the group


---------33:49----------
did not explain her reasoning


---------33:51----------
or whatever so let's let's go back to z


---------33:54----------
yeah thanks for sharing your perspective


---------33:55----------
he-man yeah


---------33:57----------
i appreciate you sharing but i would


---------33:59----------
like for you to not interrupt me you can


---------34:01----------
wait until i'm done


---------34:04----------
okay go ahead z yeah so from her


---------34:07----------
point of view um he man kept trying to


---------34:11----------
initiate their other sexual conversation


---------34:13----------
even pointing out that he's interested


---------34:16----------
in the bdsm community and that he's a


---------34:20----------
dom and that he was into submissive


---------34:22----------
woman in itself this report was by the


---------34:24----------
way


---------34:25----------
two thousand characters long so it is a


---------34:27----------
little bit difficult to summarize


---------34:28----------
of course so then what did you guys


---------34:30----------
notice in the server


---------34:32----------
so you said that yeah so this happened


---------34:34----------
off of our server right so that brings


---------34:36----------
up an interesting question about


---------34:37----------
do we act on things that happen outside


---------34:39----------
of our server is that appropriate


---------34:41----------
and when you guys so it prompted you


---------34:43----------
guys to take a closer look which sounds


---------34:44----------
reasonable to me


---------34:46----------
yes so initially if something like this


---------34:49----------
happens what we do is that


---------34:50----------
we would consider mute and then


---------34:54----------
overall look their behavior on the


---------34:55----------
server so


---------34:57----------
throughout our investigation we found a


---------34:59----------
lot of


---------35:00----------
self-promotion some questionable posts


---------35:04----------
and statements


---------35:05----------
and some not safer work


---------35:09----------
posts as well i don't think so because


---------35:13----------
i've never posted


---------35:14----------
a i don't think that's true


---------35:18----------
so let's let's start with just one at a


---------35:20----------
time so you said self-promotion right


---------35:22----------
see what do you mean


---------35:23----------
by that so apparently uh he-man seems to


---------35:27----------
have some kind of


---------35:28----------
podcast where they talk about different


---------35:31----------
kind of topics


---------35:33----------
um including hentai which in itself is


---------35:36----------
not safe for work so there's another


---------35:37----------
rule broken there about keeping posts


---------35:39----------
safe for work well one um


---------35:42----------
we didn't tougher hentai until now and


---------35:45----------
we have no hentai


---------35:47----------
um content on there um two i posted that


---------35:50----------
in the creators


---------35:51----------
um section so


---------35:55----------
unless i was not allowed to do that i


---------35:58----------
mean


---------35:58----------
i don't know exactly what you define as


---------36:00----------
creators creative


---------36:01----------
so could you do that yes that is


---------36:04----------
actually very


---------36:05----------
interesting because when when this uh


---------36:08----------
report was brought to our


---------36:09----------
attention and we looked up your post


---------36:11----------
history it was kind of surprising for


---------36:13----------
all of us that this had been going on


---------36:15----------
for so long without


---------36:16----------
any of us catching on so it is maybe a


---------36:19----------
fault on our part


---------36:20----------
and could have been reported by other


---------36:22----------
members or maybe even


---------36:24----------
the rules throughout your stay on the


---------36:25----------
server had changed


---------36:28----------
fair enough so then so in addition to


---------36:30----------
self-promotion


---------36:31----------
z you said there were a couple of other


---------36:32----------
things that you all noticed or had


---------36:34----------
concerns about


---------36:35----------
there are some questionable posts and


---------36:38----------
statements


---------36:39----------
the thing is that um in okay it seems


---------36:42----------
like


---------36:43----------
some of these posts were not written by


---------36:46----------
you but they were


---------36:47----------
shared by you so that in our opinion


---------36:50----------
kind of reflects on your behavior


---------36:52----------
and what you stand for so there was this


---------36:55----------
one go ahead there was this one post


---------36:59----------
where it actually says sisters are


---------37:02----------
[ __ ] worthless


---------37:04----------
mine won't do [ __ ] to help me relieve me


---------37:06----------
of my sexual


---------37:07----------
poverty won't hook me up with her


---------37:09----------
friends won't bring me to parties won't


---------37:11----------
give me money so i can get facial


---------37:13----------
services


---------37:14----------
oh i know exactly what that was very


---------37:16----------
long post but that those are the few


---------37:18----------
first lines of it oh i know exactly what


---------37:21----------
that was about


---------37:22----------
what that was about was we were having a


---------37:24----------
discussion about me being an um


---------37:26----------
i was uh um talking about my experience


---------37:29----------
dealing with incels when they were


---------37:31----------
trying to


---------37:32----------
harass me um they actually called me a


---------37:35----------
tyrone


---------37:36----------
and rachel pro found me i think that was


---------37:38----------
like some black chat or something


---------37:40----------
and they sent me all this stuff and i


---------37:43----------
was showing these people what these guys


---------37:45----------
were doing


---------37:46----------
their discord got banned so it wasn't


---------37:49----------
really me


---------37:49----------
trying to say i hate sisters because i


---------37:51----------
don't have any to really hate


---------37:54----------
um it was me more showing uh the gamer


---------37:57----------
uh


---------37:58----------
healthy gamer gg community what these


---------38:00----------
guys actually believe in


---------38:01----------
what these guys stand for and why they


---------38:04----------
stand for it


---------38:05----------
um so again i will add it's very


---------38:08----------
important to ask for context when you


---------38:10----------
make these


---------38:11----------
bands because when you don't


---------38:14----------
a lot of people can get unfairly banned


---------38:16----------
and they can piss them off


---------38:18----------
so it's very important to just may have


---------38:21----------
pulled me to the side and say


---------38:22----------
hey what was this about or


---------38:25----------
do you really believe in this because


---------38:28----------
banning me outright


---------38:30----------
was just kind of kind of wrong but


---------38:33----------
that's just my opinion


---------38:35----------
and was there anything else that you


---------38:36----------
guys kind of wanted to add that


---------38:38----------
that sort of contributed to the ban um


---------38:41----------
another one is


---------38:42----------
i think ultimately a lot of guys don't


---------38:44----------
have enough confidence


---------38:46----------
that there will be any more single woman


---------38:48----------
that they want and if


---------38:49----------
people suggest to them why don't you get


---------38:51----------
a trans woman and why don't you date a


---------38:53----------
single mother


---------38:54----------
they'll get angry just because it's almo


---------38:56----------
it's almost like getting a consolation


---------38:58----------
prize


---------38:59----------
the reason why i said that is because


---------39:01----------
there are a lot of men


---------39:02----------
in the uh gamer community that for some


---------39:06----------
reason believe


---------39:07----------
that they are unfairly treated


---------39:11----------
because they do not they're not able to


---------39:14----------
get the


---------39:15----------
um scarlett johansson's or the very


---------39:18----------
pretty women in the world


---------39:20----------
and they believe that if a woman who


---------39:24----------
has a child or a woman who is a little


---------39:26----------
bit overweight


---------39:27----------
or a woman who may not fit the beauty


---------39:29----------
standards of society


---------39:32----------
are attracted to them they feel as if


---------39:34----------
they're getting a consolation pride


---------39:36----------
so that is what i was trying to uh


---------39:40----------
um say in that dm was that these men


---------39:43----------
are not looking at the bigger picture


---------39:45----------
they're not looking at this woman who's


---------39:47----------
actually showing them actually affection


---------39:49----------
and loving them for them


---------39:51----------
but they're judging that woman based


---------39:53----------
upon


---------39:54----------
oh she's not really pretty she's not


---------39:58----------
she has a child or she


---------40:01----------
she's too ugly for me that's what it was


---------40:05----------
so ximena let me ask you a question have


---------40:08----------
you been watching the other ban appeals


---------40:11----------
yep and what have you thought so far


---------40:13----------
have you thought that those ban appeals


---------40:14----------
were dealt with in a fair way


---------40:16----------
yeah i believe that it was uh that


---------40:20----------
um well more or less i would have maybe


---------40:22----------
had a private call


---------40:23----------
not on twitch but i do believe that it


---------40:27----------
was much more better for them to be able


---------40:29----------
to kind of


---------40:30----------
speak on their behalf and you know you


---------40:33----------
know


---------40:34----------
say their piece and generally speaking


---------40:36----------
so sometimes we've sort of like arrived


---------40:38----------
at some conclusions and i know this is


---------40:40----------
going to sound kind of weird but


---------40:41----------
twitch chat also has like voiced their


---------40:43----------
opinion have you felt like twitch chat's


---------40:45----------
opinion has been relatively fair


---------40:47----------
um i i honestly am not watching


---------40:51----------
um twitch chat right now so i don't know


---------40:53----------
okay so i'll give you like an example so


---------40:55----------
the first guy said that he said some


---------40:56----------
really vicious things and he was kind of


---------40:58----------
in an emotionally bad place


---------41:00----------
and that he didn't really feel like he


---------41:02----------
was like ready to come back to the


---------41:04----------
server and twitch chat sort of agreed


---------41:06----------
and so that's something so then the


---------41:10----------
question that i have so we haven't asked


---------41:11----------
to a chat but in a second we're going to


---------41:13----------
pull twitch at and we're going to ask


---------41:15----------
them whether


---------41:15----------
we think you should be unbanned or not


---------41:18----------
if they say that you're unbanned do you


---------41:20----------
think that would be fair


---------41:21----------
yeah i guess if they say that you should


---------41:24----------
remain banned


---------41:25----------
do you think that would be fair sure


---------41:28----------
okay so let's ask do you really think so


---------41:31----------
um


---------41:32----------
i mean i wouldn't mind being unbanned i


---------41:34----------
don't think that anything i said was


---------41:36----------
like


---------41:37----------
toxic or anything there was no i i


---------41:39----------
wasn't


---------41:40----------
i wasn't trying to like post anything


---------41:43----------
unsafe for work it was more of where


---------41:45----------
this was just showing us more of an


---------41:46----------
example of a conversation


---------41:48----------
yeah i get you man so so i think what


---------41:50----------
zeke commented i i think


---------41:52----------
i i can tell as well is that like you


---------41:54----------
have a different perspective right


---------41:56----------
so you're saying that like z's


---------41:58----------
perspective like there's a different


---------41:59----------
side of things so what i'm asking you is


---------42:02----------
when a bunch of people


---------42:03----------
seem to have a perspective that isn't


---------42:05----------
your own


---------42:07----------
how do you know whether they're wrong or


---------42:09----------
you're wrong


---------42:10----------
honestly i all i know is that what i


---------42:12----------
know and i'll


---------42:13----------
only know what i what my intention was


---------42:16----------
from the post


---------42:17----------
and it wasn't to um


---------42:21----------
try to troll or anything like that i


---------42:24----------
i get you i i get you i think you've


---------42:26----------
made that very clear


---------42:28----------
and at the same time the question that


---------42:30----------
i'm asking you is i agree


---------42:31----------
that all you know is what you know and


---------42:34----------
when


---------42:34----------
other people tell you something else how


---------42:37----------
do you reconcile


---------42:39----------
what you know versus what other people


---------42:41----------
are telling you


---------42:42----------
how do you know whether what you know is


---------42:45----------
right or wrong like how do you


---------42:46----------
critically look at your own thought


---------42:48----------
process


---------42:49----------
and statements to know like sure you


---------42:51----------
have your perspective right so you said


---------42:53----------
that like


---------42:54----------
essentially like you weren't advocating


---------42:56----------
for that you are using that as actually


---------42:57----------
an example


---------42:59----------
of what is back what so in a sense you


---------43:02----------
actually like side completely with the


---------43:03----------
mods that you were


---------43:04----------
you posted something not as a


---------43:06----------
representation of your own views


---------43:08----------
but as a representation of views that


---------43:09----------
you strongly disagree with and that you


---------43:11----------
think are wrong


---------43:14----------
makes sense to me and at the same time


---------43:16----------
what i would encourage you so let's go


---------43:17----------
ahead and just ask twitch at whether


---------43:19----------
we think that you should be banned or


---------43:21----------
unbanned


---------43:22----------
and he meant what i would encourage you


---------43:23----------
to do so it would make sense to me if


---------43:25----------
they felt


---------43:26----------
like um you know that


---------43:29----------
you have sort of a counterpoint to a lot


---------43:31----------
of this kind of stuff


---------43:33----------
and at the same time it would also make


---------43:34----------
sense to me that like sometimes talking


---------43:37----------
to women about how you're a dom


---------43:38----------
and and women feeling like you're sort


---------43:41----------
of


---------43:42----------
sexually inappropriate with them on a


---------43:44----------
podcast


---------43:45----------
and something that you don't understand


---------43:47----------
because all you see is what you know


---------43:50----------
that's something that's worth looking at


---------43:53----------
does that make sense


---------43:55----------
no that wasn't right either i didn't


---------43:57----------
talk to anybody about me being a dom


---------43:59----------
or anything like that what was that


---------44:01----------
statement


---------44:03----------
um yeah so in the report it clearly


---------44:06----------
states


---------44:07----------
that he-man randomly told me that he was


---------44:10----------
into bdsm


---------44:11----------
community and that he's a dom and if i


---------44:13----------
knew what adom was and that he liked


---------44:15----------
submissive


---------44:16----------
woman out of the blue i tried to keep


---------44:18----------
this conversation


---------44:19----------
being about anime podcasting but he kept


---------44:22----------
mentioning


---------44:23----------
sexual harassment topics um


---------44:26----------
no so hold up hold on a second amen


---------44:29----------
so i know you say no in response to that


---------44:32----------
so let's just forget about what actually


---------44:34----------
happened


---------44:35----------
the question that i'm asking you is when


---------44:38----------
someone has a perspective


---------44:39----------
that is very different from your own how


---------44:42----------
do you approach that


---------44:43----------
do you just say no and they're wrong and


---------44:46----------
i'm right


---------44:48----------
well i told them that's not what i said


---------44:50----------
i mean


---------44:51----------
and do they have any evidence of me


---------44:53----------
actually saying it


---------44:54----------
um it's it's from as far as i can


---------44:59----------
tell from this young lady she either


---------45:02----------
misheard


---------45:03----------
or misinterpreted what i was saying that


---------45:06----------
was


---------45:06----------
not what we were talking about great


---------45:08----------
he-man so now we get to something


---------45:10----------
interesting right so when a lot of


---------45:12----------
people


---------45:13----------
consistently mishear or misinterpret


---------45:16----------
what you say how do you deal with that


---------45:20----------
i try to correct them i try to have a


---------45:23----------
conversation with them


---------45:25----------
yeah so maybe buddy what you should do


---------45:27----------
is when a lot of people are mishearing


---------45:29----------
you


---------45:30----------
maybe you should instead of correcting


---------45:32----------
them think about


---------45:33----------
like the way that you're coming across


---------45:36----------
because what i'm hearing is a pattern of


---------45:38----------
misunderstanding


---------45:40----------
right that's the way that you're


---------45:41----------
describing it and generally speaking in


---------45:44----------
my experience


---------45:46----------
when there's a pattern of


---------45:47----------
misunderstanding that revolves around


---------45:49----------
one person that person is the one that's


---------45:52----------
doing most of the misunderstanding


---------45:54----------
uh that's sure um


---------45:57----------
it's something to think about i mean i


---------45:59----------
don't have a rule


---------46:01----------
for you but i i i'm not trying to bully


---------46:04----------
you or anything like that i'm just


---------46:05----------
saying that like


---------46:06----------
so by the way so i i think 75 of people


---------46:09----------
don't believe you should be on band so


---------46:11----------
they think that the ban is appropriate


---------46:14----------
and i recognize i can see how that's


---------46:16----------
like really confusing


---------46:17----------
because the whole point here is you


---------46:19----------
started this conversation off with


---------46:21----------
saying


---------46:21----------
i don't understand why i was banned and


---------46:23----------
you don't see


---------46:24----------
anything that you did wrong and you


---------46:26----------
provide actually good


---------46:28----------
reasons right so if like mods are


---------46:29----------
banning you for quoting something


---------46:32----------
that you are actually like in the


---------46:33----------
context of the conversation you're


---------46:35----------
saying


---------46:36----------
it's inappropriate to use the word dildo


---------46:38----------
when you're talking to someone


---------46:39----------
and then they ban you for using the word


---------46:41----------
dildo it's like what the [ __ ] mods


---------46:43----------
i was saying that it's inappropriate


---------46:45----------
does that make sense


---------46:47----------
yeah it almost sounded like either she


---------46:50----------
only listened to a portion of what i


---------46:53----------
said or


---------46:53----------
maybe she just maybe what she was saying


---------46:56----------
uh what i was saying


---------46:58----------
she thought i was talking about that i i


---------47:01----------
get that and my point to you is that


---------47:03----------
when you


---------47:03----------
are have a pattern of interactions


---------47:07----------
where it appears to you like people are


---------47:10----------
only listening to a portion of what


---------47:12----------
you're saying


---------47:13----------
and not giving you the appropriate


---------47:14----------
context maybe that's a reason to


---------47:17----------
re-examine your


---------47:18----------
own communication because there is a


---------47:20----------
pattern of misunderstanding what you're


---------47:22----------
trying to say


---------47:23----------
and so when there's a pattern of


---------47:25----------
misunderstanding what you're trying to


---------47:26----------
say


---------47:27----------
you can try to convince the rest of the


---------47:29----------
world that you're not saying what you're


---------47:31----------
saying


---------47:31----------
or maybe you're conveying something that


---------47:33----------
you don't realize you're conveying


---------47:36----------
okay does that make sense


---------47:39----------
sure yeah i get it i mean you don't


---------47:42----------
sound like you sound like you


---------47:43----------
are conceding the point but i don't i'm


---------47:46----------
not


---------47:47----------
i feel like you you still don't really


---------47:48----------
get it i get it


---------47:50----------
i get it i'm not i'm not i'm genuinely


---------47:52----------
dude because i i think


---------47:54----------
like everything that you're saying


---------47:55----------
actually makes sense to me


---------47:57----------
and i think like that's what's so tragic


---------47:58----------
about the situation is i don't think


---------48:00----------
that your intentions


---------48:01----------
are genuinely bad and if you know i it's


---------48:05----------
really bizarre i i don't know


---------48:06----------
what to think when one person has an


---------48:09----------
impression that you're like


---------48:10----------
asking them if they like submissives and


---------48:12----------
you're telling them about


---------48:13----------
how you're a dom and you're saying you


---------48:15----------
never said that i don't know what to


---------48:16----------
make of that


---------48:17----------
what i wonder about is that when there's


---------48:19----------
like when you have


---------48:20----------
that kind of experience with like a


---------48:22----------
dozen people and i'm not saying that


---------48:24----------
it's a dozen people and you can dispute


---------48:25----------
that point what i'm saying is that


---------48:27----------
and z sort of said it right she's like


---------48:29----------
each of these things on their own is


---------48:31----------
like it's not really potentially a


---------48:33----------
bannable offense


---------48:34----------
but there's something here that the mods


---------48:36----------
feel like is like generally


---------48:38----------
inappropriate


---------48:38----------
and so it makes sense to me that you're


---------48:40----------
confused why you got banned because


---------48:42----------
you really don't feel like you stepped


---------48:43----------
out of line and what i'm saying is that


---------48:45----------
maybe you didn't explicitly step out of


---------48:47----------
line but that there's a lot of


---------48:49----------
communication


---------48:50----------
that you're offering which for some


---------48:52----------
reason is perceived


---------48:54----------
by multiple people in a different way


---------48:57----------
from what you're conveying


---------48:58----------
and when any time i have


---------49:01----------
something that i think i'm saying and


---------49:03----------
one person disagrees


---------49:04----------
sure maybe i'll try to convince them but


---------49:06----------
if there are a dozen people that i have


---------49:08----------
a conversation with and they


---------49:09----------
all sort of read something into what i'm


---------49:12----------
saying that like i don't think i'm


---------49:14----------
saying


---------49:15----------
it really causes me to look at my


---------49:16----------
communication


---------49:18----------
so i would really encourage you to do


---------49:19----------
that


---------49:21----------
all right that's something i can do and


---------49:24----------
i


---------49:24----------
i really do appreciate you coming on


---------49:26----------
because i think this is a this is


---------49:27----------
actually an awesome example


---------49:29----------
of how like communication can be really


---------49:31----------
confusing and some people feel like


---------49:33----------
bands


---------49:34----------
are inappropriate now i don't know


---------49:36----------
actually it's not my place to decide


---------49:38----------
whether the ban is appropriate or


---------49:39----------
inappropriate


---------49:41----------
i just know that generally speaking i


---------49:42----------
think our mods do a pretty good job and


---------49:44----------
i think i would encourage you to like


---------49:46----------
because i i do think actually twitch


---------49:47----------
chat is like pretty good about this


---------49:49----------
and you know twitch hat does feel like


---------49:51----------
the band was kind of appropriate and so


---------49:53----------
like i would really like take this as an


---------49:56----------
opportunity for self-reflection


---------49:59----------
and and maybe it is just that you know


---------50:01----------
you're quoting things inappropriately


---------50:02----------
but like


---------50:03----------
i would really stop and think you know


---------50:05----------
because if people are perceiving


---------50:07----------
that you're talking about you know bdsm


---------50:10----------
in an inappropriate manner like i would


---------50:12----------
really try to figure out where that's


---------50:14----------
coming from


---------50:15----------
okay right because it does seem like


---------50:17----------
it's not just one person


---------50:19----------
it's like there's a pattern of like


---------50:21----------
right on the edge kind of stuff that


---------50:23----------
some people feel is over the line and


---------50:25----------
you don't feel as overblind and you're


---------50:26----------
entitled to your opinion


---------50:28----------
and i get where you're coming from and


---------50:29----------
at the same time the pattern sort of


---------50:31----------
like bothers me a little bit and i think


---------50:33----------
deserves some amount of reflection


---------50:36----------
okay thanks for coming on man appreciate


---------50:39----------
it


---------50:40----------
and good luck to you in your anime


---------50:42----------
podcast


---------50:43----------
yeah yeah thanks


---------50:55----------
you
