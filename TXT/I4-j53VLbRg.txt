---------00:00----------
so how to deal with an aggressive


---------00:01----------
teenager


---------00:03----------
addicted to video games right so this is


---------00:05----------
this is a good one right hey hi dr k um


---------00:08----------
i need advice on what to do with my


---------00:10----------
younger brother 17 he is autistic but


---------00:12----------
attends regular school with a decent


---------00:14----------
performance he didn't get any special


---------00:16----------
education but we made efforts to be


---------00:18----------
understanding for his difficulties


---------00:20----------
before the pandemic he was socially


---------00:21----------
inept but still had a good relationship


---------00:23----------
with us with the start of the pandemic


---------00:25----------
he got a phone and became addicted to


---------00:26----------
video games and his behavior changed


---------00:29----------
he locks himself in his room all day


---------00:31----------
barely eats yells loudly for hours on


---------00:33----------
end while playing pvp games he also uses


---------00:36----------
very foul language and often punches or


---------00:38----------
throws objects violently


---------00:40----------
his shouting doesn't stop at night and


---------00:42----------
he and doesn't allow anyone to sleep


---------00:44----------
parents and four siblings when


---------00:46----------
confronted about his behavior even by a


---------00:48----------
simple knock on the door to remind him


---------00:50----------
to lower his voice he goes into fits of


---------00:52----------
rage and blames it all on us


---------00:54----------
saying we should leave him alone until


---------00:55----------
he calms down which sometimes takes


---------00:57----------
hours to days which is an inconvenience


---------00:59----------
last year he ran away from home and


---------01:01----------
sometimes he threatens to do it again


---------01:03----------
when he puts down his video games he


---------01:04----------
becomes a little more open discussion


---------01:06----------
and promises to change and says he


---------01:08----------
understands the problem however a few


---------01:10----------
minutes later he goes back to video


---------01:11----------
games and forgets all of that and all


---------01:14----------
the shouting cursing disrespectful


---------01:15----------
speech resumes


---------01:17----------
my father gave up on him and doesn't


---------01:19----------
want to take him to a mental health


---------01:20----------
professional i am an unemployed college


---------01:22----------
student so i can't do that myself how


---------01:24----------
should i talk to my brother should i ask


---------01:26----------
for outside help


---------01:28----------
um


---------01:30----------
ps i'd be overjoyed if dr k saw this i


---------01:32----------
saw it but he did he


---------01:34----------
but if he didn't would appreciate any


---------01:36----------
advice i think you should check out the


---------01:37----------
advice in the thread as well uh thank


---------01:40----------
you to dr k and and thank you to the


---------01:42----------
wonderful community


---------01:43----------
so this is a hard one


---------01:46----------
so we get a lot of posts


---------01:49----------
about people asking what can i do in


---------01:51----------
this situation


---------01:52----------
and sometimes you know for parents and


---------01:55----------
stuff i think that there's a lot more


---------01:56----------
that they can do


---------01:58----------
but a lot of the posts that we get are


---------01:59----------
from like siblings


---------02:01----------
who are like you know hey my my you know


---------02:03----------
my younger brother or sister or whatever


---------02:05----------
has a problem what can i do to support


---------02:07----------
them we also get a lot of posts from


---------02:09----------
people like asking about friends right


---------02:11----------
they'll say oh my friend is struggling


---------02:12----------
with depression like


---------02:14----------
what can i do


---------02:15----------
what can i do my my friend or partner is


---------02:17----------
suicidal like i don't know how to


---------02:18----------
support them


---------02:20----------
we get a lot of requests for people


---------02:22----------
asking what can i do


---------02:24----------
in situations where


---------02:27----------
they're not really empowered to do much


---------02:30----------
so the first thing that you've got to do


---------02:31----------
if you're in a situation like this


---------02:33----------
is first of all recognize like what


---------02:36----------
you're empowered to do and what you're


---------02:38----------
not empowered to do


---------02:40----------
and this in and of itself is like


---------02:41----------
oftentimes a place that people get


---------02:43----------
tripped up because they want to do so


---------02:45----------
much right your desires you care about


---------02:48----------
your brother you really want to try hard


---------02:50----------
like the amount of energy or will


---------02:53----------
that you have to help him


---------02:56----------
is actually potentially outweighed by


---------02:59----------
what you're actually capable of


---------03:01----------
and we see this a lot in medicine right


---------03:03----------
so sometimes you know you'll see this


---------03:05----------
like i tend to think about things like


---------03:06----------
cancer where you know


---------03:08----------
people are willing to do everything


---------03:10----------
within their power they're willing to


---------03:11----------
take any medicine they're willing to do


---------03:13----------
this they're willing to do that you have


---------03:14----------
lots of doctors that are you know


---------03:16----------
willing to go above and beyond to try to


---------03:18----------
save this patient's life


---------03:19----------
and at the end of the day you just may


---------03:21----------
not be able to


---------03:22----------
so you can want something a lot


---------03:24----------
especially as a sibling you can care


---------03:26----------
about your brother you can love your


---------03:28----------
brother but one of the first things that


---------03:30----------
it's difficult to do is to accept that


---------03:33----------
you cannot fix this problem you can try


---------03:36----------
to help him by all means but you have to


---------03:38----------
start out of the gate recognizing that


---------03:40----------
like you know there's only so much you


---------03:42----------
can do as an older sibling who's


---------03:43----------
unemployed and in college and that's


---------03:45----------
your karma


---------03:46----------
that's not really up to you right you


---------03:48----------
can't magically be their parent


---------03:51----------
some


---------03:52----------
siblings will try right so some siblings


---------03:55----------
will get parentified once their parents


---------03:58----------
check out and they become responsible


---------04:00----------
for younger siblings


---------04:02----------
so ultimately the first thing and this


---------04:04----------
is where we also kind of come it comes


---------04:05----------
back to dharma and karma so what's your


---------04:07----------
dharma what's your duty in the situation


---------04:10----------
and what's your karma what are you


---------04:12----------
actually capable of what's your


---------04:13----------
circumstance


---------04:16----------
so i know it's kind of hard but the


---------04:17----------
first thing you've got to really do is


---------04:18----------
like think through those things like


---------04:20----------
what is your response what is the


---------04:21----------
responsibility


---------04:22----------
of an older sibling to a younger sibling


---------04:25----------
what's the responsibility of a 22 year


---------04:27----------
old to a 17 year old


---------04:30----------
first thing to think about and


---------04:31----------
furthermore what are you capable of


---------04:33----------
because you're gonna you're gonna beat


---------04:34----------
yourself up and you're gonna feel


---------04:35----------
ashamed of yourself and it's gonna be so


---------04:37----------
terrible like because you love your


---------04:38----------
brother so much and you want so much you


---------04:40----------
want to do so much for him but if you're


---------04:41----------
not able to you're going to just tear


---------04:43----------
yourself apart internally and you're


---------04:44----------
going to blame yourself which is not


---------04:45----------
going to help anyone


---------04:49----------
so that's the first thing is to


---------04:50----------
recognize basically i'm going to assume


---------04:52----------
that you have essentially no real power


---------04:54----------
in this situation like for example as


---------04:56----------
his older sibling you can't take away


---------04:57----------
his video games right like i'm assuming


---------04:59----------
you can't do that


---------05:00----------
um you're not you may not understand


---------05:02----------
health insurance or whatever i don't


---------05:03----------
know what country you're in but you may


---------05:05----------
not be able to take him to uh because


---------05:07----------
he's a minor so he's 17 so you may not


---------05:09----------
be able to take him to a medical doctor


---------05:10----------
or therapist because you're not his


---------05:12----------
guardian right so there are a lot of


---------05:14----------
things that you can't do which it sounds


---------05:16----------
like your brother needs


---------05:17----------
so let's get on to that


---------05:19----------
so the first thing is i'm so sorry that


---------05:21----------
your dad seems to have mentally checked


---------05:23----------
out and is unwilling to take him to see


---------05:24----------
a therapist because i i think


---------05:25----------
essentially what needs to happen in the


---------05:27----------
situation is that your parents need to


---------05:30----------
take responsibility and furthermore


---------05:32----------
they it's not their fault but like


---------05:34----------
they're probably not equipped to deal


---------05:36----------
with something like this


---------05:37----------
so this is where you know sometimes


---------05:39----------
we'll say hey like you guys should sign


---------05:40----------
up for coaching coaching can help with


---------05:42----------
with this when it comes to something


---------05:43----------
like this and even within our parent


---------05:45----------
coaching we have this issue where when


---------05:47----------
it comes to the intersection of autism


---------05:48----------
spectrum and addiction especially video


---------05:50----------
game addiction i really think that


---------05:52----------
having a a real mental health


---------05:54----------
professional involved is like really


---------05:56----------
what you need


---------05:58----------
so remember that autism spectrum has


---------06:00----------
such a constellation


---------06:02----------
of symptoms so we do see things like


---------06:06----------
emotions that get out of control very


---------06:08----------
quickly we do see less control over


---------06:11----------
addictive behaviors we see meltdowns


---------06:13----------
behavioral disturbances things like that


---------06:16----------
there are also different kinds of


---------06:17----------
communication problems so you know in


---------06:19----------
the worst cases we have


---------06:20----------
people on the autism spectrum that are


---------06:22----------
non-verbal and really don't communicate


---------06:24----------
at all


---------06:25----------
then we have people on the high


---------06:26----------
functioning autism that can go to school


---------06:28----------
and things like that and have


---------06:29----------
conversations but their internal ability


---------06:32----------
to become aware of their actions and


---------06:34----------
behaviors like maybe pretty low so


---------06:37----------
they'll make promises but as soon as the


---------06:39----------
game turns on like everything goes out


---------06:40----------
the window they're not like capable of


---------06:42----------
remembering the promise that they made


---------06:44----------
their mind can't remind them hey


---------06:46----------
remember we promised this thing


---------06:49----------
so this is where working with a


---------06:50----------
professional is so important because


---------06:52----------
ideally the professional will understand


---------06:54----------
and map out for the family


---------06:57----------
what the child can and can't handle


---------07:00----------
then ideally what you need to do is set


---------07:01----------
up a very strict


---------07:04----------
boundary plan around gaming usage


---------07:07----------
right and what i'm sort of hearing in


---------07:08----------
this situation is that there are


---------07:10----------
essentially no boundaries being set on


---------07:12----------
the child because


---------07:14----------
the child really flips out and so since


---------07:17----------
everyone is walking on eggshells around


---------07:19----------
the child


---------07:20----------
you're propagating a lot of bad behavior


---------07:22----------
that is getting worse and worse and no


---------07:23----------
one is putting a check on the bad


---------07:24----------
behavior so it's just going to grow out


---------07:26----------
of proportion right it's kind of like


---------07:28----------
you know if i have an ant mound in my


---------07:30----------
front yard and i don't do anything to


---------07:31----------
stop the ants the ant-man will keep


---------07:33----------
growing like it'll it'll be an


---------07:34----------
infestation if i've got termites in my


---------07:36----------
house and i don't do anything to stop


---------07:38----------
them it'll just keep growing


---------07:39----------
so behaviors will continue to grow or be


---------07:42----------
shaped by the video games until someone


---------07:44----------
sets some kind of limit


---------07:47----------
and this is where promises extracting a


---------07:50----------
promise from someone is not setting a


---------07:52----------
limit


---------07:54----------
so setting a limit is about having some


---------07:56----------
kind of behavioral consequence when a


---------07:59----------
certain kind of behavior happens


---------08:01----------
extracting a promise is insufficient


---------08:03----------
so this is what we see like back when i


---------08:05----------
worked in an addiction rehab you know


---------08:07----------
i'd have some patients who made lots of


---------08:09----------
promises for many years they're like


---------08:11----------
yeah i promise i'll quit drinking my


---------08:13----------
last drink i swear i'll never do it


---------08:14----------
again promise after promise after


---------08:15----------
promise for year after year after year


---------08:20----------
and they're not lying they're very


---------08:22----------
genuine in that moment right like they


---------08:23----------
really do believe it they're remorseful


---------08:26----------
month goes by three months go by six


---------08:28----------
months go by


---------08:30----------
and then kind of just sort of forget


---------08:32----------
right it's like making a new year's


---------08:33----------
resolution the day that you make a new


---------08:35----------
year's resolution i'm gonna cut out soda


---------08:37----------
for


---------08:38----------
2022 gg no more soda


---------08:41----------
you really mean it there's a lot of


---------08:42----------
motivation there right


---------08:44----------
just over time the mind is kind of


---------08:46----------
tricky it sort of forgets it kind of


---------08:48----------
yeah


---------08:50----------
a little bit every once in a while is


---------08:51----------
okay


---------08:53----------
like it doesn't matter like i'm eating


---------08:54----------
cookies anyway so like what's the


---------08:56----------
difference between cookies and soda like


---------08:57----------
if i'm gonna eat some sugar like


---------08:58----------
sometimes i just enjoy a soda more than


---------09:00----------
a cookie like there are all kinds of


---------09:01----------
rationalizations that you know


---------09:03----------
mine gets distracted you go back to the


---------09:05----------
behavior


---------09:07----------
so why do people show up at rehab


---------09:10----------
because their partner is like i'm a


---------09:11----------
divorce you i'm done with this


---------09:14----------
either you go


---------09:15----------
rehab or i'm done


---------09:17----------
so 30


---------09:19----------
of people that have been


---------09:21----------
the rough estimate okay i don't have


---------09:23----------
real data on this but i want to say that


---------09:24----------
30 percent of people that i took care of


---------09:26----------
or like patients at rehabs that i worked


---------09:28----------
at were undergoing a divorce or


---------09:30----------
separation there has to be a consequence


---------09:33----------
in order to drive the behavior


---------09:35----------
and the problem is if you're like 22


---------09:36----------
years old and you've got a 17 year old


---------09:38----------
like i don't know that you can drive


---------09:39----------
that consequence and if your parents are


---------09:41----------
mentally checked out i think you guys


---------09:42----------
it's a really hard uphill battle i don't


---------09:45----------
think you're going to be able to fix it


---------09:46----------
on your own bluntly


---------09:48----------
so i i mean this is what we do in parent


---------09:50----------
coaching is we'll help parents


---------09:53----------
work with their children with autism and


---------09:55----------
set limits


---------09:56----------
and even then especially in the cases of


---------09:58----------
autism we also recommend


---------10:00----------
real mental health professional mental


---------10:02----------
health help specifically because when it


---------10:04----------
comes to autism it's such a


---------10:06----------
heterogeneous manifestation that there


---------10:09----------
isn't like a playbook for autism if any


---------10:11----------
of you all have autism or you have a


---------10:13----------
family member with autism you understand


---------10:15----------
that there's no playbook for autism


---------10:17----------
autism in and of itself has so many


---------10:18----------
different presentations and so setting


---------10:21----------
up the right kind of behavioral plan for


---------10:22----------
someone with autism requires you


---------10:24----------
understanding


---------10:25----------
where their deficits are and what their


---------10:27----------
where their strengths are


---------10:29----------
right


---------10:30----------
and so for example one just one simple


---------10:32----------
example is like generally speaking


---------10:33----------
people with autism do better with


---------10:35----------
concrete communication


---------10:37----------
so like setting very firm limits that


---------10:39----------
are like super concrete it's not like


---------10:41----------
get good grades


---------10:43----------
like that's too abstract so you have to


---------10:44----------
be like you have to study for a minimum


---------10:46----------
of two hours a day and get scores higher


---------10:48----------
than 90.


---------10:50----------
and if you don't do that we will reduce


---------10:52----------
your gaming time by this amount


---------10:55----------
so it needs to become like a very


---------10:58----------
strict kind of behavioral plan


---------11:00----------
then i think this is where you know i


---------11:02----------
hate to say it chat but sometimes we do


---------11:04----------
help your parents set better limits on


---------11:06----------
you which i think is something that you


---------11:08----------
all appreciate over time so that we've


---------11:10----------
heard on stream as well from guests


---------11:12----------
we've heard you know


---------11:15----------
like burnt out gifted kids say yeah i


---------11:17----------
wish my parents you know were stricter


---------11:19----------
on me like i wish they forced me to


---------11:20----------
study when i was a kid so that i knew


---------11:22----------
how to study as an adult


---------11:24----------
so sometimes we really encourage hard


---------11:27----------
limit setting


---------11:29----------
and so when it comes to autism i think


---------11:30----------
as a 22 year old i just don't know how


---------11:32----------
much you're capable of because if you


---------11:33----------
guys have decided that you're not going


---------11:34----------
to seek mental health help and your dad


---------11:36----------
is basically mentally checked out and


---------11:38----------
you guys aren't going to set limits on


---------11:39----------
the kid i don't i don't know what you


---------11:40----------
can do as a 22 year old you can ask him


---------11:43----------
you can say hey like what do you think


---------11:45----------
about your gaming


---------11:47----------
it's disruptive for me


---------11:50----------
but i i think getting him to a therapist


---------11:52----------
and maybe talking to your parents about


---------11:54----------
like hey i'm worried like maybe the best


---------11:56----------
thing you can do is talk to your parents


---------11:57----------
and say hey i'm worried about my brother


---------11:59----------
like i think this is getting worse what


---------12:00----------
do you all think


---------12:02----------
and then your parents are gonna say like


---------12:03----------
yeah it's getting worse but we don't


---------12:04----------
know what to do


---------12:06----------
and that's when you can say okay so if


---------12:08----------
you don't know what to do i don't know


---------12:09----------
what to do either


---------12:10----------
generally speaking when you don't know


---------12:12----------
what to do maybe we should go consult a


---------12:14----------
professional because it's their job to


---------12:16----------
know what to do


---------12:17----------
right i don't think that he's like ill


---------12:19----------
or anything and it's not like you guys


---------12:20----------
are doing a bad job but it just feels to


---------12:23----------
me like we're outgunned in this


---------12:25----------
situation so maybe we need to get a


---------12:27----------
little bit of help


---------12:28----------
and i think if you can really win over


---------12:30----------
your parents and get them to a


---------12:31----------
professional


---------12:32----------
that'll be like the first step


---------12:49----------
you
