---------00:00----------
so a couple of quick announcements so


---------00:02----------
we're starting our coaching program


---------00:04----------
i mean sorry our coaching program has


---------00:06----------
been full for a couple of weeks now


---------00:08----------
um we're releasing a bunch of spots on


---------00:11----------
november 9th


---------00:12----------
um for those of you guys who don't know


---------00:14----------
what our coaching program is


---------00:16----------
so it's not a medical treatment right so


---------00:18----------
if we think about


---------00:20----------
medical treatment is like


---------00:21----------
anti-depression right like that's what


---------00:23----------
the medications are called


---------00:24----------
antidepressants coaching is like sort of


---------00:26----------
pro happiness or like


---------00:28----------
pro moving forward in life so it's not


---------00:30----------
necessarily about fixing what's broken


---------00:32----------
it's more about getting unstuck getting


---------00:34----------
unparalyzed


---------00:36----------
working on your motivation thinking


---------00:37----------
about understanding your emotions and


---------00:39----------
what holds you back


---------00:41----------
digging into problematic behaviors like


---------00:44----------
clinginess


---------00:45----------
or like other kinds of like self


---------00:48----------
conceptions that you have that


---------00:50----------
prevent you from moving forward a good


---------00:52----------
example is like if i can't get into


---------00:54----------
harvard i'm not gonna apply to college


---------00:56----------
like that sort of thinking right


---------00:58----------
where we want to help you guys


---------00:59----------
understand that and help you take a step


---------01:01----------
forward


---------01:02----------
and so that's really what our coaching


---------01:03----------
program is about it turns out that our


---------01:05----------
coaching program does actually happen to


---------01:07----------
improve


---------01:08----------
depression and anxiety and it's not like


---------01:10----------
a direct clinical effect it's more


---------01:12----------
through helping people live build


---------01:15----------
and live like more fulfilling lives and


---------01:17----------
then depression and anxiety just start


---------01:19----------
to get better


---------01:20----------
as you start to build confidence about


---------01:21----------
yourself that's what our coaching


---------01:23----------
program's about


---------01:29----------

like inflammation right so if you've got


---------02:00----------

---------02:53----------
go see a doctor


---------02:55----------
well you know i have


---------02:58----------
look at this wait can you see it no you

---------03:24----------
well the hair part i kind of like


---------03:27----------
i'm kind of i think i look good


---------03:30----------
yeah it makes you look distinguished


---------03:32----------
yeah i think in a gray


---------03:33----------
mature yeah it would well mature


---------03:37----------
not mature mature i like that that's


---------03:40----------
yeah


---------03:40----------
that could be oh my god i can make a


---------03:43----------
brand of clothing


---------03:45----------
and make it more expensive and do like


---------03:47----------
you know


---------03:48----------
the ape gang merch mature and put an


---------03:50----------
apostrophe on one of the letters


---------03:52----------
yeah you feel me beautiful yeah i i feel


---------03:54----------
you i mean that's you know


---------03:55----------
yeah yeah wow but yeah the gray hair


---------03:58----------
look great people with black hair or


---------04:01----------
dark hair call it mature


---------04:02----------
and once you start turning gray it's


---------04:04----------
mature


---------04:06----------
my tour i like that mature couture


---------04:09----------
yeah there it is look at the ideas


---------04:12----------
flowing


---------04:14----------
looks like mine's so sharp yeah


---------04:17----------
maybe i guess we'll see i just kind of


---------04:19----------
uh


---------04:20----------
yeah yeah damn hopefully yeah


---------04:24----------
i think the eye thing is going to go


---------04:25----------
away i've had you slept wrong yeah


---------04:27----------
i think i'm pretty sure like i think i


---------04:29----------
slept and that's actually an imprint of


---------04:30----------
like


---------04:32----------
maybe my sheets wrinkles i don't know


---------04:34----------
but maybe not


---------04:36----------
i don't think it sheets wrinkles i think


---------04:37----------
it's more likely to be like some


---------04:39----------
low level of inflammation or puffiness


---------04:41----------
it looks like puffiness to me


---------04:42----------
more than anything else yeah my dad gets


---------04:45----------
that puffiness stuff so


---------04:46----------
that could be what it is yeah yeah


---------04:49----------
so yeah um train what is there something


---------04:52----------
in particular you want to talk about


---------04:53----------
today i mean i know we


---------04:55----------
we've had a couple of conversations yeah


---------04:58----------
i think this is like the uh


---------05:00----------
in a way i guess this this may come off


---------05:03----------
no i don't know but say it bro yeah


---------05:06----------
perfect


---------05:07----------
yeah i think uh this is like the


---------05:10----------
the memoirs yeah train wrecks tv you


---------05:12----------
know we have story one story two and now


---------05:15----------
we're on


---------05:15----------
day three you know and one day it'll be


---------05:18----------
day 100


---------05:19----------
you know and and you know like all human


---------05:22----------
beings


---------05:23----------
when you know i yeah let's


---------05:26----------
i don't know uh yeah yeah so


---------05:29----------
yeah go ahead tell me about so so tell


---------05:32----------
me about


---------05:33----------
what you know where did we kind of leave


---------05:34----------
off i know we sort of started talking


---------05:36----------
about your family a little bit but


---------05:38----------
what are we going to discuss in in day


---------05:40----------
three


---------05:42----------
um we could i think i think we're going


---------05:45----------
to get into the uh


---------05:48----------
i think we're going to get into the


---------05:49----------
juicy i think oh yeah i think we're


---------05:51----------
gonna start into the


---------05:55----------
i think we're gonna get deeper i think


---------05:56----------
you had asked last time at the end


---------06:00----------
for me to get into the like the bullying


---------06:03----------
of school and then what led to drug use


---------06:07----------
and then that's something i think that's


---------06:09----------
where we left off


---------06:11----------
right so yeah i think i think so too i


---------06:14----------
wasn't sure exactly where we were going


---------06:15----------
but i remember that we had sort of been


---------06:18----------
uh kind of like a little bit we done an


---------06:20----------
overview


---------06:21----------
and then we were going to kind of tunnel


---------06:23----------
down so can you tell me about the


---------06:25----------
bullying


---------06:26----------
well before we go there we have to you


---------06:28----------
know kind of open the


---------06:30----------
you know we you know if we just go into


---------06:33----------
it right


---------06:34----------
now i feel like it's going to be this


---------06:36----------
very cold thing


---------06:37----------
first i got to ask you how have you been


---------06:39----------
i've been


---------06:40----------
doing well man i think um so i like the


---------06:44----------
weather


---------06:46----------
you know so i really like um i took like


---------06:48----------
a hour-long walk last night


---------06:52----------
and it was just really nice um


---------06:55----------
i think personally


---------06:56----------
[Music]


---------06:58----------
you know it's interesting so i think


---------06:59----------
we've done a lot of good things


---------07:02----------
and yet i find myself um


---------07:05----------
noticing a lot of problems in what we do


---------07:08----------
so and i i mean i think this is good


---------07:12----------
it's all progress but i i feel pretty


---------07:14----------
excited actually because i'm finally


---------07:15----------
getting to do


---------07:16----------
some of the things that i really wanted


---------07:18----------
to do and what i mean by that is when


---------07:20----------
you know when i


---------07:22----------
when we started streaming on twitch so i


---------07:24----------
started working with rando gamers


---------07:26----------
and then really enjoyed that and then


---------07:29----------
started to notice themes


---------07:31----------
right so okay these guys are like they


---------07:32----------
think they're all they all think they're


---------07:34----------
lazy but they're actually not lazy


---------07:36----------
um so that's like a good example of one


---------07:38----------
everyone thinks they lack motivation but


---------07:40----------
they don't


---------07:41----------
lack motivation it's just plugged up and


---------07:43----------
they it can't shine through


---------07:46----------
yes i think i think a lot can actually


---------07:49----------
apply to that i think uh


---------07:52----------
i think there's a lot of things that the


---------07:54----------
general public


---------07:56----------
um kind of diagnoses streamers with


---------08:00----------
not realizing that it's it's not


---------08:02----------
actually the case it's it's not like a


---------08:03----------
result of who they are it's more of a


---------08:05----------
result of


---------08:08----------
the streaming and and if you mix a


---------08:10----------
streaming in with any individual


---------08:12----------
it'll happen to anybody even the most


---------08:13----------
right like so a good example of that


---------08:15----------
would be


---------08:16----------
i think for some reason everybody


---------08:19----------
is a sociopathic narcissist on twitch


---------08:23----------
and i i can maybe see to some certain


---------08:26----------
degree maybe


---------08:27----------
like but i don't think that's the case


---------08:28----------
but for some reason like the general


---------08:30----------
viewer base likes to assert that


---------08:33----------
that like diagnosis onto like every


---------08:35----------
streamer


---------08:37----------
does that make any sense and i've never


---------08:39----------
i mean i understand it because i can see


---------08:41----------
which ones


---------08:42----------
might be but the majority that they


---------08:44----------
diagnose


---------08:45----------
i don't think are at all why do you


---------08:47----------
think yeah why do you think


---------08:49----------
they think that oh they say it i know


---------08:52----------
but but why do you think they say that


---------08:55----------
why do you think they think that what do


---------08:58----------
they see that causes them or what


---------09:00----------
what drives them to come to that


---------09:02----------
conclusion they i think they see the uh


---------09:06----------
so i think they see like a generalized


---------09:09----------
symptom but they don't realize that it


---------09:13----------
you know it's kind of like you know if


---------09:14----------
you get a


---------09:17----------
let's say you get a sinus infection


---------09:18----------
right and you're getting like a


---------09:20----------
tightening in your chest congestion


---------09:22----------
right and


---------09:23----------
you decide to go to webmd and you type


---------09:26----------
in


---------09:27----------
chest uh chest tightness and congestion


---------09:30----------
and then you know three results one says


---------09:32----------
sinus infection


---------09:33----------
and then two results say can you know


---------09:35----------
cancer and then the other one says


---------09:37----------
whatever the [ __ ] right like for some


---------09:39----------
reason people want to believe the more


---------09:40----------
extreme ones


---------09:41----------
yeah yeah something like that right so i


---------09:43----------
think it's just like they see like a


---------09:44----------
generalized symptom


---------09:46----------
and they just automatically attribute it


---------09:49----------
to


---------09:51----------
what's the symptom that they see i i


---------09:53----------
think it's a it's a good


---------09:54----------
it's a really i think it's a frankly


---------09:57----------
sophisticated


---------09:58----------
approach i think oftentimes we confuse a


---------10:00----------
symptom with a diagnosis


---------10:02----------
um yeah and and so i'm with you that i


---------10:05----------
don't think that the majority of


---------10:06----------
streamers are sociopathic narcissists


---------10:08----------
oh no not at all i can't i've yeah i can


---------10:11----------
see


---------10:12----------
how by virtue of being a public figure


---------10:18----------
you exhibit some of the signs that


---------10:21----------
narcissists would


---------10:22----------
exhibit right like there would be some


---------10:25----------
symptoms about


---------10:26----------
you know things like i mean


---------10:27----------
self-promotion and like building a brand


---------10:29----------
is like actually part of your job


---------10:31----------
which can appear a lot like narcissism


---------10:33----------
for example


---------10:35----------
um yes but what do you what do you think


---------10:37----------
it is that they see that makes them


---------10:38----------
think that it's like


---------10:40----------
like narcissists like what's the symptom


---------10:42----------
that


---------10:43----------
what's the symptom that makes them


---------10:46----------
assign that diagnosis i think the main


---------10:50----------
symptom that people confuse


---------10:52----------
for narcissism mainly is


---------10:56----------
confidence i think there is a huge


---------10:59----------
huge huge lack of confidence amongst the


---------11:01----------
general


---------11:02----------
like viewer that watches twitch and i


---------11:05----------
think


---------11:05----------
as a gamer that they have they've set


---------11:08----------
some sort of


---------11:10----------
some sort of thing that every gamer


---------11:12----------
needs to be


---------11:13----------
and if any gamer passes that threshold


---------11:15----------
of confidence and they have to be a


---------11:16----------
narcissistic sociopath


---------11:18----------
but i i think they fail to like realize


---------11:22----------
that what you see you know the


---------11:25----------
confidence that you may see


---------11:26----------
when they're in their environment of


---------11:27----------
streaming or gaming


---------11:29----------
you can't assume that that's their


---------11:31----------
everyday state or every second state


---------11:33----------
right like does that make any sense yeah


---------11:36----------
i think people failed oh yeah go ahead


---------11:39----------
yeah no go for it finish yourself i


---------11:40----------
think people i think people fail


---------11:42----------
to consider like what happens off stream


---------11:43----------
right like


---------11:46----------
in that confidence in order to have true


---------11:49----------
confidence in my opinion


---------11:50----------
you have to have a level of awareness of


---------11:52----------
your own insecurities


---------11:54----------
you have to understand that they're


---------11:55----------
going to be there always and that


---------11:57----------
they're


---------11:57----------
that they're there and everyone has them


---------12:00----------
and


---------12:01----------
i think that that's a big portion or


---------12:04----------
that's part that's a big part of the


---------12:06----------
formula to get to a level of confidence


---------12:08----------
it's


---------12:08----------
it's it's accepting your insecurities


---------12:11----------
and knowing that they're there and kind


---------12:12----------
of just making peace with them


---------12:14----------
but i think some a lot of people that


---------12:15----------
are more like inexperienced they think


---------12:17----------
confidence is not having any


---------12:18----------
insecurities


---------12:20----------
which is just wrong in my opinion so


---------12:22----------
does that make any sense yeah


---------12:24----------
sort of um i i think uh i i find myself


---------12:26----------
kind of being curious about your


---------12:28----------
personal experience as opposed to


---------12:30----------
abstractions


---------12:31----------
so when you say like they don't see what


---------12:34----------
happens off stream


---------12:36----------
right so you're let me just lay out what


---------12:38----------
i understand


---------12:40----------
okay from what you're saying so you're


---------12:42----------
saying that


---------12:43----------
a lot of times people judge streamers


---------12:46----------
for being sociopathic narcissists


---------12:50----------
that the narcissism why do they think


---------12:52----------
that


---------12:53----------
it's because they see something like


---------12:55----------
confidence


---------12:56----------
and they kind of like confuse confidence


---------12:58----------
and narcissism


---------13:00----------
and that streamers don't i mean


---------13:03----------
the audience doesn't really account for


---------13:05----------
what happens offstream in the streamer's


---------13:07----------
life which i completely


---------13:10----------
understand but what i'm curious about is


---------13:13----------
like


---------13:13----------
what happens offstream that as it


---------13:16----------
relates to this


---------13:17----------
bucket of like narcissism and confidence


---------13:23----------
i think the same thing that well not the


---------13:26----------
same exact thing but just relative to


---------13:27----------
each person's life


---------13:28----------
i think similar things that are


---------13:29----------
happening in every viewer's lives that


---------13:31----------
they they think the streamer doesn't see


---------13:33----------
right i think the streamer's life is


---------13:35----------
kind of like how


---------13:37----------
we view a an actor's life or a


---------13:40----------
sports player's life or just these


---------13:42----------
instagram pictures of the happiest


---------13:44----------
couples lives i think


---------13:45----------
a lot of people make the mistake and


---------13:46----------
they see this loved streamer that's


---------13:49----------
loved by many and


---------13:50----------
that's making so much money and you know


---------13:53----------
talking with such confidence but they


---------13:54----------
they failed to think about what's you


---------13:58----------
know all the intricacies and all the


---------14:00----------
[ __ ] that's like they're what i'm trying


---------14:02----------
to say is everyone's the same like all


---------14:03----------
of us have our time where we're going


---------14:05----------
off stream we're doubting ourselves


---------14:07----------
we're thinking did we make the right


---------14:08----------
decision did we not make the right


---------14:10----------
decision


---------14:11----------
did i do this well did i not do this


---------14:12----------
well right and that people don't realize


---------14:14----------
that


---------14:15----------
when you're on camera sometimes you have


---------14:17----------
to be strong


---------14:19----------
for the crew for the community right but


---------14:22----------
people


---------14:22----------
mistaken that it's it's like it's like


---------14:24----------
they haven't thought


---------14:26----------
far enough to realize okay let's say he


---------14:28----------
comes on and he acts


---------14:30----------
or and he is insecure and doubting and


---------14:32----------
this and this and that right


---------14:34----------
now the only people that that would make


---------14:36----------
happy are the ones that want to see you


---------14:38----------
fail and need to see you in that state


---------14:40----------
so you can't ever you can't ever uh


---------14:43----------
cater to that


---------14:45----------
because those people the fact they want


---------14:47----------
to see you in that state


---------14:48----------
that's a reflection of their own


---------14:49----------
insecurity right they need to see you


---------14:51----------
there or below in order for themselves


---------14:52----------
to feel better so they're not there for


---------14:54----------
the caring of you


---------14:55----------
they're there to find some sort of


---------14:56----------
short-term cure for themselves


---------14:59----------
and then you have the other factor you


---------15:00----------
need to be strong for those of


---------15:02----------
for the ones that are weak right and


---------15:03----------
then those ones you're strong but then


---------15:05----------
you give this other effect off that


---------15:06----------
you're coming off as everything's great


---------15:08----------
and


---------15:08----------
you know blah blah blah does that make


---------15:09----------
any sense it's a


---------15:16----------
i think one of them is the greater and


---------15:18----------
the other


---------15:19----------
i don't know does that make any sense


---------15:21----------
yep i think that the reason that it's a


---------15:23----------
lose-lose is because at the end of the


---------15:24----------
day you're being false


---------15:28----------
yeah and i think a lot of people yeah i


---------15:32----------
agree with you


---------15:32----------
so the question that i have trained is


---------15:34----------
like


---------15:36----------
why do you have to be strong for someone


---------15:38----------
weak if that's not really what you are


---------15:41----------
you're almost implying that you know


---------15:43----------
strength is a mask that you put on for


---------15:45----------
your audience


---------15:46----------
why can't you be weak


---------15:52----------
you can be but there's a time and place


---------15:55----------
okay i mean


---------15:59----------
here's the thing


---------16:08----------
here's the thing okay hear me out here


---------16:10----------
okay


---------16:11----------
so


---------16:16----------
the way i go about it


---------16:20----------
is a little different i think


---------16:24----------
i just kind of wear my like


---------16:27----------
yeah i kind of just wear my emotions on


---------16:29----------
my sleeve in a way


---------16:31----------
kind of i'm a little closed off but i


---------16:36----------
don't know actually


---------16:37----------
but i definitely show like for me like i


---------16:39----------
was talking about like what i see


---------16:40----------
generally for me for my stream i think i


---------16:44----------
you know when i'm feeling sad or down or


---------16:47----------
whatever i think i'm pretty open with my


---------16:49----------
chat


---------16:49----------
and they know when i'm you know in that


---------16:50----------
mood when i'm feeling good i feel good


---------16:53----------
right i think


---------16:57----------
i'm more so referring to


---------17:04----------
this is why i say on my stream don't put


---------17:06----------
me on a pedestal i'm just like you


---------17:07----------
right i try to i try to give that off as


---------17:10----------
much as i can


---------17:11----------
i think the main reason like i think


---------17:12----------
what i'm trying to say is


---------17:14----------
the main reason i think that those


---------17:16----------
things that we're talking about come


---------17:17----------
across and everyone labels every


---------17:18----------
streamer as that


---------17:19----------
because they fail to realize that we're


---------17:21----------
just like them we make the same mistakes


---------17:24----------
you know we [ __ ] like them we fart like


---------17:26----------
them we have our disgusting habits like


---------17:28----------
them we have our good habits like them


---------17:29----------
we last two seconds in bed like them


---------17:31----------
some days we last long some days some


---------17:33----------
days we have no sex at all some days we


---------17:35----------
do have sex some days we're just as


---------17:36----------
lonely right


---------17:37----------
i think people like attribute


---------17:42----------
wrong things to people just because


---------17:48----------
they have fame or money right obviously


---------17:50----------
not to the level of like actors and


---------17:51----------
stuff but this is like more like a c


---------17:52----------
level c class whatever the [ __ ] but does


---------17:54----------
that make any sense


---------17:55----------
yes what i'm trying to say is uh go


---------17:57----------
ahead what is it like


---------17:59----------
to be what i'm hearing you basically say


---------18:02----------
is that they don't


---------18:03----------
judge you fairly oh well for me it's


---------18:06----------
content i just


---------18:08----------
you know what do you mean content oh you


---------18:10----------
know i have a couple row sessions


---------18:13----------
well what what i didn't quite follow you


---------18:16----------
there but let me


---------18:16----------
try to reiterate yeah um so


---------18:20----------
what i what i'm hearing you say is that


---------18:22----------
you know you guys get


---------18:23----------
judged as streamers for being


---------18:25----------
sociopathic narcissists and the problem


---------18:27----------
is that people don't see


---------18:28----------
the rest of you right and that you guys


---------18:31----------
are just like everyone else but you get


---------18:33----------
judged in a different way that you [ __ ]


---------18:36----------
you finish in bed fast some days slow


---------18:39----------
some days


---------18:40----------
you're lonely some days you're not


---------18:43----------
lonely other days


---------18:44----------
completely get it right and you say


---------18:46----------
don't put on a pedestal


---------18:48----------
and yet what i'm hearing you say is that


---------18:49----------
you know despite you sending that


---------18:51----------
message


---------18:52----------
people do treat you differently right


---------18:54----------
they do put you on a pedestal


---------18:56----------
or they put you under their crosshairs


---------19:00----------
right that they project their


---------19:02----------
insecurities on you and things like that


---------19:04----------
that's


---------19:05----------
that's kind of well to be fair in a way


---------19:08----------
there are some people so the pedestal


---------19:10----------
thing is just what i do i do the


---------19:12----------
pedestal thing to be fair i don't think


---------19:13----------
anybody really follow


---------19:14----------
i think people want to be put on a


---------19:15----------
pedestal right so that's kind of


---------19:17----------
something i do in my stream i say don't


---------19:19----------
put them in a pedestal


---------19:20----------
but i think the i think others they they


---------19:22----------
want the benefits of the pedestal


---------19:24----------
but then when it comes to the


---------19:25----------
responsibility taking responsibility of


---------19:27----------
the other half of being on put on a


---------19:29----------
pedestal they don't want that part


---------19:30----------
i don't want either of them because i


---------19:32----------
know if if i don't want the bad parts i


---------19:33----------
can't have the good parts right


---------19:35----------
and if i want the good parts i have to


---------19:36----------
accept the bad parts so i just say


---------19:37----------
listen don't put me on a pedestal


---------19:39----------
i'm just like you i'm gonna make a


---------19:40----------
mistake next week i might say some [ __ ]


---------19:42----------
that might cancel all of us


---------19:43----------
you know don't think i'm this pg-13


---------19:45----------
figure that is some sort of robotic


---------19:47----------
[ __ ]


---------19:48----------
you know uh inhumane thing i'm not right


---------19:51----------
so that's me i think a lot of people


---------19:53----------
want to grab the good and then not have


---------19:54----------
the bad of the pedestal part


---------19:56----------
so that's on them but i think that's one


---------19:58----------
of the reasons


---------20:01----------
i think that needs so it's not just a


---------20:02----------
viewer thing it's it's a both thing


---------20:05----------
streamers kind of


---------20:08----------
take that they encourage it yeah and


---------20:11----------
they don't


---------20:11----------
push back real does that make sense they


---------20:13----------
don't realize that


---------20:15----------
if you don't want to take responsibility


---------20:17----------
for the bad parts of being put on a


---------20:18----------
pedestal you can't


---------20:19----------
encourage and take the good parts and


---------20:21----------
then as soon as the bad happens you kind


---------20:23----------
of step away and say oh this isn't fair


---------20:25----------
so i think it's something that both


---------20:26----------
viewers and instruments need to come


---------20:27----------
together and they need to communicate


---------20:28----------
and be more open about


---------20:31----------
in order for the viewers to not just see


---------20:33----------
them as like a computer screen or some


---------20:34----------
rich famous guy that's playing games


---------20:36----------
they would just see him as themselves so


---------20:39----------
train i


---------20:39----------
i noticed that you know if i just pay


---------20:41----------
attention to the


---------20:43----------
the you know the subject of a lot of the


---------20:46----------
sentences


---------20:48----------
that you use you're talking about


---------20:49----------
streamers but then you actually say that


---------20:52----------
you don't fall into that


---------20:53----------
bucket in a lot of ways i'm hearing that


---------20:56----------
like so for example you say


---------20:57----------
a lot of people do want to be on a


---------20:58----------
pedestal i don't want to be


---------21:00----------
on a pedestal you know i feel like a lot


---------21:03----------
of people want the good and don't want


---------21:04----------
the bad whereas i recognize you can't


---------21:06----------
have the good


---------21:07----------
without the bad so yeah i don't want to


---------21:10----------
have it


---------21:11----------
and and so what i'm curious about is i


---------21:12----------
mean we can talk kind of hypothetically


---------21:15----------
about


---------21:15----------
streamers but frankly i don't know what


---------21:18----------
to make of that right so what i tend to


---------21:20----------
get curious about is like


---------21:23----------
you know what's in the mind of the


---------21:24----------
person who thinks that all streamers are


---------21:26----------
sociopathic narcissists


---------21:29----------
what's what's in the mind of the


---------21:30----------
streamer


---------21:32----------
who is on the receiving end of


---------21:35----------
other people thinking that they're a


---------21:37----------
sociopathic narcissist


---------21:39----------
and so what i'm really curious about is


---------21:40----------
like what's in your mind


---------21:42----------
and we can talk generally about


---------21:44----------
streamers but i don't i don't know how


---------21:45----------
much we can learn


---------21:46----------
or i mean i think we learned a lot but i


---------21:49----------
think you can offer a richness of


---------21:50----------
information if we're talking about you


---------21:52----------
that we can't get


---------21:53----------
if we're hypothesizing about other


---------21:56----------
people


---------21:58----------
true okay


---------22:02----------
so so i was just using this as a warm-up


---------22:04----------
conversation to get my brain fluids


---------22:06----------
flowing but yeah


---------22:07----------
i'll answer that and then we'll go into


---------22:08----------
the actual juicy part of round three of


---------22:10----------
the dr k trainwrx tv talk so to answer


---------22:13----------
your question


---------22:16----------
um


---------22:20----------
what's going on in the minds of


---------22:24----------
the viewer that's asserting


---------22:27----------
or that's making that diagnosis or


---------22:29----------
whatever it's called


---------22:33----------
i i guess i i don't know but i would if


---------22:36----------
i made a


---------22:37----------
guess i would say it's


---------22:40----------
so from the viewers side i would say


---------22:41----------
it's some sort of insecurity of their


---------22:43----------
own


---------22:44----------
where that where the where instead of


---------22:46----------
just viewing the person as as they are


---------22:48----------
and enjoying them as they are


---------22:49----------
and realizing that they're not going to


---------22:52----------
like every single person if they don't


---------22:53----------
like them they should just move along


---------22:54----------
and


---------22:55----------
see a new person i think i think they


---------22:57----------
need to


---------22:59----------
i think that they need that diagnosis


---------23:02----------
to be true like that's their way


---------23:06----------
of shaping the streamer they're watching


---------23:08----------
like they don't want to leave because


---------23:09----------
they like them but


---------23:10----------
there's something of that person that


---------23:12----------
makes them feel away and the only way


---------23:13----------
they can make that feeling go away or


---------23:15----------
justify that feeling and stay there


---------23:16----------
is to assert those diagnoses onto them


---------23:20----------
in order for them to rationalize why


---------23:23----------
they're perceiving the behavior that


---------23:25----------
they're


---------23:26----------
like attributing or whatever the word is


---------23:29----------
they're using as a rationalization to


---------23:30----------
stay and watch


---------23:32----------
by minimizing them and putting


---------23:34----------
themselves greater does that


---------23:36----------
does that make any sense that that's


---------23:37----------
what i would guess possibly as the view


---------23:39----------
i completely agree i mean i i think so


---------23:42----------
there's something really interesting if


---------23:43----------
you look at


---------23:44----------
um you know eastern theories of the mind


---------23:46----------
one of the things that they say is that


---------23:49----------
the ego is a protective mechanism and


---------23:52----------
the ego


---------23:53----------
helps you when you're feeling sad or


---------23:55----------
vulnerable or emotionally hurt


---------23:58----------
by putting pumping yourself up or


---------24:00----------
putting other people down


---------24:02----------
yes right so yes i can feel better about


---------24:05----------
myself if i put other people down


---------24:07----------
and this is one of the really


---------24:08----------
interesting things is i've been


---------24:10----------
exploring why people are so toxic


---------24:12----------
towards celebrities and and streamers


---------24:16----------
i think one of the interesting things


---------24:17----------
that i realized is that


---------24:20----------
you know if you put an ant down


---------24:23----------
you don't your ego doesn't get a whole


---------24:25----------
lot if you put a peer down


---------24:27----------
your ego gets more if you


---------24:31----------
take someone who's above you down a


---------24:33----------
notch


---------24:34----------
then your ego gets a lot and if you


---------24:38----------
topple someone who's at the top of a


---------24:39----------
pedestal


---------24:41----------
well then you get to feel really good


---------24:42----------
about yourself


---------24:44----------
yeah and so it's really interesting um


---------24:49----------
and you know just as a side note train i


---------24:51----------
can't i'm gonna troll you here a little


---------24:53----------
bit let me know if you you know this is


---------24:54----------
offensive but


---------24:55----------
nothing's offensive if you're wondering


---------24:58----------
you know maybe why people think


---------25:00----------
you come across as narcissistic what i'm


---------25:03----------
hearing from you say


---------25:04----------
oh i know what it is


---------25:08----------
well i'll be honest with you


---------25:12----------
i mean just look at me right now my legs


---------25:14----------
are crossed i mean look at me like i'm


---------25:16----------
sitting here as if


---------25:18----------
you know i mean i see it myself i feel


---------25:21----------
like


---------25:22----------
i'm almost offending myself by looking


---------25:24----------
at myself like i just look like


---------25:27----------
i don't know i look aggressive i look


---------25:29----------
aggressively confident as if i figured


---------25:31----------
life out and i know what i'm talking


---------25:32----------
about i don't mean to come off that way


---------25:33----------
i don't think


---------25:34----------
i think i know nothing right now i'm to


---------25:36----------
be honest i'm insecure about half the


---------25:37----------
[ __ ] i've said the last 30 minutes but


---------25:39----------
when i'm looking at my physical features


---------25:41----------
in the outside shell it looks like i


---------25:44----------
think


---------25:45----------
i've said everything because i know it's


---------25:47----------
correct and if you disagree you're gone


---------25:49----------
that's the way i look to myself but on


---------25:51----------
the inside i've actually been insecure


---------25:53----------
about the last 30 minutes of what i've


---------25:54----------
been saying because honestly


---------25:56----------
i'm so kind of i'm so foggy and gloomy


---------25:59----------
or uh


---------26:00----------
just so i'm just waking up i don't know


---------26:02----------
what the [ __ ] i've been seeing the last


---------26:03----------
30 minutes


---------26:03----------
right so that's what's inside but the


---------26:05----------
outside i'm looking at myself it looks


---------26:07----------
like i have figured the world out and


---------26:08----------
i'm just telling you


---------26:09----------
what i'm telling you is god's grace and


---------26:11----------
you should you know be happy i've been


---------26:13----------
speaking that's what


---------26:14----------
that's what i look like to me when i'm


---------26:16----------
speaking but the inside of actually


---------26:17----------
insecure about what i've been saying i'm


---------26:18----------
like what the [ __ ] am i saying right now


---------26:20----------
holy [ __ ]


---------26:20----------
does that make sense you feel entirely


---------26:24----------
too much okay can i do one thing real


---------26:26----------
quick yeah


---------26:27----------
i have to use the restroom real quick is


---------26:29----------
that go for it okay


---------26:30----------
and i'll gather my thoughts i'm so sorry


---------26:33----------
no no


---------26:34----------
dude call of nature bro i'm back sorry


---------26:37----------
about that no problem man


---------26:38----------
yeah you know that uh that hot tea just


---------26:41----------
went through and


---------26:42----------
you know i just took the longest pee of


---------26:43----------
my life


---------26:46----------
yeah no i'm just kidding i i i yeah i


---------26:49----------
yeah you know i i don't like talking


---------26:51----------
about this because


---------26:53----------
you know i i still you know uh


---------26:56----------
listen chat i took a [ __ ] okay get over


---------27:00----------
it


---------27:01----------
and it was good it was one it was one of


---------27:02----------
those where you know honestly i wish i


---------27:04----------
could have sat there for another 45


---------27:06----------
minutes


---------27:06----------
you know and just just really just wrote


---------27:08----------
it out you know what i'm talking about


---------27:09----------
it's one of those that


---------27:10----------
i almost wish i could have sucked back


---------27:12----------
in and redid it


---------27:13----------
it was that good does that make any


---------27:15----------
sense yeah that sounds


---------27:17----------
yeah yeah i've never heard anyone say


---------27:18----------
that but yeah i too


---------27:20----------
experienced i i enjoy sitting on the pot


---------27:24----------
you know after doing a number two and


---------27:26----------
and actually it's a very um


---------27:27----------
physiologically intensive process


---------27:30----------
yeah you know well i want to know that


---------27:32----------
some time like recover from


---------27:34----------
it so yeah but anyways so back to where


---------27:36----------
we're


---------27:37----------
i'm a lot more clear now so actually you


---------27:40----------
go ahead i think you're going to respond


---------27:41----------
go ahead


---------27:42----------
yeah so i was just going to say you know


---------27:44----------
it's interesting because you say when


---------27:45----------
you look at yourself


---------27:46----------
you see a guy who comes across as


---------27:49----------
arrogant yeah


---------27:52----------
and which is interesting because what


---------27:54----------
you feel is insecure


---------27:57----------
and i don't think you come across as


---------27:59----------
arrogant at all man i think you come


---------28:01----------
across as pretty chill and pretty


---------28:02----------
genuine at least that's how i perceive


---------28:04----------
you i don't think you're


---------28:06----------
you know you're not like claiming to be


---------28:10----------
you know the the source of wisdom and


---------28:13----------
knowledge in the world in fact quite the


---------28:15----------
opposite you're


---------28:16----------
you're owning that you're just one guy


---------28:17----------
and you're like everyone else and and


---------28:19----------
everything else you're kind of sitting


---------28:20----------
back you're relaxed


---------28:21----------
you're kind of chilling and and i think


---------28:24----------
the interesting thing is that


---------28:26----------
i don't think it's a coincidence that


---------28:28----------
your feeling of insecurity


---------28:30----------
coexists with your judgmental perception


---------28:33----------
of yourself


---------28:35----------
right so if we think about it so you


---------28:38----------
perceive yourself as someone who's


---------28:40----------
falsely confident or


---------28:41----------
overly confident or look at this guy who


---------28:44----------
who looks like he knows what he's


---------28:45----------
talking about


---------28:46----------
yes and when you say it's it's


---------28:49----------
interesting because if you really tunnel


---------28:50----------
down into that that language


---------28:52----------
looks like he knows what he's talking


---------28:54----------
about


---------28:55----------
yep and that looks like actually is


---------28:57----------
rooted in your own secure


---------28:59----------
insecurity train well if if i may expand


---------29:02----------
on what i meant by that


---------29:04----------
so you you


---------29:08----------
you are you know wise you have


---------29:10----------
experience you know and


---------29:12----------
you're a little older than the j you


---------29:14----------
know than an average viewer of twitch


---------29:15----------
right so it's not


---------29:19----------
so when i tell you that i look at myself


---------29:21----------
and that's what i see


---------29:23----------
it's not because it's what i feel about


---------29:25----------
myself


---------29:26----------
it's because what i've that's what i've


---------29:28----------
been told


---------29:30----------
that i look like ever since


---------29:34----------
middle school and that's one of the


---------29:37----------
general re that's actually probably the


---------29:39----------
main


---------29:39----------
i honestly believe and this this is a


---------29:42----------
fact


---------29:42----------
this isn't some victim card thing that i


---------29:44----------
know they love to say victim card


---------29:46----------
this is this is a fact and anyone who


---------29:49----------
doesn't admit this by this point on


---------29:50----------
twitch based on everything that's gone


---------29:52----------
on


---------29:53----------
is just in denial i'm vilified no matter


---------29:56----------
what i do


---------29:57----------
so it's it's that vilification


---------30:01----------
that that's where it stems from right


---------30:03----------
it's the voice it's the mixture of the


---------30:05----------
way i look the way i come off


---------30:07----------
so when i say i look this way it's not


---------30:09----------
that i truly believe i look that way to


---------30:11----------
me the way i look is completely


---------30:13----------
normal and average like anybody else now


---------30:15----------
i understand


---------30:16----------
i have some protruding features i mean


---------30:18----------
there's this one time that stuck with me


---------30:19----------
since now


---------30:20----------
i went to a doctor and the doctor tried


---------30:22----------
to convince my parents to


---------30:23----------
go to undergo a surgery to shave down my


---------30:27----------
protruding


---------30:28----------
bones in my face to have a more uh uh


---------30:32----------
well-liked appearing face like a more


---------30:34----------
trusting face rather than like a warrior


---------30:36----------
bones protruding so a doctor tried


---------30:38----------
telling my mom to do that


---------30:39----------
and my mom yeah my mom said no and i'm


---------30:42----------
happy she said no because [ __ ] that


---------30:44----------
right


---------30:44----------
you're beautiful shane and thank you


---------30:46----------
thank you and people told me to get you


---------30:48----------
know


---------30:48----------
no surgeries i said hell no you know i i


---------30:51----------
love my nose you know like i i love


---------30:53----------
myself i have a love for myself you know


---------30:54----------
and it doesn't go into this like


---------30:56----------
narcissistic thing like i just i


---------30:57----------
appreciate


---------30:58----------
you know the way i look i do think i'm


---------31:01----------
the best looking on twitch that's not a


---------31:02----------
meme you know it's half meme to kind of


---------31:04----------
ease it into people's minds but i'm my


---------31:07----------
family best looking


---------31:08----------
right these things are what i believe


---------31:11----------
it's not that i think i look this way


---------31:12----------
it's that i've learned that when i speak


---------31:15----------
for some reason these things are


---------31:16----------
attributed to me and people


---------31:19----------
since middle school and this will go


---------31:21----------
into the bullying stories people


---------31:23----------
need me to be a certain thing like they


---------31:26----------
need me to be the villain or whatever


---------31:28----------
they see


---------31:28----------
they need me to be that otherwise i


---------31:31----------
can't be accepting their


---------31:32----------
like i don't know if it's out of a fear


---------31:35----------
that's like instilled in them where i


---------31:37----------
need to be ripped down and teared down


---------31:38----------
and


---------31:39----------
so it's just it's just been continuous


---------31:41----------
that right and i'll give you examples of


---------31:43----------
that um


---------31:44----------
here later on we go to the bullying


---------31:45----------
stuff but so that's what i mean when i


---------31:48----------
say


---------31:48----------
i i've slowly understood where they're


---------31:51----------
coming from because


---------31:52----------
when i look at myself i


---------31:55----------
when i put myself into when i try to put


---------31:57----------
myself into someone that doesn't know me


---------32:00----------
i mean this part isn't an insecurity


---------32:01----------
part i think it's just true right if i


---------32:03----------
were to see let's say a chance on the


---------32:04----------
soda puppet on the street right i'd be


---------32:07----------
like yeah i don't want to approach him


---------32:08----------
i'd be like hey what's up man you need


---------32:09----------
help with that


---------32:10----------
but if i saw me on this trip like damn


---------32:12----------
if i say the wrong thing i'm gonna get


---------32:13----------
punched in the face


---------32:14----------
like that that's just like i think it's


---------32:16----------
just a common like instinctual thing


---------32:17----------
right like if you see someone that has


---------32:19----------
this like


---------32:19----------
more protruding face you know kind of


---------32:22----------
you know he looks


---------32:22----------
angry because of his extreme passionate


---------32:26----------
facial features


---------32:27----------
you know he gets he gets into an


---------32:28----------
argument he can't just talk normal tone


---------32:30----------
he has to start yelling


---------32:32----------
but i'm not actually yelling i'm just


---------32:33----------
excited but since i have a deep voice


---------32:35----------
it's coming across like


---------32:36----------
i'm doing a battle cry right so these


---------32:38----------
things that


---------32:39----------
i for the longest time didn't realize


---------32:41----------
but these things


---------32:42----------
are what people kind of see and since


---------32:43----------
they don't know me


---------32:45----------
that's kind of their first impression


---------32:47----------
that they assert


---------32:49----------
does that make any sense that's just


---------32:50----------
kind of what i gathered i'm not saying


---------32:51----------
they're right to do it


---------32:53----------
because i i don't think they are but


---------32:55----------
it's just what i've accepted to just be


---------32:56----------
the baseline


---------32:57----------
to be vilified no matter what you do


---------33:03----------
well it's kind of funny


---------33:06----------
because it's been this way since the


---------33:09----------
beginning


---------33:10----------
now am i saying that i'm a perfect human


---------33:12----------
being and i don't deserve to be


---------33:14----------
criticized or held accountable for


---------33:16----------
things no i definitely think i should be


---------33:18----------
held accountable for a lot of things i


---------33:19----------
think i made a lot of mistakes


---------33:21----------
i think that i will continue to make


---------33:22----------
mistakes


---------33:24----------
but it's weird because because it's been


---------33:27----------
this way for so long for me


---------33:29----------
it's like my bod my myself has adapted


---------33:33----------
to now when i'm not vilified


---------33:36----------
when i go through bouts of acceptance


---------33:40----------
i'm bored i'm content i've lost


---------33:42----------
motivation


---------33:43----------
it's almost as if my body has adapted


---------33:46----------
where i need to be hated and doubted


---------33:48----------
in order to to to to to to progress


---------33:53----------
and i'll give you an example of that um


---------33:54----------
earlier this year


---------33:56----------
um there was the australian wildfires


---------33:59----------
and we did a charity for them


---------34:02----------
and i think for the first time in a long


---------34:04----------
time it was like two days


---------34:06----------
where it was just pure peace everyone's


---------34:09----------
like oh train


---------34:10----------
good thing he did ignore everything else


---------34:12----------
good thing great thing good job train


---------34:13----------
and there was nothing like it was like


---------34:16----------
like i should you know i was happy i was


---------34:18----------
i was happy that i was being accepted


---------34:20----------
finally or whatever but


---------34:22----------
i was kind of i was like damn what now


---------34:25----------
you know and i didn't do it for that


---------34:27----------
reason i did it because


---------34:28----------
a lot of my community is from australia


---------34:31----------
so i knew that the fires were


---------34:32----------
you know impacting their lives and i


---------34:34----------
knew that it was you know [ __ ] their


---------34:36----------
[ __ ] up and they would talk about in my


---------34:37----------
chat so i thought you know


---------34:38----------
we kind of do it for the core community


---------34:40----------
and for the people


---------34:42----------
but that little two days of just


---------34:44----------
acceptance i was like damn what now


---------34:46----------
it's like my body couldn't or my mind


---------34:49----------
couldn't


---------34:50----------
it's got i gained this adaptive trait


---------34:52----------
over the last like 15 years where i


---------34:54----------
needed to be doubted


---------34:56----------
hated and vilified in order to progress


---------34:58----------
and prove people wrong does that make


---------34:59----------
any sense


---------35:00----------
makes a lot of sense so what do you why


---------35:02----------
do you think that's an adaptation


---------35:04----------
so if we think about an adaptation an


---------35:06----------
adaptation allows us


---------35:07----------
to succeed in a particular environment


---------35:11----------
right so what is the adaptation like


---------35:14----------
what right so you like you've taken


---------35:18----------
the negative energy directed towards you


---------35:20----------
and you use it as fuel that's what i'm


---------35:22----------
hearing


---------35:23----------
yes yes right


---------35:26----------
yeah can i think for a second


---------35:30----------
please do yeah


---------35:41----------
so what what happened after the


---------35:43----------
wildfires like did you do something to


---------35:45----------
become


---------35:46----------
vilified once again because people


---------35:47----------
thought you were like a decent person


---------35:49----------
and then you kind of


---------35:50----------
you say you get bored then what happens


---------35:53----------
oh it just goes back to a baseline what


---------35:56----------
is the baseline though


---------35:57----------
the baseline's just the vilified the


---------36:00----------
vilified thing or it's kind of just like


---------36:02----------
is that but how do people vilify you or


---------36:05----------
is there something that triggers


---------36:06----------
their hatred


---------36:12----------
i think that


---------36:16----------
um i definitely say


---------36:20----------
some stupid [ __ ] i'll do so i'll


---------36:26----------
um yeah i mean


---------36:31----------
yeah i i think i say some pretty dumb


---------36:33----------
[ __ ] i think you know there's times


---------36:35----------
where i say some stupid [ __ ] there's


---------36:36----------
times where i you know


---------36:37----------
have a little laugh with my friends or


---------36:39----------
i'll have opinions that don't match the


---------36:40----------
uh


---------36:41----------
you know popular opinion can you give me


---------36:44----------
an example of what


---------36:45----------
what you described as a dumb shift that


---------36:47----------
you say


---------36:51----------
um i think there is so since there are


---------36:54----------
so many people watching


---------36:56----------
i think there's a disconnect between


---------36:58----------
like uh with context


---------37:00----------
right so if i'm talking to like my


---------37:02----------
community and we're just like making a


---------37:03----------
joke or i'm just talking to them and


---------37:04----------
just clowning around


---------37:06----------
that that could be clipped and obviously


---------37:08----------
unless you're there in that moment and


---------37:10----------
you can pick up the last two hours of


---------37:12----------
context you're gonna see that as


---------37:13----------
what the [ __ ] is this guy saying like


---------37:15----------
this is some stupid [ __ ] how could you


---------37:16----------
say that right


---------37:18----------
um so i think that leads to a lot of


---------37:19----------
things and


---------37:21----------
i think the main part is so


---------37:25----------
i think that


---------37:29----------
it's just there's no benefit to the


---------37:31----------
doubt given


---------37:32----------
right so i think uh for example right


---------37:35----------
let's say


---------37:36----------
a buddy of mine chants he says some soda


---------37:39----------
pop and he says some


---------37:40----------
dumb [ __ ] it kind of goes nah it's just


---------37:42----------
chance he doesn't mean [ __ ] right


---------37:44----------
but if i say some dumb [ __ ] that's out


---------37:45----------
of context there's no like there's no


---------37:47----------
digging and looking at the context


---------37:49----------
there's no seeing what was it about it's


---------37:50----------
like


---------37:50----------
they need to believe that it is the


---------37:52----------
worst possible thing that i could mean


---------37:54----------
does that make sense and i think that


---------37:55----------
comes from the base level


---------37:58----------
why do they believe that about you why


---------38:00----------
do they give chance the benefit of the


---------38:02----------
doubt but they don't give you the


---------38:03----------
benefit well


---------38:04----------
i genuinely believe i genuinely think


---------38:06----------
it's that halo effect thing


---------38:08----------
right what is that halo effect what does


---------38:10----------
that mean


---------38:12----------
the you know i don't know that term


---------38:16----------
oh it's like i think


---------38:21----------
this is tough to say because no one's


---------38:24----------
gonna ever


---------38:25----------
i think it comes down from the way that


---------38:27----------
you come across


---------38:29----------
right i think uh a buddy of mine poke


---------38:32----------
him and i did this test one stream


---------38:34----------
where we talked beforehand and there was


---------38:37----------
this like graph we both saw


---------38:39----------
and we didn't tell the stream and


---------38:42----------
there's this graph of like a face that's


---------38:44----------
like more trusting


---------38:45----------
that people can be okay with them being


---------38:48----------
successful or better or having a better


---------38:50----------
car or a better house or better


---------38:51----------
girlfriend they're okay they're like


---------38:52----------
please do we


---------38:53----------
will even support you more if you have


---------38:55----------
it and there's a face where


---------38:57----------
if you even have one thing better you


---------38:59----------
have to be torn down to the ground


---------39:01----------
and me and poke saw this graph and we


---------39:02----------
realized like we're sitting at the exact


---------39:04----------
opposites


---------39:05----------
of like like he's on this face i'm on


---------39:07----------
this face and kind of laughed at it


---------39:09----------
and then we like did this a little test


---------39:11----------
and


---------39:12----------
the reaction was perfect it was like it


---------39:14----------
was the per it was exactly what we


---------39:16----------
thought and what the like graph would


---------39:17----------
say it would be


---------39:18----------
right whereas like one face looks more


---------39:20----------
like it just needs to be torn down and


---------39:22----------
needs to be like


---------39:22----------
devoured and the other face every


---------39:24----------
benefit the doubt given every


---------39:26----------
credibility given even more


---------39:28----------
credibility given than even uh deserved


---------39:30----------
right


---------39:31----------
so it's kind of like those two


---------39:32----------
polarizing spectrums of the way you come


---------39:34----------
across


---------39:34----------
does that make sense yeah


---------39:39----------
so train i'm a little bit


---------39:43----------
so i'm in a fork in the road yeah go


---------39:46----------
ahead


---------39:46----------
so i have a couple of random thoughts


---------39:50----------
that are sort of starting to come


---------39:52----------
together in a hypothesis


---------39:53----------
perfect please please let me finish


---------39:57----------
and then the other thing though is that


---------39:59----------
i'm wondering whether it's


---------40:00----------
better to hold on to the hypothesis from


---------40:03----------
now


---------40:03----------
for now and talk to you a little bit


---------40:06----------
about bullying


---------40:07----------
because i think that'll probably flesh


---------40:09----------
the hypothesis out


---------40:11----------
okay or i can kind of you know


---------40:15----------
jump to a conclusion it's not really a


---------40:18----------
conclusion because it's not really


---------40:19----------
well-formed it's just like


---------40:21----------
data points that i think it's kind of


---------40:23----------
like a constellation right like


---------40:25----------
i see these couple data points and


---------40:26----------
someone's like that's an archer and it's


---------40:28----------
like it's just a random


---------40:29----------
scattering of points right so the archer


---------40:32----------
is what i'm


---------40:33----------
making out of these data points and


---------40:34----------
that's really unfair


---------40:36----------
and i really am so with with some people


---------40:39----------
i would just jump out and i would say


---------40:41----------
hey here's like maybe what's going on


---------40:43----------
but let's just think about


---------40:45----------
what you're telling us what you're


---------40:47----------
telling us is that people don't give you


---------40:48----------
the benefit of the doubt what you're


---------40:49----------
telling us is that


---------40:50----------
someone looks at one constellation of


---------40:52----------
stars and


---------40:53----------
if it's sodapoppin they say that's a


---------40:56----------
birthday cake and if it's you


---------40:58----------
that's a tombstone right like and so


---------41:01----------
it's interesting because that's that's


---------41:02----------
accurate yeah so now i have to be really


---------41:05----------
careful because


---------41:06----------
i would normally consider sharing this


---------41:08----------
with you but if we really think about


---------41:10----------
what your actual


---------41:11----------
what you're telling us is that like


---------41:13----------
people don't give you the benefit of the


---------41:15----------
doubt so there's a part of me that wants


---------41:16----------
to kind of pull back and say


---------41:18----------
let me really make sure let me give you


---------41:20----------
the benefit of the doubt let me


---------41:21----------
ask you a few more questions let's get


---------41:23----------
into it and then maybe i can


---------41:25----------
share this with you at the end but i


---------41:27----------
really leave it up to you


---------41:28----------
because you know it's what you want to


---------41:30----------
do why don't we start with the


---------41:33----------
good the the juicy stuff where we left


---------41:36----------
off for around two we'll tend to round


---------41:37----------
three because


---------41:38----------
because i don't think to be honest


---------41:41----------
i don't feel like i explained everything


---------41:44----------
i explained to you right now


---------41:45----------
as a perfect representation of what i


---------41:47----------
believe i think some of it was just kind


---------41:49----------
of filler because i couldn't think of


---------41:50----------
the right stuff


---------41:51----------
so i don't feel too confident in an


---------41:53----------
analysis like of that of me


---------41:55----------
so let's start with the round three the


---------41:57----------
round three of our talk based on where


---------41:58----------
we left off


---------41:59----------
and then it goes into exactly what we're


---------42:01----------
just talking about but i think


---------42:02----------
if i can explain to you through my


---------42:04----------
experience and through actual example


---------42:06----------
you can actually get a better


---------42:07----------
understanding of what i'm saying because


---------42:08----------
i think the way i'm describing it is


---------42:09----------
just so


---------42:11----------
it's just so all over the place that at


---------42:13----------
this point i'm not even recognizing what


---------42:14----------
i'm describing to you as being myself


---------42:16----------
anymore so


---------42:17----------
yeah let's start with the round two the


---------42:19----------
the round three stuff we'll start and at


---------42:20----------
the end you can


---------42:21----------
i'd love to hear actually cool examples


---------42:24----------
cool


---------42:25----------
yeah okay so we can let's start


---------42:29----------
let's start end of elementary school


---------42:34----------
okay so end of elementary school so


---------42:38----------
fifth grade to sixth grade from fifth


---------42:40----------
grade you're in a different school


---------42:41----------
sixth grade is middle school so you


---------42:43----------
switch schools entirely and you get into


---------42:44----------
a different whole different bracket


---------42:46----------
just explain this because some people


---------42:47----------
have you know things that are mixed from


---------42:49----------
k1 to 12th grade


---------42:53----------
it's elementary school i remember i was


---------42:54----------
uh you know


---------42:56----------
i was still a kid when i say kid


---------42:59----------
i'm talking kid i'm talking zero


---------43:01----------
awareness of


---------43:03----------
hygiene for myself and my parents still


---------43:05----------
tell me you know


---------43:06----------
zero awareness style zero awareness of


---------43:09----------
what's


---------43:10----------
in music wise blah blah fifth grade i go


---------43:13----------
into sixth grade


---------43:15----------
i'm still wearing my short shorts i


---------43:17----------
still have my


---------43:18----------
i still remember the shirt i had on


---------43:19----------
first day of school it was this little


---------43:21----------
fish shirt that had a


---------43:23----------
hole in it because the the teachers


---------43:25----------
hamster in fifth grade


---------43:27----------
that i held in my hand actually nibbled


---------43:29----------
through my shirt i wore that shirt to


---------43:31----------
school as a fish


---------43:32----------
short shorts glasses you know probably


---------43:35----------
bad breath because i didn't brush my


---------43:37----------
teeth that morning


---------43:38----------
a couple of pimples and i remember going


---------43:41----------
to school everyone


---------43:42----------
everyone kind of i don't know what the


---------43:44----------
word is assimilated or they kind of just


---------43:45----------
went into the style you know everyone


---------43:47----------
knew how to dress the you know the


---------43:48----------
basketball shorts below your knees


---------43:51----------
short socks instead of long white socks


---------43:53----------
you know actual lace shoes instead of


---------43:55----------
velcroed ones


---------43:56----------
everyone kind of knew and i wanted to


---------43:58----------
school with one best friend


---------44:00----------
and that best friend's name was tyler


---------44:04----------
that was my name and i remember the


---------44:07----------
first day of school


---------44:08----------
everyone kind of looked at me laughed


---------44:09----------
you know and


---------44:11----------
i had one best friend that i like


---------44:12----------
trusted he was my best friend from


---------44:14----------
childhood all the way up to sixth grade


---------44:16----------
and there was this other kid


---------44:19----------
that was like a baseball prospect he was


---------44:22----------
looking to be like on the baseball team


---------44:24----------
first year everyone was talking about


---------44:25----------
him in the leagues


---------44:27----------
his name was ryan now i remember uh


---------44:31----------
sixth grade or my first lunch


---------44:36----------
i got my lunch and everyone's kind of


---------44:38----------
somehow everyone knew each other i don't


---------44:39----------
know how they could know each other i


---------44:40----------
don't know if there was some event


---------44:41----------
outside of school that they all knew


---------44:42----------
each other beforehand


---------44:44----------
but anyways i found tyler and tyler's


---------44:47----------
with sitting with ryan and other people


---------44:49----------
and


---------44:50----------
at that point i'm you know already


---------44:51----------
feeling insecure


---------44:53----------
i'm feeling terrible i'm feeling


---------44:55----------
unwelcome


---------44:57----------
and i'm thinking i have one good friend


---------44:58----------
so i go up to him and i'm ready to sit


---------45:00----------
with him and he looks at me and he's


---------45:01----------
like


---------45:02----------
you can't sit with me and i kind of just


---------45:05----------
like i was kind of in shock


---------45:07----------
and he said a couple other mean things


---------45:08----------
and then all the friends laughed and


---------45:10----------
then from that


---------45:10----------
from that day on for the rest of sixth


---------45:13----------
grade i ate my bathroom alone


---------45:16----------
in in this in the bathroom like i ate my


---------45:18----------
food alone in the bathroom alone


---------45:20----------
and that kind of started a big that was


---------45:23----------
like the start to everything


---------45:25----------
that was the start to like that was the


---------45:26----------
start i would even say to the to my


---------45:28----------
brand on stream


---------45:30----------
um the squad w the double standard


---------45:34----------
and i'll get to that a little later so


---------45:37----------
anyways i i i go through sixth grade


---------45:39----------
like that eat my bathroom


---------45:41----------
i eat my food in the bathroom and


---------45:44----------
you know that came with its own thing


---------45:46----------
you know i would be eating


---------45:47----------
usually i'd be crying in there and i'd


---------45:50----------
have that little you know


---------45:51----------
that deep pain in my chest kind of


---------45:53----------
feeling and i'd end up just


---------45:55----------
not eating because i'd be full after


---------45:57----------
that but that was for that entire year


---------46:00----------
seventh grade came along and


---------46:03----------
in seventh grade there was this girl


---------46:06----------
that was in


---------46:07----------
sixth grade that was seen by the entire


---------46:10----------
school as the hardest girl in the school


---------46:12----------
now for some reason this girl she saw me


---------46:15----------
and she didn't want anyone else she just


---------46:16----------
wanted me


---------46:17----------
but i was just so like i was still so


---------46:19----------
mature i was so hated i was even more


---------46:21----------
insecure


---------46:23----------
and keep in mind in this is gonna be


---------46:26----------
really hard to believe but in middle


---------46:27----------
school


---------46:28----------
i had this deep a voice this this voice


---------46:31----------
you're hearing i had this voice


---------46:32----------
and i remember and i know i'm not


---------46:34----------
misremembering cause i remember


---------46:36----------
specific teachers to this day that still


---------46:38----------
commented on my voice's deepness


---------46:40----------
at that age


---------46:44----------
so anyways


---------46:47----------
so this girl kind of saw me looked at me


---------46:50----------
and she liked me i didn't know how


---------46:52----------
but she did and you know i never made


---------46:54----------
anything of it


---------46:55----------
i kind of just stayed friends and then


---------46:58----------
you know um i believe


---------47:01----------
i want to say


---------47:04----------
um so i rode the same bus as her best


---------47:07----------
friend and her best friend would always


---------47:09----------
like kind of tell me and talk to me and


---------47:12----------
i'll get into that i can bring this back


---------47:14----------
up yeah but her best friend kind of


---------47:16----------
uh related to me right but i was at that


---------47:18----------
point i was like


---------47:19----------
so nervous and insecure and shy that it


---------47:22----------
was as if she was talking to a wall


---------47:24----------
i just didn't i didn't really absorb it


---------47:25----------
or i thought it was just


---------47:27----------
some sort of plot against me at that


---------47:29----------
point with like how much i got [ __ ]


---------47:30----------
with


---------47:32----------
so anyways 7th grade comes along i


---------47:34----------
forgot


---------47:35----------
when 911 happened to this time


---------47:39----------
but i did 9 11 in sixth grade or fifth


---------47:42----------
grade


---------47:42----------
2001 i mean anyways seventh grade comes


---------47:45----------
along


---------47:47----------
and you know i'm pershing i'm iranian so


---------47:49----------
the 911 thing in in in that


---------47:52----------
yeah in arizona right it didn't matter


---------47:54----------
if you're


---------47:55----------
you know iranians completely separate


---------47:57----------
from


---------47:58----------
everything else like it's different


---------48:00----------
language different ethnicity different


---------48:01----------
everything


---------48:02----------
but they didn't care right iran sounds


---------48:04----------
like iraq that's just what it was


---------48:06----------
for them in that school so i remember


---------48:08----------
there was this kid


---------48:09----------
shane um he was kind of the redneck


---------48:14----------
kind of of the school and he was proud


---------48:15----------
of it like he would say that stuff


---------48:17----------
and i remember he uh made comments that


---------48:20----------
my parents


---------48:21----------
blew up the building they were in the


---------48:22----------
plane blah blah blah or like my parents


---------48:25----------
brothers were on the plane and


---------48:26----------
my parents are responsible and this


---------48:29----------
other guy named chris set up the fight


---------48:31----------
between me and that kid and that kid was


---------48:32----------
the cool kid of the school he was in the


---------48:34----------
cool kid group he was the wrestler


---------48:36----------
and i was you know the soccer player and


---------48:39----------
the loser


---------48:40----------
and chris set up the fight and long


---------48:43----------
story short we met up in the bathroom


---------48:44----------
and i ended up breaking his nose and


---------48:49----------
in that moment that three minutes that


---------48:51----------
one punch that broke his nose


---------48:53----------
everything changed suddenly because i


---------48:57----------
because of one punch that isn't


---------48:58----------
reflective of my character isn't


---------49:00----------
reflective of who i am


---------49:02----------
it is it has nothing to do with


---------49:05----------
who i want to be what i think i am my


---------49:08----------
emotions


---------49:09----------
what i want to see in the world there's


---------49:11----------
no depth to it nothing


---------49:13----------
but because of a simple punch suddenly


---------49:16----------
the entire population of girls wanted me


---------49:19----------
suddenly all the guys wanted me to sit


---------49:21----------
at their table and be friends with them


---------49:23----------
and at that time i couldn't understand


---------49:25----------
how i could sit there and go through


---------49:26----------
what i went through relative to my life


---------49:29----------
for those one and a half years


---------49:31----------
and then a single punch to one person's


---------49:33----------
face that's clearly in the wrong as


---------49:35----------
being racist


---------49:37----------
is all that it takes for me to be loved


---------49:39----------
by all


---------49:40----------
accepted by all right it made no sense


---------49:43----------
to me and you know that this will lead


---------49:44----------
on to


---------49:45----------
my brand and squad w and everything else


---------49:49----------
so anyways uh that happens i end up uh


---------49:54----------
you know i i get carried away a little


---------49:56----------
bit into it all


---------49:57----------
and but i don't forget the girl that


---------49:59----------
liked me before it all


---------50:01----------
and i kind of just stuck with her eighth


---------50:04----------
grade comes along


---------50:04----------
i'm sorry can you see that that last


---------50:06----------
part again what about that oh i i stuck


---------50:07----------
with so i


---------50:08----------
i ended up choosing the girl that was


---------50:09----------
with me for all of the [ __ ] right


---------50:12----------
so she liked me before the punch and now


---------50:14----------
that i punch someone all them want me


---------50:16----------
they want me to sit with them and hang


---------50:17----------
out with them and go to their little


---------50:18----------
kickbacks and parties


---------50:21----------
and this is the girl that was super hot


---------50:23----------
or no


---------50:25----------
yes it was the girl that liked me before


---------50:26----------
the punch it was the super hot so were


---------50:28----------
you dating her


---------50:30----------
uh we weren't dating we were still doing


---------50:33----------
our little


---------50:33----------
you know thing yeah yeah i would i would


---------50:36----------
well i did those on virginity at 13


---------50:39----------
which is middle school


---------50:40----------
so it's not this thing where it's middle


---------50:42----------
school we're just talking nothing


---------50:43----------
happening like the people were


---------50:44----------
definitely doing stuff


---------50:45----------
at least in my time in day and age you


---------50:46----------
know people are doing stuff that i guess


---------50:48----------
is weird to talk about now for some


---------50:49----------
reason but


---------50:50----------
um we're you know we were hooking up and


---------50:52----------
stuff but we were just kind of like


---------50:54----------
going slow


---------50:54----------
it was something you'd see out of like


---------50:56----------
some like teen wolf you know some


---------50:58----------
some mtv movie you know anyways


---------51:01----------
eighth grade comes along and i'm still


---------51:04----------
kind of riding out the punch you know


---------51:05----------
i'm still kind of the cool kid now


---------51:08----------
but you know i'm still friends with all


---------51:10----------
my friends


---------51:11----------
and at the end of eighth grade you know


---------51:14----------
i'm still


---------51:16----------
i live that life i have that year and a


---------51:18----------
half of


---------51:19----------
perspective that i've gained from being


---------51:21----------
the cool kid from


---------51:23----------
you know anything i say


---------51:27----------
um


---------51:32----------
i was definitely still insecure um


---------51:36----------
but i definitely did ride out


---------51:39----------
some of the benefits of the position of


---------51:43----------
being the cooler kid and


---------51:45----------
you know the feared kid or whatever the


---------51:47----------
hell the case might be


---------51:50----------
i wrote it out a little bit you know


---------51:51----------
obviously i was young i was


---------51:54----------
immature and you know i i definitely


---------51:56----------
wrote it out


---------51:57----------
you know it had its advantages and


---------52:00----------
almost had no disadvantages to be


---------52:01----------
completely honest


---------52:02----------
weird weird school is just weird high


---------52:04----------
school middle school is weird for some


---------52:05----------
reason


---------52:06----------
if you're the cool kid you already have


---------52:07----------
zero disadvantage until later in life


---------52:09----------
when you realize


---------52:10----------
that was your peak and it made you


---------52:12----------
content with everything so you had


---------52:14----------
no you know further ambition to move


---------52:16----------
higher up anyways


---------52:18----------
so anyways no it didn't happen to me and


---------52:21----------
because it's because i i'll tell you why


---------52:23----------
and this may have actually saved me in a


---------52:25----------
way but


---------52:26----------
so at the end of eighth grade i'm still


---------52:27----------
kind of the cool kid going around you


---------52:29----------
know


---------52:30----------
different schools are getting together


---------52:32----------
you know


---------52:34----------
i i'm like the i'm like the pillar of my


---------52:36----------
school and the other cool kids at other


---------52:37----------
schools we'd all get together party and


---------52:39----------
like it was just it was like a crazy


---------52:40----------
time anyways


---------52:42----------
so end of eighth grade my parents want


---------52:43----------
to move


---------52:45----------
now keep in mind i'm like this emo kid


---------52:48----------
so that was kind of my day and age i'm


---------52:49----------
this scene kid i've


---------52:50----------
you know girl pants on shirt jacket you


---------52:53----------
know


---------52:55----------
and you know i'm just


---------52:58----------
you know it's one girl after the other


---------53:00----------
because it was insane


---------53:01----------
right this was eighth [ __ ] grade so


---------53:03----------
like it was just


---------53:04----------
crazy awesome virginity that eighth


---------53:06----------
grade and


---------53:08----------
my parents want to move to different


---------53:09----------
city


---------53:12----------
so the city that i was in


---------53:15----------
was very culturally diverse there was


---------53:18----------
everyone


---------53:19----------
you know a lot of you know a lot of


---------53:20----------
black kids a lot of mexican kids a lot


---------53:22----------
of


---------53:22----------
middle eastern kids a lot of white kids


---------53:24----------
everyone just it's a big melting pot


---------53:26----------
just


---------53:27----------
mixed mixed mix mixed my parents want to


---------53:30----------
move


---------53:30----------
right we end up moving


---------53:34----------
we end up going over to which i guess


---------53:37----------
there was more background stories i


---------53:38----------
ended up losing my best friend because


---------53:39----------
of the move


---------53:40----------
but that's i guess that's irrelevant to


---------53:41----------
what we're talking about i guess there's


---------53:43----------
a piece of it but anyways


---------53:44----------
i'll just i'll skip that we'll get to


---------53:45----------
that later so we ended up moving


---------53:48----------
we're not moving to scottsdale


---------53:49----------
scottsdale arizona


---------53:51----------
now i end up going to the school um


---------53:54----------
yeah this is in eighth grade so you guys


---------53:56----------
move in the middle of eighth grade no no


---------53:57----------
we move at the end of it good so i moved


---------53:58----------
my first


---------53:59----------
freshman year of high school oh wow so


---------54:00----------
new high school new high school


---------54:02----------
new city new place no one knows me


---------54:06----------
move there and if there is any place


---------54:09----------
opposite of culturally diverse melting


---------54:12----------
pot type thing it is this


---------54:13----------
school that i went to it was called


---------54:15----------
chaparral high school


---------54:17----------
i think it is a rated school and it's in


---------54:19----------
the top 1200 for like america


---------54:21----------
for public schools now


---------54:24----------
this school's all white kids when i say


---------54:26----------
all white


---------54:27----------
i'm saying that like my junior year in


---------54:30----------
that school was probably the first time


---------54:32----------
i saw a black kid walk in the halls


---------54:33----------
or and then we had like two asian kids


---------54:35----------
like it was like that


---------54:36----------
everyone was white everyone there it was


---------54:39----------
the weirdest


---------54:40----------
experience and they were all like going


---------54:44----------
to that phase where they're gangster


---------54:45----------
white


---------54:46----------
but they all came from very rich


---------54:47----------
families right it was just a very very


---------54:49----------
different place and me walking in there


---------54:52----------
dressed the way i was dressed being the


---------54:54----------
way i was


---------54:57----------
it started all over and


---------55:00----------
the bullying so right


---------55:04----------
so i walk in no one knows me


---------55:08----------
i kind of just you know first day i'm


---------55:10----------
shy i don't carry over any of the


---------55:13----------
things from eighth grade and i just kind


---------55:15----------
of was myself


---------55:18----------
and it was just a crazy experience and


---------55:21----------
i remember freshman year you know uh


---------55:24----------
i got [ __ ] with a lot you know i for


---------55:27----------
me for me it was more so


---------55:29----------
the it was the it was the vocal


---------55:33----------
uh it was the emotional bullying that


---------55:37----------
i was kind of cursed with


---------55:40----------
um so i got so


---------55:43----------
i would get made funner for my big head


---------55:46----------
people would call me domer which


---------55:48----------
now it's been made into a meme and it's


---------55:50----------
a better thing but


---------55:51----------
they call me domer they call me t-rex


---------55:54----------
because of my protruding bones in my


---------55:56----------
face they'd say i look like a dinosaur


---------55:58----------
um you know all the things that you hear


---------56:02----------
today in twitch chat they said then


---------56:04----------
now it's kind of different so i'm okay


---------56:07----------
with it now


---------56:08----------
you know now i've kind of owned it um


---------56:11----------
you know typical stuff just ugly


---------56:15----------
unwanted [ __ ] like that and and in those


---------56:17----------
days you have to understand in those


---------56:18----------
days


---------56:19----------
there was no acknowledgement


---------56:22----------
for emotional abuse there was none it


---------56:25----------
was sticks and stones may break your


---------56:26----------
bones but words cannot hurt you and that


---------56:28----------
was accepted by


---------56:28----------
all everybody including myself right


---------56:33----------
so it was a different time there was no


---------56:36----------
awareness of that it was physical


---------56:38----------
bullying or no bullying and


---------56:39----------
later on we find out that emotional


---------56:41----------
abuse is even worse


---------56:44----------
but anyways it was just non-stop you


---------56:46----------
know girls would


---------56:47----------
point and laugh guys would point and


---------56:49----------
laugh they would throw food at me [ __ ]


---------56:51----------
like that


---------56:51----------
now and how did you feel about yourself


---------56:55----------
when


---------56:56----------
that kind of stuff would happen um


---------56:59----------
what did you understand like what's your


---------57:01----------
understanding about the world


---------57:03----------
and who you are and who they are


---------57:10----------
and


---------57:19----------
i was an idiot i


---------57:26----------
the more i got


---------57:30----------
[ __ ] with the better i wanted to be


---------57:34----------
[Music]


---------57:36----------
like to them i thought


---------57:41----------
maybe i don't know


---------57:48----------
you wanted them to like you i want i i


---------57:51----------
wanted them to like me but i also


---------57:55----------
i i have this weird thing in me and this


---------57:58----------
is how i am to this day where


---------58:01----------
you know right now you could punch me in


---------58:03----------
the face and we can we can get into a


---------58:04----------
fist fight


---------58:06----------
and right when that fist fight ends it's


---------58:08----------
like the slate is cleaned


---------58:10----------
like i i will go and buy you a burrito


---------58:12----------
we'll have a nice lunch together


---------58:14----------
right so after like a bout of emotional


---------58:17----------
abuse or bullying


---------58:21----------
i would do nice things for them


---------58:25----------
and it


---------58:29----------
confused them


---------58:32----------
but i didn't see it as anything bad


---------58:36----------
i saw it as i just kind of


---------58:40----------
accepted that that's just the way i came


---------58:42----------
off


---------58:43----------
that maybe like that's what i needed to


---------58:47----------
go through


---------58:47----------
in order to be seen


---------58:51----------
as like a i don't know


---------58:54----------
does that make any sense i'm not really


---------58:56----------
sure how to explain


---------58:58----------
i thought i needed to go through that


---------58:59----------
that was my


---------59:01----------
you know i thought maybe i i needed to i


---------59:04----------
don't know


---------59:05----------
does that make any sense yeah it almost


---------59:07----------
sounds to me like you felt on some level


---------59:09----------
you deserved it


---------59:12----------
it needed to happen right


---------59:16----------
yeah i use deserve in a loaded way


---------59:19----------
i know i know i know i know i didn't


---------59:21----------
take that in that yeah don't worry


---------59:23----------
i'm not i'm not


---------59:28----------
i guess i didn't under so it's crazy


---------59:32----------
because right now everything in my life


---------59:33----------
right now to this day my brand


---------59:35----------
everything i preach


---------59:37----------
it stems from those days


---------59:40----------
absolutely i just i i didn't understand


---------59:44----------
how


---------59:46----------
i didn't get how like the nice things


---------59:49----------
that you know


---------59:49----------
are nice things nice you know the


---------59:51----------
actions that


---------59:53----------
the good things that you do for people i


---------59:55----------
didn't get how those


---------59:57----------
didn't matter it's like people they talk


---------60:00----------
about them like they matter


---------60:02----------
they talk about how they want them how


---------60:03----------
they wish the world was like this


---------60:05----------
but when they see it happen


---------60:08----------
it's made fun of it's uncool the person


---------60:11----------
doing them is just a [ __ ] nerd loser


---------60:14----------
you know soy boy right whatever the [ __ ]


---------60:16----------
right


---------60:17----------
but it's the talk of wanting it that


---------60:19----------
people value more than the actual


---------60:21----------
getting it right so it's like all the


---------60:24----------
cool kids will talk about doing all the


---------60:26----------
good


---------60:27----------
but they'll just be [ __ ] douche bags


---------60:30----------
and dicks and superficial and


---------60:31----------
go do opposite if they talk and then


---------60:33----------
when there's somebody that's doing it


---------60:37----------
it doesn't matter if they're doing it no


---------60:39----------
one cares it's like it's the cool thing


---------60:41----------
to do is to talk about it


---------60:43----------
to share the idea to to spread the hope


---------60:46----------
through the talk but when someone


---------60:47----------
actually does it they're


---------60:49----------
i don't know it was just this weird


---------60:50----------
thing i learned this happened all the


---------60:51----------
way back then too


---------60:52----------
it was [ __ ] insane right uh


---------60:56----------
so it was uncool to be nice and good


---------60:59----------
for the second time yeah go ahead how


---------61:01----------
does it feel to be vilified no matter


---------61:03----------
what you do


---------61:10----------
right because that's what you're telling


---------61:12----------
me you're telling me that like


---------61:15----------
you know everyone talks about being nice


---------61:18----------
like something to aspire to


---------61:19----------
we in our talk we place value to it


---------61:23----------
and what i'm imagining is there's like a


---------61:25----------
a kid in 10th grade


---------61:27----------
man in 10th grade who


---------61:31----------
gets made fun of because of


---------61:34----------
the way your face looks and then


---------61:38----------
like what i'm hearing from you


---------61:40----------
overwhelmingly is that like you sort of


---------61:43----------
didn't


---------61:44----------
deserve what they did and and you could


---------61:46----------
have been an [ __ ] and they would have


---------61:48----------
made fun of you you could have said


---------61:49----------
nothing and they would have made fun of


---------61:50----------
you


---------61:50----------
well i said nothing yeah and then you


---------61:53----------
could you tried to be nice like you


---------61:55----------
tried to be a good person you tried to


---------61:56----------
be


---------61:57----------
what people aspire to right you tried to


---------62:00----------
become a good person and to be respected


---------62:03----------
and then they laughed at you and made


---------62:04----------
fun of you anyway well they hated it so


---------62:06----------
no matter what


---------62:07----------
if i can get to the end and then i'll


---------62:10----------
answer that because the end is so


---------62:11----------
important to everything


---------62:12----------
right okay and i've only had i think


---------62:15----------
when i get to the end and tell you


---------62:18----------
what i'm going to tell you i've only had


---------62:20----------
maybe three or four other people in my


---------62:22----------
life


---------62:23----------
be able to admit what this individual


---------62:26----------
admitted


---------62:27----------
and recently actually hafu is one of the


---------62:30----------
people that could


---------62:31----------
just be confident enough or i don't know


---------62:33----------
what the wording is but to admit it


---------62:35----------
that's why i respect the hell out of


---------62:36----------
when i really like hafu but


---------62:38----------
so long story short you know just


---------62:41----------
another four years of


---------62:43----------
just you know even on my soccer team


---------62:45----------
right i made varsity freshman year


---------62:47----------
and even there man you know


---------62:51----------
i got in in the soccer team they


---------62:53----------
actually physically bullied me right


---------62:55----------
like they would


---------62:56----------
coach wouldn't look it was something you


---------62:58----------
see out of a movie you know they would


---------62:59----------
trip me they would just


---------63:01----------
[ __ ] push me down kick me on the


---------63:03----------
ground and the coach would look back


---------63:04----------
around and


---------63:05----------
he would think that i'm the one horsing


---------63:07----------
around so i would get the laps


---------63:09----------
it was some just [ __ ] up [ __ ] but that


---------63:10----------
was just i just took that as what it was


---------63:12----------
not to mention i ended up taking


---------63:13----------
one of the senior player spots because i


---------63:15----------
ended up being the first leading goal


---------63:16----------
scorer for


---------63:17----------
in freshman year so that was more of i


---------63:20----------
just saw that as


---------63:21----------
you know the insecure kind of


---------63:24----------
like i said the talk over the action


---------63:26----------
thing anyways


---------63:28----------
i'm gonna skip past everything okay


---------63:30----------
there's a lot of detail in there but i


---------63:31----------
think


---------63:31----------
you get a good gist i don't need to make


---------63:32----------
this a pity party so senior year


---------63:35----------
why not because


---------63:44----------
because in my opinion by now i think


---------63:49----------
i think the people or you


---------63:53----------
based on what i've said they know what


---------63:54----------
i'm talking about


---------63:56----------
if you don't know what i'm talking about


---------63:58----------
at this point then the more i talk


---------64:00----------
you i feel like it's only gonna make you


---------64:02----------
understand through pity and feeling bad


---------64:04----------
and if you understand through pity and


---------64:05----------
feeling bad you don't


---------64:06----------
actually understand and there's no


---------64:08----------
actual solution that comes from it


---------64:10----------
all that comes from it is just the


---------64:12----------
feeling of feeling bad for the


---------64:13----------
individual


---------64:13----------
and giving them you know treating them


---------64:16----------
in a way because


---------64:17----------
you feel bad but you don't truly


---------64:18----------
understand what they went through right


---------64:19----------
does that make any sense man i could go


---------64:21----------
deeper into sophomore junior and senior


---------64:23----------
year


---------64:25----------
i could definitely you know the parties


---------64:27----------
the not being invited the


---------64:28----------
kind of being kicked out in front of


---------64:30----------
everybody because


---------64:32----------
you know i was never welcome in the


---------64:34----------
first place or i'm a loser like


---------64:36----------
things like that like i can go i mean


---------64:38----------
there's a lot of like rejection and


---------64:40----------
just you know what what i'm what i'm


---------64:42----------
curious about is why you're devaluing


---------64:45----------
pity


---------64:46----------
but anyway we can just we can go to the


---------64:48----------
end i'm just taking notes


---------64:51----------
i guess i devalue pity because


---------64:55----------
i don't know i was i was kind of


---------64:59----------
i don't know like i


---------65:04----------
for me it was there's you can't put your


---------65:06----------
head down in sulk


---------65:07----------
you can't pity you have to you know


---------65:10----------
instead think of a way you're going to


---------65:11----------
beat it


---------65:13----------
you know think of the think of the way


---------65:14----------
you're going to climb the mountain and


---------65:15----------
get over it you know if you sit there


---------65:16----------
and


---------65:17----------
you know just i don't know


---------65:20----------
you know for me that there was no i


---------65:22----------
didn't have my things solved by others i


---------65:24----------
had to solve them


---------65:25----------
right so i don't know does that make any


---------65:28----------
sense


---------65:29----------
yeah yeah it makes a lot of sense but


---------65:33----------
i think it's it's pity didn't help is


---------65:36----------
what i'm hearing


---------65:38----------
no pity i was


---------65:41----------
i've never been i've never been


---------65:45----------
i don't know what the word is i don't


---------65:46----------
want to say blessed


---------65:48----------
i've never had the accommodate i've


---------65:50----------
never had the luxury


---------65:52----------
of being pitied i've never like no one's


---------65:55----------
ever felt


---------65:55----------
no one's ever said oh poor you know he


---------65:57----------
doesn't you know minus my parents maybe


---------65:59----------
but like


---------66:00----------
you know no one's ever said oh damn man


---------66:02----------
like it's all good bro like you don't


---------66:03----------
deserve this


---------66:04----------
like you know keep your head up like one


---------66:06----------
day you'll be hungry and proof of them


---------66:08----------
wrong


---------66:08----------
that was never the case it's as if like


---------66:11----------
in a way


---------66:11----------
even the people who called me friends in


---------66:14----------
a way like


---------66:14----------
in the back their minds they enjoyed me


---------66:17----------
being put down


---------66:18----------
so like i just you feel if i said i pity


---------66:21----------
you


---------66:23----------
i guess in a way i feel insulted i think


---------66:26----------
so


---------66:28----------
does that make any sense you're just


---------66:30----------
just from like where i'm at


---------66:32----------
yep so i don't even think like i don't


---------66:33----------
even want the pity


---------66:35----------
you don't want the pity i completely


---------66:36----------
agree yeah what's insulting about it


---------66:40----------
how dare you that's what i that's


---------66:43----------
well yeah what's insulting about it is


---------66:48----------
what i went through where i'm at right


---------66:50----------
now i don't even see it as a bad thing


---------66:52----------
i'm glad i went through it i see it as a


---------66:55----------
strength


---------66:56----------
i i turned weakness


---------66:59----------
i turned i turned the destruction of


---------67:03----------
myself the the putting down of myself


---------67:05----------
into one of my greatest strengths and


---------67:07----------
into a fuel


---------67:09----------
that people who didn't have that life


---------67:12----------
can never taste and i'm not saying that


---------67:14----------
you need to have that life or it's a


---------67:15----------
good thing in my life it's not


---------67:17----------
but i just don't need anyone's pity


---------67:20----------
does that make any sense makes a lot of


---------67:22----------
sense


---------67:24----------
yeah so we'll circle back to that okay


---------67:26----------
we'll circle back to it okay so senior


---------67:27----------
year


---------67:29----------
i finally got to a place now keep in


---------67:31----------
mind i'm still insecure


---------67:33----------
i'm still immature i'm still extremely


---------67:35----------
insecure


---------67:36----------
to the point i mean there's a lot i left


---------67:38----------
out about you know just this school is a


---------67:40----------
rich school


---------67:40----------
so that's where a lot of my insecurities


---------67:42----------
came from where i felt like i need to


---------67:43----------
lie about what i have in order to be


---------67:44----------
accepted


---------67:45----------
you know why about a car or a house or


---------67:48----------
who owns what


---------67:50----------
and it stems from this school but


---------67:53----------
anyways


---------67:53----------
senior year comes around i still


---------67:56----------
remember the group of kids that would


---------67:57----------
bully me right


---------67:59----------
um it was pretty much the football team


---------68:01----------
right and


---------68:04----------
that the head of it all his name was


---------68:05----------
ethan


---------68:07----------
right now i think he's like in hollywood


---------68:08----------
somewhere like uh


---------68:12----------
he's best friends with like the brother


---------68:13----------
of


---------68:15----------
emma stone emma stone his brother


---------68:17----------
spencer and then i went to school


---------68:19----------
spencer and


---------68:20----------
i think freshman year emma emma's


---------68:22----------
brother spencer and spencer's best


---------68:23----------
friends ethan


---------68:24----------
and they kind of took him to hollywood


---------68:25----------
now they work there anyways though


---------68:27----------
so


---------68:30----------
so that's kind of what it was well


---------68:33----------
here's the thing


---------68:34----------
so emma was actually a very nice person


---------68:36----------
she's always been very


---------68:38----------
nice and very good like very mature very


---------68:40----------
nice so that's actually the surprising


---------68:41----------
part like


---------68:42----------
she was the like mature responsible one


---------68:44----------
she was cool


---------68:45----------
i only got like i think i only saw for


---------68:47----------
six months before she would transfer


---------68:48----------
schools to like a private school or


---------68:49----------
something but


---------68:50----------
her brother ended up transferring back


---------68:51----------
to our school


---------68:53----------
and he he had his bouts you know he was


---------68:56----------
half and half he was kind of embarrassed


---------68:58----------
to you know be around me i was the loser


---------68:59----------
he was the cool kid whatever


---------69:01----------
um how do i feel about that we'll get


---------69:03----------
into that a little later


---------69:05----------
but anyway so at the end of the school


---------69:07----------
year


---------69:08----------
i gave that background information just


---------69:11----------
to kind of add more credibility to it


---------69:12----------
all but


---------69:13----------
by credibility i mean how how well i


---------69:16----------
remember the events because the human


---------69:17----------
memory usually you know it's not too


---------69:18----------
good but anyways


---------69:19----------
so senior year comes around and


---------69:24----------
i've always been a very like blunt


---------69:26----------
person when it comes i just kind of


---------69:27----------
asked straight up things that people are


---------69:29----------
too like embarrassed for and it wasn't


---------69:30----------
always like this it kind of built up all


---------69:32----------
the way to senior year


---------69:33----------
so senora comes around and


---------69:37----------
i had a class at this english class and


---------69:39----------
my teacher was the football


---------69:41----------
like strategy coach


---------69:44----------
and all the players were my class at the


---------69:46----------
end they would hit me in class


---------69:48----------
and then the teacher would i think


---------69:50----------
relive his the high school experience he


---------69:52----------
thinks he deserved through being a


---------69:54----------
teacher and


---------69:55----------
giving the cool kids a pass and getting


---------69:57----------
me in trouble for getting hit and


---------69:58----------
retaliating


---------70:00----------
um sometimes school year ended and i


---------70:03----------
ended up asking this guy


---------70:04----------
this this ethan guy like why


---------70:07----------
did they hate me right and i remember


---------70:11----------
actually there was one big thing i


---------70:12----------
remember they would so ethan


---------70:15----------
his girlfriend worked in the student


---------70:18----------
yearbook so in like the student council


---------70:19----------
yearbook


---------70:21----------
and this was the worst part for me i


---------70:23----------
think that wasn't the worst part it was


---------70:24----------
one of the bad parts that to this day


---------70:25----------
remember


---------70:27----------
every year book i had i would rip out


---------70:30----------
two pages


---------70:31----------
and i would cry in my bathroom even at


---------70:35----------
the age i was at


---------70:36----------
because he would get his girlfriend to


---------70:39----------
add in


---------70:40----------
a page of just like just like clowning


---------70:43----------
on me just like


---------70:45----------
just rumors about me into like so like


---------70:47----------
in the sections where i'd say most


---------70:49----------
likely to be


---------70:50----------
they would put rumors into me and it was


---------70:51----------
the school joke and they would all


---------70:53----------
turn that page and laugh at me and point


---------70:55----------
and i would always rip that page out in


---------70:57----------
the bathroom and


---------70:58----------
flush it down and just cry but anyways


---------71:00----------
at the end of the year i asked uh


---------71:04----------
[ __ ] but anyways at the end of the


---------71:06----------
year i remember i asked them strip i was


---------71:08----------
like


---------71:09----------
like why like the [ __ ] like


---------71:13----------
you know what was all this for


---------71:16----------
and this was the first honest answer i


---------71:18----------
got


---------71:19----------
at least now that from what i know now


---------71:22----------
honest answer that i got


---------71:24----------
he said the reason that i


---------71:28----------
they hated me hear me out here okay and


---------71:31----------
we'll get to why i brought hafu up in a


---------71:32----------
second here and some others


---------71:34----------
he told me the reason they hated me and


---------71:36----------
the reason they felt they needed to


---------71:37----------
bully me is because they felt they


---------71:40----------
needed to bring me down a notch


---------71:41----------
literally word for


---------71:42----------
what you said earlier they need to bring


---------71:43----------
me down a notch they felt when i walked


---------71:46----------
into their school


---------71:47----------
they didn't like that i walked around


---------71:49----------
with my head up high they didn't like


---------71:50----------
the way i


---------71:51----------
talked confidently little did i know


---------71:54----------
this wasn't the case at all i was


---------71:56----------
insecure it's just part of


---------71:57----------
when i talk i have this deeper voice


---------71:59----------
right i might get a little passionate


---------72:01----------
and me walking my head up high what the


---------72:02----------
[ __ ] it to them if


---------72:04----------
like think about that i want you to


---------72:06----------
think about that


---------72:08----------
so i wasn't any of the things they


---------72:10----------
attributed to me


---------72:11----------
but because of the way i looked and the


---------72:13----------
way i walked


---------72:15----------
it's as if i owned the place and they


---------72:17----------
felt like they needed to bring me down a


---------72:18----------
notch


---------72:18----------
and that was that was the stem of my


---------72:20----------
bullying it wasn't even


---------72:22----------
anything that i had done to them it


---------72:24----------
wasn't anything that


---------72:26----------
i said or that actually disgusted them


---------72:29----------
it was the mere fact that i threatened


---------72:32----------
their


---------72:33----------
egos because of


---------72:37----------
walking with my head up high and


---------72:40----------
it that was the first time i didn't


---------72:42----------
understand it then but i understand


---------72:44----------
clearly now


---------72:44----------
and the reason i bring up hofu because


---------72:47----------
i'm sure they'll be pushed back on their


---------72:48----------
story a little bit


---------72:49----------
but recently um hof and i started


---------72:52----------
playing among us i'll skip back to


---------72:54----------
school and stuff in a second but half


---------72:55----------
and i started playing among us


---------72:56----------
and so she's actually a supporter of


---------73:00----------
mine i support her she's a friend now


---------73:01----------
and


---------73:02----------
i respect the hell out of it for


---------73:03----------
admitting this because i think a lot of


---------73:04----------
people feel this way but


---------73:06----------
it takes a certain confidence to admit


---------73:08----------
it


---------73:10----------
hafu literally said word for word what


---------73:12----------
ethan told me senior year of high school


---------73:14----------
she told me this like two weeks ago like


---------73:17----------
i was talking to her about


---------73:18----------
different groups why some groups don't


---------73:20----------
want me in there and she literally said


---------73:23----------
exactly what it is the looks thing you


---------73:26----------
kind of you kind of look like you know


---------73:27----------
you look


---------73:28----------
kind of scary the way you talk it's kind


---------73:30----------
of intimidating and aggressive


---------73:32----------
comes across as if you had to beat


---------73:33----------
everyone's ass like like


---------73:35----------
hearing that from her in the message


---------73:37----------
when i responded i'm like listen


---------73:40----------
i i like a piece of me


---------73:44----------
i just respected the hell out of her


---------73:46----------
because this is the vibe i get


---------73:48----------
time and time again from a lot of people


---------73:50----------
but that you you can't


---------73:51----------
what what man is going to admit that no


---------73:54----------
man it goes again if you feel that way


---------73:56----------
about me


---------73:57----------
it goes against the very thing to even


---------73:58----------
admit that because if you feel that way


---------74:00----------
about me in the first place it means


---------74:02----------
there's something that's being some


---------74:03----------
ego that's being triggered right some


---------74:04----------
insecurity


---------74:06----------
which contradicts the mere fact of ever


---------74:08----------
admitting oh well i don't like you


---------74:09----------
because


---------74:10----------
you kind of scare me right so no one


---------74:12----------
ever admits it but i think


---------74:14----------
that's like a deeper reflection of it


---------74:15----------
all right and i think that's why i'm


---------74:17----------
vilified i think that's why a lot of the


---------74:18----------
things that i do


---------74:19----------
are kind of devalued they're kind of


---------74:22----------
lessened


---------74:24----------
and i think so that's why i brought the


---------74:26----------
hawfu thing up just to kind of verify


---------74:27----------
the story that i was told in


---------74:29----------
senior year about by my bully


---------74:33----------
and yeah so that that was that and then


---------74:34----------
you know college came around and


---------74:36----------
same thing happened in college you know


---------74:37----------
went to college same [ __ ]


---------74:40----------
and then i got into the drugs and the


---------74:42----------
drugs were a crazy time


---------74:45----------
but i'll stop there so we can kind of go


---------74:48----------
over that stuff i mean


---------74:49----------
maybe now that i think about it maybe i


---------74:50----------
should have went deeper into the high


---------74:52----------
school bullying stuff


---------74:53----------
i feel like but whatever go ahead so


---------74:56----------
train first of all let me start by


---------74:57----------
saying


---------74:59----------
thank you so much for sharing man you


---------75:00----------
are a phenomenal storyteller


---------75:03----------
um really yeah oh thank you


---------75:06----------
you know it's interesting because i i


---------75:08----------
see you always make statements whenever


---------75:11----------
we talk about like you know


---------75:13----------
do you get what i'm saying do you hear


---------75:14----------
me i think train you're a very clear


---------75:16----------
communicator


---------75:18----------
i i think that you you capture the


---------75:20----------
essence of things


---------75:22----------
in a way that cannot be wrapped around


---------75:24----------
words


---------75:26----------
and so sometimes you have trouble


---------75:28----------
finding the words but i don't think


---------75:30----------
it's because you're so if we think about


---------75:32----------
it any word


---------75:33----------
is a false representation of a real


---------75:35----------
thing


---------75:36----------
true right agreed so i i think sometimes


---------75:40----------
you think you're communicating poorly


---------75:41----------
because you have trouble finding the


---------75:43----------
words and i think the reason you have


---------75:44----------
trouble finding the words is not because


---------75:45----------
you're dumb


---------75:46----------
it's because you're so close to the


---------75:47----------
truth that no word captures it


---------75:50----------
that's right i can't think of that's


---------75:51----------
that's exactly right i'm just like very


---------75:53----------
yeah like right and and but i don't


---------75:56----------
have i mean there's basically only been


---------75:59----------
once


---------76:00----------
during the last hour and a half where i


---------76:02----------
haven't been able to follow you and i


---------76:03----------
sort of told you right away


---------76:04----------
but i think for the most part like i


---------76:06----------
think you know even at the beginning


---------76:07----------
when you said i'm nervous i i don't


---------76:08----------
think i'm speaking clear i think you're


---------76:10----------
speaking very clearly


---------76:11----------
i think you tell you're a wonderful


---------76:13----------
storyteller


---------76:15----------
um i i think that you know your life has


---------76:17----------
a


---------76:18----------
a narrative to it for sure um


---------76:22----------
and and i think it's there's a lot of


---------76:24----------
authenticity there


---------76:25----------
there's a lot of truth there there's a


---------76:27----------
lot of pain there


---------76:29----------
and there are a lot of adaptations in


---------76:32----------
your story um


---------76:35----------
you know before we get into the drugs


---------76:37----------
because i i want to just


---------76:39----------
toss out a couple things one is that i


---------76:41----------
think maybe we should save drugs for


---------76:43----------
next time presuming there's an over time


---------76:46----------
i do want to share some thoughts with


---------76:48----------
you and i i want to kind of give you


---------76:52----------
i i'm curious what you think um i think


---------76:55----------
this is going to be a challenge because


---------76:56----------
at this point i feel


---------76:57----------
quite confident but that doesn't


---------77:00----------
necessarily mean i'm right but i


---------77:02----------
i wouldn't be surprised if you


---------77:04----------
[Music]


---------77:06----------
don't see things quite the way that i do


---------77:09----------
and


---------77:09----------
and the the main reason that i think


---------77:11----------
that like we should maybe talk about


---------77:12----------
this before we get to the drugs is i


---------77:14----------
suspect


---------77:16----------
something about the drugs has to do


---------77:19----------
with this right so when we think about


---------77:22----------
addiction


---------77:23----------
and we think about substance use


---------77:27----------
oftentimes the road to sobriety


---------77:30----------
is not through like focusing on the


---------77:32----------
addiction it's to focus


---------77:34----------
on the things that the addiction takes


---------77:36----------
advantage of


---------77:37----------
certainly there's like a neurochemical


---------77:39----------
maybe biological predisposition


---------77:41----------
or whatever fine but in my experience


---------77:44----------
literally as an addiction psychiatrist


---------77:46----------
it's [ __ ] like this


---------77:47----------
that when you figure this stuff out the


---------77:49----------
substance use gets way better


---------77:53----------
and if it's okay with you trained i'm


---------77:55----------
gonna just start talking


---------77:57----------
and feel free to jump in yeah go ahead


---------78:00----------
before


---------78:01----------
you fully go in actually i'll save the


---------78:05----------
drug thing yeah


---------78:06----------
for next time because the drug thing


---------78:09----------
isn't directly related to


---------78:10----------
that but it is a little bit anyways yeah


---------78:14----------
yes talk go away you talk go ahead just


---------78:16----------
go i find it hard to believe that it's


---------78:17----------
not going to be related because like


---------78:18----------
this is the story


---------78:19----------
it is and it's not but yeah okay sorry


---------78:22----------
yeah go ahead


---------78:24----------
okay so i'm gonna kind of go


---------78:26----------
chronologically


---------78:27----------
because that's the way that my notes are


---------78:28----------
maybe i can collect my thoughts better


---------78:30----------
but i think it'll hopefully come


---------78:31----------
together


---------78:32----------
okay cool so let's actually just start


---------78:36----------
with talking about narcissism for a


---------78:37----------
second


---------78:38----------
okay because i think it's actually an


---------78:39----------
important discussion so people talk


---------78:42----------
about


---------78:42----------
narcissism narcissists as people


---------78:46----------
right like we say that this person is a


---------78:48----------
narcissist


---------78:49----------
i don't think that's the right way to


---------78:51----------
think about narcissism i think the way


---------78:52----------
to think about narcissism


---------78:53----------
is that it's like a particular pattern


---------78:56----------
of mind that's in response to something


---------78:58----------
else


---------78:59----------
and specifically it's like a defense


---------79:00----------
against an attack and it's like a


---------79:02----------
protective mechanism


---------79:03----------
right when people put you down there's a


---------79:05----------
part of you that says no


---------79:08----------
i'm more than that right and everyone


---------79:10----------
hates me but i'm more than that i'm a


---------79:12----------
good person whatever


---------79:14----------
and i think part of the reason that that


---------79:15----------
streamers and i think is it's really


---------79:17----------
insightful


---------79:18----------
to me anyway i think it's nuanced the


---------79:20----------
way that you understand train that like


---------79:23----------
you know people exhibit


---------79:24----------
symptoms like streamers exhibit symptoms


---------79:27----------
of narcissism which aren't about them as


---------79:29----------
a person


---------79:30----------
they're not narcissists it's part of the


---------79:31----------
job something about streaming


---------79:34----------
in the world that we live in exhibits


---------79:36----------
that or


---------79:37----------
provokes that kind of behavior which i


---------79:39----------
agree with 100 and so maybe the reason i


---------79:41----------
think you're insightful is because we


---------79:42----------
agree


---------79:43----------
um but so i think a lot of what we see


---------79:47----------
in narcissistic behavior is because


---------79:48----------
frankly you guys get attacked a lot


---------79:50----------
right so


---------79:50----------
when does narcissism tend to crop up


---------79:52----------
it's when you get attacked


---------79:54----------
and if you look at celebrities and why


---------79:56----------
do celebrities and streamers and


---------79:57----------
influencers exhibit narcissistic


---------79:59----------
qualities


---------80:00----------
i think once you get into the public


---------80:01----------
face it's as simple as you get attacked


---------80:03----------
more and when you get attacked more


---------80:04----------
you have more narcissistic defenses


---------80:08----------
and and so i just wanted to kind of toss


---------80:10----------
that out because i i do think it makes


---------80:12----------
sense and


---------80:12----------
we're actually working on that and


---------80:14----------
trying to understand that and trying to


---------80:15----------
support


---------80:16----------
uh content creators better at healthy


---------80:18----------
gamer um


---------80:21----------
but then i want to get to the beginning


---------80:23----------
thing which is like this weird


---------80:25----------
insecurity that you have at the


---------80:26----------
beginning of our conversation in the way


---------80:27----------
that


---------80:28----------
you see yourself when you look when you


---------80:30----------
like see yourself right so you said i


---------80:32----------
feel insecure about the way that i talk


---------80:34----------
and when i look at myself i see some guy


---------80:37----------
who's falsely confident


---------80:39----------
right but i want you to just think about


---------80:41----------
how closely those are tied together


---------80:43----------
that's not actually what you look like


---------80:44----------
like that's absurd bro


---------80:47----------
what does false confidence even look


---------80:49----------
like you just look like you


---------80:51----------
your perception of false confidence


---------80:53----------
comes from your insecurity


---------80:55----------
like i think those are really the


---------80:57----------
perception of false confidence


---------80:58----------
comes from so it's what i'm it's what's


---------81:02----------
drilled in my head


---------81:04----------
people cannot be okay with me being a


---------81:07----------
confident person


---------81:08----------
so i try to look into i look at myself


---------81:11----------
and through their eyes


---------81:12----------
i completely but let's be clear


---------81:16----------
it's what you just said it's drilled


---------81:19----------
into your head which means that the


---------81:22----------
perception


---------81:24----------
of you being a falsely confident person


---------81:27----------
is coming from


---------81:28----------
your head it's not coming from the


---------81:30----------
outside world i don't doubt that it's


---------81:32----------
been


---------81:32----------
drilled into your head by external


---------81:35----------
events but this is something i want you


---------81:36----------
guys to really understand


---------81:38----------
is that external events happen and then


---------81:40----------
they drill into our head


---------81:42----------
but where they live is in your head


---------81:46----------
they don't actually live in the outside


---------81:47----------
world they don't live in the way that


---------81:49----------
other people continue to see you


---------81:51----------
once something drills into your head


---------81:53----------
that's where it lives


---------81:55----------
and i'm not saying that it's


---------81:56----------
inappropriate yeah that it got drilled


---------81:58----------
into your head


---------81:59----------
i think there's a so real quick to enter


---------82:02----------
in here


---------82:03----------
so it's not that it's drilled in my head


---------82:07----------
and i believe it it's that so when you


---------82:09----------
ask the question why


---------82:10----------
do you think people are scared of you


---------82:13----------
i'm trying to i'm tr when i answer that


---------82:16----------
it's not i'm answering it through


---------82:17----------
what they're telling me is that makes


---------82:19----------
sense it makes sense


---------82:20----------
but just let me finish so i i agree with


---------82:22----------
you so i was going to get to this where


---------82:24----------
i know you don't believe it


---------82:27----------
and yet you do and we'll get to that


---------82:29----------
because i i think it's really


---------82:30----------
interesting and i think it can be


---------82:32----------
kind of confusing but i i just want to


---------82:34----------
like highlight this point where like i


---------82:36----------
completely agree and if we listen to


---------82:37----------
your [ __ ] story man


---------82:39----------
clearly the world has been sending you


---------82:41----------
particular messages which i think


---------82:43----------
live there now because you even tell us


---------82:46----------
i'm really insecure


---------82:47----------
you say it all the [ __ ] time right


---------82:49----------
and so if we think about like why are


---------82:50----------
you so insecure


---------82:52----------
because you're also you're insecure and


---------82:54----------
you're confident at the same time


---------82:56----------
you really strike me as someone who has


---------82:58----------
a lot of genuine confidence


---------82:59----------
a lot of genuine compassion a lot of


---------83:01----------
genuine goodness


---------83:04----------
and a lot of genuine insecurity and that


---------83:06----------
seems like irreconcilable to most people


---------83:08----------
because they think that


---------83:09----------
you can't be confident and secure and


---------83:11----------
insecure at the same time


---------83:13----------
whereas i think that's the way most


---------83:14----------
people think they think it's like a


---------83:15----------
linear scale but it's not


---------83:17----------
yeah you can have parallel insecurity


---------83:19----------
with parallel confidence well i think to


---------83:21----------
go further i think in order to have


---------83:23----------
confidence


---------83:24----------
you must become one or you must become


---------83:27----------
or


---------83:27----------
you have to accept your insecurities


---------83:29----------
yeah so we'll talk about that


---------83:30----------
from the acceptance of insecurities and


---------83:32----------
the acceptance of imperfection right i


---------83:33----------
completely agree so i think your


---------83:35----------
confidence comes from the pers


---------83:36----------
acceptance of some insecurities but i


---------83:38----------
think there's other stuff down there


---------83:40----------
that is still affecting you in a


---------83:43----------
negative way which we'll get to


---------83:44----------
okay so we're gonna get to this idea of


---------83:46----------
like okay i'm vilified no matter what i


---------83:49----------
need


---------83:50----------
what i do so i'm gonna just actually


---------83:51----------
highlight a couple of things which i


---------83:53----------
think


---------83:53----------
exhibit narcissistic defenses i'm not


---------83:55----------
calling you a narcissist but it's just


---------83:57----------
like


---------83:57----------
when we're thinking about people who are


---------83:59----------
narcissists like what do they do right


---------84:01----------
so one is that yes


---------84:02----------
um you know one is that you say that


---------84:05----------
things are facts right like you say like


---------84:07----------
this is a fact


---------84:09----------
so so like it i mean sort of like yes


---------84:12----------
these events happened


---------84:13----------
but like you know your perceptions of


---------84:16----------
the way that people


---------84:17----------
perceive you you view as facts those are


---------84:21----------
not actually facts there are beliefs


---------84:23----------
that are supported by evidence


---------84:24----------
did a doctor actually come to you and


---------84:27----------
say


---------84:28----------
hey this guy has a protruding forehead


---------84:30----------
we need to do surgery and i'm like what


---------84:31----------
the [ __ ]


---------84:32----------
right and and so so that is a factual


---------84:35----------
thing but then


---------84:36----------
out of that experience train comes a


---------84:38----------
belief that lives in your mind


---------84:41----------
and then you start to think that that


---------84:43----------
belief is a fact


---------84:45----------
right because it's supported by so much


---------84:46----------
evidence people like you had this deep


---------84:48----------
voice


---------84:49----------
teachers told you and then you're coming


---------84:50----------
up to us and you're saying look at all


---------84:51----------
the evidence for what i believe


---------84:54----------
but oddly enough train i don't think


---------84:56----------
it's actually a fact


---------84:57----------
i think all of those things happen to


---------84:59----------
you and i want you to just


---------85:00----------
take a step out of your own shoes and


---------85:02----------
let's think about someone who thinks


---------85:03----------
that they're ugly for example right


---------85:05----------
right and like you talk to them and you


---------85:07----------
say like


---------85:08----------
bro you're not ugly but they're like no


---------85:10----------
this happened and then this happened


---------85:12----------
and then this happened and this happened


---------85:13----------
i'm telling you bro i'm ugly the entire


---------85:15----------
world has told me this there are so many


---------85:17----------
facts that make me


---------85:18----------
i know i'm ugly it's a fact it's not a


---------85:21----------
belief


---------85:23----------
right i'm fully on yeah i'm on same page


---------85:25----------
yeah


---------85:26----------
and so there are other things that you


---------85:28----------
tend to do which is like


---------85:30----------
you know i'm vilified no matter what


---------85:32----------
right and like that's kind of weird


---------85:33----------
because then you also make these


---------85:34----------
statements about


---------85:35----------
they need me to be something and like


---------85:37----------
you you talk a lot about what other


---------85:39----------
people like need you to be


---------85:42----------
and so there's a really tricky there's a


---------85:43----------
really subtle ground there which i i


---------85:46----------
genuinely trained i'm gonna say this


---------85:48----------
again i'm not just saying this is a


---------85:49----------
disclaimer i genuinely think you're like


---------85:50----------
an awesome compassionate


---------85:52----------
not narcissistic guy but i think that


---------85:55----------
you have an adaptation


---------85:57----------
in there that is absolutely something


---------86:00----------
like narcissism


---------86:01----------
but i don't i don't blame you for it i


---------86:02----------
think it's like just think about the


---------86:04----------
life that you've lived


---------86:05----------
unless you can be a little bit


---------86:06----------
narcissistic you would have been like


---------86:08----------
smashed to pieces i mean you were


---------86:10----------
smashed to pieces


---------86:12----------
yeah right and like it's the only way


---------86:15----------
that you can survive but that


---------86:16----------
lingers with you and we'll get to that


---------86:20----------
in a second because i think


---------86:21----------
that which has been adaptive for you is


---------86:24----------
now


---------86:25----------
starting to be maladapted and we'll get


---------86:27----------
to that


---------86:29----------
but it kind of like there's this really


---------86:30----------
tricky thing about like if you say i'm


---------86:32----------
vilified no matter what


---------86:34----------
they need me to be this in a sense


---------86:38----------
you gotta it's dangerous territory i'm


---------86:39----------
not saying you do this but i want i want


---------86:41----------
everyone who sort of thinks this kind of


---------86:42----------
stuff about themselves


---------86:46----------
so here's what i'm saying so like like i


---------86:48----------
think i was talking i don't know when we


---------86:49----------
left off so i'm gonna try to just recap


---------86:51----------
real quick


---------86:52----------
okay so like if you think about people


---------86:54----------
who have insecurities right they look


---------86:56----------
and they think


---------86:56----------
that like they call their insecurities


---------86:58----------
facts and what they do is they assemble


---------87:00----------
all this evidence


---------87:02----------
right and they say like oh but this


---------87:03----------
happened and then this happened and then


---------87:05----------
this happened and like that's why


---------87:07----------
like i'm not dumb for believing this


---------87:09----------
it's a fact


---------87:10----------
and i completely agree i don't think


---------87:12----------
you're dumb for believing it but let's


---------87:13----------
be clear that it's not necessarily a


---------87:15----------
fact it's just a belief


---------87:17----------
and it's a powerful belief it's a


---------87:18----------
justifiable belief but it's still a


---------87:20----------
belief


---------87:22----------
and and now i want to get to this idea


---------87:23----------
of like i'm vilified no matter what


---------87:25----------
because that's a really dangerous tight


---------87:27----------
rope to walk i


---------87:28----------
i sort of agree with what you're saying


---------87:30----------
but i think that there's a


---------87:31----------
potential for a different way to look at


---------87:33----------
it which is that when you start to say


---------87:35----------
i'm vilified no matter what it starts to


---------87:37----------
discount


---------87:38----------
who you actually are right you're saying


---------87:41----------
that the


---------87:41----------
the the connection between who i am and


---------87:44----------
how the world treats me


---------87:45----------
is completely independent and so the the


---------87:49----------
tricky thing there is if you start to


---------87:50----------
believe that about yourself


---------87:52----------
then in a weird way you start to become


---------87:56----------
you start to lack power over


---------88:01----------
into them and they chose to hate you


---------88:03----------
anyway so that got drilled into your


---------88:05----------
whole


---------88:06----------
your head and then you have that belief


---------88:08----------
that's swimming around which is like


---------88:11----------
you know like people don't


---------88:14----------
like me and i'm vilified no matter what


---------88:18----------
and the last thing that i want to kind


---------88:20----------
of point out here is that when you say


---------88:21----------
i'm vilified no matter what and you say


---------88:23----------
and i ask you


---------88:24----------
how do you feel about that you say it's


---------88:26----------
kind of funny


---------88:28----------
right if you really stop and think about


---------88:30----------
it like that's not funny at all


---------88:33----------
like if i if i am talking to a kid and


---------88:36----------
the kid says no matter what i do


---------88:37----------
my parents like hit me


---------88:40----------
i can't make them happy like that's not


---------88:42----------
funny


---------88:44----------
being vilified no matter what you do


---------88:46----------
like being i know you've like donated


---------88:49----------
and supported a bunch of streamers


---------88:50----------
you try to support your community you're


---------88:53----------
super authentic


---------88:54----------
like i think you're genuinely a good guy


---------88:57----------
and


---------88:57----------
and for you to be treated like that is


---------88:59----------
not funny


---------89:02----------
and and we kind of we kind of even hear


---------89:04----------
like how that happens because then you


---------89:05----------
say


---------89:06----------
i've adapted to it right i thrive off of


---------89:08----------
it


---------89:09----------
i've adapted to being hated it's fuel


---------89:11----------
for me


---------89:12----------
and you start to feel uncomfortable


---------89:15----------
when people like start to respect you


---------89:18----------
and and and that's where we get into


---------89:20----------
really


---------89:20----------
tricky territory because this is where


---------89:22----------
sometimes a hypothesis


---------89:24----------
could emerge here and one is that it


---------89:26----------
reminds me of something called the


---------89:28----------
repetition compulsion


---------89:29----------
which is like this idea that we tend to


---------89:31----------
like repeat things that are even kind of


---------89:34----------
bad for us


---------89:35----------
because we have this compulsion to do


---------89:38----------
something


---------89:38----------
over and over and over again and


---------89:42----------
what that means is that i i really


---------89:45----------
wonder actually whether you self


---------89:46----------
sabotage


---------89:48----------
and what you're kind of saying is that


---------89:49----------
like you know i felt really good after


---------89:51----------
doing this


---------89:52----------
this like fundraiser and you feel good


---------89:54----------
about yourself and then two days later


---------89:55----------
and then i ask you what happens after


---------89:57----------
that


---------89:57----------
and your response is i start to say


---------89:59----------
stupid stuff but i think in a weird way


---------90:01----------
i wonder whether what's going on is like


---------90:03----------
it's uncomfortable territory for you and


---------90:05----------
like


---------90:06----------
you're way more comfortable being hated


---------90:08----------
and we'll get to


---------90:09----------
why that is and we even said that right


---------90:11----------
like you said that like the


---------90:12----------
the hate fuels me and you kind of say


---------90:15----------
that if we listen to the narrative what


---------90:16----------
your narrative is is like


---------90:18----------
being hated has been my source of


---------90:20----------
triumph it's how i grew as a person


---------90:22----------
it's how i understand who i was it's how


---------90:25----------
i like learned strength


---------90:27----------
and like what my true value is it's also


---------90:29----------
how you support


---------90:30----------
other people because your message to


---------90:31----------
other people is that if life is not


---------90:33----------
treating you well and people aren't


---------90:34----------
treating you well


---------90:35----------
you can grow past that it's become such


---------90:37----------
a core aspect of who you are


---------90:39----------
to be hated and that your strength comes


---------90:42----------
from being hated


---------90:43----------
which begs a very important question


---------90:45----------
which we'll get to later which is like


---------90:47----------
what happens if you're not hated and


---------90:49----------
this is where i'm gonna give you a


---------90:51----------
little


---------90:51----------
spoiler right so like what is the one


---------90:54----------
thing train that i've said to you that


---------90:57----------
you have not liked


---------91:02----------
that you pity me absolutely


---------91:05----------
right and it's kind of weird because


---------91:07----------
like like why do i pity you like pity


---------91:10----------
that that comes from compassion it comes


---------91:11----------
from like


---------91:12----------
holy [ __ ] man do you just realize like


---------91:14----------
what your life is like


---------91:16----------
how is pity not an appropriate or fair


---------91:19----------
response


---------91:20----------
and i think the reason you hate it so


---------91:22----------
much is because like that it's a


---------91:24----------
different narrative


---------91:26----------
because if we respond to you with


---------91:28----------
compassion


---------91:30----------
then like this person that you become


---------91:34----------
comes tumbling down because this person


---------91:37----------
was born of hate


---------91:38----------
it's strength through adversity it's


---------91:40----------
triumph and you absolutely have man


---------91:42----------
don't get me wrong i'm with you 100


---------91:44----------
i think it's amazing what you've


---------91:45----------
accomplished because you could have


---------91:46----------
gotten turned into like a little piece


---------91:49----------
of nothing


---------91:50----------
you could have gotten bulldozed by the


---------91:52----------
world but you didn't


---------91:53----------
let that happen and the hate became part


---------91:56----------
of your fuel it became part of your


---------91:57----------
strength


---------91:59----------
and so if i try to be compassionate


---------92:01----------
towards you if i try to pity which like


---------92:03----------
frankly bro i mean come on like what do


---------92:05----------
you expect man


---------92:06----------
you don't think that you deserved pity


---------92:09----------
you don't think that you people didn't


---------92:11----------
mistreat you and of course you do and


---------92:13----------
this is why


---------92:13----------
i think these things can exist in


---------92:15----------
parallel


---------92:17----------
but i think it's challenging because if


---------92:18----------
i pity you then


---------92:20----------
the adaptation that you've created for


---------92:22----------
yourself doesn't hold anymore


---------92:25----------
and now it becomes really really


---------92:27----------
dangerous territory


---------92:29----------
and one of the things that just pops


---------92:31----------
into my head is like


---------92:32----------
what would have happened to you if you


---------92:35----------
were 15 and one person came up to you


---------92:37----------
and maybe this did happen


---------92:38----------
and we can explore that down the road


---------92:40----------
but it's just kind of a hypothesis i


---------92:42----------
still have other things i want to say


---------92:43----------
if one person came up to you and be like


---------92:45----------
man it's really shitty how other people


---------92:47----------
are treating you


---------92:49----------
you don't deserve to be treated this way


---------92:52----------
it's not your fault


---------92:53----------
i would take care of them to the end of


---------92:55----------
time to me that to me that's


---------92:57----------
to me that's loyalty and that's that's


---------92:59----------
just like decent that's being good


---------93:03----------
you say that right and if i but if i say


---------93:06----------
that to you if i say train you didn't


---------93:08----------
deserve that


---------93:10----------
i'm sorry this happened to you what's


---------93:11----------
your response to that


---------93:16----------
i would say i appreciate it but it's not


---------93:18----------
a big deal i got through it


---------93:20----------
exactly right so like that's what i'm


---------93:21----------
saying i i ask you hypothetically if


---------93:23----------
this had happened you say one thing


---------93:25----------
and then i actually say it to you and


---------93:27----------
your response is something else


---------93:29----------
do you see that


---------93:32----------
yes and it's really strange right like


---------93:35----------
it's like


---------93:36----------
like you expect one thing to happen but


---------93:38----------
you don't actually respond that way


---------93:40----------
you don't actually respond that way to


---------93:42----------
compassion


---------93:43----------
i mean you have because i think that's


---------93:45----------
why you treasure hafu so much is because


---------93:47----------
she said something to you that was


---------93:48----------
incredibly validating right


---------93:50----------
she said they treat you this way because


---------93:52----------
of what you like you know so


---------93:54----------
so we'll get we'll get there i think


---------93:56----------
it's just something we can explore down


---------93:57----------
the road


---------93:58----------
yep um


---------94:02----------
yeah i mean i i think that


---------94:08----------
yeah so like the other thing is that i


---------94:10----------
think we as twitch


---------94:11----------
we actually propagate a lot of this


---------94:14----------
stuff


---------94:14----------
in a way that is not good for you and


---------94:17----------
the best example that i can think of is


---------94:19----------
when you went to the bathroom


---------94:21----------
boy did we have a field day with it


---------94:24----------
right and i i think it's it's


---------94:26----------
interesting because you've become such a


---------94:28----------
strong person and you've learned how to


---------94:29----------
laugh it off


---------94:31----------
but i still think that like you know i


---------94:34----------
we're [ __ ] toxic to you man


---------94:38----------
right and that's not okay even though


---------94:41----------
you laugh it off like


---------94:42----------
when you go into the bathroom and people


---------94:44----------
make start making jokes about you


---------94:45----------
snorting lines of coke like


---------94:47----------
we all laugh about it right and it's


---------94:49----------
okay but i think on some level


---------94:51----------
that hurts on some level that hurts


---------94:54----------
you've just learned how to deal with


---------94:55----------
that hurt so well


---------94:57----------
and in fact as you've said you use that


---------94:59----------
hatred as fuel you use that hurt as fuel


---------95:01----------
and i know you're okay with it because


---------95:03----------
you joke about it but i think on


---------95:04----------
some level no you're right on some so


---------95:08----------
because i've started banning it recently


---------95:10----------
so i'm


---------95:12----------
if you're joking about it i'm cool with


---------95:15----------
the joke


---------95:16----------
the problem is there are people now that


---------95:19----------
they're using it as something to devalue


---------95:23----------
the work i put in right so those are the


---------95:25----------
people i'm trying to get away from so


---------95:27----------
like


---------95:27----------
if you use it as an inside joke within


---------95:29----------
the community i'm cool with it i


---------95:30----------
understand it you know it's funny i'm


---------95:32----------
going in the back you know every second


---------95:34----------
i'm coming back doing long streams it's


---------95:35----------
funny the problem is there are people


---------95:37----------
that are now


---------95:38----------
using it to devalue the work i put in


---------95:42----------
or devalue a lot of different things


---------95:44----------
that i do


---------95:46----------
and at the end of the day i know deep


---------95:48----------
down they know i'm not doing it but it's


---------95:50----------
what they


---------95:50----------
it's all they have to grab onto


---------95:53----------
that's negative at that moment they do


---------95:56----------
those are the people i try to get out of


---------95:57----------
the community i banned them from


---------95:58----------
misusing it does that make sense


---------96:00----------
i think that makes a lot of sense and i


---------96:01----------
still think that on some level


---------96:05----------
even the the more benign jokes


---------96:09----------
even if it's not intended to like hurt


---------96:12----------
and we're saying it all in good fun and


---------96:14----------
we take that cue from you


---------96:16----------
i think that you think things that are


---------96:18----------
like objectively painful


---------96:20----------
are kind of funny and i think that like


---------96:23----------
we need to be more careful and i'm


---------96:24----------
certainly going to be more careful


---------96:26----------
about joining in when you're


---------96:28----------
self-deprecating


---------96:31----------
right and if you really stop and think


---------96:33----------
about it and this happens a lot where


---------96:34----------
like


---------96:35----------
you put yourself down and then everyone


---------96:36----------
else puts you down too and then like you


---------96:38----------
guys all have a good laugh about it


---------96:40----------
and it feels protective but it at the


---------96:43----------
core of that


---------96:44----------
is like a tiny insecurity that people


---------96:46----------
are reinforcing


---------96:48----------
right it's kind of like if you're the


---------96:50----------
fat kid in the group and then everyone's


---------96:52----------
like oh ho ho this person is the fat kid


---------96:55----------
right and you're like ha ha because like


---------96:56----------
that's how we learn how to adapt right


---------96:58----------
we're like


---------96:58----------
if you can't beat them join them and


---------97:01----------
then you join them


---------97:03----------
in making fun of yourself and then like


---------97:04----------
you're still making fun of yourself but


---------97:06----------
you're not alone anymore right


---------97:07----------
at least you've got a team you guys are


---------97:09----------
all joking about something together


---------97:11----------
and that can feel really good it can


---------97:12----------
feel like you're not isolated anymore


---------97:14----------
it's why this dynamic happens all the


---------97:15----------
time


---------97:16----------
but at this end of the day there's still


---------97:18----------
a group of people yourself included


---------97:20----------
who are like making fun of you for being


---------97:22----------
fat


---------97:24----------
right on some level i really


---------97:28----------
hypothesize that there's something there


---------97:31----------
that's actually like we're bullying you


---------97:32----------
and you're


---------97:33----------
giving us permission to and there's


---------97:35----------
something about that that when i really


---------97:36----------
stop and think about it like i think


---------97:38----------
that needs to change


---------97:40----------
and can i can i just keep going


---------97:43----------
yes okay so the other thing that i want


---------97:46----------
to get to is like this this thing when


---------97:48----------
you punched someone


---------97:49----------
and then you suddenly became popular


---------97:51----------
right like you were crying in the


---------97:52----------
bathroom every day and then you punch


---------97:54----------
this kid and then suddenly you're the


---------97:55----------
hottest [ __ ] in the world


---------97:56----------
and like you rode that you took


---------97:58----------
advantage of it but i think that


---------97:59----------
actually sends a really dangerous


---------98:01----------
message which goes back to


---------98:02----------
i'm vilified no matter what because then


---------98:04----------
you realize it's the same [ __ ]


---------98:06----------
message which is that


---------98:07----------
who i am as a person does not determine


---------98:10----------
how other people treat me


---------98:12----------
i'm vilified no matter what and i'm


---------98:13----------
respected for all the wrong reasons


---------98:15----------
both of them are very dangerous messages


---------98:17----------
one on with one you're on top and with


---------98:19----------
one you're on bottom


---------98:20----------
and one of them seems really positive


---------98:22----------
and one of them feels really toxic


---------98:24----------
i think they're both equally bad because


---------98:26----------
what


---------98:27----------
what that reinforced for you is that


---------98:29----------
respect


---------98:30----------
does not come from your actions


---------98:34----------
it doesn't come from your intentions it


---------98:36----------
doesn't come from what you do


---------98:38----------
it just comes from random ass [ __ ] and


---------98:41----------
hatred also comes from random ass [ __ ]


---------98:43----------
that is outside of my control


---------98:46----------
and so i think that's a dangerous mask


---------98:49----------
to reinforce


---------98:50----------
it's a dangerous world for you to have


---------98:54----------
i agreed and then


---------98:57----------
you know you kind of keep on talking


---------98:59----------
about like it happens all over like in


---------99:00----------
the ninth grade


---------99:01----------
and then like later on and with ethan or


---------99:04----------
whatever and so i think like these


---------99:05----------
themes about


---------99:06----------
you know who you are and how other


---------99:08----------
people appreciate you or how other


---------99:10----------
people treat you and who you truly are


---------99:13----------
there's like a fundamental disconnect


---------99:15----------
there


---------99:16----------
um and


---------99:19----------
and i think it puts you in a really


---------99:21----------
tricky spot because at this point like i


---------99:23----------
don't think you can take the mask off


---------99:25----------
i don't think you can stop being


---------99:27----------
adaptive in this way because


---------99:29----------
because like the the converse of it is


---------99:31----------
like terrifying


---------99:33----------
and i'm telling you train and i know


---------99:34----------
this is gonna be triggering for you but


---------99:36----------
like


---------99:36----------
i'm telling you like you deserve pity


---------99:38----------
man like what the [ __ ]


---------99:40----------
listen just think about the story that


---------99:42----------
you've told us


---------99:44----------
and imagine that someone in your view


---------99:46----------
you do these things you do these streams


---------99:47----------
where like your viewers call in


---------99:49----------
right and like they tell you and you try


---------99:51----------
to help them through their problems


---------99:52----------
and if anyone had told you this story


---------99:57----------
you would respond to them with


---------99:58----------
compassion and pity


---------100:02----------
but you'll be damned if anyone responds


---------100:04----------
to you that way


---------100:05----------
which goes back to narcissism because


---------100:09----------
you're different and this is really


---------100:12----------
interesting because


---------100:13----------
i think these things exist in parallel i


---------100:15----------
don't think they're actually like in


---------100:16----------
conflict


---------100:17----------
you recognize that you are a normal


---------100:19----------
person


---------100:20----------
and you believe that to the core of your


---------100:22----------
being you [ __ ] just like everyone else


---------100:23----------
you eat just like everyone else you have


---------100:26----------
good days and you have bad days just


---------100:28----------
like


---------100:28----------
everyone else but then parallel to that


---------100:32----------
is this overwhelming story that you have


---------100:36----------
in your mind that you're


---------100:37----------
not like everyone else and you have so


---------100:40----------
much evidence for that when other people


---------100:42----------
when someone looks at someone else and


---------100:45----------
it's the soda popping story right like


---------100:48----------
they get the benefit of the doubt but


---------100:49----------
you don't get the benefit of that you


---------100:50----------
got the sloping forehead they called you


---------100:52----------
t-rex


---------100:53----------
you know [ __ ] doctor told you to get


---------100:54----------
surgery on your forehead


---------100:56----------
and how can you say that you're like


---------100:58----------
everyone else because your entire life


---------101:00----------
you've been told


---------101:01----------
that you're different you've been judged


---------101:03----------
for being different


---------101:05----------
you've been judged for [ __ ] that you did


---------101:06----------
not do you've been judged unfairly


---------101:09----------
and how can you say like we are like


---------101:11----------
everyone else


---------101:13----------
and you tell us over and over and over


---------101:14----------
again that i'm different


---------101:19----------
right and like like so it's weird


---------101:21----------
because those


---------101:22----------
two things exist in in parallel as well


---------101:27----------
and and can i keep going


---------101:31----------
we good yeah okay please yeah so like


---------101:33----------
like then there's just a couple of other


---------101:35----------
just kind of random thoughts right like


---------101:38----------
at the height of the emotional bullying


---------101:40----------
you said i i


---------101:42----------
like when you were kind of talking about


---------101:44----------
it and you said like i was an idiot


---------101:45----------
right like when people were treating you


---------101:48----------
so bad you say i was an idiot i was dumb


---------101:51----------
and i was nice to them


---------101:52----------
and it was confusing to them and that's


---------101:55----------
that sort of like really rubs me the


---------101:56----------
wrong way because


---------101:58----------
i i don't doubt that on some level it's


---------102:00----------
stupid but like


---------102:01----------
i think there's something really


---------102:02----------
self-deprecating about


---------102:05----------
calling yourself an idiot when people


---------102:08----------
are being


---------102:09----------
vitriolic towards you you're saying i


---------102:12----------
was dumb because i was nice to them like


---------102:14----------
i think i don't think that was dumb i


---------102:15----------
think that's like


---------102:16----------
that's you your true character shining


---------102:18----------
through


---------102:20----------
and it's so devastating because this is


---------102:23----------
a time in your life where people are


---------102:24----------
treating you badly and you're like the


---------102:26----------
essence of like turning the other


---------102:28----------
cheek and trying to be nice to them and


---------102:30----------
trying to be like a good person and you


---------102:31----------
get punished for it


---------102:32----------
and holy [ __ ] what does that tell you


---------102:34----------
about goodness in the world


---------102:37----------
right it paints a really bleak picture


---------102:40----------
that you were nice to your abuser


---------102:42----------
and like that sounds like a [ __ ]


---------102:44----------
abusive relationship right where it's


---------102:45----------
like


---------102:46----------
you know someone abuses you and you're


---------102:48----------
like oh i'm so sorry like let me bake


---------102:49----------
you a cake


---------102:51----------
and and i think this is going to be hard


---------102:53----------
for you to hear because you don't


---------102:54----------
that's too victim card right like you


---------102:57----------
don't want to own


---------102:58----------
that you were a victim like you want to


---------103:00----------
own that you were a victim and you've


---------103:02----------
risen above it but you don't want anyone


---------103:04----------
spitting


---------103:06----------
and i i think that like this is really


---------103:08----------
tricky because like i think there's a


---------103:09----------
nuance here where


---------103:11----------
i wish you lived in a world train where


---------103:13----------
i could pity you


---------103:14----------
and still respect you and i think that's


---------103:16----------
what it comes down to


---------103:20----------
that i can pity you and i actually


---------103:21----------
respect you all the more because of what


---------103:24----------
happened


---------103:26----------
but don't take away my right to be


---------103:29----------
compassionate because you've been hurt


---------103:31----------
and that you didn't deserve it and that


---------103:35----------
the world does treat you differently and


---------103:37----------
that's


---------103:38----------
that's what's so [ __ ] heartbreaking


---------103:40----------
man is because


---------103:42----------
on the inside you're exactly the same as


---------103:45----------
everyone else and you keep telling us


---------103:46----------
that


---------103:47----------
over and over and over again and on the


---------103:49----------
outside


---------103:50----------
no one treats you like everyone else


---------103:54----------
your voice your stature and what is it


---------103:57----------
like to live a life where you


---------103:59----------
are like everyone else but no one treats


---------104:02----------
you like everyone else


---------104:05----------
where you're vilified no matter what


---------104:06----------
like if that doesn't deserve


---------104:09----------
pity and if that isn't heartbreaking and


---------104:11----------
if that isn't soul crushing i don't know


---------104:13----------
what is


---------104:20----------
and so this is where i i think the last


---------104:22----------
thing i've got like just one or two


---------104:23----------
other thoughts and one is like


---------104:24----------
this whole thing about devaluing pity


---------104:26----------
and you're like i don't want you all to


---------104:27----------
throw me a pity party and i was like bro


---------104:29----------
that's exactly what you deserve


---------104:30----------
if anyone on this earth deserves a pity


---------104:32----------
party it's you


---------104:35----------
right and like i wish you could


---------104:39----------
get to the point where like you could


---------104:41----------
understand that you deserve


---------104:43----------
pity and you deserve people saying like


---------104:46----------
man that sucks for you


---------104:48----------
that like even earlier i asked you like


---------104:49----------
what would you have said back then if


---------104:51----------
someone said you don't deserve this


---------104:52----------
you've been like i would attract to that


---------104:53----------
person forever and then when i say it


---------104:54----------
you're like i'm insulted


---------104:57----------
right that i mean it's it's like apples


---------104:59----------
and oranges because you won't


---------105:00----------
let us you won't let us say that to you


---------105:03----------
you reject it from us you don't want us


---------105:06----------
to throw a pity party


---------105:08----------
but this is the thing i i i want you to


---------105:10----------
understand this if you can


---------105:12----------
that if we throw you a pity party it


---------105:15----------
doesn't mean that


---------105:17----------
you we're devaluing any of your


---------105:19----------
accomplishments i think it's like


---------105:20----------
i think both of those can exist right we


---------105:22----------
can say train like


---------105:24----------
i mean you were [ __ ] bullied your


---------105:26----------
entire [ __ ] life


---------105:28----------
right and you had a lot of you have a


---------105:30----------
lot of things to be grateful for in life


---------105:31----------
you had really supportive parents you


---------105:32----------
had really awesome parents


---------105:34----------
right you can really like have a


---------105:35----------
supportive community and twitch loves


---------105:37----------
you


---------105:37----------
and at the same time like we can also


---------105:39----------
hold these two


---------105:41----------
contrary truths because you hold them in


---------105:43----------
yourself every day


---------105:45----------
that you're confident and you're


---------105:46----------
insecure you're genuinely confident


---------105:48----------
and you're a pile of insecurities and so


---------105:51----------
what i'd love for you to do is to


---------105:52----------
actually just be confident


---------105:55----------
to let go of those insecurities and i


---------105:57----------
think the reason you can't let go of


---------105:59----------
those insecurities


---------106:00----------
is because you've built a narrative of


---------106:02----------
yourself of like triumph


---------106:04----------
and hate is what propels me forward so


---------106:06----------
like you can't


---------106:08----------
get anything from us except for hate


---------106:10----------
because it's terrifying because if we


---------106:12----------
stop hating you then where does your


---------106:13----------
fuel come from where does your strength


---------106:15----------
come from


---------106:16----------
where does your triumph come from and


---------106:18----------
that's why you hate being pity because


---------106:20----------
we like


---------106:21----------
if we turn that hate into love then your


---------106:24----------
adaptive strategy in life gets no fuel


---------106:29----------
and where this becomes maladaptive is


---------106:32----------
that if you


---------106:33----------
propagate that hatred by saying an


---------106:36----------
off-color thing or things like that


---------106:38----------
and i think you really struggle with


---------106:39----------
this and we'll see maybe this is where


---------106:41----------
i'm really


---------106:42----------
walking on shaky ground is that like


---------106:45----------
that's your fuel right so i think on


---------106:47----------
some level you probably do some things


---------106:48----------
to self-sabotage


---------106:50----------
because that's what we do when we build


---------106:51----------
up adaptive mechanisms early in life


---------106:54----------
and we figure out okay hatred fuels me


---------106:56----------
like how on earth just think about that


---------106:58----------
completely hypothetically for a second


---------107:00----------
if i tell you train there's a guy


---------107:02----------
whose triumph and success and strength


---------107:05----------
and self-worth are born of hatred of


---------107:07----------
other people


---------107:08----------
do you think that person is going to do


---------107:10----------
something to evoke hatred


---------107:15----------
it's interesting possibly yeah because


---------107:17----------
that's how you fill up your gas tank


---------107:19----------
and i think if we think about moving


---------107:21----------
forward for you


---------107:23----------
right so i get that this is all a house


---------107:24----------
of cards that i'm building right so it


---------107:26----------
could be all [ __ ] wrong


---------107:27----------
so i accept that but if i think about


---------107:29----------
moving forward to you


---------107:30----------
for you i think that you've got to


---------107:32----------
understand that like some of these


---------107:34----------
conceptions that you have for the world


---------107:36----------
were absolutely what you needed to


---------107:38----------
survive


---------107:39----------
absolutely put you where you are today


---------107:44----------
and you can let them go what i


---------107:48----------
imagine is that when you were when you


---------107:50----------
went into middle school


---------107:52----------
you reached a river


---------107:55----------
and then you built this raft and you


---------107:57----------
used the raft to cross the river


---------108:00----------
and then you looked at yourself and you


---------108:02----------
said you know what without


---------108:04----------
that raft i would have never crossed


---------108:05----------
this river so now that you're on the


---------108:07----------
other bank you pick up the raft you put


---------108:08----------
it above your head and you start walking


---------108:12----------
and then people like train why are you


---------108:13----------
carrying that raft around and you're


---------108:14----------
like without the raft i would have never


---------108:16----------
crossed the river and it's like


---------108:17----------
yeah man but you've crossed the river


---------108:19----------
you don't need it anymore


---------108:21----------
you don't need to have your strength be


---------108:23----------
fueled by hatred of other people


---------108:25----------
because you have intrinsic value that is


---------108:27----------
so much more than that


---------108:29----------
you don't need their hate anymore


---------108:32----------
you've grown past it you just don't need


---------108:36----------
it like you're amazing because of who


---------108:38----------
you are


---------108:39----------
your strength may be born of hatred or


---------108:42----------
been fueled by hatred but now


---------108:44----------
that adaptation has become maladaptive


---------108:48----------
and i i don't know i don't know if you


---------108:50----------
self-sabotage yourself but like this is


---------108:52----------
the kind of thing


---------108:53----------
that leads to self-sabotage


---------108:54----------
hypothetically this is what i've seen


---------108:57----------
that you start to build a narrative


---------108:58----------
about yourself that is


---------109:00----------
positive and protective in so many ways


---------109:02----------
but is built on a foundation of


---------109:04----------
rot and you just think about i don't


---------109:08----------
know if you have kids or not but like


---------109:09----------
you think about your parents or you


---------109:11----------
think about the kids that you're gonna


---------109:12----------
have one day or the kids that you


---------109:13----------
already have


---------109:14----------
i don't know and do you like what would


---------109:17----------
your dad say or what would your mom say


---------109:20----------
if you said you know i need hatred to


---------109:23----------
succeed


---------109:26----------
and would they want that kind of life


---------109:29----------
because here's the crazy thing train


---------109:31----------
here's the crazy thing


---------109:33----------
i think that your strength is not born


---------109:36----------
of hatred


---------109:37----------
i think your strength is just you baby


---------109:39----------
it's just you


---------109:42----------
and it's not that the hatred is where


---------109:44----------
your strength comes from


---------109:46----------
it's that you're so [ __ ] strong and


---------109:48----------
hatred was so ubiquitous


---------109:50----------
for such a long part of your life that


---------109:53----------
you started to tie those two things


---------109:54----------
together


---------109:57----------
you got bullied over and over and over


---------110:00----------
again


---------110:00----------
and you rose above it and so then you


---------110:02----------
look back and you say without hatred i


---------110:04----------
would be nother


---------110:05----------
whereas i say you were something before


---------110:07----------
that hatred and the hatred tried to


---------110:09----------
knock you down and it failed


---------110:13----------
and i think the more that you start to


---------110:15----------
think in that way the more you realize


---------110:16----------
you don't need hatred


---------110:17----------
you don't need to be provocative and i


---------110:19----------
think i you know that right and like


---------110:20----------
this is the weird thing is that


---------110:22----------
the crazy thing is that you have within


---------110:25----------
you


---------110:25----------
two trains right one is the train that


---------110:28----------
we all see


---------110:30----------
and one is the train who walked into the


---------110:32----------
sixth grade


---------110:34----------
with your shoes and your glasses and


---------110:35----------
whatnot that


---------110:37----------
kid you carry that kid with you and


---------110:39----------
that's your insecurity


---------110:42----------
the kid who walked up to your friend and


---------110:44----------
said hey can i eat lunch with you he's


---------110:46----------
like you don't get to eat lunch with us


---------110:48----------
when you look at your an image of


---------110:50----------
yourself and you see false confidence


---------110:52----------
that's the kid who's who gives you that


---------110:54----------
impression


---------110:56----------
i don't see false confidence i see real


---------110:58----------
confidence


---------111:03----------
that's the kid that i protect yeah does


---------111:06----------
that make sense


---------111:07----------
absolutely that's the kid that i have to


---------111:09----------
be strong for right


---------111:11----------
so it doesn't happen to other does that


---------111:13----------
mean so like i am


---------111:14----------
i see myself as a i don't know


---------111:18----------
so here's the problem train when you


---------111:21----------
protect that kid


---------111:22----------
that kid can never get confident in


---------111:24----------
themselves


---------111:29----------
yeah you fight that battle for that kid


---------111:31----------
you've got to stop protecting that kid


---------111:33----------
that kid is stronger than you think


---------111:38----------
but you never give him a chance that's


---------111:40----------
what i'm saying


---------111:41----------
you think you have to protect that kid


---------111:43----------
is the source of your strength man it's


---------111:44----------
not hatred


---------111:45----------
he's the one who's been strong from the


---------111:47----------
beginning


---------111:49----------
and the only problem is that kid doesn't


---------111:51----------
know that he doesn't need your help


---------111:53----------
because you never give him a chance to


---------111:55----------
like explore it you never let him play


---------111:57----------
on the field so he never realizes what


---------111:59----------
he's good at


---------112:00----------
all he sees is himself is that i'm the


---------112:02----------
kid who's in the bathroom


---------112:03----------
bathroom and i've got train the guy who


---------112:06----------
broke that guy's nose


---------112:07----------
he's going to protect me and you're both


---------112:09----------
of those people


---------112:12----------
but he's stronger than you no because


---------112:13----------
he's [ __ ] you


---------112:16----------
those are the same kid yep


---------112:20----------
you don't need to protect him he doesn't


---------112:21----------
need your protection


---------112:27----------
i know it's weird that's what i've got


---------112:34----------
yeah that was about yeah


---------112:38----------
yeah yes yes


---------112:42----------
yeah yeah yeah i mean


---------112:47----------
it's yeah you know


---------112:55----------
it's it's not that i don't think the kid


---------112:58----------
that kid is weak it's that


---------113:04----------
i know i was that kid and i know what i


---------113:07----------
went through


---------113:08----------
to get to who i am today


---------113:14----------
and it's not that i use hate as fuel


---------113:16----------
it's that i know how to


---------113:18----------
transfer it into positivity


---------113:21----------
because of the love my parents gave me


---------113:23----------
so i got so even though


---------113:25----------
when i was bullied i was loved equally


---------113:28----------
or greater by my parents at home


---------113:30----------
without their love i would probably


---------113:34----------
become some sort of [ __ ] serial


---------113:35----------
killer by now with how much i was pushed


---------113:37----------
around right


---------113:37----------
so it's their love that that's why you


---------113:41----------
s that's why you see so many parallels


---------113:42----------
that are completely contradictory to


---------113:44----------
each other


---------113:44----------
it's because at home my parents gave me


---------113:46----------
everything


---------113:49----------
that they could every like they gave me


---------113:51----------
love greater than love itself


---------113:53----------
and then at school i got


---------113:56----------
the darkest of hate so


---------113:59----------
that's where the two sides built up


---------114:01----------
these two polarizing sides where i saw


---------114:04----------
society for what it was in that moment


---------114:07----------
and i saw what controlled it what


---------114:09----------
manipulated it one punch


---------114:11----------
suddenly i'm the greatest human being


---------114:12----------
and any any deed i do


---------114:15----------
is seen as you know the hero the hero we


---------114:18----------
need


---------114:19----------
but before i could do the greatest of


---------114:21----------
things and i'm a [ __ ] loser


---------114:24----------
but because i punch what the right kid


---------114:26----------
in the nose i am the hero we need i am


---------114:28----------
for the people


---------114:29----------
and that is just the most disgusting way


---------114:33----------
and it just that's just the way i see


---------114:36----------
that today


---------114:37----------
still though today to this very day that


---------114:40----------
is


---------114:40----------
how i see society work that is how i see


---------114:42----------
the general public accept


---------114:44----------
different people and it makes


---------114:47----------
no sense to me so it's not the fact that


---------114:49----------
i'm carrying this around


---------114:51----------
for no reason everything that happened


---------114:54----------
to me in that day


---------114:55----------
in those days it's not that it's still


---------114:58----------
happening to me it changes that i


---------115:00----------
see that it's that's how people are


---------115:01----------
operating train train bro


---------115:03----------
right exactly so let me let me just


---------115:05----------
repeat to you what you said


---------115:07----------
it's not that i'm carrying it around for


---------115:09----------
no reason


---------115:10----------
you're damn right and that's why it's


---------115:12----------
hard to put it down


---------115:14----------
because you have a really good reason


---------115:18----------
you learned a lot about the world and


---------115:20----------
that's why it's hard to move let it go


---------115:24----------
right because you have like i s like


---------115:25----------
that's it man and i i don't know how


---------115:28----------
like


---------115:28----------
i think your your conception of yourself


---------115:30----------
is perfect like you're right


---------115:32----------
i think you you saw


---------115:35----------
unconditional love on one side and


---------115:37----------
unconditional hate on the other


---------115:39----------
and those were polar opposites and i


---------115:42----------
think what you've got to do is like


---------115:43----------
learn to integrate and very simply


---------115:46----------
very simply train you could say whatever


---------115:48----------
you want to you can hypothesize


---------115:49----------
psychoanalyze whatever


---------115:51----------
at the end of the day if you cannot


---------115:53----------
accept the pity and compassion of


---------115:54----------
another person


---------115:55----------
that's a problem


---------116:00----------
i i can't accept it under one thing


---------116:03----------
though


---------116:04----------
i and this could be crazy but i don't


---------116:07----------
think it is


---------116:08----------
i i can accept pity and compassion


---------116:11----------
if it's coming from someone that


---------116:13----------
understands but if i'm just accepting


---------116:15----------
pitting compassion for the sake of it


---------116:16----------
being the right thing to do


---------116:18----------
but there was no understanding i i find


---------116:20----------
that as


---------116:22----------
a cheap pity it's something that it's


---------116:24----------
it's not going to


---------116:26----------
the only way we fix what's going on is


---------116:29----------
through understanding what's going on so


---------116:30----------
if you want to have pity because you


---------116:32----------
understand what's going on


---------116:33----------
and that pity is coming from a place of


---------116:35----------
meaning


---------116:36----------
then i will accept that and i will be


---------116:38----------
very happy and i'll i'll take care of


---------116:39----------
you right because


---------116:40----------
that's that's very meaningful to me i've


---------116:42----------
never felt like i've ever deserved it


---------116:44----------
but if you see that and you feel that


---------116:45----------
then i appreciate that


---------116:46----------
but if it's just this you know i feel


---------116:49----------
like pity these days is like a [ __ ]


---------116:50----------
birthday card


---------116:51----------
right it's like no one actually means


---------116:53----------
the happy birthday man like hey


---------116:55----------
i'm happy you're here no one means that


---------116:56----------
it's just a happy birthday bro


---------116:58----------
i mean it's just like a thing that


---------116:59----------
you've been you know a programmed to say


---------117:02----------
every birthday regardless of if you even


---------117:03----------
know the [ __ ]


---------117:04----------
individual right there's a difference


---------117:06----------
between meaning it understanding it


---------117:08----------
being about it


---------117:09----------
than just saying it because you're


---------117:10----------
programmed to say because society's


---------117:11----------
programmed you to do it right


---------117:12----------
so it's that pity that i don't accept


---------117:14----------
because i know


---------117:15----------
they don't truly care or understand


---------117:19----------
what they mean when they're saying they


---------117:20----------
pity me for what's going on


---------117:22----------
right and it's that i don't want to


---------117:24----------
encourage or perpetuate that because


---------117:25----------
that is the


---------117:26----------
very problem that led me to be where i


---------117:27----------
am yeah yeah makes perfect sense so so


---------117:30----------
now we're going on to dangerous


---------117:31----------
territory and by dangerous territory


---------117:33----------
what i mean is that


---------117:34----------
i think we're quickly reaching the point


---------117:36----------
where the problem is subtle


---------117:39----------
and i'm going to amplify it but i don't


---------117:42----------
think it's a big problem


---------117:43----------
or arguably it is okay so like does that


---------117:45----------
make sense like


---------117:46----------
i'm going to make a mountain out of a


---------117:48----------
molehill here but i'm going to do it on


---------117:49----------
purpose


---------117:50----------
go ahead so the problem is that you got


---------117:52----------
to just really pay attention okay


---------117:54----------
because when you say


---------117:55----------
i can accept pity from someone who


---------117:56----------
understands makes perfect sense i'm with


---------117:58----------
you right


---------117:59----------
what's wrong with that that there's a


---------118:01----------
lot of false pity in the world and that


---------118:02----------
everything is like birthday cards


---------118:04----------
instead of like authentic it's like sort


---------118:06----------
of you know


---------118:08----------
virtue signaling kind of stuff i'm with


---------118:10----------
you there too


---------118:12----------
now why is this a problem for you it's a


---------118:15----------
problem because you got to remember


---------118:17----------
that like the


---------118:20----------
in your mind there's a fundamental


---------118:23----------
disconnect


---------118:24----------
between how the world perceives you and


---------118:27----------
how


---------118:28----------
you feel you are and you believe that


---------118:32----------
the world


---------118:32----------
fundamentally misperceives you and that


---------118:35----------
you're vilified no matter what


---------118:38----------
and some first impression yes and so the


---------118:40----------
real


---------118:41----------
challenge there is that coming from such


---------118:44----------
a skeptical


---------118:46----------
it's been drilled into you i love that


---------118:48----------
phrase it's been drilled into you


---------118:51----------
that people are going to misjudge you


---------118:53----------
and not give you the benefit of the


---------118:54----------
doubt


---------118:56----------
and the problem that with that is that


---------118:58----------
if you doubt


---------118:59----------
other people's judgments of you i think


---------119:01----------
there's a lot of


---------119:02----------
authentic pity and compassion that you


---------119:05----------
view as a birthday card


---------119:08----------
well well just to clarify i don't say


---------119:10----------
any of these things out right it'd be


---------119:12----------
very rude to like


---------119:13----------
discount someone's compassion but it's


---------119:15----------
just like it's kind of like a vibe you


---------119:16----------
feel right


---------119:17----------
i understand i'm not talking about you


---------119:18----------
saying anything what i'm saying is that


---------119:20----------
like like


---------119:21----------
so there's a there's a kid crying in the


---------119:24----------
bathroom


---------119:25----------
who still lingers in you and manifests


---------119:27----------
like he bubbles up


---------119:28----------
his insecurities right and what i'm


---------119:31----------
saying is like


---------119:32----------
i think that there's a layer i mean


---------119:33----------
you've done phenomenal training you've


---------119:35----------
done amazing


---------119:36----------
you've you're a statistical outlier so


---------119:38----------
you don't need to do anything else you


---------119:40----------
can just keep being you baby you're


---------119:41----------
beautiful


---------119:42----------
and at the same time i envision a world


---------119:45----------
where you could live with fewer of those


---------119:47----------
insecurities


---------119:48----------
i envision a world where that [ __ ]


---------119:51----------
relentless thought process of


---------119:53----------
self-judgment and sounding stupid


---------119:55----------
and are people following you and you


---------119:57----------
worrying so much of that or you could be


---------119:58----------
freed of that and you can just


---------120:00----------
talk right where you can understand that


---------120:03----------
like sometimes you're going to stay


---------120:05----------
stupid [ __ ] for for the most part what


---------120:07----------
comes out of your mouth


---------120:08----------
is like intelligent and understandable


---------120:11----------
and has value and people could see you


---------120:12----------
from that


---------120:13----------
that's what i'm talking about in terms


---------120:15----------
of forward momentum


---------120:16----------
to be free of that insecurity i'm not


---------120:19----------
saying the insecurity screws you


---------120:20----------
i'm not saying it holds you back from


---------120:22----------
succeeding in life i'm not saying that


---------120:24----------
you're not


---------120:25----------
you know you're you're a force for good


---------120:27----------
in spite of that insecurity


---------120:29----------
so right now your adaptation has been


---------120:33----------
so much in spite of something negative


---------120:37----------
right strength in spite of toxicity now


---------120:40----------
you think that this maybe the toxicity


---------120:42----------
fuels the strength i think it's in spite


---------120:43----------
of and what i'm saying is that


---------120:45----------
the next layer which is more subtle


---------120:48----------
because you're not you know you're not


---------120:51----------
unable to have a job and things like


---------120:52----------
that right


---------120:53----------
a lot of people like forward momentum is


---------120:55----------
like really concrete for them they need


---------120:57----------
to find a job they need to find a


---------120:58----------
relationship whatever i think you've


---------121:00----------
got a lot of stuff solved at least as


---------121:02----------
far as i can tell


---------121:03----------
but the next level this is challenging


---------121:04----------
is really more spiritual growth


---------121:07----------
it's about unburdening your mind of this


---------121:09----------
insecurity


---------121:10----------
and i think the way to do that has


---------121:12----------
something to do with accepting people's


---------121:14----------
pity


---------121:14----------
it has something to do with letting go


---------121:18----------
of the perception that people don't give


---------121:20----------
you the benefit of the doubt even though


---------121:22----------
it could be true


---------121:23----------
i don't doubt it's been true i mean


---------121:25----------
obviously right


---------121:27----------
but at the same time like you don't the


---------121:29----------
insecurity so so that can be true but


---------121:31----------
the conditioning


---------121:33----------
that that creates in your mind does not


---------121:35----------
have to be true


---------121:36----------
if that makes sense the external fact


---------121:39----------
in the world can be true but the


---------121:43----------
the scars that that does for you can be


---------121:47----------
let go


---------121:48----------
and that i feel very strongly right you


---------121:50----------
can be a physically


---------121:51----------
ugly person you can be someone that is


---------121:55----------
not


---------121:55----------
desired by people that you're attracted


---------121:58----------
to


---------121:59----------
and you can also let go you can accept


---------122:03----------
that fact


---------122:05----------
and still feel good about yourself


---------122:09----------
we all have weaknesses we all have


---------122:11----------
shortcomings


---------122:13----------
right like yes yes and like that can be


---------122:15----------
a factual statement of truth


---------122:17----------
without it creating like these scars in


---------122:20----------
your mind which you carry around


---------122:22----------
and that's what i want you to let go i'm


---------122:25----------
not going to dispute


---------122:26----------
that your voice is deep i'm not going to


---------122:28----------
dispute that you have a prominent


---------122:30----------
forehead in a prominent nose


---------122:33----------
you know i'm not going to disbe fine but


---------122:36----------
whatever that means to you i dispute


---------122:41----------
because disputing that is useless


---------122:51----------
me too that's why i don't change them


---------122:53----------
that's why i like the way they are


---------122:54----------
i think it's just me i'm stepping


---------122:58----------
outside of me


---------122:59----------
to explain to you what i think others


---------123:02----------
see it's not necessarily a pro so i


---------123:04----------
under so i understand like on a simple


---------123:06----------
level


---------123:07----------
why that would be a projection of my own


---------123:09----------
insecurities within


---------123:10----------
but here's why i believe it's not


---------123:14----------
so everything i told you of why i


---------123:15----------
believe others


---------123:17----------
feel the way they do about me isn't a


---------123:19----------
projection of insecurity of my


---------123:21----------
own things it's literally


---------123:24----------
five six years of trial and error


---------123:26----------
research like


---------123:27----------
in my research i mean like a


---------123:28----------
light-hearted like asking like yo what's


---------123:30----------
going on here what's up right like


---------123:32----------
does that make any sense it seems as if


---------123:35----------
it seems like


---------123:36----------
so for example the the example you gave


---------123:39----------
earlier of


---------123:39----------
you know calling the person fat or


---------123:41----------
whatever right it seems like


---------123:45----------
what is said about me or what i'm told i


---------123:48----------
am


---------123:48----------
that's negative if i accept it


---------123:53----------
then it's like okay good thank god he


---------123:56----------
sees it


---------123:57----------
if i don't accept it it's like oh you're


---------123:59----------
a terrible [ __ ] cocky narcissistic


---------124:01----------
person right


---------124:02----------
and then somebody else right let's go to


---------124:04----------
someone else that's uh not


---------124:05----------
in my shoes right if someone says


---------124:07----------
something terrible and they accept it


---------124:08----------
it's like no don't say that about


---------124:10----------
yourself you're good right that pity


---------124:12----------
naturally that instinctive pity of a


---------124:14----------
decent person


---------124:16----------
automatically turns on it's like no


---------124:18----------
don't say about yourself you're good


---------124:19----------
you're not this you're not that you're


---------124:20----------
not this


---------124:21----------
but in my situation from most of my


---------124:23----------
experiences


---------124:25----------
it's like i need to accept the fact that


---------124:27----------
i am this thing that people are telling


---------124:28----------
me


---------124:29----------
and if i don't then i'm some cocky evil


---------124:31----------
monster that needs to be put down a


---------124:33----------
notch


---------124:33----------
this is like countless time and time


---------124:35----------
again now do i have positive


---------124:37----------
reinforcement in my community yes do i


---------124:38----------
have positive people in my life yes do i


---------124:40----------
have


---------124:40----------
comments that are very nice to me one


---------124:42----------
hundred percent


---------124:44----------
i'm not referring to people who have


---------124:45----------
gotten the time to know me people that


---------124:47----------
gone


---------124:47----------
know me have said the things that you


---------124:50----------
say obviously on a much more like just


---------124:52----------
simpler level obviously


---------124:53----------
your assessment is flattering and very


---------124:55----------
nice and it's a lot more


---------124:56----------
complex and i like that but they do


---------124:59----------
support


---------125:00----------
it's i'm everything i'm referring to


---------125:04----------
i'm referring to the first time


---------125:05----------
impressioners i'm referring to first


---------125:07----------
impression


---------125:08----------
on this site and in this world first


---------125:10----------
impression


---------125:12----------
is everything and what i'm saying is


---------125:14----------
there is no first impression that comes


---------125:15----------
from me


---------125:16----------
it's an automatically like thing it's


---------125:17----------
something that's just in their mind


---------125:19----------
it's like they look at me and it


---------125:20----------
automatically fears instilled within


---------125:22----------
them


---------125:23----------
and there's this this this thing where i


---------125:25----------
need to be brought down


---------125:26----------
instantly i need to be brought down a


---------125:28----------
notch this guy is too cocky


---------125:31----------
he thinks does that make any sense it


---------125:32----------
makes a lot of sense so train i'm gonna


---------125:34----------
have to get going because i have to


---------125:36----------
cover for we have a thing where we


---------125:39----------
train and i mean sorry support our


---------125:40----------
coaches so i have to do some coaching


---------125:42----------
support


---------125:42----------
round four then next week uh yeah two


---------125:45----------
weeks reach out to zank


---------125:47----------
but i want to just leave this with you


---------125:48----------
so i i don't get cool i don't disagree


---------125:50----------
at all because you're talking about


---------125:52----------
other people's impressions of you so


---------125:53----------
here's what i want you to look at


---------125:55----------
okay i'm not concerned about that yeah


---------125:59----------
what i'm concerned about and what i'd


---------126:01----------
love for you to pay attention to


---------126:03----------
is your reaction to that


---------126:07----------
it's your conditioning to that it's


---------126:10----------
how does it feel to be a human being who


---------126:14----------
walks this earth


---------126:16----------
and when people look at him you're like


---------126:18----------
a hunchback


---------126:20----------
oh complete [ __ ] yeah right and like


---------126:23----------
that's that's what we've gotta like


---------126:26----------
because


---------126:26----------
when you when you sit with like when you


---------126:28----------
kind of think about that like that's


---------126:31----------
the kid like i was like i gotta think


---------126:33----------
that there's some overlap between that


---------126:35----------
feeling


---------126:35----------
and like the way you felt when you're


---------126:37----------
when your friend tyler comes


---------126:38----------
turns to you and you oh no it's the same


---------126:40----------
feeling it's the same feeling yeah


---------126:41----------
you're right


---------126:42----------
it's it's a perfect overlap it's the


---------126:43----------
same exact feeling yes so here's the


---------126:45----------
crazy thing man


---------126:46----------
that feeling doesn't come from the way


---------126:48----------
that they look at you


---------126:49----------
that feeling is an echo of


---------126:52----------
tyler telling you that it's the feeling


---------126:55----------
that you carry with you that's the raft


---------126:57----------
my dude


---------126:58----------
so you're saying that no matter how much


---------127:00----------
people doubt me hate me or


---------127:01----------
whatever i don't need to feel the way


---------127:06----------
that i do i can just be like a [ __ ]


---------127:07----------
who gives a [ __ ] like are you saying i


---------127:08----------
can get to that point like


---------127:10----------
[ __ ] him it's not even oh [ __ ] em you're


---------127:12----------
not gonna have that reaction


---------127:15----------
that's the raft you're carrying you've


---------127:17----------
been carrying that raft


---------127:18----------
ever since you walked into the bathroom


---------127:20----------
and ate that lunch on the first day


---------127:22----------
you were judged unfairly that feeling of


---------127:25----------
unfair


---------127:26----------
judgment irrespective of how you look


---------127:30----------
not it's it's the raft bro and you can


---------127:32----------
set that down i know it's


---------127:34----------
mind-boggling but that's exactly what


---------127:35----------
i'm saying yes


---------127:37----------
you can live a life where you can meet


---------127:39----------
another person and the first thought in


---------127:41----------
your head is not oh [ __ ]


---------127:43----------
now i have to do this thing where


---------127:44----------
they're going to judge me and i have to


---------127:45----------
like wait until they get to know me


---------127:48----------
you can live a life that is


---------127:51----------
that's what i have to listen i have to


---------127:53----------
literally in these new groups


---------127:55----------
i have to like literally like i have to


---------127:58----------
like talk like this you're ready for


---------127:59----------
this i'm like


---------128:00----------
oh no you're good man like everything's


---------128:01----------
okay like i have to do that


---------128:03----------
otherwise i'm just automatically this


---------128:06----------
terrible [ __ ] right like i can't like


---------128:08----------
hey


---------128:09----------
my man that's not cutting it like that


---------128:11----------
suddenly is i'm at war but i'd be like


---------128:13----------
yo


---------128:14----------
you're good don't worry about it man


---------128:15----------
like everything's okay i do this like


---------128:17----------
reinforcement


---------128:18----------
low higher my pitch in my voice it's


---------128:20----------
this weird [ __ ] i don't understand it


---------128:21----------
but the fact that i do it and it works


---------128:23----------
proves everything that i'm saying like


---------128:25----------
what the [ __ ] yeah so so train i i just


---------128:28----------
understand how like frustrating that is


---------128:29----------
that like all this action


---------128:31----------
all of my actions are thrown out and


---------128:34----------
then


---------128:34----------
the entire cure to it all is to hire my


---------128:38----------
voice a little bit


---------128:39----------
come off less confident and suddenly i'm


---------128:41----------
a good person now


---------128:43----------
but all my actions that prove otherwise


---------128:45----------
to my physical features are irrelevant


---------128:47----------
they're thrown out it doesn't matter


---------128:48----------
dude do you


---------128:49----------
but as soon as i do something that makes


---------128:51----------
people feel better about that


---------128:53----------
yeah do you realize how shitty it is to


---------128:55----------
live a life


---------128:56----------
where instead of being yourself you have


---------128:58----------
to be some caricature of what you think


---------129:00----------
other people want


---------129:03----------
it's exhausting like what do you think i


---------129:04----------
mean when i say you're carrying a raft


---------129:06----------
around


---------129:07----------
it's heavy and you carry it every day


---------129:12----------
and what i'm telling you is if that


---------129:14----------
feeling is exactly the same


---------129:16----------
this is just the way the mind works it's


---------129:17----------
an echo


---------129:19----------
if you go back and you help that kid


---------129:21----------
that feeling


---------129:22----------
will dissolve like what do you think


---------129:24----------
processing a trauma


---------129:25----------
is like literally there's a field


---------129:28----------
of treatment for ptsd but doesn't that


---------129:31----------
but doesn't that in itself be


---------129:32----------
before we wrap up here doesn't that in


---------129:34----------
itself the mere fact


---------129:37----------
like even even if i put the raft down


---------129:39----------
let's put the raft down and i stopped


---------129:40----------
caring about it or stopped reacting to


---------129:41----------
it i want to ask you this question


---------129:43----------
that very effect that is coming from


---------129:46----------
what i just explained


---------129:47----------
how all of my actions are thrown out who


---------129:49----------
cares of the action it's about the talk


---------129:51----------
it's about how you present yourself in a


---------129:53----------
superficial form


---------129:55----------
that dictates whether people believe in


---------129:57----------
you trust you or like you like does that


---------129:59----------
itself kind of show you how primitive


---------130:02----------
and barbaric


---------130:06----------
we as humans are in a way like on a


---------130:10----------
certain layer like i can put the wrath


---------130:11----------
down as much as we want but it doesn't


---------130:13----------
change the fact


---------130:14----------
that this is the this is this is what is


---------130:17----------
resulting


---------130:17----------
right like this is happening how does it


---------130:19----------
i'll ask you for the third and final


---------130:21----------
time


---------130:22----------
how does it feel to be vilified no


---------130:25----------
matter what you do


---------130:29----------
it pisses me the [ __ ] off it's not funny


---------130:34----------
yeah no it pisses me the [ __ ] off it


---------130:36----------
legitimately pisses me off


---------130:38----------
right it makes me angry it makes me


---------130:41----------
angry


---------130:42----------
now it makes me mad yeah now we're


---------130:44----------
getting somewhere


---------130:46----------
yeah it makes me very very angry


---------130:50----------
no it's because what people want what


---------130:52----------
i'm sorry to cut you off what i hear


---------130:54----------
people


---------130:55----------
want is directly contradictory


---------130:58----------
to to to to their to their own


---------131:02----------
actions so let me explain what i mean by


---------131:04----------
that


---------131:05----------
right people want a world where they're


---------131:08----------
accepted people want a world


---------131:09----------
where you know good is done where


---------131:13----------
people are taken care of where people


---------131:15----------
are being nice to each other right


---------131:16----------
they want that but they don't realize


---------131:19----------
that they are the very


---------131:20----------
problem that is stopping them from


---------131:22----------
having what


---------131:23----------
they want themselves do you want to


---------131:25----------
train what's everything


---------131:26----------
to grow up in a world surrounded by


---------131:28----------
those kinds of people


---------131:30----------
but it's all of us every human being if


---------131:32----------
they came to this understanding


---------131:33----------
what's it like to grow up in a world


---------131:35----------
surrounded by other people like that


---------131:40----------
[ __ ] infuriating absolutely now we're


---------131:43----------
getting somewhere


---------131:44----------
but i can't do anything about it so


---------131:45----------
that's why i just try to stay consistent


---------131:47----------
with my actions


---------131:48----------
and in the back of my mind i keep that


---------131:50----------
haters


---------131:52----------
i do not accept that you can't do


---------131:54----------
anything about it


---------131:55----------
well i do slang about it but what i'm


---------131:57----------
saying is i can't


---------131:58----------
insert it into their minds like they're


---------132:00----------
going to learn in 20 years of time


---------132:02----------
you don't need to do [ __ ] in their minds


---------132:03----------
solving this problem comes from here


---------132:07----------
it comes from you i know it sounds


---------132:10----------
absolutely crazy


---------132:11----------
but i guess we're gonna have to have


---------132:13----------
this con finish this conversation later


---------132:16----------
so i'll just leave you with that and i


---------132:17----------
think if you feel fury now we're getting


---------132:19----------
somewhere


---------132:22----------
right because that's a feeling that's


---------132:24----------
buried beneath all the niceness towards


---------132:26----------
the


---------132:26----------
the bullies that treated you that way


---------132:29----------
and like that's it's there bro and like


---------132:32----------
you got to let that that's a raft you've


---------132:34----------
been carrying around for a long time


---------132:37----------
hovered by yeah


---------132:41----------
this is if you want to know the truth


---------132:42----------
the unboxing of how i feel


---------132:45----------
put into this like metaphor or analogy


---------132:47----------
this is what it is


---------132:49----------
okay who i am is the kid


---------132:54----------
before the kid that i was before i


---------132:57----------
punched that kid in the face


---------132:58----------
i am that kid the one before the punch


---------133:01----------
right


---------133:03----------
the kid that punched in the face and


---------133:06----------
suddenly


---------133:06----------
got all the credibility is what i see


---------133:09----------
so many people in today's world as


---------133:13----------
right for some reason they


---------133:16----------
there's something that they have or they


---------133:19----------
get that gives them


---------133:20----------
all the credibility but they they have


---------133:22----------
none of the actual intention


---------133:24----------
or action that like solidifies


---------133:28----------
what people think they are and no one


---------133:31----------
cares


---------133:32----------
that there is no action it's like the


---------133:34----------
talk is enough but then all of their


---------133:35----------
philosophies are


---------133:36----------
action is greater than talk but they


---------133:38----------
don't like they don't hold that


---------133:39----------
accountable for anyone that they are


---------133:41----------
already like


---------133:42----------
hi it's so hard for me to explain this


---------133:43----------
like what i'm trying to do a great job


---------133:45----------
what i'm trying to say is it seems like


---------133:47----------
the people


---------133:48----------
who are punching in the face the people


---------133:51----------
who are somehow the cool kid


---------133:55----------
they're still winning and in the genuine


---------133:57----------
good that are actually doing good


---------133:59----------
through


---------133:59----------
action they may look ugly they may look


---------134:02----------
terrible they may


---------134:02----------
look evil they may say a couple of cuss


---------134:04----------
words and [ __ ] yous and


---------134:06----------
suck my [ __ ] but they're the ones that


---------134:08----------
are


---------134:09----------
the heroes are the tr the heroes in


---------134:11----------
today's world that are brought up


---------134:13----------
are the true villains and the villains


---------134:15----------
that are seen


---------134:16----------
as villains are the true heroes and it's


---------134:18----------
that mere it's


---------134:19----------
it's that that is why our world where is


---------134:21----------
where it is but no one sees it


---------134:23----------
does it do does that under do you


---------134:25----------
understand it's like so


---------134:26----------
i'm going to ask you a question and then


---------134:28----------
you tell me whether i understand okay


---------134:30----------
i'm not it's going to be hard because i


---------134:32----------
i really have to go but
