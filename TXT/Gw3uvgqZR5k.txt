---------00:00----------
the amount of time that you spent on a


---------00:02----------
tangent was greater that so how did you


---------00:04----------
do that did you have a thought just now


---------00:07----------
oh I need to stop talking about this no


---------00:10----------
you didn't you just stop talking about


---------00:12----------
it


---------00:16----------
okay so um I even know how am i doing


---------00:22----------
yeah you know today's great but yeah I'm


---------00:29----------
happy you're really you're kind of good


---------00:30----------
direction honestly I have a [ __ ] do I do


---------00:33----------
this okay so here we go I like so doctor


---------00:36----------
can't I had an off stream talk two days


---------00:39----------
ago and I was sober I said I was sober


---------00:44----------
because I take something that I consider


---------00:45----------
a medication for depression in most days


---------00:47----------
sure but I was sober when we talked and


---------00:51----------
I actually I want you to describe it


---------00:54----------
what was your experience cuz here to


---------00:55----------
experience something clearer than mine


---------00:57----------
of the conversation yeah so how much


---------01:02----------
context do we want to share about the


---------01:03----------
conversation because I know there are


---------01:05----------
some things in the conversation I don't


---------01:06----------
care about anything in there is fine for


---------01:08----------
me to share so I'll to you well at one


---------01:12----------
point we talked about something where I


---------01:13----------
have to sign an NDA right so we


---------01:14----------
shouldn't talk about that okay just that


---------01:18----------
yeah right so okay but we didn't I


---------01:21----------
didn't go in-depth so it's fine okay I


---------01:22----------
just so I I wanted to just so what was


---------01:27----------
my impression of the conversation no you


---------01:30----------
can actually say anything you want to


---------01:31----------
say about anything in the conversation


---------01:33----------
because we didn't talk about the part of


---------01:34----------
the NDA because you haven't had you sign


---------01:35----------
it yet okay so whatever whatever you're


---------01:38----------
saying so but what was your question


---------01:42----------
[ __ ] I forgot that this point okay I


---------01:46----------
want to update the viewers on what


---------01:48----------
happened off stream because they missed


---------01:49----------
one therapy session that isn't therapy


---------01:54----------
it's not therapy right so that's


---------01:56----------
actually what we walked about right so


---------01:58----------
so I think my impression was we were


---------02:00----------
talking about clarifying what our


---------02:02----------
relationship is yeah and whether this is


---------02:05----------
therapy or this isn't therapy and what


---------02:07----------
our options are in terms of how to form


---------02:10----------
a relationship and I think that you know


---------02:12----------
the last time we talked on stream we had


---------02:17----------
a conversation about abandonment and


---------02:19----------
then I made a very bold claim because I


---------02:21----------
got emotional as well and I felt like I


---------02:24----------
wanted to be there for you so that you


---------02:26----------
no longer felt this way and I think


---------02:29----------
sometimes what


---------02:30----------
happens amongst people is that they have


---------02:32----------
different kinds of complexes and I have


---------02:34----------
them too and one of the things that


---------02:36----------
happens with me is when I see someone


---------02:38----------
hurting I want to make them better and


---------02:40----------
sometimes I will in that moment


---------02:43----------
say whatever I think they I can to make


---------02:45----------
them feel better but sometimes that's


---------02:47----------
irresponsible and I'm not I mean I think


---------02:51----------
in a sense it was irresponsible but I


---------02:52----------
think from our perspective we're trying


---------02:55----------
to understand you know like what is this


---------02:57----------
for you what is this for me what are we


---------03:00----------
doing on Twitch this is like kind of a


---------03:01----------
new thing and I think a common


---------03:03----------
perception is that if you're talking


---------03:05----------
about feelings with someone then that is


---------03:07----------
therapy but I think we can kind of say


---------03:10----------
like so so reckful also shared with me


---------03:12----------
that he had a great conversation for


---------03:14----------
several hours with poka main am I saying


---------03:17----------
that right now mm-hmm right where he


---------03:20----------
also talked about feelings and things


---------03:22----------
like that but I don't think that I don't


---------03:26----------
think that poka main is your therapist I


---------03:28----------
don't think I'm your therapist I think


---------03:29----------
you can talk to another human being


---------03:30----------
about feelings and you can explore


---------03:32----------
things that are authentic and important


---------03:34----------
to yourself and that doesn't necessarily


---------03:35----------
make you a therapist and so we were also


---------03:38----------
talking about the other options in terms


---------03:40----------
of like what are we are we like


---------03:41----------
colleagues like that that stream on


---------03:43----------
Twitch together we'd sort of talked a


---------03:44----------
little bit about you know things like


---------03:46----------
viewership and stuff like that I raised


---------03:48----------
some concerns about favoritism so I want


---------03:52----------
to try to treat people equally and I


---------03:55----------
just wanted to kind of acknowledge that


---------03:57----------
if one person is coming on stream over


---------03:59----------
and over again are we doing a disservice


---------04:01----------
to other people which I think you are so


---------04:03----------
I think I shouldn't come on stream over


---------04:04----------
and over again with you every week yeah


---------04:07----------
so I think and and so I think that that


---------04:10----------
too for me feels like it's closer to a


---------04:12----------
doctor-patient relationship which I


---------04:14----------
think becomes really complicated if


---------04:16----------
you're kind of working with someone week


---------04:17----------
after week you know and I think the


---------04:21----------
other thing that we expressed is that


---------04:23----------
like so I want to be rectals friend


---------04:24----------
right so but if I'm if I'm your friend


---------04:27----------
then can I be your doctor do I want to


---------04:29----------
be your doctor do I want to be your


---------04:30----------
friend and I think the the reason that


---------04:32----------
this kind of relates to reckful is


---------04:34----------
because I think reckful has I think he's


---------04:36----------
a very warm open and caring person and


---------04:40----------
also tangles up


---------04:43----------
relationships with people and it's


---------04:47----------
something that I actually do too so I


---------04:49----------
tend to tangle up relationships with


---------04:51----------
people I tend to not see things in terms


---------04:52----------
of black and white and that's the reason


---------04:54----------
I sorta like clean sure that's part of


---------04:57----------
the reason I started streaming anyway


---------04:58----------
because like no no one talks about


---------05:00----------
feeling like you know no therapist or


---------05:02----------
psychiatrist has come live on stream to


---------05:03----------
like talk to people about mental health


---------05:05----------
or the feelings I or maybe it does


---------05:06----------
happen and I just haven't heard of it


---------05:07----------
but I think that's a little bit


---------05:09----------
unorthodox and so we basically had a


---------05:12----------
conversation about like what are the


---------05:14----------
bounds of our relationship what's


---------05:15----------
acceptable what isn't acceptable I don't


---------05:18----------
think I mentioned this to him explicitly


---------05:20----------
but this was kind of running in my mind


---------05:22----------
so people forward me this clip forwarded


---------05:24----------
me this clip where reckful said that he


---------05:27----------
would pay a million dollars to to see me


---------05:29----------
do psilocybin and we didn't talk about


---------05:32----------
that right right yeah and so I think


---------05:35----------
that's a good example of like you know


---------05:37----------
what does that mean and like what what's


---------05:43----------
going on there so like what are you


---------05:45----------
looking for and like so our relationship


---------05:47----------
could get real money real fast right so


---------05:49----------
when people start and it's not the first


---------05:51----------
time this has happened where people will


---------05:52----------
offer me vast sums of money for X Y or Z


---------05:55----------
and and that just kind of makes me


---------05:57----------
concerned because like what are we


---------05:58----------
really doing so we just had a


---------06:01----------
conversation that was you know since in


---------06:03----------
the spirit of relationships and you know


---------06:05----------
a couple weeks from Valentine's Day we


---------06:07----------
had a DTR conversation you guys know


---------06:08----------
what that is


---------06:10----------
isn't a DTR what's a DTR DT I'm a sauce


---------06:19----------
define the relationship right and and so


---------06:27----------
I think it's important right because


---------06:28----------
like people like I want to be careful


---------06:29----------
about what we're doing on stream I want


---------06:31----------
to be our here to help people but I also


---------06:34----------
don't want to send the wrong message and


---------06:36----------
I also don't want to leave people


---------06:37----------
hanging and I think at times


---------06:40----------
I'll let reckful share sort of what he


---------06:42----------
remembered about it but I think at times


---------06:44----------
the conversation did get pretty


---------06:45----------
emotional and but that's for him to


---------06:49----------
share yes my piece he was saying that he


---------06:54----------
wanted to be there for me for the next


---------06:55----------
few years and then he but but the


---------06:57----------
problem


---------06:57----------
that kind of said it in a flurry flurry


---------07:01----------
of emotion I don't know if Larry's good


---------07:02----------
word uh while streaming he was getting


---------07:05----------
emotional himself he wanted to be there


---------07:06----------
for me so he said it but he hadn't


---------07:08----------
actually thought it through and what


---------07:10----------
that entails because he that is not a


---------07:13----------
licensed therapist in Texas and just a


---------07:15----------
lot of things you know how you'd have to


---------07:18----------
live in Texas to be my therapist in


---------07:21----------
Texas is how it works yeah so we also


---------07:23----------
did talk about you know whether you want


---------07:25----------
me to be your actual therapist and what


---------07:27----------
that would entail and the other thing is


---------07:29----------
that bit of research which is important


---------07:31----------
to remember is the the research on


---------07:32----------
people on BPD it's two years of someone


---------07:35----------
who's actually a romantic partner so


---------07:37----------
it's unclear whether a friend but yeah I


---------07:38----------
need to get in a relationship with a


---------07:40----------
girl for two years and have it actually


---------07:42----------
work out and that might cure my BPD with


---------07:44----------
yes and so this is this is what we also


---------07:47----------
kind of talked about I don't know if you


---------07:48----------
remember but like you know you know it's


---------07:50----------
not about curing and in the relationship


---------07:52----------
working out it's about developing a


---------07:55----------
couple not thinking in these terms yeah


---------07:57----------
okay yeah so so exactly so that's what


---------08:00----------
we need to change right so you think


---------08:02----------
about things in terms of working out or


---------08:03----------
not working out I think we had talked


---------08:05----------
about so what's gonna happen is you


---------08:07----------
enter relationships is that there are


---------08:10----------
gonna be stressful parts and not


---------08:12----------
stressful parts and if there is a


---------08:15----------
stressful part where you're some scar of


---------08:17----------
abandonment gets triggered then you may


---------08:20----------
act in a different kind of way and we


---------08:22----------
can talk about that like I'm curious


---------08:23----------
about you know your prior relationships


---------08:25----------
and things like that and as that some


---------08:28----------
scar activates it causes you to do


---------08:30----------
things that you normally wouldn't do and


---------08:33----------
those are kind of driven by that that


---------08:35----------
fear of abandonment process trauma


---------08:37----------
unprocessed trauma great way to put it


---------08:39----------
right so so some of the trauma of losing


---------08:43----------
your brother one brother and then


---------08:44----------
another brother like you're terrified


---------08:46----------
that like you'll lose someone else and


---------08:49----------
so you try to my other brothers still do


---------08:51----------
this means yeah around yeah and and so I


---------08:55----------
think what we need to help you do is


---------08:57----------
like use meditation or psilocybin or


---------09:00----------
however you want to but to gain


---------09:01----------
perspective on those moments and


---------09:03----------
essentially ride out those emotions so


---------09:06----------
that you can like not do something that


---------09:08----------
negatively impacts the relationship


---------09:11----------
so we need to help my my mind is stuck


---------09:13----------
on certain things right now yeah tell me


---------09:16----------
so I'm stuck on I like to get these


---------09:20----------
things solve they guess I'm I don't like


---------09:23----------
to be in detention so much beautiful


---------09:26----------
yeah so I'm in the tension of is he


---------09:29----------
gonna be my therapist or are we gonna be


---------09:33----------
friends because he said if he's my


---------09:35----------
therapist we can never travel together


---------09:36----------
anywhere like it changes how it is so I


---------09:41----------
thought was I was thinking I'd be cool


---------09:43----------
it'd be cool to go to Japan with with


---------09:45----------
dr. K sounds nice yeah feel nice yeah


---------09:49----------
just see how he experiences things and


---------09:52----------
have fun I don't know yeah so I


---------09:57----------
I really want a friend but you know that


---------09:59----------
I I'm thinking longer-term I'll have


---------10:03----------
friends so what I need is a therapist


---------10:06----------
maybe yeah so I think rather than


---------10:10----------
resolve that issue reckful I think the


---------10:13----------
important thing is that you said


---------10:14----------
something really really beautiful right


---------10:16----------
which is that you do not like the


---------10:17----------
tension it's a big problem in my life


---------10:20----------
yeah yeah I don't like the tension every


---------10:23----------
time I'm around a girl I like to just


---------10:25----------
have it resolved right away that okay


---------10:27----------
this is not gonna be anything romantic


---------10:28----------
for sure or it might I just want to get


---------10:32----------
it out of the way


---------10:33----------
let's is it okay if we talk about that


---------10:37----------
yeah that's a big problem for me in my


---------10:39----------
life sure so so why do you need to get


---------10:42----------
it resolved right away let's think about


---------10:44----------
that well okay let me know what don't


---------10:46----------
you like about being an attention I


---------10:48----------
don't know I have to figure it out I've


---------10:52----------
never know so absolutely right so so


---------11:02----------
let's think about this because like


---------11:03----------
here's the thing if she if the girl


---------11:06----------
decides to date you how can how things


---------11:10----------
it's really funny that I wanted you to


---------11:12----------
figure yeah I think they're pretty


---------11:13----------
laughing okay I mean I have an answer


---------11:17----------
for you but I'm gonna try to get you


---------11:18----------
there on your own yeah you want to give


---------11:20----------
me there yet yeah so so if you are so


---------11:24----------
how comfortable are you if she says yes


---------11:28----------
dude there's some problems hold on I'm a


---------11:34----------
boomer how the [ __ ] you scroll up into


---------11:36----------
which I know they changed something


---------11:37----------
I can't scroll up it just keep scrolling


---------11:39----------
down what is this and also someone said


---------11:44----------
my mic is too loud press control now


---------11:47----------
here's my mic too loud


---------11:48----------
cuz this is important to get fixed right


---------11:50----------
away and someone said I'm cutting him


---------11:52----------
off too much okay


---------11:54----------
you're cutting me not too much I don't


---------11:57----------
think I'm cutting you off too much okay


---------11:58----------
I need to stop reading it okay so I'll


---------11:59----------
just close it yeah everything's working


---------12:01----------
was close to a child chat okay I'm good


---------12:03----------
hello okay so reckful tell me how


---------12:06----------
comfortable are you if she says yes very


---------12:16----------
comfortable yeah I was really thinking


---------12:19----------
through how comfortable are you if she


---------12:21----------
says no also comfortable actually


---------12:25----------
there we go right so this is important


---------12:28----------
to understand you'd think and the word


---------12:31----------
that I'm using is is important right so


---------12:33----------
there's comfort so why are you


---------12:35----------
comfortable with her saying no is that I


---------12:38----------
have to think about it anymore it's not


---------12:41----------
what I want to happen it's not my


---------12:42----------
desired result but at least my mind


---------12:44----------
isn't in attention I'm just like okay I


---------12:47----------
can write it off as something yeah you


---------12:49----------
can write it off but what she's


---------12:51----------
rejecting you right yeah and you're


---------12:54----------
somehow okay with rejection


---------12:57----------
yes what life's not my it's not your


---------13:02----------
desired result I completely agree how


---------13:04----------
are you with it because it's [ __ ]


---------13:06----------
better than sitting there and wondering


---------13:08----------
all of them that is a griphon right so


---------13:10----------
that we're saying that the tension is


---------13:11----------
the problem but why is rigid outright


---------13:14----------
rejection better than then being left


---------13:16----------
wondering which I think a lot of people


---------13:18----------
can relate to this but let's just think


---------13:19----------
about it logically it's worse


---------13:21----------
yes logically it's worse because I have


---------13:24----------
no chance exactly that's what one would


---------13:26----------
think but but actually actually I love


---------13:29----------
this I love this conversation let's


---------13:30----------
think about it absolutely think about it


---------13:34----------
there's no hope if she leaves if she


---------13:38----------
says no right at least like in the


---------13:40----------
tension in theory there's hope and one


---------13:42----------
would think that hope is better than


---------13:44----------
rejection that's what one would think I


---------13:46----------
know why let's hear it okay cuz then


---------13:50----------
you're going through your days and


---------13:52----------
little events happen like a certain text


---------13:54----------
or like cutting the moat or like you


---------13:56----------
stupid things or just like that person


---------13:57----------
you see them if it's a real life thing


---------14:00----------
and then you wonder like this means


---------14:03----------
something did that mean something and it


---------14:04----------
clogs up all this mental effort for you


---------14:06----------
to be wondering all the time


---------14:09----------
and then for it to just be a no actually


---------14:12----------
makes your life easier in all those ways


---------14:13----------
because you can think about other things


---------14:15----------
I completely agree that that is still


---------14:18----------
not there [ __ ] you're there you're


---------14:21----------
you're there so that's what's bad you're


---------14:23----------
defining what's bad about being in the


---------14:25----------
tension and how you feel relief when you


---------14:28----------
get rejected so I'm not disagreeing


---------14:30----------
you're completely right I think you're


---------14:31----------
just missing one thing and the question


---------14:32----------
is why in particular reckful are you why


---------14:38----------
D why are you afraid of hope in okay


---------14:40----------
with rejection right because that's


---------14:43----------
another way to define this that sounds


---------14:46----------
[ __ ] up it does that's me yes [ __ ]


---------14:51----------
what do you think okay I'm afraid of


---------14:54----------
hope and I'm okay that's the tech


---------14:56----------
because the tension so sure there's like


---------14:58----------
a mental burden of you wonder if it's


---------15:00----------
right I'm afraid of hope but okay with


---------15:03----------
rejection


---------15:04----------
I'm afraid of hope and okay with is you


---------15:07----------
comfortable with rejection okay okay


---------15:11----------
it's a nice word I'm afraid of hope why


---------15:17----------
do you prefer certain failure to


---------15:20----------
uncertain success that's another way to


---------15:22----------
think about it right close my eyes and


---------15:30----------
think about it and see why do I prefer


---------15:33----------
certain failure


---------15:36----------
now should I go back in my life of


---------15:38----------
really far many years or should I just


---------15:40----------
think recently wherever you want to go


---------15:43----------
[ __ ] I want to do all right why do I


---------15:46----------
prefer certain failure to uncertain


---------15:50----------
success


---------15:51----------
oh man it's kind of like when I just


---------15:56----------
stopped streaming on Twitch for long


---------15:58----------
periods of time


---------15:59----------
mm-hmm and I passed what I was like I


---------16:02----------
just wanted to be a streamer as my main


---------16:05----------
career but I did the whole tension of


---------16:10----------
the numbers going up and down and not


---------16:12----------
like valve your accounts and not knowing


---------16:14----------
it was too much so I'd rather just run


---------16:17----------
away and closed at all not stream oh so


---------16:23----------
I prefer gutter yeah okay that's I did


---------16:26----------
that so you're right well I know you're


---------16:31----------
right I don't know why yeah I'm just


---------16:33----------
like I said this though I prefer I


---------16:35----------
prefer why am I afraid of hope but okay


---------16:43----------
with rejection


---------16:45----------
I'm not tweet that and let's see if


---------16:47----------
anybody knows okay can i tweet it sure


---------16:50----------
this is not helpful at all I just I want


---------16:53----------
to I want to see what people say yes why


---------16:55----------
am I afraid of hope but okay with


---------16:58----------
rejection so another way to think about


---------17:00----------
it that's how you worded it right why am


---------17:02----------
I afraid of hope but okay with rejection


---------17:03----------
yeah


---------17:05----------
sure so another way to think we did it


---------17:08----------
I've treated everyone answer okay so


---------17:10----------
another question is is why are you so


---------17:18----------
why are you okay with rejection but not


---------17:22----------
okay


---------17:23----------
why are you comfortable with rejection


---------17:24----------
but uncomfortable with conditional love


---------17:31----------
right so like unclear love that's the


---------17:33----------
other way to think about it okay


---------17:37----------
again why are you okay with rejection


---------17:45----------
but I am okay with it not okay with


---------17:49----------
conditional love I'm not okay with


---------17:53----------
conditional love right so like like


---------17:56----------
possible love does that what conditional


---------18:00----------
love means all right no it's it doesn't


---------18:03----------
mean for us so like let's say like


---------18:06----------
possible like so let me put it this way


---------18:08----------
the uncertainty possibly getting


---------18:10----------
rejected for you is worse than actually


---------18:12----------
getting rejected I can see that this is


---------18:17----------
a conversation you've had with people a


---------18:19----------
lot of times and it's not super


---------18:20----------
stimulating for you and that's


---------18:22----------
distracting me so I'm closing my eyes no


---------18:23----------
sorry I've just got a call and I need to


---------18:25----------
make sure it's not an emergency okay so


---------18:28----------
maybe my I just assumed a lot of things


---------18:30----------
yeah my thought process is better that a


---------18:38----------
second to [ __ ] got a lot of problems


---------18:43----------
okay so let me ask you another question


---------18:45----------
okay yeah


---------18:47----------
how much XP do you have how what if we


---------18:52----------
had to say you have different skill


---------18:54----------
levels right like you've gained XP at


---------18:56----------
like being in a relationship being


---------18:59----------
rejected and being in the tension how


---------19:03----------
much XP do you have in each of those


---------19:05----------
environments Oh a lot of experience


---------19:08----------
being in a relationship very good I've


---------19:11----------
experienced being single mmm-hmm


---------19:14----------
actually more experience being in a


---------19:15----------
relationship though and then


---------19:18----------
very little in attention it's right on


---------19:21----------
below level I'm bronze at being into


---------19:23----------
attention okay if we're using a for some


---------19:27----------
reason I like using the League of


---------19:28----------
Legends things the bronze silver gold


---------19:30----------
you know but diamond they dead dad and


---------19:32----------
Starcraft you yeah so sorrowful also


---------19:37----------
okay I'm bronze at being in attention I


---------19:39----------
might be like gold or high silver at big


---------19:43----------
interrelationship I'm not very good and


---------19:45----------
I'm man I'm not that good at being


---------19:49----------
single I'm not really good any of these


---------19:51----------
things okay so but I don't the worst at


---------19:53----------
being in attention for sure no no so but


---------19:55----------
being single is not it's being single is


---------19:58----------
not what that what we're talking about


---------20:00----------
we're talking about rejection that's not


---------20:02----------
the same as being single right I'm okay


---------20:05----------
with rejection yeah I'm chilling yes


---------20:07----------
because you have you have lost about a


---------20:11----------
lot reckful absolutely right because you


---------20:14----------
have lost people before and you have


---------20:16----------
survived yeah I'm fine


---------20:18----------
I think so yeah not because I mean so


---------20:22----------
think about that for a second be you've


---------20:23----------
gotten used to it right like you've


---------20:24----------
gotten used to people leaving yeah and


---------20:27----------
you can handle a [ __ ] okay yeah you're


---------20:30----------
right does that make sense so the


---------20:33----------
certain rejection is an area that you


---------20:35----------
actually have a lot of experience that's


---------20:39----------
it is it's very sad right I'm gonna put


---------20:46----------
you in the headphones okay I want to


---------20:48----------
hear you closer okay when it's tangled


---------20:51----------
over here okay


---------21:04----------
I'm realizing that it's silly for me to


---------21:06----------
untangle this at this time


---------21:08----------
okay done now hello yeah so like if you


---------21:14----------
think about it your XP with with


---------21:16----------
rejection and losing people is actually


---------21:18----------
like you're super high level later right


---------21:21----------
so it hurts there's no question that it


---------21:23----------
hurts but your capability to deal with


---------21:25----------
it is good actually I'm [ __ ] diamond


---------21:28----------
at getting rejected absolutely thanks


---------21:31----------
bro but like you started learning that


---------21:37----------
at a very young age right you started


---------21:41----------
learning rejection and loss when you


---------21:43----------
were super young and then each time it


---------21:47----------
happens you get you level up a little


---------21:51----------
bit and so you become more comfortable


---------21:52----------
with it yeah


---------21:54----------
what's terrifying is like you don't know


---------21:57----------
if people are gonna stay or leave like


---------22:00----------
you can deal with either camp you can be


---------22:01----------
in a relationship or you can be rejected


---------22:03----------
from relationship you can have someone


---------22:05----------
say I never want to see you again and


---------22:08----------
it's painful and you but you survive


---------22:09----------
because you know how to do that because


---------22:11----------
you're actually really resilient and you


---------22:13----------
have like like you know like winning and


---------22:15----------
losing is doable it's it's the hope


---------22:17----------
right because this is like you can only


---------22:20----------
like let yourself hope for relationships


---------22:24----------
so many times and like each time someone


---------22:26----------
ends their relationship with you it


---------22:28----------
hurts like more and more and more and it


---------22:30----------
gets harder and harder and harder to


---------22:32----------
like try to love again you're right


---------22:38----------
right so it's like


---------22:40----------
just need to know because like the


---------22:41----------
possibility like the possibility that


---------22:43----------
they're gonna say yes is just so


---------22:45----------
terrifying because the flipside of


---------22:47----------
uncertain acceptance is also uncertain


---------22:51----------
rejection so the possibility of


---------22:56----------
rejection is worse than rejection itself


---------23:02----------
mm-hmm it's the not knowing yes right


---------23:08----------
and so even now like I like some a girl


---------23:12----------
a girl told me really recently that or


---------23:15----------
she was telling another girl and she


---------23:18----------
told me that she did this that that I'm


---------23:20----------
really weird in the 10th in that tension


---------23:22----------
spot she didn't use the word tension


---------23:23----------
button and like that I want to just know


---------23:26----------
right away that it's not a relationship


---------23:30----------
thing she was telling another girl that


---------23:32----------
I'm weird like that and other people are


---------23:34----------
comfortable just being hey maybe this


---------23:36----------
will be and maybe this won't yes yeah


---------23:39----------
that is that that's what we have right


---------23:41----------
now she had to do yeah I want to do bill


---------23:43----------
to it okay so I'm tempted actually ask


---------23:47----------
you to meditate because I wonder if


---------23:49----------
let's do it in your state of mind this


---------23:51----------
will something maybe something you can


---------23:52----------
appreciate if we took our talked about


---------23:56----------
the moment where inhalation becomes


---------23:57----------
exhalation before you seen this I talked


---------24:00----------
to you about this the moment when


---------24:01----------
inhalation becomes inhalation wait wait


---------24:06----------
so I'm having one of those waters I know


---------24:09----------
this is weird a moment you know you know


---------24:10----------
when you're looking at a word for a long


---------24:12----------
time and it starts to look like it isn't


---------24:13----------
a word I've had that happen before I


---------24:16----------
never had happen your life where I look


---------24:19----------
at a word for a long time and I stare at


---------24:21----------
a word for a long time and you're like


---------24:23----------
wait is this actually a word that's how


---------24:24----------
you spell this word you've never had a


---------24:27----------
happen I don't can't believe you never


---------24:30----------
had that up and I mean maybe maybe I


---------24:32----------
have I've I've I've had that experience


---------24:34----------
with things besides words okay but just


---------24:37----------
maybe not with a word okay I don't know


---------24:39----------
if I've just stared in elation inhale


---------24:42----------
exhale in elation exhalation there well


---------24:44----------
you have inhalation and you have


---------24:45----------
exhalation right so close your eyes sit


---------24:47----------
up straight yeah and find the moment


---------24:50----------
where inhalation becomes exhalation


---------24:54----------
I'm sitting up straight and I'm finding


---------24:56----------
the moment when inhalation becomes


---------24:58----------
exhalation is this straight this is not


---------25:01----------
that straight is it straight enough for


---------25:02----------
you your spine should be straight you


---------25:05----------
can be leaning back that's okay but your


---------25:07----------
spine should be straight it is straight


---------25:09----------
I think yeah that's the most impotant


---------25:14----------
RIE this at home too so we're going and


---------25:24----------
then there's this moment here the


---------25:27----------
problem yeah so funny find the moment so


---------25:32----------
that in the parabola there is a smaller


---------25:35----------
parabola right because at the beginning


---------25:40----------
of the parabola yeah so zoom in and find


---------25:47----------
the moment okay got it


---------25:50----------
I found it okay so you found it so so


---------25:57----------
are you finding a point or is it a


---------26:00----------
parabola it's a parabola so then then


---------26:05----------
how can you find the moment if it's a


---------26:06----------
parabola because a parabola describes


---------26:08----------
the refuge I found the range find the


---------26:12----------
moment because at one point its


---------26:13----------
inhalation at one point its exhalation


---------26:15----------
right there must be a trap we must we


---------26:17----------
must step back here and discuss this ie


---------26:24----------
finding a range to me is identical to


---------26:27----------
finding a moment because there's we can


---------26:29----------
keep dividing moments into infant s amol


---------26:33----------
amounts of time forever there's no


---------26:37----------
even if you find a moment it's not I


---------26:42----------
mean it could be divided further right


---------26:44----------
so we're just looking at it as a range


---------26:47----------
how comfortable are you with it being a


---------26:50----------
range and not a moment super comfortable


---------26:53----------
super comfortable yeah because a moment


---------26:57----------
a moment is the same thing a moment is a


---------26:59----------
range also a moment is arranged


---------27:02----------
yeah sure a moment is arranged okay I


---------27:06----------
mean logically yeah no I guess I forget


---------27:09----------
it logically just I'm asking about the


---------27:11----------
conviction of your belief I'm not trying


---------27:12----------
to poke holes in your argument yeah


---------27:14----------
moment is a range between her saying yes


---------27:17----------
and her saying no is what between her


---------27:24----------
saying yes and her saying no is tension


---------27:27----------
and what is that tension a rain between


---------27:31----------
inhalation and exhalation there is what


---------27:34----------
and you are you are looking for you


---------27:38----------
cannot sit in that range so you must


---------27:40----------
practice sitting in the wrench because I


---------27:42----------
know you're capable of it I see but it's


---------27:47----------
not exactly my issue my issue is I know


---------27:49----------
this range exists and I'm uncomfortable


---------27:51----------
knowing it's arranged and don't have to


---------27:52----------
know any further so with most people


---------27:56----------
maybe that would be the issue that's not


---------27:58----------
mine what's your issue


---------27:59----------
why are you uncomfortable with the


---------28:01----------
uncertainty I don't know and we're still


---------28:04----------
trying to figure it out right so I I


---------28:06----------
think I think it's because you can be


---------28:07----------
comfortable with a range when it comes


---------28:09----------
to the breath but you are not


---------28:11----------
comfortable with the range that's what


---------28:12----------
the very definition of the uncertainty


---------28:14----------
is you want it to be a moment but I want


---------28:24----------
it to be my camera got so bright why


---------28:29----------
does it auto adjusting like that much


---------28:31----------
it's not good I'll just be dark I want


---------28:35----------
it to be


---------28:37----------
I want to know I'm accepted absolutely


---------28:44----------
I completely agree it's simpler than


---------28:48----------
then what yeah I just want to know I


---------28:51----------
complete so getting rejected then


---------28:54----------
because you just want to know it's not


---------28:56----------
about being accepted or rejected you


---------28:58----------
just want to know because in this


---------29:00----------
instance you are not uncomfortable with


---------29:02----------
arranged right you're the very


---------29:03----------
definition if you say I just want to


---------29:05----------
know you want to be squarely in an


---------29:07----------
inhalation or squarely an exhalation


---------29:10----------
you're fine with either side of the


---------29:14----------
middle of the parabola but it's in that


---------29:16----------
middle area where you are just intensely


---------29:18----------
uncomfortable does that make sense


---------29:19----------
of course it makes us the problem is


---------29:22----------
that when you become attached to a


---------29:25----------
relationship you cannot see what


---------29:27----------
otherwise you understand that didn't


---------29:32----------
make sense when I become attached to a


---------29:34----------
relationship I cannot see what life you


---------29:36----------
otherwise understand so you are


---------29:39----------
completely comfortable with the idea


---------29:41----------
that there is no inhalation and there is


---------29:43----------
no exhalation and that there's something


---------29:45----------
in the middle which is the parabola and


---------29:48----------
that if we think about that the parabola


---------29:50----------
is like the uncertainty of the breath


---------29:54----------
okay does that make sense yes but right


---------30:00----------
now your mind is calm and clear so you


---------30:03----------
are able to live in that uncertainty


---------30:05----------
without it torturing you it's just


---------30:08----------
simple there's nothing to worry about


---------30:09----------
there's no inhalation you're not


---------30:11----------
stressed out about it it's just it's a


---------30:12----------
parabola and use say that with utmost


---------30:14----------
conviction that there is no moment it's


---------30:17----------
just a range and you're comfortable with


---------30:18----------
that range yep and range is uncertainty


---------30:22----------
right like that's like it's like kind of


---------30:24----------
the same thing with that's what you're


---------30:25----------
saying


---------30:26----------
is that you cannot define it it is like


---------30:29----------
it's a race not this doesn't mean it's


---------30:33----------
uncertain though it's there


---------30:35----------
there's the range absolutely and and


---------30:38----------
when we think about her saying not


---------30:41----------
saying yes or not saying no there's a


---------30:43----------
random certainty that's uncertainty she


---------30:45----------
could say yes she could say no because


---------30:47----------
there is a binary answer at the end


---------30:49----------
whereas my breath with the breath there


---------30:53----------
really is something in between when you


---------30:55----------
say Oh an exhale then I encourage you so


---------30:58----------
I do not think both of those statements


---------30:59----------
can be true so I'd say zoom into the


---------31:02----------
parabola even further and look for the


---------31:04----------
binary answer that's the whole point


---------31:06----------
right so the point of the exercises


---------31:07----------
don't find find the moment where


---------31:10----------
inhalation becomes exhalation oh I guess


---------31:16----------
it's a it's a fun thing to help you zoom


---------31:17----------
in on the breath of an anchor right sure


---------31:20----------
that why we do it okay we do it for all


---------31:22----------
kinds of reasons that's one right there


---------31:28----------
okay I mean I can find the center of the


---------31:31----------
parabola it range the range that is in


---------31:33----------
the center of the parabola so zoom in


---------31:36----------
further then there's another range


---------31:39----------
absolutely and another range in another


---------31:41----------
range in another edge but you know at


---------31:43----------
some point like from this very simple


---------31:45----------
like physiologic standpoint at some


---------31:47----------
point you are not inhaling or inhalation


---------31:50----------
becomes that oh [ __ ] you're right yeah


---------31:52----------
yeah yeah right right okay yeah at some


---------31:56----------
point we're doing the other thing yes


---------31:59----------
that's the point like if it vacuums


---------32:01----------
earth odd or exactly right at some point


---------32:05----------
you're no longer inhaling in you're


---------32:06----------
exhaling I see you smart


---------32:13----------
so then there must be a transition and


---------32:16----------
you can detect the range of the


---------32:18----------
transition but this is why you have to


---------32:19----------
practice this technique but we can't


---------32:20----------
find we okay then I got counter that we


---------32:22----------
can't find the point right because it's


---------32:26----------
too small a range of time that if we'd


---------32:29----------
have to go to slow down time to find it


---------32:30----------
exactly so this is where if we think


---------32:35----------
about it right so like if we think about


---------32:36----------
a practice skill when I play Wow


---------32:39----------
battlegrounds my perception of time is


---------32:41----------
way too fast watch I was about to say I


---------32:48----------
didn't not stop saying pay but I would


---------32:50----------
[ __ ] love dude so funny please I used


---------33:03----------
to play warlock and I used to be on the


---------33:06----------
one hand really bad but also on the


---------33:08----------
other hand at times close to being a top


---------33:11----------
top of my server but uh but also really


---------33:15----------
bad like nowhere near like someone who's


---------33:17----------
actually better battlegrounds I would


---------33:19----------
love to not top of my server what's the


---------33:21----------
top rank okay I mean what the [ __ ]


---------33:25----------
you're talking about


---------33:26----------
they're like echelons right no sorry not


---------33:28----------
battlegrounds in arena arena yeah you


---------33:32----------
were gladiator I know I was gone doulas


---------33:38----------
the one under yeah I was like duelist


---------33:40----------
and had an option so I invited I had a I


---------33:42----------
had a claim that was gladiator that


---------33:45----------
invited me to join cuz I thought they


---------33:47----------
were good enough to join their PvP team


---------33:49----------
but I just didn't at the time so I turn


---------33:51----------
them down but I think I could have


---------33:52----------
listened I didn't have the time thing


---------33:54----------
that's that's a cop-out okay maybe you


---------33:59----------
didn't fine with the amount of time you


---------34:00----------
had you weren't good enough to do it


---------34:02----------
absolutely completely agree and may have


---------34:06----------
not never been you at the time you might


---------34:07----------
have not made it either completely agree


---------34:09----------
okay so you shouldn't talk like that


---------34:11----------
fair enough


---------34:12----------
alright yeah there we go but case in


---------34:16----------
point so it's my first that stuff makes


---------34:19----------
me want to be your friend and not your


---------34:20----------
patient


---------34:21----------
yeah so let's okay we have


---------34:25----------
to that in a second but let's let's not


---------34:27----------
get distracted so my perception of time


---------34:29----------
and battlegrounds is way faster than


---------34:31----------
your perception of time sorry but also


---------34:34----------
PvP arena all right so it's going fast


---------34:37----------
for me physically it's going so slow


---------34:38----------
yeah I'm just like oh my god this games


---------34:40----------
I'm just waiting for I've listened to a


---------34:43----------
YouTube video of you playing


---------34:44----------
battlegrounds and I was amazed arena


---------34:46----------
arena arena sorry I was amazed by your


---------34:49----------
ability to describe what is happening


---------34:51----------
and what is gonna happen next


---------34:52----------
it felt like it was slow-mo like when I


---------34:55----------
go into PvP arena it's just like I feel


---------34:58----------
like I've I'm being dropped from a


---------35:00----------
skyscraper and then before I know it


---------35:02----------
like my fell Hound is dead and all of my


---------35:04----------
man has been drained fell hunter yeah


---------35:06----------
I'll explain it it's because you just


---------35:08----------
get to know all the abilities well you


---------35:10----------
already know you already know this but


---------35:12----------
you get to know all the abilities of


---------35:13----------
every character and their cooldowns so


---------35:15----------
you get to know that there's nothing


---------35:16----------
that can happen to me in the next 10


---------35:18----------
seconds because Rogue doesn't have


---------35:20----------
kidney shot and he doesn't have vanished


---------35:22----------
right now and I cannot be stunned I'm


---------35:23----------
just chilling so I'm not in tension


---------35:26----------
because I know it's guy goes back to the


---------35:28----------
other thing


---------35:28----------
I just know nothing can happen to me so


---------35:30----------
I'm chilling you know and then I think


---------35:32----------
but I know all their abilities of all


---------35:34----------
three and yeah so your ability you learn


---------35:38----------
your ability to process who is using


---------35:40----------
what abilities on the enemy team


---------35:42----------
requires a slowing down of time that I


---------35:45----------
don't have so I have I can't keep track


---------35:47----------
in one second you can track three


---------35:50----------
abilities from through IVs whereas I can


---------35:52----------
track half of one this would annoy me


---------35:55----------
actually through add-on so just do it


---------35:56----------
for you but in tournaments at the time


---------35:58----------
you weren't allowed to use that on


---------35:59----------
switch I liked because then everyone was


---------36:00----------
honest fair playing field but we're


---------36:01----------
add-ons are just tracks in the middle of


---------36:03----------
your screen all the abilities other team


---------36:05----------
use and I didn't have any play with any


---------36:06----------
of that I had zero add-ons and then the


---------36:09----------
people were basically cheating in my


---------36:10----------
eyes yeah to have it you know because


---------36:13----------
that you're I mean unless everyone has


---------36:16----------
it on then you're cheating so so reckful


---------36:19----------
let me let me just go back to the point


---------36:21----------
so I think the issue is you're saying


---------36:22----------
that you have to slow down time and I


---------36:23----------
completely agree right so you need to


---------36:25----------
increase your resolution to be able to


---------36:29----------
detect the transition of the breath the


---------36:33----------
moment when inhalation becomes


---------36:35----------
exhalation okay


---------36:37----------
that comes with practice oh you can do


---------36:39----------
it yes are you sure


---------36:47----------
yes I like that you took some time to


---------36:49----------
answer maybe more comfortable with your


---------36:52----------
certainty so um I have a question there


---------36:55----------
okay so I hear a lot about how


---------36:59----------
meditation will get people into a state


---------37:05----------
of mind


---------37:05----------
[Music]


---------37:07----------
well you tell me a lot


---------37:09----------
no it'll get me


---------37:10----------
to a state of mind that where I want to


---------37:12----------
be really and then it'll translate into


---------37:17----------
my day to day walking around life not


---------37:19----------
just wall and meditating right mm-hmm


---------37:22----------
now what makes it so when I meditate and


---------37:28----------
when you meditate we're doing the same


---------37:29----------
thing I completely have no sometimes I


---------37:32----------
get to the point where I'm not thinking


---------37:33----------
at all


---------37:34----------
mm-hmm okay and that's where you are how


---------37:37----------
do you go farther than not thinking how


---------37:44----------
are you getting somewhere farther


---------37:45----------
because not thinking is just the first


---------37:48----------
step right so that's kind of like so but


---------37:51----------
it's hard to describe because so like


---------37:56----------
let's say that it's dark outside and I


---------38:00----------
can't see anything and I turn on the low


---------38:02----------
light and so when when there's a low


---------38:04----------
amount of light or the rods in our eyes


---------38:07----------
activate and are sensitive to low light


---------38:09----------
whereas the cones or not so when it's


---------38:11----------
dark outside the perception that I learn


---------38:13----------
this the the perception of color is not


---------38:17----------
there even though you can see like


---------38:18----------
shapes so think about when it's dark


---------38:20----------
outside like you don't see the green of


---------38:21----------
trees they look the same color as the


---------38:23----------
bark right which is like gray or brown


---------38:25----------
and then as the my god tonight that


---------38:28----------
always sees at all the same color


---------38:29----------
he's color bud but okay I wonder so he's


---------38:32----------
probably red-green color blind or is he


---------38:34----------
completely colorblind so does that mean


---------38:36----------
that his cones or rods aren't working


---------38:39----------
that is if your dad is called so cones


---------38:42----------
perceive color and rods perceive black


---------38:44----------
and white


---------38:45----------
so his cones of green are not working I


---------38:47----------
think he sees a tree is one color yeah


---------38:50----------
so I don't know particularly what's


---------38:52----------
going on with oh yeah oh man men are


---------38:54----------
usually red-green color blind because


---------38:56----------
the the gene for color is on I think


---------39:01----------
actually one x chromosome so what is red


---------39:03----------
and what does red green mean they can't


---------39:05----------
see red and green that they can't tell


---------39:06----------
the difference between red and green


---------39:08----------
what yeah you tell them


---------39:11----------
in red and green okay yeah I'm uses


---------39:15----------
different okay I get it okay that sounds


---------39:16----------
crazy now bill tell difference of red


---------39:17----------
green goddamn I'll guess some people are


---------39:21----------
like that that's a common one yeah for


---------39:24----------
men red and green are [ __ ] different


---------39:26----------
yeah see I feel bad yeah I get it let's


---------39:30----------
go back to your question yeah which was


---------39:33----------
which was how is something possible


---------39:35----------
beyond shutting off the mind so I would


---------39:38----------
describe so I'll use an analogy first


---------39:40----------
then I'll kind of give you a simple


---------39:41----------
answer so like if we think about the


---------39:42----------
perception of light there's complete


---------39:44----------
blindness and then there's low-level


---------39:46----------
light and qualitatively being able to


---------39:49----------
see or not see shapes is different from


---------39:52----------
qualitatively being able to see colors


---------39:53----------
as the amount of light in the room


---------39:55----------
increases you start to differentiate


---------39:57----------
color where before between black and


---------39:59----------
white I mean between darkness and light


---------40:01----------
all you could see was shapes you with me


---------40:05----------
darkness and light all I could see was


---------40:07----------
shapes I'm trying to follow you but I


---------40:09----------
keep thinking about other things and I'm


---------40:11----------
really not wanting to do that I really


---------40:13----------
want to focus okay while you were


---------40:15----------
talking I was thinking about how it'd be


---------40:16----------
nice to get tell but are in a call on


---------40:18----------
stream sometime my friend and I'm the


---------40:21----------
designer I'm a game


---------40:23----------
yup and then I was also thinking about


---------40:25----------
how he wouldn't know how to fix my chair


---------40:27----------
so I could be more comfortable and then


---------40:30----------
there's construction and then I'm really


---------40:33----------
having a hard time focusing and I've


---------40:34----------
seen I thought f2p and I was thing about


---------40:37----------
I wish I could overcome all these


---------40:38----------
thoughts and just focus on what you're


---------40:40----------
doing and then I was thinking about how


---------40:41----------
you could probably do that kind of stuff


---------40:42----------
because you've meditated a lot


---------40:47----------
okay good so it's good that you notice


---------40:49----------
the floor you did fonts yeah but did you


---------40:51----------
look you weren't listening at the very


---------40:52----------
end sure I was you sure you were I think


---------40:58----------
yeah oh okay


---------41:01----------
III just don't just because you involved


---------41:03----------
me with the last statement doesn't mean


---------41:05----------
I'm gonna treat any of the other that


---------41:06----------
statement is different from any other


---------41:08----------
thoughts right those are the thoughts


---------41:09----------
just random thoughts some of them


---------41:11----------
involve me some don't that's fine yeah


---------41:13----------
yeah yeah that's not what I was talk


---------41:15----------
about yeah let's keep going okay I'm


---------41:16----------
[ __ ] I'm messing us up okay so okay


---------41:18----------
that's what I always thought my see I


---------41:19----------
keep messing us up the [ __ ]


---------41:22----------
construction dude okay what do I do


---------41:26----------
so you can you drown out this


---------41:28----------
construction noise and can you help me


---------41:29----------
meditate through it and just littéraire


---------41:32----------
saying yeah but if you're if you're


---------41:34----------
meditating you're not listening to what


---------41:36----------
I'm saying


---------41:36----------
right cuz only meditate meditate now


---------41:38----------
meditate now and then it'll help me


---------41:39----------
learn to focus okay let's go I can focus


---------41:42----------
and then I can if you want to focus and


---------41:44----------
you want to calm down an act of mind


---------41:45----------
we're gonna give you a different


---------41:47----------
technique okay so this is one we've done


---------41:48----------
before


---------41:48----------
it's alternate nostril breathing this I


---------41:50----------
think will calm down your mind okay so


---------41:52----------
sit up straight let me see this symbol


---------41:56----------
okay okay that's okay you can't be like


---------42:03----------
that it's not for the record for anyone


---------42:06----------
who's confused about not being able to


---------42:07----------
do this the tendons in your hand are not


---------42:10----------
all individual forefinger control so


---------42:13----------
like there's one tendon that controls


---------42:15----------
like these two fingers which is why like


---------42:19----------
it's hard to not do it's it's just


---------42:22----------
because your fingers aren't actually


---------42:23----------
individually controlled by the ten comes


---------42:25----------
very sad that this is the farthest I can


---------42:27----------
go I know I get it the tendon yeah I get


---------42:30----------
it yeah yeah so so it's it's really


---------42:32----------
actually complicated so you have like


---------42:33----------
some tendons that control multiple


---------42:35----------
fingers then you have smaller tendons


---------42:36----------
that control individual fingers so it's


---------42:38----------
not like a deficiency it's just how


---------42:40----------
we're wired so yeah


---------42:41----------
sit up straight so thumb on the right


---------42:43----------
nostril and breathe in through the left


---------42:47----------
thumb on the right nostril and breathing


---------42:50----------
through the left yeah and then switch to


---------42:58----------
the other side block the other nostril


---------42:59----------
and breathe out


---------43:01----------
I'm blocking it with these two uh-huh


---------43:07----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] why is that my


---------43:09----------
initial thought there's somebody is just


---------43:13----------
job to do construction on the one above


---------43:17----------
me to make it look nice and my thought


---------43:20----------
was this [ __ ] [ __ ] that's not


---------43:22----------
a good the hut it's not think that yes


---------43:28----------
oh okay we'll keep going


---------43:32----------
okay so rectal I'm really sucking it I'm


---------43:37----------
really terrible I'm sorry let me take a


---------43:39----------
piss so I guess the question chat


---------43:54----------
because we talked about this last time


---------43:56----------
is does psilocybin produce the same


---------43:59----------
effect as meditation and I think my


---------44:03----------
initial answer to that is that I think


---------44:05----------
that you can have similar experiences of


---------44:08----------
consciousness in terms of D realization


---------44:10----------
and depersonalization but it was my


---------44:12----------
belief that a big difference between


---------44:14----------
psilocybin in the practice of meditation


---------44:16----------
is that meditation also teaches you a


---------44:19----------
practice of being able to focus your


---------44:22----------
mind and I believe reckful felt like in


---------44:25----------
states of psilocybin he was also able to


---------44:28----------
focus his mind right that he learned the


---------44:31----------
same thing so I'm curious about that I


---------44:38----------
don't know because I've never tried and


---------44:42----------
I think that sometimes the mind is


---------44:43----------
distracted right so we have to meet


---------44:44----------
people where they are and if your mind


---------44:46----------
is distracted that's okay it's not the


---------44:49----------
end of the world


---------45:09----------
so a lot of people are asking or want me


---------45:12----------
to ask reckful whether he took shrooms


---------45:14----------
today right well people are asking about


---------45:17----------
my opinion some people are assuming that


---------45:19----------
he did take shrooms I want you guys to


---------45:22----------
really stop and think about what the


---------45:25----------
purpose of asking that question is like


---------45:29----------
if the answer that question was yes how


---------45:33----------
would you feel about it what emotions


---------45:35----------
would come up because I'm damn sure


---------45:37----------
emotions would come up for you guys and


---------45:39----------
if the answer was no what would come up


---------45:41----------
how would you feel


---------45:42----------
can anyone does anybody know


---------45:56----------
yeah right so like exactly so notice


---------46:00----------
that within yourself and ask yourself


---------46:02----------
what do I do I stream what are we here


---------46:05----------
for and does it matter at all whether


---------46:15----------
reckful is on psilocybin right now or


---------46:17----------
not for what our goal is


---------46:24----------
reckful a lot of we don't have to talk


---------46:26----------
about this I'm just sharing with you the


---------46:27----------
I don't know how much of that


---------46:28----------
conversation you got I heard a little


---------46:31----------
bit some speakers uh yeah you reckon oh


---------46:33----------
you know why they are so curious yep


---------46:36----------
so supply line why are they so curious I


---------46:38----------
think there's a certain voyeurism to


---------46:41----------
whether you're on shrooms or not so like


---------46:44----------
I think people will feel people like


---------46:50----------
feeling right okay so so like I think


---------46:54----------
and a lot of times like when you have a


---------46:56----------
hypothesis it's very satisfying to feel


---------46:57----------
right I just don't think that that


---------46:59----------
question is relevant at all to like what


---------47:01----------
we're actually doing here what do you


---------47:02----------
think I agree with you


---------47:05----------
I was now that especially now that we've


---------47:07----------
done it on and off I think there are


---------47:11----------
certain topics that can be explored


---------47:12----------
better on so Simon and certain topics


---------47:14----------
can be explored better off because maybe


---------47:17----------
I'd actually be uncomfortable or not go


---------47:18----------
deep into a certain topic off of it but


---------47:21----------
then ah but then off off I could also


---------47:24----------
you'd be better at commenting now that


---------47:26----------
you've seen me both ways I think it's a


---------47:30----------
little different but either way we can


---------47:32----------
accomplish a lot yes I do not think we


---------47:36----------
will accomplish the same things yeah I


---------47:39----------
think we can accomplish a lot


---------47:40----------
I completely agree and I think it's


---------47:42----------
important I know so like this is like


---------47:44----------
we're you know we have to take a step


---------47:45----------
back and ask ourselves what's more


---------47:47----------
important do we want to be entertainers


---------47:49----------
on Twitch or do we actually want to help


---------47:51----------
people because if we weren't able if we


---------47:55----------
want to be entertainers then we go down


---------47:57----------
the road of asking reckful whether he's


---------47:59----------
on psilocybin or not and then we laugh


---------48:01----------
or joke about his ability to be


---------48:03----------
distracted and whatnot and I don't think


---------48:05----------
that that actually serves our purpose at


---------48:07----------
all I frankly I don't care I think


---------48:08----------
everyone should understand that at times


---------48:10----------
mind is distracted whether you on a


---------48:12----------
substance whether you were emotionally


---------48:14----------
upset or anything like that at times


---------48:16----------
your mind does not do the things that


---------48:18----------
you want it to do so in my mind there


---------48:21----------
may be also be people who are tuning in


---------48:22----------
because they want to see some kind of


---------48:24----------
emotional explosion from reckful and


---------48:26----------
they want to see him have an aha moment


---------48:27----------
and stuff like that and I I get that


---------48:30----------
right that's good that's good twitch


---------48:31----------
it's like good streaming and it's fun to


---------48:33----------
watch but I want everyone to understand


---------48:36----------
that like right now reckful I mean I


---------48:38----------
don't think it's good or bad it's just


---------48:39----------
at this moment he is noticing with


---------48:41----------
himself that he is distracted and yeah


---------48:44----------
at home does not struggle with the same


---------48:46----------
[ __ ] thing exactly so I noticed I'm


---------48:49----------
getting distracted a lot and I want to


---------48:52----------
focus and I know that you would be able


---------48:54----------
to train me and to focus better yes yes


---------48:58----------
so that site it I'm excited to learn how


---------49:01----------
to focus better so let's try one more


---------49:03----------
time and if not we'll try a different


---------49:05----------
meditation technique sure let's do it


---------49:07----------
yeah so sit up straight I'm over here


---------49:10----------
actually try this just use can you do


---------49:13----------
this link your thumb and your ring


---------49:15----------
finger thumb and ring finger yeah not


---------49:20----------
not index finger ring finger thumb and


---------49:22----------
ring thing oh there yeah that you can do


---------49:25----------
okay so now I have a just just so you


---------49:27----------
know because I get uncomfortable about


---------49:29----------
it I haven't actual like I'm


---------49:33----------
significantly below average at certain


---------49:37----------
tasks it may be like um I have an 80 IQ


---------49:43----------
at like shapes and I don't remember


---------49:46----------
exactly the okay there's certain things


---------49:49----------
some certain things I have like 80 IQ


---------49:50----------
with and let's say one of them's like


---------49:52----------
shapes and seeing rotations and like I


---------49:54----------
can't my brain can't do that so I'm just


---------49:56----------
just these things are take really long


---------49:58----------
for me that I just want you to know


---------50:00----------
that's all okay so let's just talk about


---------50:02----------
that for a second do you feel insecure


---------50:04----------
about lacking that capability I'm not


---------50:07----------
insecure as long as people know no I


---------50:09----------
just don't want people to wonder why


---------50:10----------
it's taking me so long


---------50:11----------
always with these kind of things I just


---------50:13----------
rather they know hey I'm like I'm


---------50:15----------
challenged with okay so did I tell you


---------50:19----------
how I feel about that yeah yeah okay so


---------50:23----------
just real quick I can


---------50:24----------
careless the important thing is that we


---------50:27----------
meet you where you are and we get you to


---------50:29----------
where you need to go if you're impaired


---------50:31----------
if you're brilliant if you're cut like


---------50:34----------
we just have to meet you where you are


---------50:36----------
no judgement and just get you to where


---------50:38----------
we want you to go yeah we try things and


---------50:41----------
I try let me agree okay


---------50:42----------
I completely agree just sometimes people


---------50:44----------
when I'm streaming for eight years I've


---------50:46----------
noticed people are like how the [ __ ] can


---------50:48----------
he not do this like I can't and I'm just


---------50:51----------
I always have to feel like I have to


---------50:52----------
explain if I don't have to yeah okay


---------50:53----------
let's go okay so you can so we're gonna


---------50:56----------
try a slightly different method okay so


---------50:57----------
I'm gonna do so this is gonna be hard


---------50:59----------
for you to see so I'm gonna do thumb and


---------51:00----------
ring finger we're gonna go like this


---------51:02----------
okay instead of doing this so doing this


---------51:05----------
because this can be challenging for


---------51:06----------
something yeah good and so the only


---------51:08----------
other thing is I'm gonna raise my hand a


---------51:10----------
little bit so it's gonna be like you're


---------51:12----------
not gonna be able to see my face but so


---------51:13----------
breathe in


---------51:14----------
so thumb over here Bri then ring finger


---------51:19----------
to block the other one to breathe out


---------51:24----------
breathe in through the same nostril


---------51:30----------
switch and out in switch out


---------51:51----------
in switch-out good now close your eyes


---------52:01----------
sit up straight and continue at your own


---------52:04----------
pace okay keep going no keep going


---------52:18----------
and everyone who's watching should do


---------52:21----------
this to only switch on an exhale sweep


---------52:30----------
which after inhale yeah yeah switch with


---------52:35----------
a full breath yeah it's a matter of


---------52:41----------
where we're defining in the beginning


---------52:46----------
good reckful you're learning so i've


---------52:52----------
cautious about that sound


---------53:01----------
you


---------53:13----------
keep going you can stop I don't feel


---------53:16----------
good okay really nice yeah


---------53:19----------
how's your mind yeah come I don't know


---------53:23----------
if I can focus better yet but I know


---------53:24----------
that I'm very calm although I must


---------53:28----------
mention he shut up for a second the


---------53:31----------
construction can you hear the


---------53:32----------
construction so he happened to shut up


---------53:34----------
around that time shut up his Abed


---------53:36----------
working out and stopped so it helped me


---------53:39----------
be calm but way am I still calm okay if


---------53:42----------
there's construction I'm calm I got this


---------53:46----------
okay by the way our long-term is very


---------53:48----------
dark now yeah it kept auto adjusting I


---------53:52----------
need a check I need to mess with I don't


---------53:54----------
want it to auto adjust that's perfect


---------53:57----------
down yeah that's right how do you feel


---------54:02----------
um I I feel I feel hopeful that I can


---------54:12----------
learn to overcome distraction from you


---------54:16----------
and that would be amazing for me because


---------54:20----------
it's a major problem in my life that's


---------54:24----------
all good so I'm I'm wondering do you do


---------54:27----------
you feel like you're talking differently


---------54:29----------
than before mmm-hmm I wouldn't have


---------54:33----------
guessed it but now that you mention it


---------54:34----------
I'm probably more calm they talking


---------54:37----------
absolutely right so you were saying


---------54:39----------
three or four different things that were


---------54:41----------
a little bit disconnected and you were


---------54:43----------
moving around from place to place now I


---------54:45----------
expect that to return over time which is


---------54:47----------
okay so what was it yes


---------54:53----------
that's sort of part of it yeah okay


---------55:00----------
and so help me understand how you would


---------55:02----------
like to spend the remainder of our time


---------55:04----------
today let's say like we have another 20


---------55:06----------
minutes what would I like to do yeah so


---------55:08----------
what are you cuz we've opened allotted


---------55:10----------
okay okay yeah let's let's focus on how


---------55:13----------
to focus okay but with active I want to


---------55:18----------
use an active thought method maybe


---------55:22----------
that's not the right way well what do I


---------55:24----------
actively think to tell myself to focus


---------55:26----------
or do I have to stop thinking so focus


---------55:29----------
is not tell about telling yourself


---------55:31----------
anything it is about doing something


---------55:33----------
with the attention of your mind so


---------55:35----------
telling yourself something is thoughts


---------55:39----------
this I I'm really doing obviously this


---------55:42----------
stuff I'd love for you to explain so


---------55:43----------
let's just start by like if you tell


---------55:45----------
yourself something that as a thought yes


---------55:49----------
focusing your mind is not about thoughts


---------55:52----------
it's about directing the thinking


---------55:54----------
machine in a particular direction got it


---------55:57----------
okay so we're the controller here this


---------55:59----------
is us and then we think thoughts okay we


---------56:06----------
think thoughts and then there's a lot of


---------56:07----------
disconnected thoughts happening we need


---------56:09----------
to learn to direct this though to just


---------56:12----------
go in just one direction yes but it's


---------56:16----------
very good that you're first of all


---------56:17----------
realizing so like the production of


---------56:19----------
thoughts cannot if we're learning to


---------56:21----------
direct to this I've actually okay I read


---------56:23----------
a book called mind hacking no it's about


---------56:24----------
how can your own mind and it kept


---------56:28----------
mentioning that there's this who are we


---------56:33----------
are we this thing or if we're able to


---------56:36----------
figure out how to direct this thing then


---------56:38----------
worse than something a higher the


---------56:40----------
consciousness okay it's interesting to


---------56:43----------
me we'll talk about another time anyway


---------56:46----------
good what did you just do reckful trying


---------56:50----------
to direct ourselves back to the


---------56:51----------
conversation very good and you weren't


---------56:53----------
able to do that about 60 seconds ago


---------56:54----------
right it was harder for you I'm not a


---------56:56----------
weren't able was harder for you the


---------56:58----------
amount of time that you spent on a


---------56:59----------
tangent was greater that so how did you


---------57:02----------
do that did you have a thought just now


---------57:04----------
oh I need to stop talking about this no


---------57:07----------
you didn't you just stop talking about


---------57:10----------
it


---------57:11----------
No do you see that so that wasn't a


---------57:14----------
thought I don't understand it though


---------57:16----------
that's how he was yeah but but you you


---------57:19----------
didn't you under self you didn't


---------57:21----------
convince your son Durst and all this


---------57:23----------
yeah that's awesome that's a guess I


---------57:28----------
should have ever heard in my entire life


---------57:30----------
I completely agree okay like I think


---------57:33----------
it's the coolest [ __ ] ever as well yeah


---------57:37----------
so I want people like so like this is


---------57:39----------
why I loved going to India so like I


---------57:41----------
lived my whole life not understanding


---------57:44----------
how the [ __ ] I worked like I don't


---------57:46----------
understand like when I wake up one day


---------57:49----------
why do I skip class and when I wake up


---------57:52----------
another day why do I go to class yeah I


---------57:54----------
want to know on some days why do I fall


---------57:56----------
asleep it why do I go to bed at 10:00


---------57:58----------
p.m. like I'm supposed to like a good


---------58:00----------
student and other days why do I stay up


---------58:02----------
till 4:00 in the morning playing


---------58:03----------
Warcraft 3 yes and not even just regular


---------58:06----------
work after me but Warcraft 3 like custom


---------58:08----------
games like UMS like that's not even real


---------58:11----------
war 3 it's like thrashing war 3 no no


---------58:14----------
the custom games a [ __ ] awesome yeah


---------58:17----------
yeah but even even I felt like playing


---------58:19----------
like like grinding ladder was like


---------58:21----------
actually doing something right like


---------58:22----------
playing costing games is just wasting


---------58:23----------
your [ __ ] time you know what I mean


---------58:25----------
no that I don't like how you're thinking


---------58:26----------
at all ok anyway I enjoy it I loved it


---------58:28----------
right but no just driving ladder being


---------58:31----------
doing that's a toxic thought process I


---------58:33----------
think I used to be on that thought


---------58:34----------
process what writing a lot it means


---------58:35----------
you're doing something and oh I'm seeing


---------58:37----------
this number get bigger but it's all it's


---------58:39----------
all just an abstraction of it you're


---------58:41----------
playing a game to have fun


---------58:42----------
if custom games are fun you should be


---------58:43----------
playing those if you need the number to


---------58:45----------
be growing to have fun there's a deeper


---------58:47----------
problem you need to step back from I


---------58:48----------
completely agree but I absolutely had


---------58:50----------
that deeper problem right where my sense


---------58:53----------
of value or self-worth was tied to like


---------58:55----------
just like even today you asked me what


---------58:58----------
rank was I in PvP right that has found


---------59:01----------
its annoying yet the thing is I I


---------59:03----------
wouldn't have been able to overcome this


---------59:05----------
problem and I'd still be stuck in the


---------59:06----------
loop of wanting to have a higher rating


---------59:08----------
if I didn't reach the highest rating yes


---------59:11----------
then there was nowhere else else to go


---------59:12----------
it was a point where Blizzard had to


---------59:14----------
patch the game so I could go higher


---------59:17----------
rated because I hit the cap first 9000


---------59:20----------
you couldn't go higher and they had to


---------59:22----------
actually make do up make a patch so


---------59:24----------
could get high rated I completely agree


---------59:26----------
I was actually person there this little


---------59:28----------
yeah yeah and this goes back to your art


---------59:31----------
gallery why would the I'm not trying to


---------59:36----------
do it just to brag I'm trying to say no


---------59:37----------
no I'm trying to say that I getting


---------59:39----------
there allowed me to step back and


---------59:41----------
realize oh I don't need to be on this


---------59:44----------
grind for the higher number forever I


---------59:46----------
should just play the game to enjoy it


---------59:48----------
it's really difficult


---------59:50----------
I completely claim because then you


---------59:52----------
don't end up playing as much if you're


---------59:54----------
not playing for the number to get bigger


---------59:56----------
you don't end up playing as much and


---------59:57----------
then you don't end up being as good and


---------59:59----------
mean when you're not as good you can't


---------60:01----------
play with those same teammates who are


---------60:03----------
really fun oh well my team has just


---------60:06----------
happened to be good as well I don't know


---------60:07----------
so reckful I'm gonna pause first and ask


---------60:10----------
ask you to apply what we're talking


---------60:13----------
about to what you're talking about okay


---------60:14----------
so when you came to this I'm trying to


---------60:21----------
figure out how to say this without you


---------60:22----------
didn't you understood this first in


---------60:25----------
terms of like why the grind is futile


---------60:27----------
and not a good investment of your time


---------60:29----------
and then you understood the logic of it


---------60:31----------
later right yeah like you came to a


---------60:37----------
realization and then afterward the logic


---------60:40----------
got into place but essentially the


---------60:42----------
realize you're right you're right okay


---------60:43----------
so now we get to like this issue of how


---------60:46----------
do we direct attention because it


---------60:47----------
doesn't come from the mind so you


---------60:49----------
realize something without actually using


---------60:52----------
your active thought process the reducing


---------60:54----------
it doesn't come from the mind what what


---------60:57----------
do we define where it comes from how is


---------60:59----------
just a word so we could have a go to


---------61:00----------
work consciousness simplest word


---------61:03----------
consciousness


---------61:04----------
okay so consciousness is the director of


---------61:06----------
the mind and yes and what so I think


---------61:11----------
there are different pieces but I think


---------61:13----------
generally speaking the mind so the


---------61:14----------
consciousness is the controller of the


---------61:15----------
mind consciousness is the controller of


---------61:17----------
the mind but we can be conscious without


---------61:19----------
mind when we meditate is what yes right


---------61:21----------
yeah okay so when we're conscious


---------61:24----------
without mind oh the consciousness never


---------61:27----------
directs anything other than the mind


---------61:28----------
though so just as it directs the one


---------61:30----------
thing and that thing can sometimes be


---------61:32----------
off with the other thing being on yeah I


---------61:34----------
mean so you could say that the


---------61:35----------
consciousness can also direct the body


---------61:37----------
because it's


---------61:38----------
our body functions without mental


---------61:40----------
thought right so there's directs the


---------61:44----------
body and the mind I've never really


---------61:46----------
thought about it like that but I I mean


---------61:47----------
I'm I like look about like this is very


---------61:48----------
cool right so we have consciousness


---------61:52----------
which is are actually consciousness


---------61:53----------
doesn't really uh it's true a sense


---------61:56----------
consciousness actually does not direct


---------61:57----------
anything all it is is consciousness is


---------61:59----------
our capacity for awareness consciousness


---------62:03----------
is our capacity for awareness


---------62:06----------
consciousness is where it sounds


---------62:08----------
intelligent as [ __ ] but I have to


---------62:09----------
understand what it means hold on


---------62:11----------
consciousness is our capacity for


---------62:13----------
awareness so reckful I'm starting to get


---------62:18----------
it I kind of a little bit get it I don't


---------62:19----------
okay so so so I want you to rub your


---------62:23----------
beard and just close your eyes and rub


---------62:25----------
your beard for a second and just feel


---------62:26----------
the sensation now you're noticing of the


---------62:31----------
sensation is that a thought I didn't


---------62:38----------
think anything but you're still


---------62:40----------
experiencing something right so that is


---------62:41----------
consciousness there's no thinking


---------62:44----------
there's no one analysis can come after


---------62:46----------
so you can have thoughts about it like


---------62:48----------
oh man like this feels raw for this


---------62:50----------
feels soft


---------62:51----------
all of those analytical thoughts are of


---------62:53----------
the mind but the actual noticing thing


---------62:55----------
is only the consciousness now I here's a


---------62:59----------
part where I'm not sure you're right


---------63:01----------
okay


---------63:07----------
I keep me mentioning on my stream all


---------63:13----------
the time that goes back to the split


---------63:14----------
brain experiment again he goes back to


---------63:17----------
the split brain experiment I could be


---------63:20----------
noticing things without thinking them


---------63:23----------
you'll see what the split brain patients


---------63:25----------
they'll like try to pick out their


---------63:25----------
article of clothing they want to wear


---------63:27----------
for the day and then the other hand will


---------63:29----------
knock it out and they'll pick something


---------63:30----------
else it's really yeah insane yeah then


---------63:34----------
it could just be that other side of the


---------63:35----------
brain though that is what is noticing


---------63:38----------
that I'm the right side of the brain


---------63:41----------
could be noticing that I'm rubbing my


---------63:42----------
beard


---------63:43----------
it doesn't thinking thoughts though


---------63:47----------
brain and mind in consciousness right so


---------63:50----------
to a conscious we're abstracting past


---------63:54----------
the brain we're not thinking about the


---------63:55----------
brain no because because consciousness


---------63:57----------
and mind are words that we use to


---------64:00----------
describe the experience of what goes on


---------64:02----------
in our head right there has nothing to


---------64:05----------
do with so I have no doubt that there is


---------64:07----------
a part of a brand alert I'm cocky but


---------64:09----------
sorry it's really hard so there's


---------64:11----------
absolutely a part of brain that


---------64:13----------
consciousness comes from and there's


---------64:15----------
absolutely a part of thoughts that


---------64:17----------
consciousness comes from okay


---------64:20----------
right we know that because when you


---------64:21----------
meditate we don't know where we I mean


---------64:23----------
you can't figure out what the [ __ ] does


---------64:25----------
consciousness come from that's the hard


---------64:26----------
problem right it's called the hard


---------64:27----------
problem well sort of but like I mean we


---------64:29----------
know that if you take a eg electrodes


---------64:31----------
and plug them up to your brain and as


---------64:33----------
you enter a state of meditation that


---------64:35----------
state is distinct from the state of


---------64:37----------
mental activity which is distinct from


---------64:39----------
the state of sleep which is distinct


---------64:40----------
from the state of dreaming right so we


---------64:42----------
know that these are all physical


---------64:44----------
representations those are the four


---------64:45----------
states that's it


---------64:46----------
I mean dreaming dreaming meditation


---------64:53----------
dreaming meditation sleeping and with


---------64:57----------
the normal


---------64:58----------
not consciousness thinking consciousness


---------65:00----------
okay thinking thinking is better not


---------65:02----------
consciousness so conscious consciousness


---------65:04----------
without thought is one so let's just


---------65:06----------
think about this you can have your


---------65:08----------
consciousness active and you can have


---------65:10----------
your mind active or you can have him


---------65:12----------
victim like I thought it again I thought


---------65:13----------
this [ __ ] [ __ ] but it's not


---------65:15----------
he's not a bad person why do I keep


---------65:19----------
thinking that what are you talking about


---------65:21----------
the construction there's a guy [ __ ]


---------65:23----------
doing construction above my head yeah


---------65:24----------
yeah right


---------65:30----------
reckful right now your mind is something


---------65:32----------
that that we call stimulus bound which


---------65:36----------
is that generally speaking your mind has


---------65:37----------
the capacity to filter out stimuli that


---------65:40----------
are not relevant to what you're doing


---------65:41----------
and as you as you become more stimulus


---------65:45----------
bound your capacity your minds ability


---------65:47----------
your brain's ability to filter out


---------65:49----------
stimuli it does it better when it's


---------65:51----------
regular and not irregular though you


---------65:53----------
completely agree so the stimulus found


---------65:56----------
is is attenuating a stimulus so if you


---------65:59----------
like walk into a room you'll notice that


---------66:01----------
people are talking and if you're in that


---------66:03----------
room and there's background chatter your


---------66:05----------
body your brain will acclimatize to that


---------66:07----------
stimulus and you'll stop noticing it


---------66:09----------
right that's normal that's actually how


---------66:11----------
meditation works by the way so what you


---------66:13----------
do with meditation is that I'll take


---------66:15----------
your headaches but yeah so as you know


---------66:17----------
as you put your attention on just one


---------66:19----------
thing so you can't empty your mind what


---------66:22----------
you can do is force your mind or try to


---------66:25----------
direct your mind to just notice one


---------66:27----------
thing and you can use one thought or one


---------66:30----------
sensation to push out everything else


---------66:32----------
and then over time your mind acclimatize


---------66:37----------
--is to that last thought and then that


---------66:39----------
goes away and then you're left with an


---------66:41----------
empty mind got it does that make sense


---------66:47----------
so as we we use the


---------66:49----------
to knock out all of the other thoughts


---------66:51----------
and if we do the practice long enough


---------66:53----------
eventually we'll even lose track of the


---------66:55----------
breath in the same way that you


---------66:57----------
acclimatize to other things and then


---------66:58----------
you're left with nothing but


---------67:00----------
consciousness so getting back to the


---------67:02----------
original question then how when you're


---------67:05----------
meditating do you go further than just


---------67:09----------
not thinking what is the next step the


---------67:15----------
best way I can describe it or what's


---------67:17----------
used as higher levels of consciousness


---------67:19----------
right so consciousness is not one thing


---------67:23----------
they're different in the same way that


---------67:25----------
mind has different states right so it


---------67:27----------
has anxiety fear excitement a high level


---------67:30----------
of activity a slow level of activity


---------67:32----------
like sitting back like enjoying things


---------67:34----------
being stressed out the mind has a lot of


---------67:37----------
different fluctuations and consciousness


---------67:39----------
in that way has different levels of


---------67:41----------
fluctuations I mean I wouldn't call them


---------67:42----------
fluctuations I think they're more teared


---------67:44----------
than just like lateral fluctuations but


---------67:46----------
there are different states of


---------67:47----------
consciousness so ok I know I would think


---------67:51----------
this is complete mumbo-jumbo except that


---------67:53----------
I've actually experienced a higher state


---------67:55----------
of consciousness so I'd know he's


---------67:56----------
talking about yeah so anyone who hasn't


---------67:58----------
experienced this so this goes back to


---------68:00----------
logic and knowledge right so you had


---------68:03----------
this realization about the wow ladder


---------68:05----------
and the grind and stuff like that and


---------68:07----------
then that realization can't come from


---------68:09----------
the mind it actually comes from


---------68:10----------
somewhere else and then your mind


---------68:12----------
understands that afterward if you think


---------68:14----------
about the breath practice and sorry if


---------68:17----------
I'm bouncing around too much but in the


---------68:19----------
breath practice you noticed something


---------68:21----------
about the breath and then you recruited


---------68:23----------
your mind to be able to explain it and


---------68:26----------
come up with the word parabola yes does


---------68:31----------
that make sense so that is consciousness


---------68:33----------
directing the mind to be like hey I want


---------68:37----------
you to tell me what this is or let's


---------68:38----------
think about this like let's understand


---------68:40----------
what we already know gross we got to


---------68:42----------
figure this out


---------68:43----------
exactly but you already have the answer


---------68:47----------
do i yeah because you but but the it's


---------68:50----------
not it's not the product of logic right


---------68:53----------
you figure it out first and then your


---------68:55----------
logical mind understands it afterward no


---------68:58----------
figure it out first you you feel like


---------69:00----------
you're close to figuring it out you know


---------69:02----------
the conclusion and then yes I mind to


---------69:04----------
clarify to make it very good because


---------69:08----------
figuring it out the that verb is more


---------69:12----------
mental activity but like you said you


---------69:14----------
you start with the conclusion which like


---------69:16----------
is actually kind of mind-blowing [ __ ]


---------69:18----------
him love talking you by the way is so


---------69:19----------
cool okay sorry that's okay I appreciate


---------69:26----------
the compliment it's just so for you


---------69:30----------
here's a big disconnect I think for


---------69:32----------
people on Twitch and you see you've


---------69:35----------
probably been talking to people similar


---------69:39----------
to you for a long time because you went


---------69:40----------
to I didn't go to it you went to a good


---------69:41----------
school and you're talking to colleagues


---------69:45----------
or you call them colleagues I don't know


---------69:48----------
you're in tears you're talking to peers


---------69:50----------
at a good school all the time


---------69:52----------
now with I went to UT Austin which is


---------69:54----------
like a pretty good school but it's also


---------69:55----------
like you know so oh you weren't here


---------69:59----------
yeah okay but we regard I'm regardless I


---------70:03----------
dropped out of high school right okay so


---------70:06----------
the only people I'm talking to are all


---------70:10----------
sitting at home playing games which is


---------70:13----------
fine but [ __ ] what am I trying to say


---------70:19----------
it sounds like you're making a


---------70:21----------
comparison of some kind of why is way


---------70:24----------
all of us gamers sitting on here on


---------70:26----------
Twitch we haven't heard we haven't


---------70:28----------
gotten to experience conversations like


---------70:30----------
the ones you have regularly I think okay


---------70:33----------
and then it's really nice as soon as I'm


---------70:35----------
in it Wow like I'm stimulated my mind is


---------70:38----------
stimulated I'm learning and you're


---------70:40----------
making it fun to learn for me and


---------70:42----------
usually it wasn't fun


---------70:44----------
well I'm glad you feel that way I would


---------70:47----------
also be I mean to be honest reckful I


---------70:51----------
think some of the most profound and


---------70:53----------
awesome conversations that I've had her


---------70:55----------
with gamers who are going nowhere in


---------70:56----------
life like you know III don't think you


---------70:59----------
need to be at a top-tier institution and


---------71:01----------
I firmly believe this like part of the


---------71:04----------
reason that I stream on Twitch it's


---------71:05----------
funny so I talk more about what I truly


---------71:08----------
believe on Twitch then I do at HMS


---------71:11----------
because I think the people here are more


---------71:14----------
open-minded willing to listen and able


---------71:16----------
to learn than people in like a top to


---------71:20----------
your academic institution do you think


---------71:21----------
you've learned anything from us for most


---------71:23----------
which people taunts really every single


---------71:26----------
day man cool you're learning something


---------71:30----------
for me absolutely you're not just saying


---------71:33----------
that


---------71:34----------
no okay so reckful think I probably a


---------71:39----------
second yeah I mean other than I think


---------71:41----------
it's something useful other than how to


---------71:42----------
use but you know the technology so


---------71:46----------
reckful let's pause for a second how am


---------71:48----------
I able to do what I am doing what makes


---------71:51----------
me good at this you can relate okay what


---------71:57----------
does that mean like how does one lot


---------72:01----------
that's not really what it is though I


---------72:04----------
don't [ __ ] know why you're good I


---------72:06----------
just know you are it's because you're


---------72:10----------
teaching me in this moment I don't I


---------72:13----------
don't believe that I maybe I have low


---------72:16----------
self-esteem or something no no you do it


---------72:18----------
maybe you have low self-esteem but


---------72:19----------
understand so like like this is me


---------72:21----------
getting XP for all of the other


---------72:23----------
conversations every response you give me


---------72:27----------
helps me understand like a future


---------72:30----------
conversation in a slightly different way


---------72:33----------
every person that I talked to helps me


---------72:35----------
understand the condition of humanity all


---------72:37----------
I think if I weren't me I could believe


---------72:39----------
you yeah and then we got to get to the


---------72:43----------
issue of like why you can't believe that


---------72:44----------
about yourself right why do you need


---------72:46----------
validation why do you talked about right


---------72:50----------
so where where despite all of your


---------72:52----------
amazing successes and being rectal


---------72:55----------
gladiator and doing this and doing that


---------72:56----------
and


---------72:57----------
and all the other stuff that you've done


---------72:59----------
successfully why is it that you cannot


---------73:01----------
vote is restful gladiator that that's


---------73:04----------
the video that I saw that was six


---------73:10----------
[ __ ] old yeah that's mm yeah nine


---------73:14----------
maybe they got taken down from YouTube


---------73:16----------
yeah


---------73:17----------
so despite all of these things despite


---------73:19----------
Blizzard having to patch the game so


---------73:21----------
that you can continue to grow why is it


---------73:23----------
that you can't believe this about


---------73:26----------
yourself why is it that you I believe


---------73:27----------
I'm good at I was good at that game why


---------73:30----------
do you not have inherent value and


---------73:32----------
yourself as a person I would love to


---------73:36----------
know that how long have you felt that


---------73:38----------
way my whole life I don't think long as


---------73:43----------
I can remember as long as I can remember


---------73:45----------
do you feel like your so you don't feel


---------73:47----------
like you're good enough it's not like


---------73:52----------
I'm going in for a test that I need to


---------73:54----------
be good enough for it it's just that I


---------73:57----------
don't I don't feel my value being added


---------74:01----------
just situations I feel like if I were


---------74:03----------
dead it'd be the same just one guy 7


---------74:11----------
billion people maybe almost 8 now who


---------74:14----------
knows I think we're sitting at 7.5 I'm


---------74:17----------
just gonna I'm gonna think for a second


---------74:19----------
okay


---------74:34----------
need more water - I know what happened


---------74:40----------
here but I didn't understand it right


---------74:41----------
away it's drinking almond milk yesterday


---------74:48----------
didn't clean this cup drink water out of


---------74:51----------
it and there's some gross looking [ __ ]


---------74:53----------
in here I was debating whether I show


---------74:55----------
you guys probably nobody wants to see


---------74:59----------
I'll just go clean the cup and drink yes


---------75:15----------
so I when you guys say something like


---------75:16----------
low self-esteem that's not a reason


---------75:18----------
that's a sin in them right like I mean


---------75:27----------
so not enough meditation is also


---------75:29----------
something that that's not the reason why


---------75:31----------
that's a solution potentially but it


---------75:34----------
doesn't help us understand like this is


---------75:36----------
an issue of diagnosis not of treatment


---------75:43----------
so possible right so the easy answer is


---------75:46----------
that this goes back to abandonment and


---------75:48----------
him losing his brother like that's


---------75:50----------
something that you know us psychiatrists


---------75:53----------
and therapists love to come back to is


---------75:55----------
defaulting to the answer of oh that's


---------75:57----------
the cause of all of his problems but I


---------75:59----------
think defaulting to his dad


---------76:01----------
I mean his brother is actually like


---------76:02----------
intellectually lazy and possibly doing


---------76:04----------
him into service


---------76:12----------
so arrogance deep inside it's not the


---------76:15----------
arrogance that's deep inside so


---------76:16----------
understand this when you have low


---------76:18----------
self-esteem


---------76:18----------
arrogance isn't deep inside arrogance is


---------76:20----------
on the outside and the low self-esteem


---------76:22----------
is on the inside that's what narcissism


---------76:24----------
is right a belief that other people


---------76:27----------
should treat you like you're the best in


---------76:29----------
the world and the belief in yourself


---------76:30----------
that you're the worst in the world


---------76:31----------
that's narcissism arrogance is on the


---------76:34----------
outside low self-esteem is on the inside


---------76:37----------
so it's not he's not deeply arrogant I


---------76:39----------
don't think so you very I don't know


---------76:41----------
with that if anyone's deeply arrogant


---------76:43----------
its me see you're not gonna see it


---------76:56----------
so bullied right open rifles chat okay


---------77:03----------
it's open okay so I could just not do


---------77:14----------
the construction but then I was thinking


---------77:15----------
about whether it's better to try to deal


---------77:18----------
with a construction you know what I'm


---------77:19----------
saying like to try to get used to it and


---------77:21----------
overcome what I'm hearing it okay what


---------77:25----------
do you think I crash in awhile I think


---------77:28----------
you should use noise cancelling


---------77:29----------
headphones I think you should be where


---------77:30----------
you are and don't confuse where you are


---------77:33----------
with where you want to go because those


---------77:35----------
are very different things and it takes


---------77:37----------
time to get to where you want to go I'm


---------77:38----------
confused where I am right so one day in


---------77:44----------
theory you would be able to do this


---------77:45----------
without noise cancelling headphones we


---------77:48----------
don't know how bad the construction is


---------77:49----------
but you shouldn't blame yourself for


---------77:51----------
wanting to use it I think it's smart


---------77:56----------
reckful do you know why everyone in your


---------77:59----------
and your chat is talking about [ __ ] wait


---------78:04----------
everybody might shut is talking about


---------78:05----------
[ __ ] yeah anyway what's Chuck can you


---------78:12----------
guys what happened today are you guys


---------78:15----------
okay


---------78:17----------
[ __ ] mm-hmm anyway let's date nobody I'm


---------78:25----------
just what you just did they they're so


---------78:27----------
happy that this happened what's now that


---------78:31----------
you noticed that they were spamming [ __ ]


---------78:33----------
that was the goal that's like they were


---------78:37----------
doing it okay


---------78:38----------
just they got you nice


---------78:41----------
it'll be the first not the first time


---------78:44----------
and not the last I'm just I'm still I'm


---------78:47----------
just a sad boomer trying to understand


---------78:49----------
twitch and I think I've discovered I


---------78:51----------
think I've di think I I don't I think


---------78:54----------
I've finally decoded pong by the way I


---------78:57----------
can't believe how many times you stutter


---------78:59----------
try to say that's really funny


---------79:06----------
absolutely alright so POG is just


---------79:09----------
something that you add randomly to the


---------79:11----------
end of other things right randomly yeah


---------79:16----------
I'm insulted it's like like so now I


---------79:21----------
would say insulted pong doesn't that


---------79:24----------
work yes but that's not random it


---------79:28----------
doesn't work to do it you could so that


---------79:31----------
I could say it's not random POG that


---------79:34----------
works too right yeah but okay the thing


---------79:39----------
is do you know do you know what being do


---------79:42----------
you know what being me on Twitch feels


---------79:43----------
like it feels like being in AI trying to


---------79:47----------
pass the Turing test that's funny it's


---------79:51----------
like I'm trying guys don't know that


---------79:54----------
Turing test is something to tell if an a


---------79:56----------
if something passes the Turing test me I


---------79:58----------
pass the Turing test it means you can't


---------79:59----------
tell it wasn't a human so I'm trying


---------80:02----------
really hard to not be a boomer and I


---------80:05----------
think I can mimic it but I really don't


---------80:07----------
understand it because at the end of the


---------80:09----------
day I'm not human and I'm just an AI so


---------80:13----------
then I would say just an AI POG they


---------80:16----------
always think I'm the one on psilocybin


---------80:18----------
that sentence was crazy right to it yeah


---------80:24----------
anyway so let's let's go let's try to


---------80:26----------
actually help you a little bit so so you


---------80:30----------
have this belief that you know you don't


---------80:32----------
have Val value I had value right now


---------80:36----------
teaching about twitch it's a little bit


---------80:38----------
right a little bit sure but I don't


---------80:40----------
usually feel like I have much value


---------80:43----------
um I wonder if it'll change as I do


---------80:47----------
bigger things but it's not doesn't seem


---------80:50----------
to be so like I've done a lot of things


---------80:52----------
in my life now especially now still


---------80:56----------
isn't changing that I don't feel like I


---------80:58----------
have value oh the only reason the only


---------81:01----------
reason why I'm sad I don't and I no


---------81:03----------
longer consider like jumping off the


---------81:06----------
hedge is because I think when I'm sad I


---------81:10----------
think about other people who would be


---------81:12----------
affected okay I'm glad that's keeping


---------81:16----------
you going and I want to actually this is


---------81:18----------
gonna be in a sense maybe way harder but


---------81:20----------
in a sense those people so those people


---------81:23----------
I'm adding value yes but I let's forget


---------81:27----------
about all that for a second I was gonna


---------81:29----------
say something that I think was a little


---------81:30----------
bit more complicated and harder to


---------81:32----------
digest but I will say this so there is a


---------81:34----------
difference between having value and


---------81:37----------
feeling like you have value yes mm-hmm


---------81:42----------
right so do you have value or do you


---------81:45----------
feel like you lack value I know


---------81:50----------
logically that I have value but I don't


---------81:54----------
feel it okay there are times when you


---------81:58----------
feel it right once in a while someone


---------82:00----------
will say man you really like I'll get


---------82:02----------
these even long emails actually like man


---------82:04----------
you really get you a lot recently


---------82:06----------
just tell him people tell me I changed


---------82:08----------
their life in a good way and then uh


---------82:11----------
while I'm reading it I'll feel valued


---------82:14----------
but then if I got a bunch of them that


---------82:16----------
day and they kind of blended together


---------82:18----------
then on the fifth one I read I wouldn't


---------82:20----------
feel value okay so now fine so I want


---------82:24----------
you to just notice that your sense of


---------82:26----------
value determines on is determined based


---------82:30----------
upon your feelings it's dependent on my


---------82:34----------
feelings my sense of value is dependent


---------82:38----------
on my feelings yes because you're


---------82:40----------
telling me that when you read something


---------82:41----------
I think it's dependent on other people's


---------82:44----------
feelings well that's true as well but


---------82:50----------
other people so I don't think it's


---------82:53----------
depend on other people's feelings


---------82:54----------
precisely so if we understand how the


---------82:56----------
mind works other people's behaviors make


---------82:58----------
you feel a certain way other people's


---------83:04----------
behaviors make me feel a certain way and


---------83:05----------
if they're giving me a positive feedback


---------83:08----------
a lot that I'm having a sense of


---------83:10----------
self-worth


---------83:12----------
yeah but the feeling is on your end it's


---------83:14----------
actually not their feeling it's your


---------83:16----------
feeling okay feeling was the wrong word


---------83:19----------
for it yeah right so so I first of all I


---------83:22----------
want you to stop and think for a moment


---------83:24----------
about whether one should can whether one


---------83:28----------
should base what they know on their


---------83:32----------
feelings whether one should base what


---------83:38----------
they know on their feelings no they


---------83:41----------
should not


---------83:41----------
okay so that's the first thing right so


---------83:45----------
there are different sources of knowledge


---------83:46----------
there is the there is something that I'm


---------83:48----------
gonna call intuition or realization or


---------83:52----------
consciousness or experience like that's


---------83:55----------
one bucket of knowledge that's called


---------83:56----------
neon so the Sanskrit word is neon G&Y


---------84:00----------
a.n okay the what word Sanskrit Sanskrit


---------84:04----------
yeah so for example reckful can you do


---------84:07----------
all that so I just remember Si and SK


---------84:10----------
RIT


---------84:10----------
Sanskrit yes that's in that word so do


---------84:16----------
you know what a strawberry tastes like


---------84:17----------
yeah what does it taste like


---------84:21----------
couldn't tell you in words but I know it


---------84:23----------
is


---------84:23----------
exactly that's neon right so when you


---------84:27----------
when we're thinking about whether


---------84:28----------
grinding to get to gladiator rank is


---------84:31----------
important or not important you had a


---------84:33----------
realization one day where you understood


---------84:36----------
a bunch of stuff you understood some na


---------84:38----------
what nya n g + y EI n g n yn it's a yawn


---------84:46----------
yeah there's like a weird sound you know


---------84:48----------
it has like nut that doesn't exist in


---------84:50----------
the English language chat notes or J and


---------84:53----------
J and yn is the other way they they get


---------84:55----------
strands to hit Y yeah I like the G okay


---------84:59----------
so yeah yes yeah it's like yin yang yang


---------85:04----------
we bowed Yan Yun but so one source of


---------85:11----------
knowledge is neon right so that's like


---------85:14----------
experience realization and sometimes


---------85:16----------
your mind catches up your thoughts catch


---------85:19----------
up once you figure something out like


---------85:21----------
you know that you figured it out it


---------85:22----------
takes some time for your mind to catch


---------85:24----------
up and be able to explain it or fully


---------85:26----------
understand it or like break it down into


---------85:28----------
pieces that the logical mind can


---------85:30----------
understand another source of of


---------85:32----------
knowledge is Vidya so Vidya VI dy a is


---------85:36----------
information is objective and is


---------85:39----------
transmissible so it's information is


---------85:43----------
subjective and it's transmissible yes


---------85:44----------
right so in a text book is full of Vidya


---------85:48----------
you can read a textbook through from


---------85:51----------
cover to cover and never understand


---------85:53----------
something yeah right you can memorize


---------85:55----------
without understanding


---------85:56----------
yeah just shitty videos in there right


---------85:58----------
and so the person who has neon can write


---------86:01----------
a textbook so you can have equals


---------86:04----------
mc-squared and understand what that


---------86:06----------
means and then you can write an entire


---------86:08----------
textbook does that make sense I can have


---------86:12----------
e equals mc-squared and our Senate that


---------86:14----------
means and I get right into our textbook


---------86:16----------
does that make sense


---------86:17----------
No


---------86:19----------
it does not okay so like you know we


---------86:22----------
have physics textbooks


---------86:23----------
and physics textbooks are designed


---------86:25----------
through doing video over and over again


---------86:28----------
as you do problems and equations and


---------86:29----------
stuff at some point hopefully you get a


---------86:31----------
light bulb when you're studying


---------86:32----------
something and then you get it it clicks


---------86:34----------
I mean once you it clicks you no longer


---------86:37----------
need the textbook in fact if a student


---------86:40----------
is struggling to understand it you can


---------86:42----------
go to them and you can explain to them


---------86:43----------
in a way that's better than the textbook


---------86:45----------
right yes


---------86:47----------
so neon is about like understanding the


---------86:49----------
core thing like you can explain this


---------86:50----------
concept of chase 11-ton actually neon is


---------86:54----------
the best neon is completely the best


---------86:55----------
completely agree our site yeah I always


---------86:58----------
feel like someone asked me what does


---------86:59----------
that taste like like what you did with


---------87:01----------
the strawberry and microphone was so


---------87:04----------
good at describing what something tastes


---------87:05----------
like it was so frustrating cuz you would


---------87:07----------
want me to describe in words what it


---------87:08----------
tasted like I'm I don't [ __ ] know I


---------87:10----------
know what it tastes like dude but yeah


---------87:12----------
tell you yeah so so now what we need to


---------87:17----------
do so that idea there's I want I want to


---------87:19----------
transfer a neon to someone else you


---------87:21----------
can't I know that be sick so so remember


---------87:24----------
I always said in technology Vidya is


---------87:26----------
objective transmissible and


---------87:29----------
informational said you can't I'll figure


---------87:32----------
it out 50 years from now I'll make a


---------87:34----------
technology you'll be like okay you have


---------87:36----------
to find so beyond is subjective not


---------87:39----------
transmissible although if you want to


---------87:41----------
develop a technology go for it I I'm


---------87:44----------
interrupting a reckful dude you guys are


---------87:45----------
so mad people think I'm so rude I


---------87:48----------
interrupted all the time it's just how I


---------87:50----------
talk


---------87:51----------
should I not do it wait let's like let's


---------87:53----------
see here his opinion what's your opinion


---------87:56----------
I think we should try to finish the


---------87:59----------
conversation instead of talking about


---------88:00----------
whether to interrupt or not that's funny


---------88:04----------
okay after so right so like we can say


---------88:09----------
interruption POG


---------88:12----------
know before but now we can god and


---------88:22----------
they're telling you the Boomer within me


---------88:25----------
is masquerading as whatever it is set to


---------88:28----------
it genna's and I'm pretending and I'm


---------88:31----------
hoping that no one notices


---------88:32----------
no one notices POG you just take a


---------88:35----------
random ass thing and you just Adam and


---------88:38----------
he said hog at the end it's not random


---------88:41----------
once you're actually good you can't say


---------88:43----------
like I think you could as soon as I say


---------88:46----------
it that'll be funny you can't say like


---------88:48----------
you can't say like clock from Santorini


---------88:52----------
POG but wouldn't that be a great but you


---------88:55----------
could that's the great POG clock from


---------88:59----------
Santorini Prague is the best part if


---------89:01----------
something is going to become a meme from


---------89:03----------
this show it is clock from Santorini POG


---------89:06----------
right maybe maybe he's right that you


---------89:09----------
can actually take anything I maybe I was


---------89:12----------
thinking too deep it like specifics you


---------89:15----------
weren't thinking deep enough my friend


---------89:17----------
you're not deep enough


---------89:19----------
you're too shallow baby you gotta go


---------89:22----------
deeper to the essence of POG have neon


---------89:24----------
of POG reckful no no oil wait when you


---------89:27----------
say deep here's a question when you say


---------89:29----------
deep sometimes I mean deep into the


---------89:31----------
specifics and then there's a high level


---------89:34----------
version of thinking and there's


---------89:36----------
specifics but that there's depth to the


---------89:39----------
specifics you know what I'm saying yeah


---------89:41----------
and there's depth to the big picture


---------89:43----------
there's depth in both right yeah yeah


---------89:47----------
anyway so let's go back to or maybe this


---------89:51----------
is just a you know we can just call this


---------89:54----------
aborted fetus what it is but no Yong


---------89:57----------
Yong yeah so when it comes to you you


---------90:00----------
you don't have me on a value of yourself


---------90:05----------
so no amount of convincing will work and


---------90:09----------
has worked okay that hurt but it was


---------90:14----------
true right so what we need to do for you


---------90:16----------
is give you Y on a value of yourself


---------90:18----------
because once you have me on a value of


---------90:20----------
yourself no one can convince you


---------90:22----------
otherwise every they did that hurt okay


---------90:35----------
okay anyway I'm getting distracted I'm


---------90:40----------
closing the chat you guys fun okay okay


---------90:43----------
I closed it


---------90:46----------
so yeah I don't have the feeling um when


---------90:49----------
I eat a strawberry and I could tell you


---------90:51----------
what it tastes like I can't tell you


---------90:52----------
what it tastes like but I can I know


---------90:53----------
yeah I know it I can remember the taste


---------90:56----------
right now I don't have a memory of value


---------91:00----------
for myself in my head it's not memory a


---------91:03----------
real is a memory onion onion so to get


---------91:06----------
this thing out root and stem you must


---------91:09----------
hire and I don't believe that I will


---------91:11----------
ever have it of course not


---------91:13----------
I mean of course you would believe you


---------91:16----------
would never have it because you've never


---------91:17----------
had it right it's like it's not as


---------91:21----------
simple like it's hard to understand or


---------91:23----------
believe that you will ever know what a


---------91:25----------
strawberry tastes like I don't have


---------91:30----------
taste buds that so there's another piece


---------91:34----------
of this so the first is that we can


---------91:35----------
cultivate a practice for you where you


---------91:37----------
develop a sense of self outside of mind


---------91:41----------
and hopefully have a realization of your


---------91:42----------
true self that's something we can do the


---------91:46----------
second thing that we can do is


---------91:47----------
understand if you've had some kind of


---------91:49----------
experience or nyaan or some scar of


---------91:52----------
being value less weight other people


---------91:58----------
feel a value of themselves what does it


---------92:01----------
feel like the same way I mean like how


---------92:04----------
what does strawberry taste like it's you


---------92:07----------
just know that you have a value yeah so


---------92:11----------
and this is complicated but close your


---------92:12----------
eyes it's kind of it's kind of painful


---------92:17----------
to think that I don't have this thing


---------92:19----------
you really have a thing you can feel a


---------92:21----------
value of yourself you can just taste it


---------92:24----------
you know yeah analogy yeah I don't have


---------92:30----------
it here's the thing it doesn't taste


---------92:32----------
what people think it tastes like that's


---------92:35----------
what I would say right so people


---------92:37----------
build up this image of what it feels


---------92:40----------
like but I absolutely have neon of of my


---------92:44----------
value and the thing is it's not really


---------92:46----------
value value isn't even the right word


---------92:48----------
but like value is like the closest thing


---------92:51----------
in the mind so I want you to close your


---------92:52----------
eyes I'm not ready


---------93:19----------
okay I'm ready what were you feeling


---------93:21----------
reckful I don't know I was feeling sad


---------93:26----------
that I don't have any value to myself


---------93:30----------
that is something must be sad about yeah


---------93:34----------
and I close my eyes now and do the thing


---------93:37----------
that's okay let's just talk for a second


---------93:39----------
if that's okay with you


---------93:40----------
I just it's hard for me to just let that


---------93:43----------
slide of this you really want me to


---------93:45----------
let's let it slide for another okay so


---------93:48----------
close your eyes I want you to find the


---------93:51----------
moment where inhalation becomes


---------93:52----------
exhalation and I want you to try for


---------94:01----------
nine breaths and make them as slow as


---------94:05----------
possible good


---------94:10----------
notice the feelings as they arise and


---------94:12----------
return your attention to the breath


---------94:15----------
there's a tsunami of sadness inside you


---------94:21----------
and I want you to breathe and notice


---------94:24----------
that in between space you don't have to


---------94:30----------
push the tsunami away you can let it


---------94:32----------
come and just breathe


---------94:34----------
find that moment between inhalation and


---------94:36----------
exhalation find the parabola


---------95:01----------
be patient with yourself if you have

---------98:26----------
right there's the inhalation and the


---------98:28----------
exhalation the inhalation and the


---------98:33----------
exhalation you really like that I use


---------98:37----------
the word parabola are you just using it


---------98:39----------
over and over for fun I think it's a


---------98:40----------
very good way of describing with Vidya


---------98:43----------
Yan that means you understand that that


---------98:46----------
means you have young


---------98:51----------
dude is feeling focus repple eyes closed


---------98:56----------
don't reflect on yon just focus on the


---------98:58----------
parabola okay and in the middle of the


---------99:03----------
parabola zoom in now this is your three


---------99:06----------
more breaths in the middle of the


---------99:07----------
parabola ask yourself if the person that


---------99:10----------
is noticing the parabola does that


---------99:13----------
person have value my answer was no


---------99:20----------
two more breaths okay I think now open


---------99:39----------
your eyes I think it's hard


---------99:56----------
someone who's attempted suicide to find


---------100:00----------
value in yourself what did you feel


---------100:03----------
don't presume an answer tell me what you


---------100:06----------
felt I don't feel anything so this is


---------100:18----------
gonna sound kind of weird did you find


---------100:20----------
value in yourself yes or no no no no I


---------100:24----------
stopped feeling geez I always feel like


---------100:26----------
things there was erupting like you said


---------100:27----------
and then I stopped feeling anything and


---------100:30----------
you were unable to find value in


---------100:32----------
yourself correct mm-hmm is that a


---------100:36----------
problem you're telling me it is that I


---------100:39----------
know no I'm not just what how does it


---------100:41----------
feel in that moment to be unable to find


---------100:43----------
value is that a problem in that moment


---------100:46----------
did you feel distressed no I was okay


---------100:50----------
how is that possible how can you be okay


---------100:54----------
when you look within yourself and you do


---------100:57----------
not find value because I'm just


---------101:02----------
conscious and not thinking so if I'm


---------101:06----------
thinking it's not okay but if I'm not


---------101:08----------
thinking


---------101:13----------
worry about that yes it doesn't mean


---------101:17----------
that you're worthless it doesn't mean


---------101:18----------
that suicide is a good idea it doesn't


---------101:20----------
mean that you won't hurt people but at


---------101:22----------
its core what you were feeling


---------101:26----------
transcends the concept of value or lack


---------101:29----------
of value it is just what is


---------101:33----------
consciousness pure and simple there are


---------101:37----------
eruptions all around you and there is a


---------101:39----------
person who is meditating on a rock and


---------101:42----------
you can find that person and you cannot


---------101:45----------
find value because value in and of


---------101:47----------
itself is of the mind true and you can


---------101:50----------
be peaceful in the absence of value hmm


---------101:56----------
train yourself to be peaceful in that


---------101:58----------
place and whether you feel value or you


---------102:00----------
don't feel value underneath you will be


---------102:03----------
tranquil you don't need value because


---------102:09----------
value is a feeling it comes and it goes


---------102:11----------
it is not gone what you just experienced


---------102:14----------
is just a fraction of yon practice this


---------102:16----------
every single [ __ ] day get good at it


---------102:20----------
and you will be a changed person find a


---------102:26----------
place of tranquility and stability


---------102:28----------
amidst everything that is erupting


---------102:30----------
around you and you can [ __ ] find it


---------102:34----------
so let's say I'm alone


---------102:36----------
that's okay most of my day times I


---------102:38----------
really enjoy the day I wake up it's nice


---------102:41----------
outside and I go for a walk and I've


---------102:43----------
been I've been taking the little


---------102:45----------
pictures and videos and you know I like


---------102:47----------
photography and just just loving good


---------102:52----------
okay and then I come back from my walk


---------102:55----------
and I just work on everland for a while


---------102:58----------
and I love that too and all the people I


---------103:01----------
talk to you I love them all the


---------103:04----------
nighttime roll


---------103:05----------
around and people stopped working on the


---------103:08----------
game which is reasonable then I try to


---------103:13----------
transition into a different I mean I


---------103:17----------
have to transition into enjoying


---------103:19----------
something else that's not walking


---------103:21----------
outside and it's sunshine which I like


---------103:22----------
or working on ever led which I like and


---------103:25----------
then I don't have anything to do when


---------103:29----------
it's night time so I'll message reach


---------103:33----------
out to a lot of people to hang out with


---------103:34----------
me and I'm really overbearing about it


---------103:41----------
I'm just like please hang out with me


---------103:43----------
like I'm so [ __ ] bored like I was


---------103:44----------
messaging Greek my friend just like


---------103:46----------
please [ __ ] hang out the police and


---------103:48----------
he's like I'm really busy like tomorrow


---------103:49----------
I have that do something I have to do


---------103:51----------
this I'm sorry like I really love you


---------103:52----------
but I can't right now you know that's


---------103:55----------
reasonable what are you saying what I'm


---------103:56----------
just like so desperate to hang out I


---------103:59----------
just want something to do at nighttime


---------104:02----------
it's scary to be there and I'd love to


---------104:06----------
be able to go into my own world like


---------104:08----------
this and be okay with being alone I


---------104:13----------
don't know that I can reach achieve it


---------104:15----------
you know well I beg to differ because


---------104:20----------
you say like this right you can't use


---------104:25----------
that with guidance yeah yeah but but the


---------104:28----------
point is that you're doing it you're not


---------104:31----------
saying you useless believe it myself


---------104:33----------
I don't believe myself to buy it alone


---------104:34----------
forget it forget it forget about all


---------104:36----------
that the one thing that I want you to


---------104:38----------
point out is before you were talking


---------104:40----------
about hypothetical you were saying I


---------104:41----------
wish I could find a place like that I


---------104:44----------
wish I could have what you have and it's


---------104:46----------
sad to not have it you're saying I wish


---------104:48----------
I could be like that I wish I could have


---------104:51----------
that and now you are saying like this


---------104:57----------
true it's a good stuff very important


---------105:01----------
stuff in fact it is the only step oh I'm


---------105:05----------
getting somewhere


---------105:06----------
you're getting everywhere reckful well


---------105:09----------
this


---------105:10----------
already there do you understand what the


---------105:12----------
word this means this means right in


---------105:15----------
front of you it means not far away


---------105:17----------
that's true you've just felt it you need


---------105:22----------
to cultivate within yourself the


---------105:24----------
capacity to get to the state over and


---------105:26----------
over and over again that takes practice


---------105:32----------
yes it's why for me to get myself to sit


---------105:34----------
down and just breathe when I'm feeling


---------105:36----------
overwhelming loneliness it's just like


---------105:37----------
my brain yes knowing all these thoughts


---------105:40----------
are so strong there's just so many but


---------105:43----------
just telling me like why are you alone


---------105:45----------
and why does no one want to hang out


---------105:47----------
with you all thoughts all thoughts all


---------105:50----------
thoughts not consciousness not


---------105:53----------
consciousness right so train yourself to


---------105:56----------
be in consciousness practically go to a


---------105:58----------
yoga class do you do yoga


---------106:00----------
no but there's actually a yoga class


---------106:02----------
immediately next to me so go to the yoga


---------106:06----------
class and if you want I want to go with


---------106:08----------
someone I don't want to go by myself


---------106:09----------
well you have a friend okay so start


---------106:12----------
going with a friend but at some point


---------106:13----------
you got to start going by yourself I


---------106:15----------
can't do it yet okay that's okay so


---------106:18----------
you'll get there right you'll get there


---------106:22----------

---------106:29----------

---------106:37----------
yourself be compassionate of yourself

---------106:43----------
hope people watching benefit it also yes
