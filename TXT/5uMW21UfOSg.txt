---------00:00----------

---------00:03----------
idea of like a sociopath where it

becomes all about


---------00:05----------
mimicking the behaviors where you have


---------00:07----------
to put all this thought into like


---------00:08----------
okay i put my arm here this indicates


---------00:11----------

---------00:55----------
uh so yes i i focus a lot on charity


---------01:00----------
um it's it's one of the things that i've


---------01:02----------
really found to just help with my own


---------01:04----------
mental health


---------01:05----------
and in fact one of the things that they


---------01:06----------
recommend is helping others tends to be


---------01:08----------
like that the best way to kind of just


---------01:10----------
deal with your own problems and kind of


---------01:13----------
you know get a lot of that um intrinsic


---------01:15----------
value


---------01:16----------
okay so i've been doing that a lot um


---------01:19----------
you can find me at


---------01:20----------
twitch.tv mephisto i mainly play a lot


---------01:23----------
of world of warcraft


---------01:24----------
uh things like speed running collecting


---------01:28----------
i really really enjoy collecting things


---------01:30----------
that that sense of completion is really


---------01:32----------
satisfying


---------01:34----------
cool thanks a lot and um is there


---------01:37----------
something in particular that you wanted


---------01:38----------
to talk about today des


---------01:40----------
um so really i just want to go ahead and


---------01:44----------
get across


---------01:45----------
what autism is i want to kind of engage


---------01:48----------
with the the community and


---------01:50----------
help create some understanding of


---------01:53----------
um that that concept especially like


---------01:56----------
when


---------01:57----------
i didn't get diagnosed until i was 29


---------01:59----------
and what i thought autism


---------02:00----------
was growing up as a kid isn't


---------02:03----------
what it turned out to be and then there


---------02:06----------
there's the whole issue of things like


---------02:08----------
aba and there's there's this big charity


---------02:12----------
event going on right now


---------02:14----------
that is uh color the spectrum which i


---------02:17----------
think is sending out a lot of


---------02:18----------
mixed messages about what autism is


---------02:23----------
and is more so hurtful to autistics


---------02:27----------
rather than helpful


---------02:28----------
interesting so um a lot of


---------02:31----------
so okay so that that sounds


---------02:35----------
uh like a great structure des do you


---------02:37----------
mind if i ask you


---------02:39----------
um just throughout this conversation i


---------02:41----------
think a lot of times the way that we try


---------02:42----------
to illustrate things


---------02:44----------
is by asking people sort of like


---------02:46----------
personal questions about their


---------02:48----------
experience


---------02:49----------
of a particular thing whether it be like


---------02:51----------
you know


---------02:53----------
dealing with um you know toxicity and


---------02:56----------
gaming


---------02:56----------
or you know dealing with depression


---------02:58----------
things like that is it okay if i ask you


---------03:01----------
um you know personal questions about


---------03:04----------
what your


---------03:04----------
experience of autism is things like that


---------03:08----------
yes that's completely fine in fact i


---------03:12----------
um recently there was a video that just


---------03:15----------
went viral of a bpd per individual


---------03:19----------
who um was hitting themselves in the


---------03:22----------
head repeatedly after being


---------03:24----------
harassed by a customer and that video


---------03:28----------
gave me the strength to actually post a


---------03:31----------
video of me having an autistic meltdown


---------03:33----------
on stream


---------03:34----------
um so i'm i'm very very open


---------03:38----------
to to answer anything personal or to do


---------03:40----------
that because i see this as a way of


---------03:43----------
helping others


---------03:46----------
yeah and and just you know for


---------03:48----------
clarification if i ever ask you anything


---------03:51----------
that


---------03:52----------
um you don't feel is appropriate or you


---------03:54----------
don't feel comfortable answering


---------03:55----------
you know please just signal that to me


---------03:57----------
in some way if i


---------03:59----------
detect from you that maybe we're talking


---------04:01----------
about things that could be making you


---------04:02----------
uncomfortable i may point it out to you


---------04:05----------
um and you know at the end of the day


---------04:07----------
like we're really here to


---------04:08----------
help people but i don't want you to hurt


---------04:10----------
yourself or sacrifice anything


---------04:12----------
for the sake of the greater good okay


---------04:15----------
if i do so it's it's of my own volition


---------04:18----------
i understand to make a difference


---------04:21----------
pain is kind of necessary at times but


---------04:24----------
it's important to recognize that i


---------04:26----------
choose that not that it's it's something


---------04:28----------
i'm unwilling of


---------04:30----------
yeah that's a that's a pretty profound


---------04:32----------
statement that pain is necessary


---------04:34----------
sometimes to make a difference


---------04:36----------
can you help me understand that


---------04:39----------
um being like like being open about


---------04:42----------
autism


---------04:43----------
like using my life as a kind of open


---------04:47----------
book to help others


---------04:48----------
one of the things that i've enjoyed most


---------04:50----------
about streaming is having


---------04:52----------
um individuals who didn't realize they


---------04:55----------
themselves were autistic


---------04:58----------
and after saying and hearing my story


---------05:00----------
and everything that i talked about make


---------05:01----------
that connection they go and see a


---------05:02----------
therapist


---------05:03----------
they go through the practice and then


---------05:05----------
they get diagnosed themselves


---------05:07----------
right it's it puts you in these


---------05:09----------
positions where


---------05:10----------
you know i really wish i didn't have to


---------05:12----------
open up about this but


---------05:13----------
it really also at the same time helps a


---------05:16----------
lot of people


---------05:18----------
what makes you not want to open up about


---------05:20----------
it


---------05:21----------
um it's it's it's


---------05:26----------
there is a lot of negativity that can


---------05:28----------
come from these things i mean


---------05:29----------
for example the the sharing the the


---------05:32----------
video of


---------05:33----------
myself having an autistic meltdown where


---------05:35----------
i i repeatedly punched myself in the


---------05:37----------
head


---------05:39----------
it's it's scary right it's a scary thing


---------05:42----------
to witness


---------05:43----------
it's something that could potentially


---------05:45----------
make future


---------05:46----------
job opportunities impossible


---------05:50----------
and i understand though that


---------05:54----------
these things have value and that they


---------05:56----------
can help others


---------05:58----------
and like it it's the hard thing where


---------06:02----------
i know i can handle it i know that if


---------06:05----------
things


---------06:06----------
go bad i can at least


---------06:10----------
i'm sure i can find a way to recover


---------06:12----------
from it whereas


---------06:14----------
go ahead i was just going to say so


---------06:17----------
you've mentioned


---------06:18----------
autistic breakdown or meltdown a couple


---------06:21----------
of times now and


---------06:22----------
and apparently you were um you know


---------06:24----------
hitting yourself


---------06:26----------
can you help us understand what you mean


---------06:28----------
by that term


---------06:29----------
so an autistic meltdown is


---------06:33----------
i would say in some ways it's similar to


---------06:35----------
like the the common understanding of a


---------06:37----------
meltdown


---------06:38----------
in a neurotypical individual where


---------06:41----------
everything is at its absolute worst


---------06:44----------
um in that you can't really process


---------06:47----------
anything going on


---------06:49----------
um at least to my understanding and for


---------06:52----------
myself


---------06:54----------
basically it's like everything ceases to


---------06:57----------
function the brain goes straight


---------06:59----------
into the fight or flight system but it


---------07:02----------
doesn't have a way to channel it


---------07:05----------
so everything just kind of


---------07:09----------
blows up and as a result


---------07:12----------
i i can't think i can't function one of


---------07:16----------
the


---------07:16----------
the negative stems that i have to tends


---------07:19----------
to just be


---------07:19----------
punching myself in the head because i'm


---------07:21----------
so overwhelmed


---------07:23----------
um it's taken a lot of practice and a


---------07:27----------
lot of awareness


---------07:28----------
to to be able to recognize the only way


---------07:31----------
that i can stop these things is to be


---------07:33----------
aware that i've reached the point


---------07:34----------
of that i'm going to be overwhelmed


---------07:37----------
sooner


---------07:39----------
rather than when it already happens so


---------07:40----------
it requires a great deal


---------07:42----------
of self-awareness to avoid these


---------07:44----------
situations


---------07:46----------
and can you share at all like what your


---------07:49----------
experience of being in in a meltdown is


---------07:52----------
like


---------07:56----------
it's


---------07:59----------
it's it's like


---------08:02----------
it's it's almost like i guess a panic


---------08:04----------
attack well maybe not a panic attack but


---------08:09----------
it's it's a blur right so like i i don't


---------08:12----------
really have any cognitive processing


---------08:14----------
over what's going on i don't really


---------08:16----------
understand what's happening


---------08:17----------
um it it just


---------08:21----------
it it is yeah and


---------08:24----------
yeah it's it's really hard to like


---------08:27----------
know what's going on in those moments um


---------08:30----------
i try to basically it's


---------08:31----------
it's i don't want to say it's quite like


---------08:34----------
drowning but i do feel like there's


---------08:35----------
these little moments where i can get


---------08:36----------
that little breath of air


---------08:38----------
to try and move myself away from it


---------08:42----------
so of course sorry no go for it


---------08:45----------
um and of course like like the the


---------08:47----------
better i get at it


---------08:48----------
the more i can kind of shut those


---------08:50----------
feelings down which


---------08:51----------
would result in a shutdown which is kind


---------08:54----------
of like


---------08:56----------
it's it's like a momentary to pre well i


---------08:59----------
wouldn't call it momentary but


---------09:00----------
it's it's like this this depression or


---------09:03----------
this this weighted blanket


---------09:04----------
this sinking feeling where everything


---------09:07----------
just becomes super muted


---------09:09----------
um usually if i into that i'm


---------09:12----------
i'm out for like two three four hours


---------09:16----------
i'll just end up passing out


---------09:19----------
yeah so uh you know it's interesting


---------09:21----------
because what i'm hearing from you is


---------09:22----------
that


---------09:24----------
you know it takes a lot of awareness to


---------09:25----------
manage you know


---------09:27----------
preventing a meltdown but that when


---------09:29----------
you're actually in the meltdown you sort


---------09:31----------
of lose yourself


---------09:33----------
yes um and and you know sometimes on


---------09:37----------
on stream we'll kind of joke a little


---------09:39----------
bit about becoming an


---------09:40----------
anger elemental where like your


---------09:43----------
your personhood becomes like


---------09:46----------
dominated by a particular emotion and


---------09:49----------
then like some


---------09:50----------
people will be like anger personified or


---------09:52----------
shame


---------09:53----------
personified and you sort of become like


---------09:55----------
a shame elemental


---------09:56----------
and when i'm sort of hearing from you


---------09:58----------
just like i'm trying to put myself kind


---------09:59----------
of in your shoes it's that like


---------10:01----------
you are no longer there and you're just


---------10:03----------
dominated or overwhelmed you don't have


---------10:05----------
particular


---------10:06----------
cognitions or thought processes it


---------10:09----------
sounds like there's a lot of emotion


---------10:10----------
that you're experiencing


---------10:12----------
that's quite negative and you're not


---------10:14----------
really in control of your behaviors


---------10:17----------
necessarily either and that you kind of


---------10:19----------
like well


---------10:21----------
it almost reminds me a little bit of of


---------10:23----------
what i think about kind of


---------10:24----------
physiologically as like like a seizure


---------10:26----------
actually so you get this high


---------10:28----------
state of hyper excitation


---------10:31----------
of electrical signal followed by this


---------10:34----------
refractory period where everything kind


---------10:36----------
of shuts down


---------10:38----------
and yeah and it and it's really yeah you


---------10:41----------
wanted to say something sorry


---------10:42----------
oh no no yeah that's that's very yes


---------10:46----------
um and so can you tell us des a little


---------10:49----------
bit about like you said you were


---------10:50----------
diagnosed at the age of 29


---------10:52----------
and and you know what growing up was


---------10:54----------
like what you understood autism to be


---------10:56----------
um did you recognize in some way that


---------10:59----------
you may not have been neurotypical or


---------11:01----------
how did you understand that


---------11:03----------
sure um so in retrospect


---------11:07----------
like looking back years later especially


---------11:09----------
after my diagnosis


---------11:10----------
my my uncle um is


---------11:14----------
mentally challenged and also likely


---------11:16----------
undiagnosed with autism


---------11:18----------
um i had kind of


---------11:21----------
put myself through through


---------11:24----------
my own version of aba as a kid growing


---------11:27----------
up because


---------11:28----------
i saw the way he was treated um


---------11:32----------
my he was yelled at he was kind of


---------11:35----------
shamed he was dismissed he


---------11:38----------
would have love withheld from him based


---------11:40----------
on his behaviors so


---------11:42----------
every time i saw him walking back and


---------11:44----------
forth i did everything i could


---------11:46----------
to um to


---------11:51----------
avoid displaying those behaviors if you


---------11:53----------
know the the sound


---------11:55----------
of a spoon on a ceramic bowl was painful


---------11:59----------
to my ears


---------12:00----------
i would just grin and bear it because i


---------12:02----------
didn't want to display


---------12:04----------
his behavioral characteristics and be


---------12:06----------
treated the


---------12:07----------
the same way um


---------12:10----------
and go ahead yeah


---------12:14----------
sorry i i keep interrupting you um it's


---------12:16----------
okay


---------12:17----------
so i'm just so curious what were the


---------12:19----------
behaviors that you noticed in your uncle


---------12:22----------
that you didn't want to duplicate so so


---------12:25----------
the the rocking back and forth


---------12:27----------
the specific um uh reaction that sounds


---------12:32----------
the way that he interpreted or


---------12:34----------
interacted with


---------12:35----------
problems um and of course that that even


---------12:37----------
then extended


---------12:38----------
into um excitement so like things like


---------12:42----------
christmas i


---------12:43----------
began to immediately mute that behavior


---------12:45----------
as well


---------12:46----------
so instead of being excited about


---------12:47----------
christmas i was like oh it's just


---------12:49----------
christmas and i did this at a very young


---------12:51----------
age


---------12:52----------
because i i didn't want any of those


---------12:54----------
associated behaviors


---------12:56----------
which is i i think what resulted in just


---------12:59----------
a lot of


---------13:00----------
knowing and unknowing masking growing up


---------13:02----------
as a kid i was


---------13:03----------
originally diagnosed with adhd in third


---------13:06----------
grade


---------13:08----------
and then i i always knew something was


---------13:11----------
wrong


---------13:11----------
i just didn't understand what was wrong


---------13:15----------
um the best way i could describe it is i


---------13:18----------
always kind of felt like


---------13:21----------
everyone knew something i didn't know


---------13:24----------
like i i don't know how to like like


---------13:27----------
fully explain that but i always felt


---------13:28----------
like


---------13:31----------
i always just knew something was wrong


---------13:33----------
and it wasn't until


---------13:34----------
like i i graduated um college that i


---------13:37----------
started to experience


---------13:39----------
um what is known as autistic burnout


---------13:42----------
where


---------13:42----------
i lost a lot of my masking and abilities


---------13:46----------
to kind of do things things like driving


---------13:47----------
became hotter


---------13:48----------
um my um i that's when i ended up


---------13:52----------
getting diagnosed with


---------13:53----------
ocd pure o because i was having a lot of


---------13:56----------
intrusive thoughts very obsessive


---------13:58----------
um my anxiety started shooting through


---------14:00----------
the roof


---------14:02----------
um basically all the the kind of coping


---------14:04----------
mechanisms that i had learned how to


---------14:06----------
deal with throughout life they


---------14:08----------
all came crashing down which ended up


---------14:10----------
leading to the autism diagnosis


---------14:14----------
and then you mentioned that um you know


---------14:17----------
you started like muting or masking


---------14:19----------
particular behaviors


---------14:22----------
it sounds like that's a pretty like


---------14:23----------
subconscious process


---------14:25----------
is that fair to say uh it was both


---------14:28----------
conscious and subconscious


---------14:30----------
um i mean i i would probably


---------14:34----------
uh equate it to um


---------14:38----------
like instead of being the person to to


---------14:41----------
touch a hot stove to be like oh that's


---------14:43----------
hot i used


---------14:45----------
others to learn that so if i saw someone


---------14:48----------
else treat it a certain way


---------14:49----------
i was like okay i'm not going to be act


---------14:51----------
that way because i don't want to be


---------14:52----------
treated that way


---------14:54----------
um honestly i'd say that was kind of


---------14:56----------
like a lot of how i learned things was i


---------14:58----------
had to study other people to understand


---------15:01----------
those behaviors


---------15:03----------
yeah um so let me


---------15:06----------
do you mind explaining what aba is


---------15:08----------
because some people aren't familiar with


---------15:10----------
that


---------15:11----------
um so aba is a


---------15:14----------
psychological practice it's a therapy


---------15:17----------
where behaviors that are considered


---------15:22----------
undesirable are replaced with behaviors


---------15:25----------
that


---------15:26----------
are considered desirable it is i


---------15:28----------
wouldn't say basically like dog training


---------15:30----------
but very similar


---------15:32----------
um that that idea of like say


---------15:36----------
if you wanted to get a person to make


---------15:38----------
eye contact


---------15:39----------
you you they used to be that you would


---------15:42----------
punish them if they didn't make eye


---------15:44----------
contact now that they


---------15:46----------
they prefer kind of just uh reward


---------15:49----------
reinforcement


---------15:51----------
although at the same time there's a lot


---------15:53----------
of question well not a lot of questions


---------15:54----------
it's mostly an unethical practice


---------15:58----------
what um okay so let's let's take sort of


---------16:01----------
like


---------16:02----------
i'm gonna table some of the stuff about


---------16:04----------
aba


---------16:05----------
color the spectrum things like that i


---------16:07----------
think um des


---------16:08----------
it's very helpful i personally am


---------16:10----------
learning a lot talking to you and i'd


---------16:12----------
love to just hear more of your


---------16:14----------
raw experience because i i think you


---------16:17----------
know rather than using like terms and


---------16:18----------
stuff which we can definitely get to i


---------16:20----------
think that the


---------16:21----------
is like you said a lot of people with


---------16:23----------
autism feel like


---------16:24----------
you know everyone else is watching a


---------16:27----------
movie with the volume on


---------16:29----------
and like you can tell like you're still


---------16:32----------
watching the movie so you kind of know


---------16:33----------
what's going on like you can kind of


---------16:34----------
enjoy what's going on but it seems like


---------16:36----------
there's something that other people are


---------16:38----------
sort of getting that you don't seem to


---------16:39----------
have access to


---------16:41----------
i think that's that is such a good and


---------16:44----------
in some ways it's also devastating to


---------16:47----------
kind of hear people talk like that


---------16:48----------
but when i when i work with people with


---------16:50----------
autism like i think that's such a


---------16:52----------
beautiful way to describe their


---------16:53----------
experience


---------16:55----------
it's sort of like you know some people


---------16:57----------
just seem to know things that i don't


---------16:59----------
know i don't know exactly what i'm


---------17:01----------
missing because you can try to be like


---------17:03----------
calculating about it right like you can


---------17:05----------
kind of say like okay well


---------17:06----------
it's clearly not like you know i can


---------17:08----------
hear things and they can hear things


---------17:09----------
it's just


---------17:11----------
things seem to affect me differently or


---------17:13----------
other people


---------17:14----------
things seem easier for other people and


---------17:17----------
i don't know


---------17:18----------
why this has to be so hard for me


---------17:21----------
um those are kinds of the sentiments


---------17:24----------
that i've kind of come away with what do


---------17:25----------
you think


---------17:27----------
yes i absolutely agree with that uh


---------17:31----------
like just everything growing up like


---------17:34----------
making friends


---------17:35----------
interacting in school the interactions


---------17:38----------
teachers


---------17:39----------
like all these individual components


---------17:41----------
every single aspect felt like a struggle


---------17:43----------
because i


---------17:44----------
couldn't i couldn't connect i i


---------17:46----------
struggled to start making friends until


---------17:48----------
i was


---------17:49----------
21 22 and the way i went about it


---------17:53----------
was i sat down with a therapist and i


---------17:55----------
told my plan that i was gonna go to bars


---------17:58----------
i was going to sit there and i was just


---------17:59----------
going to


---------18:00----------
observe like i wouldn't have a phone or


---------18:01----------
anything i would just sit there and


---------18:02----------
watch everyone


---------18:04----------
to the point that i would become so


---------18:06----------
bored that the


---------18:07----------
the act of talking with someone would


---------18:10----------
kind of at least


---------18:11----------
compensate for the fear of interaction


---------18:13----------
to some degree as well


---------18:15----------
but also in that time i'd be watching


---------18:17----------
you know


---------18:18----------
how the body language displayed what


---------18:21----------
topics were they discussing


---------18:23----------
you know how how did they interact you


---------18:25----------
know like all these little components i


---------18:27----------
observed all that to try and


---------18:28----------
replicate um like i know it


---------18:32----------
maybe sounds weird but the idea of like


---------18:35----------
a sociopath where it becomes all about


---------18:37----------
mimicking the behaviors where you have


---------18:38----------
to put all this thought into like


---------18:40----------
okay i put my arm here this indicates


---------18:43----------
this behavior


---------18:44----------
like all those components into being


---------18:46----------
able to start trying to develop


---------18:48----------
friendships


---------18:49----------
yeah it sounds quite labor-intensive


---------18:54----------
and is it okay if i ask you one or two


---------18:56----------
more questions about your uncle


---------18:59----------
yes i i don't want to go too too


---------19:01----------
personal on my uncle since he's


---------19:03----------
not me and sure totally understand so so


---------19:05----------
this


---------19:06----------
um uh i'll also you know let me know i'm


---------19:08----------
i'm


---------19:09----------
asking for permission for a reason so


---------19:11----------
let me know if we skirt that boundary


---------19:12----------
but


---------19:13----------
what i'd like to understand is like you


---------19:15----------
know are there particular experiences


---------19:17----------
that


---------19:17----------
see so it sounds to me like you noticed


---------19:20----------
that your uncle behaved in certain ways


---------19:23----------
that maybe you shared certain tendencies


---------19:25----------
with him and then you started to mask or


---------19:27----------
mute those behaviors


---------19:29----------
did i understand that correctly yes and


---------19:31----------
i was wondering if you could just


---------19:33----------
illustrate for us like an experience


---------19:35----------
that you had where you saw something


---------19:37----------
and then you recognized like oh i


---------19:39----------
shouldn't actually act like that


---------19:42----------
um the one that oddly like the one that


---------19:46----------
stands on


---------19:46----------
my mind the most which is silly um


---------19:49----------
was literally how he held a fork uh


---------19:53----------
my my grandma yelled at him something


---------19:56----------
fierce


---------19:56----------
like like just just chewed him out of


---------19:58----------
like we were having dinner


---------20:00----------
and just the way that he held a fork um


---------20:03----------
because like he would hold the fork like


---------20:04----------
with his fist rather than like that


---------20:08----------
and that that just it's forever burned


---------20:12----------
in my memory


---------20:13----------
um i remember things like kim


---------20:15----------
complaining about the noises sound and


---------20:17----------
everyone just


---------20:18----------
doubling down on that sound so that like


---------20:20----------
they all started doing it


---------20:23----------
like like those little components and


---------20:25----------
seeing how how they were


---------20:28----------
how he was kind of treated was


---------20:31----------
like i i don't remember everything since


---------20:34----------
it was this this is


---------20:35----------
like i but those those are like two of


---------20:38----------
the things that are really just


---------20:40----------
burned into my memory yeah i i think


---------20:43----------
that's that was


---------20:43----------
exactly sort of what i was looking for


---------20:45----------
when i asked the question because i


---------20:46----------
think


---------20:47----------
a lot of times i'm trying to imagine


---------20:49----------
that i'm like a 15 year old autistic kid


---------20:51----------
right now or a kid with autism depending


---------20:53----------
on you know what


---------20:54----------
what's the appropriate way to describe


---------20:56----------
it um


---------20:58----------
and i think the challenge is that like


---------21:01----------
you know when we use technical terms


---------21:03----------
like


---------21:04----------
it doesn't actually capture people's


---------21:06----------
experience


---------21:08----------
and and i think the way that you're kind


---------21:09----------
of describing that like there are these


---------21:11----------
particular things which seem like a


---------21:13----------
little bit


---------21:14----------
you know unique or idiosyncratic but


---------21:16----------
then a lot of people like really


---------21:18----------
you know punish people for being a


---------21:20----------
little bit different


---------21:22----------
um or they don't it's just so foreign to


---------21:25----------
understand


---------21:26----------
that like um or have you ever heard of


---------21:28----------
misophonia


---------21:31----------
no so it's interesting so there's some


---------21:34----------
correlation potentially between i i


---------21:36----------
don't know if there's some


---------21:36----------
correlation but misophony is actually


---------21:38----------
like a


---------21:39----------
a neurological illness or disorder


---------21:43----------
where benign sounds cause people like


---------21:46----------
excruciating pain


---------21:47----------
and what i'm hearing from you is that


---------21:49----------
that there are particular sounds which


---------21:51----------
feel


---------21:52----------
very like almost painful to you and it


---------21:54----------
reminds me of


---------21:55----------
actually misophonia but um yeah so thank


---------21:59----------
you for sharing that because i think


---------22:00----------
that really illustrates it


---------22:01----------
and and what did you notice about


---------22:03----------
yourself that was different


---------22:07----------
one of the major things well it's one of


---------22:10----------
those things like looking back on it now


---------22:12----------
that you noticed that it was different


---------22:14----------
but like for example always wearing a


---------22:17----------
beanie i've always been wearing shorts


---------22:19----------
um i think i got diagnosed with sensory


---------22:21----------
processing processing disorder fairly


---------22:24----------
early on


---------22:25----------
um i i vaguely remember going to therapy


---------22:28----------
for it


---------22:30----------
uh but it's it's more of these things


---------22:32----------
where you look


---------22:33----------
back and you start to realize when


---------22:35----------
you're growing up as a kid you don't


---------22:37----------
necessarily


---------22:38----------
necessarily think you know oh this is


---------22:41----------
wrong it's


---------22:42----------
why is this so hard why why is it so


---------22:45----------
easy for everyone else


---------22:46----------
why can't i accomplish what they're


---------22:48----------
accomplishing


---------22:50----------
it's hard to realize like i i didn't


---------22:53----------
grow up in the the


---------22:55----------
best of households and for me while


---------22:57----------
growing up through that i thought that


---------22:58----------
was normal


---------22:59----------
it wasn't until you know even when like


---------23:02----------
visiting other places where it was much


---------23:04----------
nicer and everything


---------23:05----------
i like that was the abnormality to me it


---------23:08----------
wasn't until i grew up


---------23:09----------
and you know met my wife and i started


---------23:11----------
to realize like


---------23:13----------
oh that's this this isn't normal


---------23:16----------
and so it's it's kind of that that uh


---------23:20----------
you don't really notice it when you're


---------23:21----------
in there um


---------23:23----------
i kind of forgot the question though


---------23:25----------
that's totally cool i


---------23:26----------
i i loved your answer um so let me just


---------23:29----------
ask


---------23:30----------
a different one what what uh what was


---------23:32----------
growing up like for you


---------23:38----------
it was hard um


---------23:41----------
it was it was hard uh


---------23:45----------
friendships were really difficult the


---------23:47----------
friendships that i


---------23:48----------
did make often resulted in harm to


---------23:51----------
myself


---------23:52----------
so um people who i hung out with


---------23:57----------
would end up abusing me


---------24:01----------
um like i i would i'd been hidden in the


---------24:04----------
head with a shovel


---------24:06----------
a razor scooter punched in the head


---------24:08----------
repeatedly


---------24:09----------
um i i even


---------24:13----------
i haven't had one instance and this this


---------24:15----------
isn't a pc gamer article so it's it's


---------24:19----------
um but i was even pissed on at one point


---------24:21----------
um


---------24:23----------
and these were people that i considered


---------24:26----------
friends because you know they they


---------24:29----------
interacted with me and


---------24:34----------
that was that was rough


---------24:37----------
um i actually caught a bit of asthma


---------24:39----------
gold's interview and i could even relate


---------24:41----------
to some of what he was talking about


---------24:43----------
well he specifically referenced it as


---------24:46----------
laziness i.e if a light bulb goes off in


---------24:48----------
a room


---------24:49----------
he he was oh i just won't use that room


---------24:52----------
anymore


---------24:53----------
um that's kind of the household that i


---------24:55----------
grew up in


---------24:56----------
so like if our our sink stopped working


---------25:00----------
we we just used the bathroom sink


---------25:01----------
instead so there was a point of time


---------25:03----------
where there was like five


---------25:04----------
or seven years where um our


---------25:08----------
our kitchen sink just wasn't used


---------25:14----------
yeah it's it it was rough


---------25:18----------
how does it feel to talk about things


---------25:19----------
like that yes


---------25:25----------
honestly it feels it feels like past


---------25:29----------
trauma


---------25:30----------
right where like i i went through this


---------25:32----------
i've talked with


---------25:33----------
with normal like not normal


---------25:36----------
numerous therapists about my experiences


---------25:40----------
growing up as a kid that kind of like


---------25:42----------
trauma and stuff and it


---------25:43----------
it is what it is it happened


---------25:47----------
it sucks but focus on the now


---------25:52----------
yeah yeah i can sort of i can sort of


---------25:55----------
detect your


---------25:56----------
um the imprint


---------26:00----------
of therapy and all the work that you've


---------26:01----------
done in the way that you talk about it


---------26:03----------
you know i i think that there's i'm


---------26:05----------
hearing a lot of acceptance


---------26:07----------
i'm not hearing a whole lot of excuses


---------26:09----------
or defensiveness


---------26:12----------
um which is which is interesting because


---------26:14----------
a lot of times you know when people will


---------26:15----------
talk about


---------26:16----------
their upbringing and like or the


---------26:18----------
negative things that potentially their


---------26:20----------
parents or loved ones used to do there


---------26:22----------
will be a lot of like caveats excuses


---------26:25----------
you know balancing the equation oh my


---------26:28----------
parents


---------26:29----------
did love me a lot things like that you


---------26:31----------
know and and i'm not really hearing a


---------26:33----------
whole lot of that from you which doesn't


---------26:34----------
you know i'm not getting the sense that


---------26:35----------
your parents were um abusive or


---------26:38----------
neglectful i mean maybe they were but


---------26:40----------
like


---------26:40----------
you know i'm not i'm not i think it's it


---------26:42----------
sounds like there were just a lot of


---------26:44----------
challenges in the household you know


---------26:47----------
it sounds like some of your caregivers


---------26:49----------
could have done a better job


---------26:52----------
it's definitely one of those tough


---------26:53----------
things my mom she


---------26:55----------
single mom all that my my father


---------26:59----------
uh who i actually finally got to meet


---------27:01----------
for the first time when i turned 30


---------27:03----------
which was interesting


---------27:04----------
um he was he was in prison and stuff so


---------27:07----------
it's


---------27:10----------
you know it is what it is it's best to


---------27:12----------
focus on the now


---------27:14----------
because like you can't do anything to


---------27:16----------
fix the pass you can do plenty to fix


---------27:18----------
the present


---------27:18----------
yeah what i'm hearing is that you kind


---------27:20----------
of spawned in a rough location


---------27:25----------
that that puts it well yeah actually


---------27:27----------
[Laughter]


---------27:29----------
didn't really get a winning spawn there


---------27:31----------
but


---------27:32----------
but you got to play from it right like


---------27:34----------
wherever you spawned you got to you know


---------27:36----------
you got to work with it absolutely and i


---------27:40----------
i feel i am plus i mean i feel like


---------27:42----------
where


---------27:43----------
where i spawned uh resulted in


---------27:46----------
me doing a lot of good yeah i mean hell


---------27:49----------
we've we've raised over


---------27:50----------
50 000 for charity since i've started


---------27:53----------
streaming which is just


---------27:54----------
wow that's amazing man like i never


---------27:58----------
thought someone


---------27:59----------
someone like me would be able to do so


---------28:01----------
much good


---------28:03----------
and who is someone like you


---------28:06----------
disabled like struggling like i've


---------28:08----------
always struggled to


---------28:09----------
do full-time employment that kind of


---------28:11----------
thing but i've always just


---------28:13----------
you know i never felt like i could


---------28:17----------
connect or fit in or do anything


---------28:20----------
and to suddenly be able to be like oh no


---------28:22----------
actually you found a place where things


---------28:24----------
are working


---------28:25----------
and you're actually doing a really good


---------28:26----------
job at it it


---------28:30----------
it really changes it's one of the things


---------28:31----------
i love about twitch


---------28:33----------
right where in a lot of instances where


---------28:35----------
you struggle in the world real world


---------28:36----------
especially as a disabled individual


---------28:38----------
to finally find a platform where your


---------28:41----------
disability isn't as much of a limiter as


---------28:43----------
it is in reality


---------28:44----------
i mean streaming is reality but you like


---------28:47----------
the


---------28:48----------
the real world so to speak yeah i think


---------28:51----------
there's a lot of interesting


---------28:52----------
philosophical


---------28:54----------
points there about you know what's the


---------28:55----------
real world what isn't


---------28:57----------
i'm curious um how do you feel about the


---------28:59----------
term disabled


---------29:01----------
uh i'm i'm personally fine with it i


---------29:05----------
i i understand that there's some some


---------29:07----------
backlash around the


---------29:09----------
the word and everything but i mean


---------29:14----------
it's hard not to refer to it as a


---------29:16----------
disability because i feel like it limits


---------29:18----------
me in so many ways going for my master's


---------29:20----------
program


---------29:21----------
that was a nightmare and


---------29:24----------
academia in general for for those of us


---------29:27----------
with with disabilities is almost an


---------29:29----------
impossibility


---------29:30----------
and then adding in covet into it and i


---------29:33----------
was completely wrecked i


---------29:34----------
i couldn't even i i finished my master's


---------29:37----------
program with the 4.0 but i couldn't


---------29:38----------
finish writing my thesis


---------29:40----------
because everything changed and i just


---------29:43----------
it was like there it just slipped


---------29:45----------
through my hands


---------29:47----------
interesting what what's made it hard can


---------29:50----------
you help us understand like you said


---------29:51----------
you've struggled to maintain full-time


---------29:53----------
employment what's made that hard


---------29:56----------
um a lot of it


---------29:59----------
is focusing


---------30:02----------
and maintaining a lot of the


---------30:04----------
interactions the


---------30:06----------
the social interactions everything that


---------30:07----------
goes in at work understanding like the


---------30:10----------
the the hierarchy and the systems that


---------30:13----------
are there and the clerks and the groups


---------30:15----------
in office politics that's what they're


---------30:17----------
called like like


---------30:18----------
navigating through all that was it


---------30:22----------
basically felt impossible um


---------30:25----------
there are certain tasks that you're


---------30:26----------
expected to be able to complete like


---------30:28----------
talking on a phone um i've learned


---------30:31----------
ways around it but it's difficult still


---------30:35----------
i really really really really hate


---------30:37----------
phones i do not like phones they are


---------30:39----------
such a just overwhelming sensory


---------30:42----------
especially phones ringing


---------30:44----------
and then of course you know like like


---------30:45----------
sometimes because a lot of workplaces


---------30:47----------
they don't give you


---------30:48----------
you space you're all kind of in like uh


---------30:50----------
enclosed so


---------30:52----------
things like um like i used to have


---------30:55----------
a a co-worker who would like


---------30:58----------
spam click their mouse to activate their


---------31:00----------
computer they're just like


---------31:01----------
click click click click click i could


---------31:03----------
not get any work done


---------31:04----------
i would have i would have noise


---------31:07----------
cancelling headphones and everything


---------31:09----------
or you know people come up behind you


---------31:11----------
start having full count conversations


---------31:13----------
there are so many components in


---------31:16----------
a workplace that you know neurotypicals


---------31:19----------
or just


---------31:20----------
normal individuals would be like oh


---------31:22----------
whatever like oh i can just cancel that


---------31:24----------
i


---------31:24----------
i can't um and


---------31:28----------
there there's also like when when i


---------31:31----------
reach these points of where i'm


---------31:32----------
completely overwhelmed like


---------31:34----------
hey if i keep pushing myself i'm going


---------31:36----------
to have a meltdown


---------31:38----------
work tends to not be a place where you


---------31:41----------
can go ahead and get the flexibility


---------31:42----------
necessary for that um and that that's


---------31:46----------
again one of the things that i love


---------31:48----------
about streaming


---------31:49----------
is it's like hey i've reached i'm like


---------31:52----------
nearing that point where i'm overwhelmed


---------31:53----------
i'm going to have a meltdown


---------31:55----------
and i can just stop like it's


---------31:58----------
sorry go ahead and i don't know i was


---------32:00----------
gonna say have you played darkest


---------32:01----------
dungeon


---------32:02----------
i have not i've always wanted to but i


---------32:05----------
i've never actually started


---------32:07----------
it it's interesting because here i've


---------32:09----------
never used a darkest dungeon analogy on


---------32:11----------
stream before but hearing kind of like


---------32:13----------
your workplace environment like i don't


---------32:14----------
know if you


---------32:15----------
are familiar with the mechanics but you


---------32:16----------
know you have an hp pool like any other


---------32:18----------
rpg


---------32:19----------
and then like essentially magic does


---------32:22----------
stress damage


---------32:23----------
and so this is like a reverse hp pool


---------32:25----------
where like it goes from zero to 200 and


---------32:27----------
if you hit 200 you die


---------32:29----------
and then like once you hit 100 like your


---------32:31----------
character gets like a pretty significant


---------32:33----------
debuff


---------32:34----------
what i'm almost hearing from you is that


---------32:36----------
there's like this stress like it's just


---------32:37----------
like darkest dungeon where


---------32:39----------
there's stuff that like racks up your


---------32:41----------
stress and then if it hits a certain


---------32:43----------
point


---------32:44----------
like you have a meltdown and you can


---------32:46----------
even


---------32:48----------
kind of use a lot of your like cognitive


---------32:51----------
energy or mana pool


---------32:52----------
to like suppress or like


---------32:56----------
kind of keep that stuff buried but it's


---------32:58----------
still like building up in the background


---------33:01----------
and if you force yourself into these


---------33:03----------
situations


---------33:04----------
you can kind of last for some amount of


---------33:06----------
time but i


---------33:08----------
it sounds like you know that meltdown or


---------33:10----------
burnout as you mentioned


---------33:11----------
you mentioned something about like


---------33:12----------
coping mechanism burn out


---------33:15----------
um i i forget what the term you used but


---------33:17----------
you said that you had like


---------33:19----------
the all of your autistic burnout yeah


---------33:22----------
um and and so it's it's bizarre but


---------33:26----------
that's kind of what i'm hearing is that


---------33:27----------
kind of fair


---------33:28----------
that like you could manage it for a


---------33:30----------
while but it really wouldn't get better


---------33:32----------
and then you


---------33:33----------
sort of it was too much for you to


---------33:34----------
handle yes


---------33:36----------
i think that's a good comparison um


---------33:40----------
specifically like it it's


---------33:43----------
we can kind of push ourselves and this


---------33:46----------
is one of the things that i had to learn


---------33:48----------
in my my master's program is how often i


---------33:50----------
had to say no


---------33:52----------
because if we push ourselves like i


---------33:55----------
i don't like hitting myself in the head


---------33:58----------
like it's it's


---------33:59----------
one it's it's not a pretty thing to see


---------34:02----------
and two


---------34:02----------
it's not very good for myself and so


---------34:06----------
i i had to start learning to say no more


---------34:09----------
often


---------34:10----------
even though like i wanted right like i


---------34:12----------
wanted to play everything i wanted to


---------34:13----------
get my master's degree i wanted to to


---------34:15----------
succeed in academia


---------34:17----------
i i understood that i


---------34:20----------
i had to just stop otherwise like it


---------34:24----------
would just get worse


---------34:25----------
and worse and these these meltdowns like


---------34:28----------
the the more i have them the more i push


---------34:30----------
myself


---------34:31----------
the the worse that it would get yeah


---------34:34----------
des what's it like to want something so


---------34:37----------
much and not be able to


---------34:38----------
do it


---------34:42----------
it sucks um i think we can all kind of


---------34:45----------
relate to that


---------34:46----------
um but i think it's also something that


---------34:49----------
we all have to come to terms with


---------34:50----------
that the the notion that we can become


---------34:53----------
anything


---------34:54----------
isn't a reality and that sometimes it's


---------34:57----------
best to pay attention to what we can do


---------35:00----------
and to strengthen that rather than


---------35:04----------
climb an impossible wall and i know that


---------35:07----------
i


---------35:07----------
i can you know get my masters i can get


---------35:10----------
my doctorates but it's going to be about


---------35:12----------
finding


---------35:13----------
um finding a program and


---------35:16----------
thing that works with me


---------35:20----------
desk bro i think how did you learn that


---------35:24----------
because i think like 99 of people out


---------35:27----------
there like


---------35:29----------
arguably myself included you know


---------35:33----------
have trouble learning the lesson of like


---------35:35----------
i want this so much but i may not be


---------35:37----------
able to get it


---------35:39----------
how do you believe me acceptance believe


---------35:41----------
me once you punch yourself


---------35:42----------
in the head enough times you learn


---------35:44----------
[Laughter]


---------35:46----------
um seriously though like like when when


---------35:49----------
you


---------35:50----------
reach those points where you you feel


---------35:53----------
yourself breaking you realize


---------35:55----------
something's going to to give right


---------35:58----------
and i i think that's kind of one of the


---------36:01----------
at least the the positive things


---------36:03----------
is um learning that


---------36:07----------
it was like i can't keep doing this i


---------36:09----------
got to find another way


---------36:11----------
the best way to describe my experiences


---------36:13----------
is


---------36:14----------
it's like trying to kool-aid man through


---------36:16----------
a bunch of walls and eventually you


---------36:17----------
can't kool-aid through the wall so you


---------36:19----------
have to find a way around it


---------36:20----------
yeah and yeah beautifully sad


---------36:24----------
yes you know it's it's also kind of


---------36:26----------
interesting


---------36:28----------
let me just think about this because you


---------36:29----------
mentioned the cycle which i think is


---------36:31----------
really important to understand


---------36:33----------
um which is like you know once you


---------36:35----------
kool-aid man through a wall or


---------36:37----------
or you know once you fail it's something


---------36:39----------
that you really want


---------36:40----------
it actually causes you to try to


---------36:42----------
kool-aid your way through more walls


---------36:44----------
right you dig deeper there's some amount


---------36:47----------
of


---------36:47----------
shame there's some amount of lack of


---------36:50----------
acceptance there's some amount of


---------36:51----------
attachment and wanting it


---------36:53----------
that you kind of like you like burn out


---------36:56----------
even more


---------36:57----------
like you try even harder you dig deeper


---------36:59----------
you push yourself more


---------37:00----------
because that's what we're sort of taught


---------37:01----------
to do right like don't ever give up


---------37:04----------
and where there's a will there's a way


---------37:07----------
and then so then what happens is


---------37:08----------
and the the crazy thing is that you can


---------37:10----------
kool-aid your way through a wall right


---------37:12----------
you can smash through things


---------37:13----------
by digging deep and then what happens is


---------37:15----------
people like


---------37:17----------
they dig deep and then they like they do


---------37:19----------
it they sort of succeed


---------37:20----------
even though they're like cannibalizing


---------37:23----------
themselves from the inside


---------37:25----------
and then they say okay this works right


---------37:27----------
because then they've been able to do it


---------37:28----------
and then they got what they wanted and


---------37:31----------
they're sort of not really paying


---------37:32----------
attention to the cost and then they


---------37:33----------
think to


---------37:34----------
themselves oh i can do this this is


---------37:37----------
possible


---------37:38----------
and that's almost what i find to be like


---------37:40----------
the most damning thing because it's sort


---------37:42----------
of like yeah it's possible but


---------37:44----------
what did you have to pay you know what's


---------37:46----------
the price that you pay


---------37:48----------
to get to where you are and then if they


---------37:50----------
fail again the whole cycle repeats and


---------37:51----------
they're like oh


---------37:52----------
if i had dug deeper if i had sacrificed


---------37:54----------
more if i had done more


---------37:56----------
if i wasn't just so messed up like if if


---------37:59----------
all of these things and then like the


---------38:00----------
cycle repeats and it repeats and repeats


---------38:03----------
and what i'm curious about is you know


---------38:05----------
when


---------38:05----------
when you are able to push yourself and


---------38:08----------
actually accomplish things


---------38:10----------
and then like when you fail and you sort


---------38:12----------
of like how did you get get out of that


---------38:14----------
cycle you know like because i i can sort


---------38:17----------
of see it going both ways one which is


---------38:18----------
like


---------38:19----------
you need to do better if you did better


---------38:21----------
you could do it


---------38:23----------
versus recognizing oh actually like


---------38:24----------
maybe i can't do that


---------38:28----------
yeah it's it's it's really hard to say


---------38:32----------
honestly the best way like the


---------38:35----------
the past ever since the diagnosis which


---------38:37----------
is it's been almost


---------38:39----------
four years now i feel especially like


---------38:41----------
every well


---------38:42----------
honestly the past five years have been a


---------38:44----------
blur like ever since i graduated college


---------38:46----------
everything's just kind of


---------38:49----------
it's it's i don't know like the the


---------38:54----------
the ability to grasp like what's


---------38:56----------
happened


---------38:57----------
feels less tangible than it did when i


---------39:00----------
was younger


---------39:03----------
but what i do know is each time i reach


---------39:07----------
the breaking point each time i hit a


---------39:09----------
wall


---------39:10----------
um it got harder and harder to kind of


---------39:13----------
break through and to keep going


---------39:16----------
and i i know that


---------39:20----------
eventually i was it was hurting myself


---------39:24----------
to to just


---------39:25----------
bash into the wall and so i


---------39:28----------
had to i had to start thinking about it


---------39:31----------
more critically i had to look at the


---------39:32----------
wall


---------39:33----------
and you know sometimes there there


---------39:36----------
actually happens to be a door right next


---------39:37----------
to the wall


---------39:38----------
sometimes i sometimes i have to


---------39:42----------
to you know maybe get scaling gear or


---------39:45----------
you know whatever their various option


---------39:48----------
because i


---------39:49----------
was literally like i was literally


---------39:52----------
killing myself so to speak by constantly


---------39:54----------
running into these walls


---------39:56----------
i think one of the the things that makes


---------39:58----------
it more apparent for those of us with


---------40:00----------
disabilities


---------40:01----------
is that we run into them more frequently


---------40:03----------
which


---------40:04----------
the more frequently that you run into it


---------40:07----------
you're going to be more aware


---------40:08----------
yeah whereas if it happens like you know


---------40:10----------
every six months every year


---------40:12----------
you might fall into that same trap where


---------40:15----------
you you i just gotta dig deeper i just


---------40:17----------
gotta dig deeper


---------40:18----------
so i really think that contributed a lot


---------40:21----------
is that it's that


---------40:23----------
when you have these problems you run


---------40:25----------
into them more frequently and


---------40:27----------
you learn faster so to speak yeah that's


---------40:31----------
it's so wise and also a little bit


---------40:33----------
damning because


---------40:34----------
kind of what i'm hearing for your answer


---------40:35----------
is like you know oh des like how did you


---------40:38----------
guys


---------40:39----------
you know figure out how to wipe rag i


---------40:43----------
mean


---------40:43----------
how to down ragnaros and it's like yeah


---------40:45----------
i wiped a whole lot


---------40:47----------
like other people may wipe every six


---------40:49----------
months to a year but i wiped like


---------40:51----------
once a week and and it's really hard to


---------40:55----------
say but


---------40:56----------
to listen to and to really think about


---------40:58----------
but i i do think that there's a lot of


---------40:59----------
value to sort of like


---------41:01----------
recognizing that maybe you're just like


---------41:03----------
more experienced at wiping


---------41:05----------
and and i don't know what that means for


---------41:07----------
people who are neurotypical who


---------41:08----------
encounter things


---------41:09----------
less frequently but i'm certainly


---------41:11----------
detecting a lot of like


---------41:13----------
you know awareness on your part and and


---------41:16----------
critical thinking and sort of


---------41:17----------
recognizing who you are accepting


---------41:20----------
yourself for who you are


---------41:21----------
um separating out maybe what you should


---------41:24----------
be


---------41:25----------
from what you are


---------41:28----------
and i think in in some ways it sounds


---------41:29----------
like you started that process very young


---------41:31----------
because you noticed when you were young


---------41:33----------
that like you were different from other


---------41:34----------
people


---------41:37----------
absolutely um what have been


---------41:40----------
how did you feel about getting an autism


---------41:42----------
diagnosis or what was that like for you


---------41:44----------
to get diagnosed with autism it was a


---------41:48----------
major relief to be honest


---------41:50----------
um it was it was a struggle


---------41:53----------
uh the the therapist and kind of


---------41:56----------
everything


---------41:58----------
they don't like diagnosing adults i was


---------42:01----------
autistic


---------42:02----------
um they they don't really see or at


---------42:05----------
least my therapist didn't really see


---------42:07----------
that the resources were


---------42:09----------
useful to diagnosing an autistic adult


---------42:12----------
um that you were seen as like taking


---------42:14----------
resources away from autistic children


---------42:16----------
that that's something that could be you


---------42:18----------
know benefiting someone that they could


---------42:20----------
help


---------42:20----------
because once you're an adult there's


---------42:22----------
there's no support network there's


---------42:23----------
nothing that can really be


---------42:24----------
done um which is part of what led me


---------42:27----------
into charity because that's that's


---------42:29----------
literally horrifying to realize


---------42:31----------
okay you invest so heavily in autistic


---------42:34----------
children


---------42:35----------
and then it's just like well it's


---------42:37----------
someone else's problem now


---------42:38----------
right it's like building a beautiful


---------42:41----------
garden


---------42:42----------
and it's like ah we'll let the weeds


---------42:43----------
take over right like it just it makes no


---------42:46----------
sense


---------42:48----------
so getting that diagnosis not only gave


---------42:50----------
me


---------42:51----------
ease of mind and understanding of who i


---------42:54----------
was


---------42:55----------
but it also connected me with the


---------42:56----------
autistic community being able to connect


---------42:59----------
with other autistics that have had


---------43:00----------
similar experiences


---------43:02----------
to be able to to be a part of a network


---------43:04----------
where i finally


---------43:05----------
felt a sense of belonging which like i


---------43:09----------
i think a lot of that that um


---------43:13----------
that psychological usefulness is missed


---------43:16----------
in these diagnosis because they're


---------43:18----------
there's it's super important


---------43:20----------
it's really important to be able to have


---------43:22----------
that connection to have that belonging


---------43:24----------
to know that you're not alone to go from


---------43:27----------
feeling like


---------43:28----------
there there's no one else like you no


---------43:30----------
one else going through the problems that


---------43:31----------
you're going through


---------43:32----------
to someone like holy [ __ ] there's


---------43:35----------
there's other people out there that


---------43:37----------
that understand yeah


---------43:40----------
sounds like you had felt alone for a


---------43:43----------
long time and now


---------43:44----------
i'm sort of hearing you say a lot about


---------43:47----------
being able to connect to other people


---------43:49----------
but


---------43:49----------
i other people i've worked with have


---------43:51----------
also sort of emphasized that


---------43:53----------
they had a reason for why


---------43:56----------
things were that the way they were right


---------43:59----------
because people like


---------44:00----------
my experience with people with autism


---------44:01----------
just listening to them is they just feel


---------44:03----------
so broken like arbitrarily because it's


---------44:05----------
not there isn't like a diagnosis or


---------44:07----------
reason or rhyme


---------44:08----------
like you're just you're just bad at


---------44:10----------
making friends


---------44:11----------
there's like something fundamentally


---------44:13----------
busted


---------44:14----------
and you just suck at it there's no like


---------44:16----------
explanation there's no reason there's no


---------44:18----------
like


---------44:19----------
you know and and and for some people who


---------44:20----------
get an autism diagnosis they sort of


---------44:22----------
understand that


---------44:24----------
what i have always experienced which is


---------44:27----------
that it's hard for me to live life like


---------44:29----------
neurotypical people do


---------44:30----------
actually has like a neurological or


---------44:33----------
neuroscientific correlation to it


---------44:35----------
there are parts of my brain that


---------44:36----------
literally function


---------44:38----------
in a different way from like what a


---------44:40----------
neurotypical person's brain functions


---------44:42----------
like


---------44:42----------
and so it's not like some kind of moral


---------44:44----------
deficiency


---------44:45----------
or being weak or just sucking or like


---------44:48----------
a charisma stat that's like low


---------44:52----------
it's that you're wired differently


---------44:55----------
did that sort of have an impact for you


---------44:57----------
in that way or was it mostly about


---------44:59----------
connection


---------45:00----------
uh no definitely like finally having


---------45:02----------
that answer and understanding


---------45:04----------
um absolutely like i focus on the


---------45:07----------
connection because i i think that's a


---------45:09----------
really


---------45:10----------
important thing because i i think many


---------45:12----------
of us with autism


---------45:14----------
we desperately want social connection


---------45:16----------
that was like one of the


---------45:18----------
big misunderstandings that i had about


---------45:20----------
autism before getting my diagnosis


---------45:23----------
was that if if


---------45:26----------
you wanted to have friends if you wanted


---------45:28----------
that social interaction that you


---------45:30----------
couldn't be autistic


---------45:31----------
because autistics weren't weren't


---------45:33----------
sociable


---------45:34----------
which it's simply not the case and there


---------45:36----------
was there was like a lot of these kind


---------45:38----------
of


---------45:38----------
um this misinformation out there


---------45:42----------
that i had to search through to better


---------45:44----------
understand


---------45:45----------
what autism was when i went to seek my


---------45:48----------
my diagnosis


---------45:50----------
and and can you help us understand a


---------45:53----------
little bit about the sort of this


---------45:55----------
i can imagine it's tricky because on the


---------45:56----------
one hand it can be hard to make social


---------45:58----------
connections


---------45:59----------
and wanting social connections and what


---------46:01----------
it's like kind of swimming through those


---------46:03----------
waters


---------46:06----------
a lot of it like one of the big things


---------46:08----------
that i struggled with growing up as a


---------46:10----------
kid


---------46:11----------
is noticing when i was being annoying


---------46:13----------
right


---------46:14----------
like i would talk about something i'm


---------46:17----------
very passionate about something that i


---------46:18----------
care about


---------46:19----------
and realizing that the other person was


---------46:21----------
annoyed bored or


---------46:23----------
whatever in trying to like now


---------46:26----------
now like i have all this anxiety and i'm


---------46:29----------
like i'm constantly watching like facial


---------46:30----------
interactions i'm watching body language


---------46:33----------
like there's this huge anxiety where i'm


---------46:35----------
like okay i need to change the subject


---------46:37----------
to the point that even


---------46:38----------
even if someone is enjoying the


---------46:41----------
conversation


---------46:43----------
i'm ready to jump that like that


---------46:44----------
conversation like wait i've been talking


---------46:46----------
about this for three four or five


---------46:47----------
minutes okay i need to change subject


---------46:49----------
even if they are liking it because it's


---------46:51----------
it's almost like the script that plays


---------46:52----------
in my head


---------46:55----------
um yeah like like a lot of those that


---------46:59----------
kind of like


---------47:00----------
trying to figure it out was just it was


---------47:03----------
constant like okay i didn't get the


---------47:05----------
reaction i wanted or


---------47:06----------
okay this didn't happen the way it was


---------47:08----------
try again let's change one thing i mean


---------47:11----------
i i definitely relied on science on like


---------47:14----------
things like scientific method


---------47:15----------
to to be able to go and experiment and


---------47:18----------
like okay we'll try this one little


---------47:19----------
tweak we'll try this week we'll try this


---------47:21----------
tweak until i ended up with a script


---------47:23----------
that was somewhat successful


---------47:27----------
yeah it sounds very intensive


---------47:31----------
from an energy standpoint yes it's


---------47:34----------
it can be exhausting yeah and and that


---------47:37----------
you know once you came up with your


---------47:39----------
algorithm that like even if


---------47:41----------
the conversation organically didn't


---------47:43----------
require a shift


---------47:45----------
there's a part of your brain that has


---------47:46----------
learned that after four minutes about


---------47:49----------
talking about a subject the safest thing


---------47:50----------
to do is to switch the subject


---------47:53----------
yes yeah and but really


---------47:56----------
and i i know you use the term


---------47:58----------
sociopathic but i i think um


---------48:01----------
you know i think that somewhat apples


---------48:03----------
and oranges but


---------48:04----------
i am hearing a lot that you make like a


---------48:07----------
lot of your


---------48:09----------
social interactions are calculated and


---------48:12----------
and not out of a desire to like take


---------48:14----------
advantage of anyone but just because i


---------48:15----------
i think what i'm also hearing from you


---------48:17----------
and this is my experience working with


---------48:18----------
people with autism is that


---------48:20----------
you know some of the empathic circuitry


---------48:22----------
that allows people to like


---------48:24----------
naturally like know how to swim is


---------48:28----------
is not quite intact and so you have to


---------48:32----------
rely you have to figure out other ways i


---------48:34----------
i just had another analogy which maybe


---------48:36----------
is devastating and offensive


---------48:37----------
but sort of like a duck without feathers


---------48:40----------
you're still a duck but like some of the


---------48:42----------
things that you


---------48:43----------
normally allow you to float like you


---------48:45----------
have to learn how to like swim


---------48:46----------
in a different way


---------48:49----------
and and so it sounds it sounds really


---------48:51----------
tough man


---------48:53----------
yeah you mentioned specifically about


---------48:56----------
not trying to take advantage of others i


---------48:58----------
growing up before i knew i was autistic


---------49:00----------
that was one of the big things that i


---------49:02----------
dealt with a lot


---------49:03----------
was um like because of how i approached


---------49:07----------
everything and thinking about it to try


---------49:08----------
and elicit specific responses


---------49:11----------
i i like i had this this big fear


---------49:14----------
that i was deliberately trying to take


---------49:16----------
advantage of people


---------49:17----------
right because it was literally how i had


---------49:19----------
to solve all of my problems like i had


---------49:21----------
to do this like this


---------49:22----------
this component that came so natural to


---------49:25----------
everyone else


---------49:26----------
i had to go all this deliberate and like


---------49:29----------
thinking about each of these components


---------49:31----------
where i literally felt like i was


---------49:32----------
manipulating others


---------49:34----------
and it it sucked it definitely had a


---------49:38----------
huge kind of


---------49:39----------
negative mental toll i can completely


---------49:42----------
understand that i think


---------49:44----------
unfortunately um you know that's not


---------49:47----------
necessarily the case and i've i've met


---------49:49----------
um a ton of people who


---------49:52----------
are very emotionally like not overly


---------49:55----------
cognitive


---------49:56----------
and at the same time are also incredibly


---------49:58----------
manipulative


---------49:59----------
like it's not that thinking very


---------50:01----------
cognitively about social


---------50:03----------
interactions makes you manipulative or


---------50:05----------
not i've seen you know both versions of


---------50:06----------
that


---------50:07----------
and and des i'm curious you mentioned


---------50:09----------
that you're you're married


---------50:11----------
yes can you tell us a little bit about


---------50:13----------
how that happened because i know that's


---------50:15----------
something that's very anxiety provoking


---------50:17----------
for


---------50:17----------
a lot of people with autism like


---------50:19----------
romantic relationships


---------50:22----------
so i actually it's it's kind of silly i


---------50:25----------
kind of fell into my lap so to speak


---------50:28----------
um i i didn't


---------50:32----------
really have any relationship experience


---------50:34----------
until


---------50:35----------
i was 22


---------50:39----------
when i was 22 i um


---------50:42----------
i i this this sounds really bad


---------50:46----------
uh i basically found a situation where i


---------50:49----------
could rely on my looks


---------50:51----------
to be able to bypass romantic or


---------50:54----------
the the kind of romantic interactions to


---------50:56----------
lose my virginity


---------50:58----------
um so i had to go through this this kind


---------51:00----------
of like cold calculation to be able to


---------51:04----------
find myself in a position to be able to


---------51:06----------
to go through that because i wanted to


---------51:10----------
to solve that problem i'm sorry i'm


---------51:12----------
looking at chat


---------51:20----------
yes you can't look at chad from


---------51:25----------
sorry everyone wants to know how you did


---------51:30----------
it


---------51:30----------
i want to know but you can't look at


---------51:32----------
chat you're on a roll


---------51:42----------
when you're socially awkward and you're


---------51:43----------
not even if you're not neurotypical


---------51:46----------
imagine all the neurotypical people with


---------51:48----------
social anxiety who think that they're in


---------51:49----------
cells and aren't even on the spectrum


---------51:51----------
and here you have the answer for them


---------51:54----------
and you get distracted by chat


---------51:58----------
just let's put it on the adhd part as


---------52:00----------
well


---------52:01----------
um but yeah it is


---------52:07----------
um so that that whole situation i


---------52:10----------
i basically it kind of allowed me to


---------52:16----------
i don't know i've admit my way through


---------52:18----------
it so


---------52:19----------
like like relationships are really like


---------52:22----------
fine tasks where you need like


---------52:24----------
you know like you need to be able to


---------52:27----------
like


---------52:28----------
be able to move everything just right


---------52:30----------
for it to go through


---------52:31----------
and i specifically reference oven mitt


---------52:33----------
because that's what it feels like


---------52:35----------
interacting with social circumstances


---------52:37----------
it's this very


---------52:38----------
um texturous fine-tuned interaction and


---------52:41----------
we have oven mitts


---------52:43----------
so it feels really hard to to be able to


---------52:45----------
piece through that


---------52:48----------
and it it worked i


---------52:52----------
like looking back on it i feel bad


---------52:55----------
because it definitely feels like a


---------52:56----------
situation where


---------52:57----------
i may have manipulated someone


---------53:01----------
um into a romantic relationship in order


---------53:04----------
to


---------53:05----------
um meet that right it's it's not


---------53:08----------
a it's not a nice thing


---------53:12----------
at least i don't consider it a nice


---------53:14----------
thing um


---------53:17----------
but it allowed me to kind of get past


---------53:20----------
that that


---------53:21----------
big fear when you're a virgin which is


---------53:24----------
what happens when you do get to that


---------53:26----------
point right it completely


---------53:28----------
changed the kind of dialogue and


---------53:30----------
interaction for me


---------53:33----------
uh can you help me understand i i i


---------53:36----------
i find myself being curious about you


---------53:38----------
know what


---------53:42----------
yeah i just have so many questions like


---------53:43----------
can you just share more about that


---------53:45----------
i'm serious because i like i i think you


---------53:48----------
know


---------53:48----------
doing something because you want to get


---------53:52----------
laid like i can sort of understand where


---------53:54----------
you're coming from there but i think


---------53:55----------
just as equally as important is like


---------53:57----------
illustrating or helping people


---------53:59----------
understand what felt unethical about


---------54:01----------
for you about that what felt


---------54:03----------
manipulative for you how you came to


---------54:04----------
that realization


---------54:06----------
i feel like there's actually a lot of


---------54:07----------
all the memes and stuff aside


---------54:09----------
i think there's there's a lot of


---------54:10----------
important wisdom here


---------54:13----------
so mainly what made it feel manipulative


---------54:16----------
is for the individual like i i didn't


---------54:20----------
really care specifically about them that


---------54:23----------
it was


---------54:24----------
kind of a means to an end


---------54:28----------
i mean they they were obviously


---------54:30----------
interested and wanted to engage in


---------54:32----------
everything so it was


---------54:33----------
mutual but for me my


---------54:37----------
understanding of sexual interaction has


---------54:39----------
always been based around things like


---------54:40----------
love right that that very romantic


---------54:43----------
nature


---------54:44----------
so utilizing it to


---------54:47----------
not utilizing love but utilizing sex to


---------54:50----------
kind of


---------54:52----------
understand was


---------54:56----------
ethically problematic to me i think um


---------54:59----------
interesting because you know to play


---------55:02----------
devil's advocate for a second i mean you


---------55:03----------
were the one who was there so i


---------55:05----------
but i'm sort of you know my


---------55:08----------
understanding


---------55:09----------
of of sex and love is that the two don't


---------55:11----------
necessarily have to go hand in hand


---------55:13----------
and that especially if you're a 22 year


---------55:15----------
old you know like


---------55:17----------
a little bit of figuring it out as long


---------55:19----------
as and it sounds like the other person


---------55:20----------
was like interested in consenting and


---------55:22----------
all


---------55:22----------
you know that's that's the really


---------55:24----------
important stuff to me but you know i


---------55:26----------
i i want to say that like i don't want


---------55:28----------
to discourage people from


---------55:30----------
figuring it out because at 22 you're not


---------55:33----------
going to know exactly what the


---------55:34----------
relationship is between sex and love


---------55:37----------
right right you're just not and and so i


---------55:39----------
i'm not hearing anything


---------55:41----------
so far that seems kind of unethical to


---------55:43----------
me


---------55:44----------
except maybe some expectations that you


---------55:47----------
had but or that you you maybe were not


---------55:49----------
that much like


---------55:51----------
potentially romantically into this


---------55:53----------
person but


---------55:55----------
um i i feel like i utilized them not for


---------55:58----------
sex


---------55:59----------
but for what sex meant which is why i


---------56:01----------
think this became


---------56:02----------
a little bit more unethical to me


---------56:05----------
oh no it's one of those things where


---------56:07----------
when you're 22


---------56:09----------
um it makes


---------56:13----------
sense but like looking back on it i i


---------56:16----------
basically


---------56:17----------
treated it kind of like a science


---------56:19----------
experiment


---------56:20----------
rather than like the the kind of like


---------56:23----------
sexual experience


---------56:25----------
right it was about seeing what it was


---------56:27----------
about getting through that and kind of


---------56:28----------
removing it as


---------56:30----------
a factor rather than


---------56:34----------
um


---------56:37----------
rather than just trying to get laid


---------56:40----------
interesting okay


---------56:41----------
and how did you meet your you said that


---------56:43----------
your current relationship sort of fell


---------56:45----------
into your lap


---------56:47----------
so i i met um i met my wife


---------56:50----------
through a friend that i was able to make


---------56:52----------
thanks to you know sitting in bars


---------56:54----------
constantly watching language


---------56:56----------
uh turns out they were like a big metal


---------56:58----------
head so we we


---------57:00----------
oh god it was amazing like finally this


---------57:02----------
was one of those scripts where i didn't


---------57:03----------
have to change the conversation every


---------57:04----------
four minutes


---------57:05----------
we would talk about metal for like hours


---------57:08----------
and hours and hours like uh we love


---------57:10----------
metal um but


---------57:12----------
eventually he told me about this this


---------57:16----------
girl that he had met she was getting her


---------57:17----------
bachelor's in neuroscience


---------57:19----------
i wanted to get my bachelor's in


---------57:21----------
neuroscience


---------57:23----------
and so we we um we started talking on


---------57:26----------
facebook


---------57:27----------
all that she was currently seeing


---------57:29----------
someone else


---------57:30----------
and you know as we talked more and more


---------57:32----------
i


---------57:34----------
um i i basically just laid out my


---------57:37----------
feelings for her and talked like you


---------57:38----------
know about how


---------57:39----------
like i i cared for her and all that um


---------57:43----------
and things just ended up working out she


---------57:46----------
ended up breaking up with the


---------57:47----------
the other guy who happened to be super


---------57:49----------
abusive um


---------57:51----------
we we shared our first kiss august 11th


---------57:55----------
um and it is


---------57:59----------
i don't know like i think because i


---------58:01----------
spent so much time


---------58:03----------
analyzing every single situation having


---------58:06----------
to be super aware


---------58:07----------
of where i was cognitively where i was


---------58:09----------
emotionally


---------58:10----------
actually ended up preparing me for that


---------58:12----------
relationship


---------58:14----------
so when we ended up in this i was very


---------58:16----------
quick to


---------58:18----------
i was very quick to be like hey this is


---------58:21----------
problematic or


---------58:22----------
hey this is bothering me or hey i don't


---------58:24----------
like this


---------58:25----------
and we would actually talk about things


---------58:27----------
before they became a problem


---------58:29----------
um i i definitely do see like a lot of


---------58:32----------
my experiences as an autistic having


---------58:34----------
been beneficial even unknowingly


---------58:36----------
because of how much i had to rely on


---------58:38----------
observing literally every single detail


---------58:42----------
yeah it sounds like you know i'm i'm


---------58:45----------
purposely avoiding chat


---------58:47----------
because i can only imagine you know all


---------58:49----------
the messages about


---------58:51----------
your autism and chadness rolled into one


---------58:54----------
but i i think it's great because i think


---------58:56----------
it sort of illustrates something really


---------58:57----------
really important which is that


---------58:59----------
um what i'm really hearing from you is


---------59:01----------
that you took a lot of risks right so i


---------59:03----------
i'm


---------59:04----------
not when you sort of confessed your


---------59:05----------
feelings for her had y'all met in person


---------59:08----------
um we we had men in person um we had met


---------59:12----------
a couple of times


---------59:13----------
uh and this is still when i was trying


---------59:16----------
to figure out how relationships worked


---------59:18----------
so you know like the whole you know oh


---------59:21----------
you should you should ignore women that


---------59:23----------
makes them want you like like all those


---------59:25----------
kind of like


---------59:26----------
really kind of crappy information that's


---------59:28----------
out there for when you're young


---------59:31----------
in trying to somehow cipher wisdom from


---------59:34----------
all of that


---------59:35----------
in in some form to interact in


---------59:38----------
relationship


---------59:39----------
and so what do you think is useful


---------59:42----------
to make a relationship so it sounds like


---------59:44----------
y'all are married now


---------59:46----------
yes um i i honestly i got lucky


---------59:49----------
i'm gonna be real honest i like i don't


---------59:51----------
know how it happened


---------59:52----------
it's it's like it's like doing that jump


---------59:55----------
in a video game you do it once and you


---------59:56----------
have no idea how you did it and you can


---------59:58----------
never do it again


---------59:59----------
that that is literally like it's just


---------60:02----------
everything lined up


---------60:03----------
i i don't know um but what i will say


---------60:07----------
as far as it lasting we've been married


---------60:09----------
for


---------60:10----------
over we've been together eight years


---------60:13----------
we've been married six


---------60:16----------
um communication is so incredibly


---------60:19----------
important


---------60:20----------
is if the other if the other person


---------60:23----------
doesn't know where you're


---------60:24----------
at they can't work with you


---------60:27----------
and she didn't know i was autistic when


---------60:30----------
um we we got married and all that we


---------60:32----------
didn't find out until years later


---------60:36----------
and there were points where you know it


---------60:38----------
looked like we might get divorced but


---------60:41----------
having a conversation around there and


---------60:45----------
understanding like yeah this is this


---------60:47----------
sucks this is problematic we weren't


---------60:49----------
quite expecting this


---------60:51----------
but um we got through it


---------60:55----------
because we we talked we understand she


---------60:57----------
knows how much i love her how much i


---------60:59----------
care about her


---------61:00----------
um i i do what i can to try and


---------61:04----------
help out even though i struggle in so


---------61:06----------
many other ways like


---------61:08----------
being being married to someone who isn't


---------61:11----------
able to to bring in like full-time work


---------61:13----------
or isn't able to bring in lots of money


---------61:15----------
is difficult but


---------61:20----------
um communication really helps


---------61:24----------
yeah i'm glad you said that because i


---------61:26----------
think that's what i'm hearing is


---------61:27----------
different


---------61:28----------
um so i i think that you know sometimes


---------61:31----------
people feel like they don't


---------61:33----------
they can't bring value to a relationship


---------61:36----------
and i know you say


---------61:37----------
frankly it was luck or so therefore it


---------61:39----------
was rng


---------61:40----------
and i certainly feel the same way about


---------61:42----------
my relationship in terms of getting


---------61:43----------
really really lucky


---------61:45----------
but i do think that you know there are a


---------61:46----------
lot of really interesting things kind of


---------61:48----------
objectively


---------61:49----------
des about your relationship and how it


---------61:51----------
evolved and i think there are a lot of


---------61:53----------
lessons to take away for people


---------61:55----------
so here's what i'm hearing you you know


---------61:57----------
this is this is what your character


---------61:58----------
sheet shows right


---------62:00----------
so you were born with the autism trait


---------62:02----------
which is like


---------62:03----------
comes with like charisma penalties and


---------62:06----------
and things like that


---------62:07----------
like it's hard for you to socially


---------62:09----------
interact with people it can be really


---------62:10----------
challenging and let me know if this


---------62:12----------
sounds offensive at some point okay um


---------62:14----------
and then also that like


---------62:16----------
some of your disability prevents you


---------62:17----------
from doing things like working full-time


---------62:19----------
and things like that and so


---------62:21----------
on paper you know i think a lot of


---------62:24----------
people will look at that and will say


---------62:26----------
like if if people are in your shoes like


---------62:28----------
i could only imagine


---------62:29----------
being you know a 24 year old person with


---------62:31----------
autism who's unable to


---------62:33----------
hold a full-time job and to think to


---------62:35----------
myself


---------62:36----------
that i'm not worthy of having a


---------62:39----------
relationship i can't ever be in a


---------62:41----------
relationship


---------62:44----------
and yet what i'm hearing from you is


---------62:45----------
that ultimately like you can actually


---------62:47----------
have a very successful relationship


---------62:49----------
and that as important and as it's hard


---------62:52----------
right so there's some amount of shame


---------62:53----------
and expectation and societal stuff and


---------62:55----------
whatnot


---------62:56----------
but at the end of the day that like


---------62:58----------
communicating with your partner and like


---------63:00----------
letting people know where you're at


---------63:01----------
letting people like owning up to what


---------63:03----------
your shortcomings are and trying to


---------63:05----------
support them the best that you can that


---------63:06----------
like


---------63:06----------
you can talk about things and like let


---------63:08----------
people know where you're at


---------63:10----------
and and i think another thing that


---------63:11----------
you're not really mentioning i'd imagine


---------63:13----------
you're very good at listening


---------63:15----------
and also like you know what people


---------63:18----------
sometimes what


---------63:19----------
the the trickiest thing that i see in


---------63:21----------
terms of like marriage counseling i


---------63:22----------
don't do a whole lot of it


---------63:24----------
is that a lot of people make sacrifices


---------63:27----------
and then feel resentful and then their


---------63:29----------
partner says


---------63:30----------
i never asked you to make that sacrifice


---------63:34----------
right so like i'll make a big sacrifice


---------63:36----------
and then i'll feel owed


---------63:37----------
because i made this big sacrifice and


---------63:39----------
then the person on the other side of the


---------63:40----------
table is like


---------63:41----------
i never asked that of you and then we


---------63:43----------
get into this really tricky impasse


---------63:45----------
because


---------63:45----------
you know one partner feels really owed


---------63:48----------
because they've given something up


---------63:49----------
and then on the other side the other


---------63:50----------
partner was like i didn't buy that thing


---------63:53----------
so i don't owe you anything


---------63:56----------
you know i never asked for that


---------63:57----------
sacrifice and so what i'm kind of


---------63:59----------
hearing from you i'm reading between the


---------64:01----------
lines here is that i think you guys


---------64:02----------
probably did a really good job


---------64:04----------
it's not about making the sacrifice or


---------64:06----------
not making the sacrifice or being able


---------64:08----------
to be full-time employed or having


---------64:09----------
autism or not having autism


---------64:11----------
it's about ultimately being on the same


---------64:13----------
page about where you guys are whether


---------64:15----------
it's in a good place or a bad place


---------64:17----------
and i'm hearing you say that you know


---------64:19----------
you all have talked about divorce which


---------64:20----------
sounds like


---------64:21----------
very understandable because it sounds


---------64:23----------
like there are a lot of challenges


---------64:25----------
that you all face in your relationship


---------64:26----------
just like any other relationship and


---------64:28----------
that


---------64:28----------
you guys have an additional layer of


---------64:30----------
challenge because on some level


---------64:32----------
you know there are a lot of things that


---------64:33----------
society expects from you that you may


---------64:35----------
not be able to do and let me know if


---------64:36----------
this feels mean


---------64:37----------
at some point i'm not really i think


---------64:39----------
it's it actually is like a shining


---------64:40----------
example


---------64:41----------
of how so many of what we assume about a


---------64:44----------
successful relationship


---------64:46----------
i don't think is actually what makes a


---------64:47----------
successful relationship


---------64:50----------
it's not having a particular career it's


---------64:52----------
not it's like really about being on the


---------64:54----------
same page and it doesn't it sort of


---------64:55----------
doesn't matter


---------64:57----------
like i mean it matters but to me the


---------65:00----------
most


---------65:00----------
crucial thing i've seen you know two


---------65:02----------
neurotypical people who have successful


---------65:04----------
careers and are very charismatic


---------65:06----------
who have gotten divorced and i think the


---------65:09----------
problem is like they're not on the same


---------65:10----------
page


---------65:12----------
and i've seen a lot of people who feel


---------65:14----------
hopeless because of certain


---------65:15----------
disadvantages they have that they're


---------65:17----------
unable to find love


---------65:19----------
or sex but what i'm really hearing from


---------65:22----------
you is that like


---------65:23----------
you know that it's possible to have both


---------65:26----------
of those things as long as you really


---------65:27----------
focus on


---------65:28----------
self-awareness attending to another


---------65:31----------
person's needs


---------65:32----------
being somewhat transparent about what


---------65:34----------
your needs are these are the kinds of


---------65:36----------
things that i i'm really hearing have


---------65:37----------
led to your success


---------65:39----------
what do you think uh absolutely i i


---------65:42----------
think


---------65:42----------
spending so much time observing studying


---------65:46----------
being aware of recognizing i i think all


---------65:49----------
these things have played


---------65:50----------
an important and critical role in my own


---------65:52----------
success with relationships


---------65:54----------
um i mean it's it's like any subject the


---------65:57----------
more you study it the better you get at


---------65:59----------
it you might not


---------66:00----------
um like like i i didn't i didn't just


---------66:04----------
i wasn't suddenly born with my


---------66:05----------
understanding of neuroscience i had to


---------66:07----------
study it i had to go through i had to


---------66:09----------
take classes


---------66:10----------
and then you know i was able to actually


---------66:13----------
start to understand it


---------66:15----------
and so for a lot of


---------66:18----------
normal individuals out there they might


---------66:20----------
have all this understanding already kind


---------66:21----------
of pre-built in


---------66:23----------
whereas for for myself i had to study it


---------66:26----------
and study and study and


---------66:27----------
i think it paid off yeah


---------66:30----------
well said yes um so


---------66:35----------
i had a couple of other like so i i


---------66:38----------
really appreciate everything you've


---------66:39----------
shared with us i'd love to hear a little


---------66:41----------
bit about


---------66:42----------
aba activism what's going on with with


---------66:45----------
autism if you want to talk about that


---------66:47----------
um you know i think there are a couple


---------66:49----------
of other things that you mentioned which


---------66:51----------
i think are like really really


---------66:53----------
important for people to hear like this


---------66:55----------
concept of love being withheld based on


---------66:58----------
your behaviors


---------66:59----------
is there a particular direction you want


---------67:01----------
to take things yes


---------67:05----------
um so i'm like this is this is a really


---------67:09----------
important conversation for the autistic


---------67:11----------
community


---------67:12----------
since aba is is generally considered


---------67:16----------
abuse by our community


---------67:19----------
um and on the idea of like the old


---------67:23----------
school aba being a way of withholding


---------67:25----------
love withholding attention with holding


---------67:28----------
certain characteristics and why i


---------67:29----------
compared earlier


---------67:31----------
like giving myself aba um for for those


---------67:34----------
asking by what aba is


---------67:36----------
it's it's basically um


---------67:40----------
put the simplest way not to to downgrade


---------67:44----------
what it is or to downgrade ourselves


---------67:46----------
it's it's pavlovian right whereas like


---------67:49----------
you give a reward or you give a negative


---------67:52----------
response to elicit a specific response a


---------67:54----------
specific behavior


---------67:57----------
and in the instance where i was talking


---------67:58----------
earlier about with my uncle


---------68:01----------
is my uncle would do an action um i


---------68:04----------
respond negatively to the um


---------68:08----------
clinking noise of a ball right my


---------68:11----------
response would be


---------68:13----------
okay i'm not going to react to that


---------68:15----------
because i don't want that added


---------68:17----------
that added pain because they'll keep


---------68:19----------
clanking the ball


---------68:21----------
in a nearest response to this annoyance


---------68:24----------
so that is a negative reinforcement that


---------68:26----------
tells me not to elicit that behavior


---------68:29----------
this is similar to what we've seen in a


---------68:31----------
lot of aba it's changed since then


---------68:34----------
i've been told um but there's


---------68:37----------
still a lot of problems especially like


---------68:40----------
positive reinforcement can still be


---------68:41----------
problematic if you're getting a behavior


---------68:44----------
to respond that causes harm


---------68:46----------
for example i once had


---------68:49----------
a meltdown not one that resulted in me


---------68:52----------
hitting myself but i threw my phone and


---------68:54----------
ended up running into a wall because a


---------68:57----------
professor touched the lip of my cam


---------68:59----------
so i had a can um and their their hand


---------69:03----------
touched the


---------69:03----------
the part where you drink from which


---------69:06----------
caused me to become everywhere


---------69:07----------
very overwhelmed it's something that's


---------69:09----------
very stressful and


---------69:11----------
and painful for me but aba would see


---------69:14----------
this behavior as problematic


---------69:16----------
and would expose me to it constantly


---------69:19----------
until i didn't respond


---------69:22----------
in a negative way


---------69:26----------
so what what what's


---------69:29----------
what is the problem you see with that um


---------69:33----------
uh it elicits pain


---------69:37----------
as a way of um


---------69:41----------
no longer performing that behavior


---------69:42----------
rather than acknowledging the the needs


---------69:45----------
of the individual and what is going on


---------69:48----------
i you know ask the person to move the


---------69:51----------
can


---------69:51----------
versus moving the can yourself


---------69:55----------
it it puts the burden on the autistic


---------69:59----------
to suffer rather than creating a


---------70:03----------
situation where no one


---------70:04----------
is suffering that's a good point i'm not


---------70:07----------
sure if people were


---------70:09----------
um yeah so so that that's a good point


---------70:13----------
so


---------70:13----------
can i share like a similar experience


---------70:15----------
that i've had sort of


---------70:16----------
as a treatment professional go ahead so


---------70:19----------
i was working with uh


---------70:20----------
a young guy with misophonia so


---------70:22----------
misophonia is a neurological disorder


---------70:24----------
where like


---------70:25----------
something is messed up where so normally


---------70:28----------
when we hear a sound like you know sound


---------70:30----------
hits our eardrum


---------70:32----------
and then that you know the sound travels


---------70:34----------
via a neuron to our auditory cortex


---------70:37----------
then travels to our auditory association


---------70:39----------
cortex


---------70:40----------
so like i'm able to hear sounds but if i


---------70:43----------
use


---------70:43----------
words for example your brain does not


---------70:46----------
interpret words as sounds it interprets


---------70:48----------
words


---------70:49----------
as words so that comes from your


---------70:51----------
auditory association cortex so something


---------70:53----------
is


---------70:53----------
i we don't know exactly what happens in


---------70:55----------
misophonia but there are some


---------70:57----------
sounds that elicit like pain like so


---------71:00----------
instead of


---------71:01----------
you know like this hearing a particular


---------71:04----------
sound


---------71:05----------
is like the experience of like rubbing


---------71:09----------
you know like this person described it


---------71:11----------
to me as like


---------71:12----------
rubbing like an open wound with


---------71:14----------
sandpaper


---------71:15----------
and so like literally sounds will hurt


---------71:17----------
them


---------71:19----------
and so the interesting thing this is


---------71:21----------
unfortunately this person is is older


---------71:23----------
now


---------71:23----------
and so like back in the day they went to


---------71:25----------
go see a neurologist


---------71:27----------
who would essentially do exposure


---------71:29----------
therapy


---------71:30----------
and was like focused on like making this


---------71:33----------
person more resilient


---------71:34----------
and they're like you know much like


---------71:36----------
exposure therapy like what we're gonna


---------71:37----------
do is expose you to the sound


---------71:40----------
until your neurons acclimatize to it


---------71:43----------
and so what this person sort of


---------71:44----------
discovered is that like they didn't


---------71:47----------
ever acclimatize to it because it's sort


---------71:49----------
of like you know it doesn't matter how


---------71:50----------
many times you get


---------71:51----------
kicked in the nuts like it's gonna hurt


---------71:53----------
every time there's no like acclimatizing


---------71:54----------
to getting kicked in the nuts


---------71:56----------
and so the bizarre thing that the reason


---------71:58----------
they wound up in my office is they were


---------72:00----------
so


---------72:00----------
traumatized by the treatment


---------72:04----------
that they sort of developed ptsd and a


---------72:06----------
personality disorder


---------72:08----------
as a result like chronic ptsd so to see


---------72:12----------
ptsd personality disorder it sort of


---------72:14----------
completely changed the way that they


---------72:16----------
like interacted with like


---------72:18----------
so like they started to think of like


---------72:20----------
doctors and parents


---------72:21----------
like it was really confusing because


---------72:23----------
they understood oh this doctor is trying


---------72:25----------
to help me and like my parents are


---------72:26----------
trying to help me but like


---------72:29----------
they're hurting me a ton and they won't


---------72:31----------
stop and they won't stop ever


---------72:33----------
and they they tell me that every time i


---------72:35----------
get hurt that like i need to be stronger


---------72:38----------
and it completely reshaped the way that


---------72:40----------
they looked at their


---------72:41----------
like important relationships caused a


---------72:43----------
ton of problems


---------72:44----------
and i think the re the way we were able


---------72:46----------
to make progress is through recognizing


---------72:48----------
that


---------72:49----------
you know early on when you were like six


---------72:51----------
years old


---------72:54----------
these people who were supposed to


---------72:55----------
protect you actually would like take you


---------72:58----------
once a week


---------72:59----------
and rub sandpaper over your open wounds


---------73:02----------
and what do you think that does to a


---------73:03----------
child


---------73:04----------
when it happens like clockwork once a


---------73:06----------
week


---------73:07----------
for an hour for a decade


---------73:12----------
and and it's really kind of terrifying


---------73:14----------
that like a lot of times i think


---------73:16----------
unfortunately as treatment professionals


---------73:19----------
there's a lot of iatrogenic which means


---------73:21----------
like you know treatment-induced


---------73:23----------
injury um and it's really sad


---------73:26----------
but just uh you know i get what you're


---------73:28----------
saying


---------73:29----------
i i didn't i didn't realize this about


---------73:31----------
aba though so


---------73:32----------
it's good to know yes there there's been


---------73:36----------
talks about changes i um recently read


---------73:39----------
an article that came out in 2021


---------73:42----------
um and from there like the argument that


---------73:45----------
aba has changed


---------73:47----------
it's still argued as unethical because


---------73:51----------
the practitioners are


---------73:54----------
are working outside of their scope as


---------73:56----------
well i.e that they're not


---------73:58----------
experts on autism in that to treat


---------74:02----------
a neurological disorder from a


---------74:04----------
psychological perspective is also


---------74:06----------
troublesome


---------74:07----------
because it's it's not


---------74:10----------
it can't be solely confined by behavior


---------74:13----------
so


---------74:14----------
it's kind of outside of the scope of the


---------74:16----------
individual to not


---------74:17----------
have experience with autism


---------74:20----------
um like like to actually be like an


---------74:22----------
expert on nazism so they can't even


---------74:24----------
notice


---------74:25----------
like if the autistic individual is


---------74:29----------
in pain right because we we don't


---------74:31----------
display


---------74:32----------
our our pain we don't display our trauma


---------74:34----------
in the same way that


---------74:36----------
neurotypical individuals will so it's


---------74:39----------
very problematic to say that well


---------74:40----------
they're not


---------74:41----------
they're not being hurt it's like anyone


---------74:43----------
can say that it's like well


---------74:45----------
they're not being hurt it it doesn't


---------74:47----------
mean that you can't


---------74:49----------
all right just because you can't see it


---------74:50----------
doesn't mean it's not there


---------74:53----------
yeah i mean don't get me started there


---------74:55----------
because it's


---------74:56----------
it's like such an uphill battle to try


---------74:58----------
to explain to people


---------74:59----------
who think that they're experts that


---------75:01----------
they're not experts


---------75:04----------
like the one lesson that i've come away


---------75:06----------
with


---------75:07----------
uh desk like just personally as a


---------75:09----------
clinician is that i can have all the


---------75:11----------
training in the world


---------75:13----------
but every person i meet is an individual


---------75:16----------
and when i run into trouble is when i


---------75:19----------
start


---------75:20----------
when i start thinking about myself as an


---------75:22----------
expert


---------75:23----------
and when someone comes to me and says


---------75:25----------
you don't know what you're talking about


---------75:28----------
like i've learned how to listen to what


---------75:31----------
they're saying


---------75:32----------
no matter where i trained no matter how


---------75:34----------
much experience i have


---------75:35----------
because this is the bizarre thing about


---------75:37----------
medicine is like you know we we


---------75:38----------
use like these protocols and paradigms


---------75:40----------
but like literally


---------75:42----------
every human being is unique and so i


---------75:45----------
don't know


---------75:46----------
is a system of medicine why we don't


---------75:49----------
sort of like


---------75:49----------
acknowledge or factor that into our


---------75:52----------
day-to-day


---------75:53----------
operations but i think it's really hard


---------75:55----------
to explain to people


---------75:57----------
who believe themselves to be experts


---------75:59----------
that


---------76:00----------
you know you may not know as much as you


---------76:01----------
think there's a lot of like


---------76:04----------
professional hubris certainly within


---------76:07----------
medicine


---------76:07----------
i think we see it a lot in in especially


---------76:09----------
unfortunately in mental health


---------76:11----------
because you'll have a lot of people who


---------76:13----------
are you know


---------76:14----------
i i think i i have a bias here so you


---------76:17----------
know i have to kind of share that but


---------76:18----------
it's my belief that a lot of our mental


---------76:21----------
health is actually physical in nature


---------76:24----------
um there's a lot of evidence of this


---------76:25----------
nowadays but if you look at like for


---------76:27----------
example you mentioned the fight or


---------76:28----------
flight response right that's a


---------76:29----------
physiologic response


---------76:31----------
and so i i don't know how much therapy


---------76:34----------
is gonna help i i mean i think therapy


---------76:36----------
can help a lot with that kind of stuff


---------76:37----------
but


---------76:38----------
i think that therapists if they ignore


---------76:41----------
the physiologic component of your


---------76:43----------
your autistic meltdown they're gonna be


---------76:45----------
doing you a disservice


---------76:47----------
the challenge is that most therapists


---------76:49----------
are not trained in physiology


---------76:52----------
um right and and we see this a lot too


---------76:55----------
in terms of


---------76:55----------
of physical medicine as well where


---------76:57----------
medical doctors


---------76:59----------
who are not trained in psychology will


---------77:01----------
like ignore the symptoms of their


---------77:03----------
patients because they think that they're


---------77:04----------
psychological


---------77:05----------
so like everyone's guilty of it you have


---------77:08----------
medical doctors that are ignoring the


---------77:09----------
psychological component and you have


---------77:11----------
psychologists who are ignoring the


---------77:12----------
physical component


---------77:14----------
um and and i think that unfortunately


---------77:16----------
like the problem is like the person who


---------77:18----------
gets screwed is the patient


---------77:22----------
um which is sad and and i i've just seen


---------77:24----------
a lot of professional hubris like


---------77:27----------
and i don't think it helps people like i


---------77:29----------
don't think it does right by our


---------77:30----------
patients


---------77:32----------
so i don't know what i'm trying to say


---------77:33----------
there but no


---------77:35----------
i i i completely understand what you're


---------77:37----------
what you're getting across


---------77:39----------
it definitely is a problematic situation


---------77:44----------
it there was something i actually i


---------77:45----------
wanted to say on that too that was


---------77:47----------
really really important oh


---------77:50----------
no damn it this is this is the problem


---------77:52----------
with the adhd brain as well we have that


---------77:54----------
thought


---------77:55----------
but we didn't write it down so it's just


---------77:57----------
it's gone well next time just interrupt


---------78:00----------
i know you've trained see i've been


---------78:01----------
taught not to interrupt that i know it's


---------78:03----------
the problem


---------78:05----------
so i know you've trained yourself not to


---------78:07----------
but like i think next time interrupt


---------78:10----------
you know i guess um let me try to run


---------78:13----------
through the sequence so we were talking


---------78:15----------
a little bit about


---------78:16----------
and see if we can catch it again even if


---------78:19----------
it slipped away so


---------78:20----------
uh you had talked a little bit about how


---------78:21----------
aba is still unethical


---------78:24----------
i shared the story about misophonia how


---------78:26----------
a lot of times


---------78:28----------
treatment can actually be like


---------78:29----------
iatrogenically injuring


---------78:31----------
that we're trying to help people and we


---------78:33----------
actually end up hurting them instead


---------78:35----------
um and then i talked i ranted a little


---------78:37----------
bit about professional hubris and a big


---------78:39----------
problem that i see in sort of mental


---------78:41----------
health treatment which is that


---------78:42----------
uh you know meant yeah there you go


---------78:45----------
autonomy


---------78:47----------
autonomy it's the idea that


---------78:50----------
those with mental health issues don't


---------78:53----------
have it


---------78:54----------
and so that these experts feel


---------78:58----------
like they have a power of authority


---------79:01----------
over the individual because they


---------79:05----------
they're not as seen as having autonomy


---------79:06----------
it's one of the big issues that we face


---------79:08----------
as autistics


---------79:09----------
is that we're emphasized things like the


---------79:13----------
the puzzle piece puzzle piece and how


---------79:15----------
all these little different components


---------79:18----------
it gives people the idea that we can be


---------79:21----------
spoken over


---------79:22----------
because we're not capable of speaking


---------79:24----------
for ourselves


---------79:26----------
i think it's only approximately 30


---------79:29----------
percent


---------79:30----------
of autistics have an intellectual


---------79:31----------
disability


---------79:33----------
so there's still a large portion of the


---------79:35----------
autistic community that is capable


---------79:37----------
i mean are not even those with


---------79:38----------
intellectual disabilities they can still


---------79:40----------
speak from themselves


---------79:41----------
they might just need more help to be


---------79:43----------
able to do so


---------79:45----------
but that 30 is what's seen rather than


---------79:49----------
the entire autistic community


---------79:51----------
and it's it's sadly not just us as i was


---------79:54----------
mentioning it's the entire mental health


---------79:56----------
as well where you lose that autonomy


---------79:59----------
as soon as you're seen as having a


---------80:02----------
disability


---------80:03----------
a good example is individuals in


---------80:06----------
wheelchairs


---------80:07----------
people will go around and push them in


---------80:08----------
the wheelchair if they're in the way


---------80:10----------
they'll invade their their space above


---------80:13----------
their head


---------80:14----------
like it that that kind of individual


---------80:17----------
control is gone


---------80:21----------
i've never heard of the face i mean i


---------80:22----------
think it makes a lot of sense but i've


---------80:23----------
never heard the phrase


---------80:25----------
invade the space above your head their


---------80:27----------
head


---------80:29----------
i never think about like when i think


---------80:31----------
about my personal space i mean i you


---------80:32----------
know i haven't sat in a wheelchair but


---------80:34----------
i'm just


---------80:34----------
appreciating for a moment that generally


---------80:37----------
speaking when i think about invasions of


---------80:39----------
my personal space i think about them in


---------80:41----------
like


---------80:41----------
horizontal directions i don't really


---------80:43----------
think about in a vertical direction i i


---------80:46----------
i don't mean i mean i'm laughing just


---------80:48----------
because i don't know what else to do


---------80:49----------
right now but


---------80:50----------
i it's bizarre like i i can't imagine


---------80:53----------
what it's like to


---------80:54----------
you know have to worry about that space


---------80:56----------
and i feel lucky to not have to worry


---------80:58----------
about that space but it's it's


---------81:00----------
it's crazy um yeah i'm with you in terms


---------81:03----------
of autonomy though and i think this is


---------81:04----------
the the other tricky thing


---------81:06----------
yeah so that's why i was kind of curious


---------81:07----------
about you know this term disabled


---------81:09----------
because


---------81:11----------
i see this a lot too and i think


---------81:12----------
sometimes


---------81:14----------
yeah it's tough because i think we're


---------81:16----------
quick


---------81:17----------
to take away other people's autonomy


---------81:20----------
um i see this a lot too where a lot of


---------81:22----------
times we like i see this with with


---------81:24----------
our community actually and like when


---------81:26----------
they talk to their parents


---------81:28----------
so we work on this a lot where people


---------81:30----------
will say


---------81:31----------
you don't understand right so like the


---------81:34----------
parents will say to the kid like you


---------81:35----------
don't understand


---------81:38----------
like i wish like let me explain it to


---------81:40----------
you and it's like no like


---------81:42----------
i'm allowed to understand and disagree


---------81:45----------
it's not that i don't understand like


---------81:46----------
you're you're kind of assuming that i'm


---------81:50----------
ignorant whereas i just


---------81:53----------
disagree i'm allowed to have an opinion


---------81:56----------
that is different from yours and that


---------81:58----------
doesn't make it objectively wrong it's


---------81:59----------
not a deficiency in my understanding


---------82:01----------
i see this a lot also in gender dynamics


---------82:04----------
um in terms of like sometimes you know


---------82:07----------
people will


---------82:07----------
like especially towards women and within


---------82:10----------
our community


---------82:11----------
um you know people will be like oh


---------82:13----------
because you are a woman therefore your


---------82:15----------
opinion is worth less than someone


---------82:16----------
else's


---------82:17----------
like you need to understand or actually


---------82:20----------
i don't even know that it's even that


---------82:21----------
conscious but like i i see this a lot


---------82:23----------
where


---------82:24----------
where disagreements are viewed as like a


---------82:26----------
lack of understanding


---------82:27----------
anytime there's kind of like this power


---------82:28----------
dynamic whether it's parents and kids or


---------82:30----------
men and women or whatever have you had


---------82:34----------
personal experiences where you felt like


---------82:36----------
you've been kind of shouted down or


---------82:38----------
ignored because of your disability


---------82:45----------
i want to say yes but i'm not able to


---------82:48----------
pull anything right out of the top of my


---------82:50----------
head


---------82:50----------
totally fine man okay um i know i've had


---------82:53----------
to argue a lot with like psychiatrists


---------82:56----------
and everything as well


---------82:57----------
just in general um things like


---------83:00----------
medication it's one of the reasons why i


---------83:02----------
pursued


---------83:02----------
pharmaceutical sciences and stuff


---------83:04----------
because i wanted to have a bit more


---------83:06----------
control over my own medication since


---------83:09----------
like when it comes to like the


---------83:11----------
pharmaceutical side


---------83:12----------
it's very it's not patient tailored


---------83:15----------
because we're not going into like


---------83:17----------
genetics etc etc


---------83:19----------
so finding those right mediums were very


---------83:21----------
difficult and so i wanted to have some


---------83:23----------
sort of authority in that conversation


---------83:25----------
to be able to better treat myself versus


---------83:29----------
where it's just


---------83:29----------
no i'm i know better


---------83:32----------
yeah that really pisses me off like i i


---------83:36----------
think that i i recently had a


---------83:37----------
conversation with a patient of mine


---------83:39----------
where you know


---------83:41----------
it was a tough it was a tough sort of


---------83:43----------
impasse um


---------83:45----------
because i was sort of recommending a


---------83:46----------
particular medication that they didn't


---------83:48----------
like and then ultimately like


---------83:49----------
you know at some point in the


---------83:50----------
conversation i was like i'm not the one


---------83:52----------
it's easy for me to make this


---------83:53----------
recommendation because i'm not the one


---------83:54----------
who has to put that pill into my body on


---------83:56----------
a daily basis


---------83:58----------
you know and i think that's very easy to


---------84:00----------
forget like we sort of think about


---------84:03----------
um you know what's like evidence-based


---------84:05----------
and scientific but like


---------84:07----------
as is pharmacologic prescribers like


---------84:09----------
we're not the one who has to


---------84:11----------
you know i have this book right and the


---------84:12----------
book has a list of side effects and i'm


---------84:14----------
like it can cause dry mouth it can cause


---------84:15----------
weight gain


---------84:16----------
it can cause erectile dysfunction but


---------84:19----------
like i'm not the one who has to live


---------84:21----------
with it right


---------84:22----------
it's the patient who has to live with it


---------84:24----------
and that's what makes it really really


---------84:25----------
challenging i think


---------84:26----------
oftentimes as prescribers like it's one


---------84:28----------
of the things that i try really hard to


---------84:30----------
remember


---------84:32----------
it's something that i don't think we


---------84:33----------
emphasize enough but i don't think that


---------84:35----------
you should


---------84:36----------
need to get formal training to be


---------84:39----------
informed about medications i think


---------84:41----------
actually that's your right as a patient


---------84:43----------
and it's the responsibility of your


---------84:44----------
doctors to equip you with the


---------84:46----------
information to make an informed choice


---------84:48----------
as opposed to overrule what you want to


---------84:51----------
based on their authority like do they


---------84:52----------
know about it more than you do


---------84:54----------
absolutely but it's their job informed


---------84:57----------
consent


---------84:58----------
is like not about the consent it's about


---------85:01----------
the informed


---------85:03----------
absolutely um i i do actually have an


---------85:06----------
example as well


---------85:08----------
i went to uh my friend's wedding


---------85:11----------
and i had gotten lost um i was


---------85:15----------
in the actual wedding venue but i guess


---------85:17----------
i wasn't supposed to be there yet


---------85:20----------
and i i told like this person came


---------85:23----------
through and said like hey you're not


---------85:24----------
supposed to be here like he was like


---------85:26----------
getting really aggressive with me


---------85:28----------
and so you know i i went in and opened


---------85:30----------
up immediately hey i'm autistic


---------85:32----------
i'm confused i don't know where i'm


---------85:33----------
supposed to be and his response


---------85:36----------
immediately


---------85:37----------
was to see me as a child he directly put


---------85:40----------
his hands on me


---------85:41----------
it was like they're there bud like


---------85:44----------
literally all of my autonomy in that


---------85:46----------
instance was ripped from me


---------85:48----------
rather than being like hey i might have


---------85:51----------
some trouble


---------85:52----------
interacting this conversation i just


---------85:54----------
need a little bit


---------85:55----------
help like it was completely ripped from


---------85:57----------
me and just


---------85:59----------
like like my personal space was invaded


---------86:02----------
my


---------86:03----------
intellectual capability was invalidated


---------86:08----------
it sucked like like i i don't want to


---------86:11----------
call it dramatic


---------86:12----------
but at the same time it


---------86:16----------
it felt


---------86:20----------
disgraceful


---------86:23----------
you're good with words yes


---------86:27----------
i i paid a lot i had to pay a lot of


---------86:29----------
attention to words growing up


---------86:31----------
um like there was times where like i i


---------86:33----------
think i spent


---------86:35----------
days studying to understand metaphor


---------86:37----------
similes stuff like that just because


---------86:39----------
i wanted to have greater communication


---------86:42----------
capability


---------86:44----------
yeah i think you do a very good job i


---------86:47----------
think you're you know we talk about


---------86:48----------
alexa thymia sometimes on stream


---------86:51----------
i'd be really curious about how you


---------86:53----------
learned how to put


---------86:54----------
words to what you feel because i even


---------86:56----------
saw like the gears turning in your mind


---------86:58----------
there where you were like recalling the


---------87:00----------
experience and trying to figure out


---------87:01----------
what is the right word to describe how i


---------87:04----------
felt


---------87:06----------
um and and it was yeah you're good with


---------87:09----------
words man it's cool it's it's it it's


---------87:11----------
it's a pleasure to hear you talk about


---------87:14----------
stuff


---------87:16----------
because i think i'm happy to hear that


---------87:17----------
yeah you you're like


---------87:19----------
you're skilled with your words like in


---------87:21----------
terms of the way that you paint


---------87:22----------
and you can paint a very clear picture


---------87:24----------
because your words are quite precise


---------87:28----------
um do you want to talk about color on


---------87:30----------
the spec color


---------87:31----------
i'm sorry did you ever respond i mean i


---------87:33----------
didn't mean to shift gears on either


---------87:35----------
but so color the spectrum is event that


---------87:38----------
is happening april 30th that is


---------87:40----------
really problematic for the those of us


---------87:43----------
on the autistic spectrum


---------87:45----------
um it's done by mock robber and i'm sure


---------87:48----------
it's it's done with good intention


---------87:51----------
uh some of the language used one of the


---------87:54----------
like problematic things are things like


---------87:56----------
my son will never be able to become an


---------87:58----------
astronaut


---------87:59----------
where there's a lot of this like a lot


---------88:01----------
of autistics


---------88:02----------
and a lot of parents are hit with this


---------88:03----------
immediately as soon as their child's


---------88:05----------
diagnosed with autism


---------88:06----------
your son will never be able to do this


---------88:08----------
your your daughter will never be able to


---------88:10----------
become this


---------88:11----------
right there's a lot of um


---------88:14----------
a lot of i can't think of the word


---------88:19----------
there's a lot of qualifiers placed on


---------88:22----------
what a person can and can't be as soon


---------88:25----------
as they have a disability


---------88:28----------
and i this language is really harmful to


---------88:30----------
the autistic community


---------88:32----------
um we were kind of as mentioned


---------88:34----------
emphatized where we're seen as children


---------88:36----------
a lot of everything going on is from the


---------88:40----------
perspective of parent to child


---------88:42----------
rather than adult to adult or


---------88:48----------
adult to child right i think that the an


---------88:50----------
adult to a child that communication is


---------88:52----------
different than a parent to a child


---------88:55----------
um and next for autism is the charity


---------88:59----------
that's being supported


---------89:01----------
up until recently they wanted to cure


---------89:03----------
and prevent


---------89:04----------
autism which many of us in the autistic


---------89:07----------
community feel


---------89:08----------
is very um


---------89:12----------
they they use eugenics um i i think


---------89:15----------
that's a very


---------89:16----------
very powerful term um


---------89:19----------
i i see it as saying you don't want me


---------89:23----------
to exist


---------89:25----------
that autistics shouldn't exist


---------89:29----------
because we're seen as problematic um of


---------89:31----------
course next raw autism


---------89:33----------
came out with a whole thing like oh we


---------89:36----------
never


---------89:36----------
said that this is this is just gross


---------89:39----------
misinformation


---------89:41----------
and then they silently remove their


---------89:43----------
their mission statement that actually


---------89:45----------
include cure autism etc


---------89:48----------
and just didn't talk about it so they


---------89:50----------
they basically


---------89:51----------
gaslit the entire autistic community


---------89:55----------
and just like oh don't listen to them


---------89:58----------
and sorry go ahead can can i can i play


---------90:01----------
devil's advocate for a second because


---------90:02----------
now actually i'm a little bit confused


---------90:04----------
devil's advocate means i'm supporting a


---------90:05----------
point but it's really


---------90:06----------
i'm confused so when i as a medical


---------90:08----------
professional


---------90:10----------
when i think about a disability i do


---------90:13----------
certainly have a bias like for example


---------90:16----------
when someone


---------90:18----------
you know loses a let or i i maybe that


---------90:21----------
has to do with losing


---------90:22----------
um i tend to think about restoration of


---------90:26----------
function


---------90:27----------
is an important part of my profession


---------90:30----------
and so when i think about someone with


---------90:32----------
like a physical disability like if


---------90:33----------
someone had lost a hand


---------90:36----------
like i would think that it is a good


---------90:38----------
move


---------90:39----------
to for that person to no longer be


---------90:41----------
disabled


---------90:43----------
um when i think about you know like i'll


---------90:45----------
write letters for like medical


---------90:46----------
disabilities for people with depression


---------90:49----------
i certainly i mean i personally like


---------90:51----------
have a goal as a treatment provider


---------90:53----------
to get that person to no longer be


---------90:55----------
disabled


---------90:56----------
so now i'm a little bit confused about


---------91:00----------
um and apologies if i'm you know coming


---------91:04----------
across as


---------91:04----------
like not understanding because i i'm


---------91:06----------
really confused now because when i


---------91:07----------
when when you use the word disability i


---------91:09----------
think about something


---------91:11----------
as i that word triggers in me the idea


---------91:14----------
that something neat could or eventually


---------91:17----------
should be fixed


---------91:19----------
what do you think about that


---------91:24----------
i acknowledge that


---------91:27----------
my the it is a disability it does limit


---------91:30----------
what i can do what i can accomplish


---------91:33----------
but i think it's a disservice to also


---------91:36----------
what it allows for us to do and for what


---------91:38----------
it allows for us to accomplish


---------91:40----------
right it's important to acknowledge is


---------91:43----------
autism a disability because it's a


---------91:45----------
disability


---------91:46----------
or is it a disability because of society


---------91:50----------
and understanding how our ability to


---------91:53----------
function


---------91:54----------
in society makes it a disability


---------91:58----------
that's right there's there's a lot of


---------92:00----------
that argument where


---------92:03----------
it might not be something that needs to


---------92:05----------
be cured or prevented


---------92:07----------
because rather it should be about


---------92:09----------
meeting us


---------92:11----------
and understanding what we are or what


---------92:13----------
we're dealing with


---------92:15----------
rather than be like you don't fit let's


---------92:16----------
fix you because that


---------92:18----------
that yeah that's super problematic very


---------92:21----------
well said so i'm i'm gonna kind of just


---------92:23----------
riff off that for a second and talk


---------92:25----------
about adhd so a lot of times when i work


---------92:28----------
with people with adhd


---------92:29----------
also as a clinician i try really really


---------92:32----------
hard


---------92:33----------
to not take the kid and make him


---------92:35----------
successful


---------92:37----------
don't default to making him successful


---------92:39----------
at sitting in a classroom for eight


---------92:40----------
hours a day


---------92:42----------
so so my treatment if you can call it


---------92:45----------
that for adhd


---------92:46----------
is to try to structure an environment


---------92:48----------
where there are vata mines so they have


---------92:50----------
a mind that's far more dynamic


---------92:52----------
can handle a lot more varied stimuli and


---------92:55----------
is not really suited to like staring at


---------92:56----------
a book for four hours a day


---------92:58----------
so what i actually try to do with my


---------93:00----------
patients with adhd is not to turn them


---------93:02----------
into


---------93:03----------
people who can read books but to help


---------93:05----------
them structure an environment because i


---------93:06----------
think that adhd


---------93:08----------
is actually like more of a natural i


---------93:09----------
mean there's definitely a clinical


---------93:11----------
illness in there


---------93:12----------
but i think there are too many people


---------93:14----------
who get diagnosed with adhd


---------93:16----------
because their minds are not suited for a


---------93:18----------
particular


---------93:19----------
environment like school so there's a


---------93:22----------
really interesting bit of research that


---------93:24----------
shows that


---------93:25----------
as the student-to-teacher ratio gets


---------93:27----------
worse


---------93:28----------
more kids get diagnosed with adhd so if


---------93:31----------
you have one teacher in 10 students


---------93:33----------
very few diagnoses of adhd if you have


---------93:36----------
one teacher and 50 students like half


---------93:37----------
the class is going to get diagnosed with


---------93:39----------
adhd


---------93:40----------
so i can totally get behind that did you


---------93:43----------
want to say


---------93:44----------
actually i actually wish i had that kind


---------93:46----------
of treatment growing up


---------93:47----------
i for me the only place i can actually


---------93:49----------
study is in a classroom now


---------93:51----------
so i need like this this very specific


---------93:53----------
environment anywhere else i can't study


---------93:55----------
yeah it sucks yeah i think it's it's


---------93:58----------
also an interesting philosophical


---------94:00----------
question about


---------94:01----------
you know how much do we change who we


---------94:03----------
are versus how much do we


---------94:05----------
adapt or shape our environment to


---------94:07----------
accommodate us


---------94:10----------
i'm curious and let me know if this


---------94:12----------
question rubs you the wrong way if i


---------94:14----------
could give you a pill and


---------94:15----------
and that would quote unquote cure your


---------94:17----------
autism would you take it


---------94:20----------
it's one of those hard things right it's


---------94:24----------
like it can't


---------94:28----------
i can't quantify what part of me is


---------94:30----------
autistic


---------94:32----------
right that that's one of the big things


---------94:34----------
in like why we we tend to prefer


---------94:36----------
autistic individual versus individual


---------94:37----------
with autism


---------94:39----------
is because we can't really separate that


---------94:42----------
we can't be like oh that's that's my


---------94:44----------
autism part okay


---------94:46----------
bye i don't like you it it's it's so


---------94:50----------
much of who i am


---------94:54----------
and so to secure my autism would mean


---------94:58----------
eliminating who i am and so


---------95:02----------
like i i i couldn't like ethically


---------95:05----------
not just like not just because of like


---------95:08----------
the other reason so even ethically i


---------95:09----------
would be


---------95:10----------
deleting a part of myself


---------95:16----------
interesting so uh can i


---------95:20----------
disagree with you a little bit yeah sure


---------95:22----------
you're more than welcome to disagree all


---------95:24----------
right so


---------95:25----------
all respect but so this is where like i


---------95:27----------
tend to be in the minority and i realize


---------95:29----------
what i'm about to say like may offend


---------95:30----------
like millions of people


---------95:32----------
but you know it's weird uh yes like


---------95:38----------
because it's hard because what are you


---------95:41----------
right like i can understand exactly


---------95:43----------
where you're coming from but


---------95:44----------
the more i've meditated so a lot of what


---------95:46----------
i'm saying comes from my experiences in


---------95:48----------
meditation


---------95:49----------
where i've come to realize that core


---------95:51----------
parts of my identity is not truly who i


---------95:53----------
am


---------95:54----------
so i i would potentially for example


---------95:57----------
identify as a doctor and i clearly do


---------95:59----------
and there's a part of me that feels like


---------96:02----------
if you took my medical license away


---------96:04----------
i would not be me but oddly enough the


---------96:08----------
more i've meditated the more i've come


---------96:10----------
to realize that even being a doctor is a


---------96:12----------
false part of who i am


---------96:13----------
that the truest part of who i am is


---------96:16----------
somewhat transcendent and cannot be


---------96:18----------
reduced to a particular quality


---------96:21----------
i know it sounds weird but like like i i


---------96:23----------
don't think of myself so it's it's kind


---------96:25----------
of bizarre so i work with a fair number


---------96:26----------
of people who are transgender too


---------96:28----------
and and you know my approach to them is


---------96:31----------
i can't tell if this is like


---------96:33----------
really really offensive or really really


---------96:35----------
accepting


---------96:36----------
but that their basic humanity is like


---------96:39----------
makes the core of who they are


---------96:41----------
and that that transcendent humanity is


---------96:44----------
far


---------96:44----------
more important than what their


---------96:46----------
[Music]


---------96:48----------
gender is and some people get really


---------96:51----------
offended by this and we have


---------96:52----------
that conversation and other people


---------96:54----------
really appreciate it i'm not sure what's


---------96:56----------
right or wrong it's just been


---------96:58----------
my experience in terms of discovering


---------97:00----------
who i am


---------97:02----------
because there's a part yeah sorry i


---------97:04----------
don't think i


---------97:05----------
follow doesn't that fit my statement


---------97:09----------
because you said that it may sorry yeah


---------97:12----------
so so that that's what's also kind of


---------97:13----------
confusing i think it's a different way


---------97:14----------
of looking at identity


---------97:16----------
but like i there's a part of me that


---------97:18----------
says that we could change a lot of


---------97:20----------
things about you and you would still be


---------97:22----------
you


---------97:24----------
but what i'm hearing you say is that you


---------97:26----------
consider


---------97:27----------
your identity to be entangled with


---------97:31----------
autism


---------97:32----------
and so removing the autism is removing a


---------97:34----------
piece of you


---------97:37----------
right like philosophically and somewhat


---------97:40----------
neuron scientifically


---------97:42----------
speaking like our our consciousness is


---------97:45----------
our brain right we could argue that the


---------97:47----------
structure of our brain plays a large


---------97:49----------
role


---------97:50----------
in our consciousness with autism being a


---------97:53----------
neurological disorder


---------97:55----------
the way that my brain is shaped is


---------97:57----------
shaped so by my autism


---------97:59----------
so to change that neurological component


---------98:02----------
would be to change myself


---------98:04----------
yeah so then my next question is is


---------98:06----------
changing yourself a bad thing


---------98:09----------
there is a difference between changing


---------98:11----------
yourself and neuroplasticity and


---------98:13----------
choosing key components of your identity


---------98:16----------
um and in that i i can't think of a good


---------98:20----------
example right now


---------98:24----------
there there's superficial change that we


---------98:26----------
all have that to some degree i think


---------98:28----------
can be critical um but


---------98:31----------
at the the identity of it all it's the


---------98:34----------
same i think


---------98:35----------
maybe this is a good example of phineas


---------98:37----------
phineas gage


---------98:39----------
uh for those who don't know phineas gage


---------98:41----------
had a


---------98:42----------
rod he was a railway railroad worker he


---------98:44----------
had a rod go through


---------98:46----------
his um his job basically i can't think


---------98:50----------
of the specific


---------98:51----------
um and went through the frontal cortex


---------98:53----------
which caused his entire behavior to


---------98:55----------
change


---------98:56----------
um so he started gambling he went from


---------99:00----------
like this religious devout person to


---------99:02----------
a gambling alcoholic very aggressive


---------99:05----------
very


---------99:06----------
um just


---------99:09----------
very horrible person so to speak by


---------99:11----------
comparison not saying that that is


---------99:13----------
horrible but


---------99:14----------
um was he still phineas gage


---------99:18----------
right and like that that's the whole


---------99:19----------
theory of like mind and what is and


---------99:22----------
isn't i don't think i'm equipped to


---------99:24----------
really have that that conversation


---------99:26----------
but to my understanding is that i cease


---------99:29----------
to exist when that changes


---------99:32----------
yeah so this is where things get a


---------99:34----------
little bit tricky because i


---------99:36----------
i you know it's it's interesting um yes


---------99:38----------
because i


---------99:39----------
i get exactly where you're coming from


---------99:40----------
and i think autonomy is ultimately like


---------99:42----------
what is most important so i think you


---------99:44----------
get to decide whether you like who you


---------99:47----------
are and whether you want to change i do


---------99:50----------
think it's arrogant for an organization


---------99:52----------
or for someone else like


---------99:53----------
including myself as a you know potential


---------99:55----------
treatment provider


---------99:56----------
for me to decide what is right for my


---------99:59----------
autistic patients like i don't get to


---------100:01----------
make that decision you get to make that


---------100:02----------
decision


---------100:04----------
and and so i can get i can totally


---------100:07----------
support you 100


---------100:08----------
in terms of you know you saying that


---------100:11----------
autism has shaped the person that i


---------100:12----------
am and i would it's i didn't hear you


---------100:15----------
say yes or no if i offered you the pill


---------100:19----------
no no okay so i think that's totally


---------100:22----------
fine i think that's


---------100:23----------
that's ultimately i think autonomy is


---------100:25----------
tends to be the


---------100:27----------
the ethical principle that is a


---------100:29----------
treatment provider like i try to value


---------100:31----------
above everything else


---------100:33----------
um at the same time i also find that i'm


---------100:37----------
in the profession


---------100:38----------
of trying to make people change that a


---------100:41----------
lot of times people will come to me


---------100:44----------
because there is a part of what they


---------100:46----------
view as their core identity which they


---------100:48----------
do not like in which they want to change


---------100:50----------
and i think that's totally fine too i


---------100:53----------
know personally that


---------100:55----------
um a lot of my journey has been


---------100:59----------
struggling


---------101:00----------
to get away from my identity and


---------101:03----------
discover who i truly am


---------101:05----------
because i think a lot of our identity is


---------101:07----------
like crafted and given to us


---------101:10----------
right like you're right like the


---------101:11----------
identity that society gives you when you


---------101:13----------
when you're at that wedding and you say


---------101:16----------
to this person that i have autism and


---------101:18----------
i'm confused i'm not sure where i'm


---------101:19----------
supposed to be


---------101:20----------
the way that the world treats you the


---------101:22----------
way that the identity that like


---------101:24----------
the world kind of hands you is one that


---------101:27----------
i think sometimes we have to actually


---------101:29----------
try really hard to get away from because


---------101:30----------
i think we also


---------101:31----------
internalize some of that so it's not


---------101:33----------
just uh you can arguably say yeah


---------101:35----------
society's like society's wrong but i


---------101:37----------
think what we do is we internalize these


---------101:39----------
things right


---------101:40----------
when we think about shame and stuff like


---------101:42----------
that we start to believe that we


---------101:43----------
are you know when it comes to the chads


---------101:45----------
and the what chads and the betas is it


---------101:47----------
chad and beta is that the


---------101:50----------
what's the opposition


---------101:53----------
anyway i i don't know so


---------101:56----------
it's tricky but i'm i'm i'm really happy


---------101:59----------
that you


---------102:00----------
you answer the question i i feel like i


---------102:02----------
learned a lot and i i think you've


---------102:04----------
really helped me


---------102:05----------
understand you said not people without


---------102:08----------
because that's interesting because i've


---------102:09----------
been told the opposite that it's more


---------102:10----------
offensive


---------102:12----------
that you define a person by a particular


---------102:15----------
diagnosis


---------102:17----------
that's the thing right like like as i


---------102:19----------
was mentioning since


---------102:20----------
autism is a neurological disability we


---------102:22----------
are as much autistic as we are a person


---------102:25----------
we're an autistic


---------102:26----------
person right our our identity can't be


---------102:29----------
separated i can't just like


---------102:30----------
okay i'm gonna go ahead and take my


---------102:32----------
autistic self i'm gonna just leave it at


---------102:34----------
home


---------102:34----------
and i'm gonna be totally normal today i


---------102:37----------
never can separate that


---------102:38----------
so i was taught the opposite by a


---------102:41----------
different group of people with a


---------102:42----------
different diagnosis


---------102:44----------
so and i'm not saying one is right or


---------102:46----------
wrong but like just to share with you


---------102:47----------
like


---------102:48----------
another conversation i had i was talking


---------102:50----------
with people with schizophrenia


---------102:52----------
and in medicine we have some


---------102:56----------
diseases that we define as the person


---------102:59----------
so we'll say so and so is a


---------103:01----------
schizophrenic


---------103:03----------
right but there is no noun that involves


---------103:07----------
cancer


---------103:08----------
so cancer is an illness like you're not


---------103:10----------
defined by your cancer like you get


---------103:11----------
diagnosed with a cancer i have


---------103:13----------
a cancer i'm not like a cancer rick


---------103:18----------
and so people like when i was kind of


---------103:20----------
like talking to people with


---------103:21----------
schizophrenia what they were sort of


---------103:23----------
saying to me


---------103:24----------
is that they don't appreciate


---------103:27----------
being defined by a particular illness or


---------103:30----------
aspect of themselves


---------103:32----------
and that they think that the person is


---------103:34----------
more important with schizophrenia


---------103:37----------
because there's still a person and the


---------103:38----------
problem is that once you get labeled as


---------103:40----------
a schizophrenic you become a


---------103:41----------
schizophrenic


---------103:43----------
you become a and i guess what they would


---------103:45----------
say is you


---------103:46----------
become an autistic in the eyes of others


---------103:49----------
but that your humanness is more


---------103:50----------
important than your autism but i


---------103:51----------
understand both sides of the argument i


---------103:53----------
don't know


---------103:54----------
i i think when it comes to schizophrenic


---------103:56----------
it has a lot to do with the stigma


---------103:58----------
as we mentioned at the start of this the


---------104:00----------
individual with borderline personality


---------104:02----------
disorder


---------104:03----------
these things have such negative


---------104:05----------
connotations to them


---------104:06----------
that you naturally don't want to be


---------104:09----------
associated to that you want to be seen


---------104:11----------
as a person because what society sees


---------104:13----------
when they


---------104:14----------
hear these words are untouchable someone


---------104:17----------
that


---------104:18----------
just to avoid um


---------104:21----------
thankfully that hasn't happened with


---------104:23----------
autism yet


---------104:24----------
okay and so i think we have the ability


---------104:27----------
to take that word and make it a positive


---------104:29----------
rather than trying to distance ourselves


---------104:31----------
from negative connotations


---------104:34----------
um and so do you consider like if i were


---------104:38----------
to


---------104:39----------
so you refer to yourself as an autistic


---------104:42----------
individual


---------104:43----------
is that your preferred and and


---------104:46----------
uh is the term


---------104:49----------
uh is there a noun form of person with


---------104:52----------
autism is it


---------104:54----------
an autistic yes an autistic as an


---------104:57----------
autistic


---------104:58----------
okay um so so it the then the term


---------105:02----------
autistic is not offensive to you


---------105:04----------
no okay got it thanks for clarifying


---------105:07----------
cool


---------105:08----------
uh again i can only really speak for


---------105:10----------
myself and


---------105:11----------
other autistics that i've interacted


---------105:13----------
with um obviously there's going to be


---------105:15----------
people of a community


---------105:16----------
that might feel otherwise i i think i


---------105:19----------
saw a comment it's up to the individual


---------105:21----------
and i think that's important as well to


---------105:22----------
consider is that some individuals will


---------105:24----------
prefer to be referred to as


---------105:26----------
individuals with autism some will be


---------105:28----------
referred to as autistic


---------105:30----------
individual and i think both should be


---------105:31----------
honored based on the


---------105:33----------
the individual person yeah


---------105:36----------
cool anything else that you want to tell


---------105:39----------
us or explain to us about you know


---------105:41----------
what's going on in the autistic


---------105:42----------
community or


---------105:45----------
anything that you want to raise


---------105:46----------
awareness of um


---------105:48----------
i'm currently doing a charity event for


---------105:51----------
autistic self-advocacy network uh we've


---------105:55----------
raised sixteen thousand eight hundred


---------105:56----------
and forty dollars so far


---------105:58----------
this month this is my third year uh


---------106:00----------
running warriors for autism


---------106:02----------
uh in world of warcraft i eventually


---------106:05----------
would like to start my own charity


---------106:07----------
focusing on helping autistic adults


---------106:10----------
i want to focus on you know


---------106:14----------
things like housing and employment


---------106:17----------
and kind of like creating this this


---------106:19----------
community that


---------106:21----------
is self-sustaining but in the meantime


---------106:24----------
one of the most important things is i


---------106:25----------
think self-advocacy equipping autistics


---------106:28----------
to be able to


---------106:29----------
advocate for ourselves to illustrate


---------106:31----------
what autism


---------106:32----------
is so that the the broader population


---------106:36----------
can understand who we are is incredibly


---------106:38----------
important


---------106:39----------
and it's one of the reasons why i've


---------106:40----------
been really really proud to support asan


---------106:42----------
for


---------106:43----------
these past three years awesome can i ask


---------106:46----------
one clarifying question sorry about the


---------106:48----------
terminology yeah go ahead is the term


---------106:51----------
autist


---------106:52----------
hopefully that's not a bannable term but


---------106:54----------
do you know


---------106:55----------
but is that offensive or is that okay


---------106:58----------
i'm not a big fan of autist uh i


---------107:02----------
i don't know about others like i i can't


---------107:05----------
speak on that one with any authority


---------107:07----------
um but i know that autist has a bit more


---------107:10----------
sling to it


---------107:12----------
in that it has negative connotations


---------107:14----------
kind of similar to


---------107:16----------
um sperg a lot of people don't know that


---------107:19----------
spur comes from asperger's


---------107:21----------
and that a lot of the characteristics


---------107:22----------
that use or


---------107:24----------
are associated to sperg are the negative


---------107:26----------
characteristics that you associate to


---------107:28----------
autism


---------107:30----------
okay thanks for clarifying yeah i i sort


---------107:32----------
of am


---------107:33----------
more familiar with that term in terms of


---------107:35----------
like i do find it to be a little bit


---------107:37----------
more derogatory and stigma inducing


---------107:40----------
um i basically don't see it used outside


---------107:43----------
of 4chan


---------107:44----------
which i think by definition makes it a


---------107:46----------
little bit


---------107:47----------
less safer yeah exactly


---------107:51----------
oh so but thanks for clarifying to us i


---------107:53----------
appreciate that


---------107:55----------
of course um any so sometimes i'll teach


---------107:57----------
people how to meditate on stream is that


---------107:59----------
interesting to you i actually used to


---------108:02----------
meditate a lot when i was younger


---------108:04----------
um i got harassed a lot for that


---------108:08----------
like one time when i was in a after


---------108:11----------
school


---------108:12----------
care thing i would be meditating and


---------108:15----------
not even joking one of the employees


---------108:18----------
there


---------108:18----------
uh took their drink and threw it in my


---------108:21----------
face


---------108:22----------
that's crazy man yeah um


---------108:26----------
i wish i have so many stories like this


---------108:31----------
childhood was rough but yeah um so


---------108:35----------
meditating yes i haven't done in many


---------108:37----------
many


---------108:38----------
many years but um i used to quite


---------108:41----------
regularly


---------108:43----------
um okay so i i can teach you like a


---------108:46----------
relatively introductory technique which


---------108:48----------
we do frequently on stream


---------108:50----------
um maybe we can all do it together but


---------108:52----------
it's a good technique because it


---------108:54----------
actually


---------108:55----------
increases your sympathetic let me think


---------108:57----------
about this


---------108:58----------
so there's one that balances your


---------108:59----------
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous


---------109:01----------
system


---------109:02----------
and there's another one that um


---------109:04----------
[Music]


---------109:05----------
are you just suppressing yawn


---------109:08----------
no okay i i just felt like i got a


---------109:12----------
yawning signal from you but


---------109:14----------
um i i just took a deep breath just like


---------109:18----------
like getting prepared to meditate


---------109:26----------
sorry


---------109:29----------
i was like oh he's trying not to yawn to


---------109:31----------
to to be polite


---------109:32----------
and he's been programmed so


---------109:35----------
oh no no oh my god i um


---------109:39----------
i was taking physics


---------109:42----------
a calculus based physics and it was lit


---------109:45----------
at night


---------109:46----------
and i totally forgot where i was and i


---------109:49----------
just let out this big


---------109:52----------
[Music]


---------109:53----------
while the teacher was talking


---------109:57----------
yeah um i have something to show you


---------110:00----------
real quick


---------110:02----------
uh so i can give you two options for a


---------110:04----------
technique


---------110:05----------
one is one that balances your


---------110:07----------
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous


---------110:09----------
system


---------110:10----------
and another one actually activates your


---------110:13----------
parasympathetic nervous system


---------110:14----------
more directly uh this is not what i was


---------110:18----------
looking for but i think it's interesting


---------110:21----------
um so there's some evidence that


---------110:25----------
people with who are tests high on


---------110:27----------
sociopathy


---------110:29----------
don't actually um


---------110:33----------
uh people who test high on on the


---------110:35----------
sociopathy scale


---------110:36----------
actually don't uh


---------110:41----------
um they don't uh


---------110:46----------
yawn the same way


---------110:50----------
so like if contagious yawning is less


---------110:54----------
common


---------110:55----------
in people who are sociopaths so if you


---------110:58----------
guys


---------110:58----------
are for those of you on twitch chat who


---------111:01----------
are yawning with us


---------111:02----------
you are less likely to be a sociopath


---------111:05----------
and for those of you


---------111:06----------
who are not yawning you're more likely


---------111:10----------
to be a sociopath


---------111:13----------
um i


---------111:17----------
this is not the paper i was looking for


---------111:18----------
but i i grabbed it anyway just because i


---------111:20----------
think it's interesting because this one


---------111:21----------
talks about


---------111:22----------
autism versus psychopathic traits i've


---------111:25----------
never seen a paper that compares the two


---------111:27----------
but i'll have to look at this i can send


---------111:28----------
this to you if you want yeah


---------111:30----------
i'd actually really like that yeah that


---------111:32----------
was actually one of the hardest things i


---------111:33----------
found about my master's program was


---------111:35----------
reading papers


---------111:36----------
oh god i hate paper so much i think


---------111:38----------
that's the adhd part though


---------111:41----------
annaletti i don't know her but okay


---------111:43----------
interesting


---------111:45----------
um so in terms of uh


---------111:50----------
meditation you want you know we can do


---------111:53----------
something that is


---------111:54----------
um


---------111:54----------
[Music]


---------111:58----------
what you may call um we can do something


---------112:00----------
that's


---------112:01----------
parasympathetic and sympathetic or


---------112:03----------
something that it really recruits the


---------112:05----------
parasympathetic nervous system


---------112:06----------
more directly


---------112:10----------
uh let's try the parasympathetic more


---------112:12----------
directly okay


---------112:14----------
so i'm gonna teach you um a technique


---------112:17----------
called


---------112:17----------
bellows breath actually let me think


---------112:19----------
about let's teach you something new


---------112:21----------
um so i'm going to teach you


---------112:27----------
um hold on


---------112:33----------
yeah okay i'm gonna i'm gonna teach you


---------112:34----------
a technique called bellows breath


---------112:36----------
or no that's not the translation


---------112:40----------
um i'm gonna teach you


---------112:43----------
i forget what the sense with word is but


---------112:45----------
i'm going to teach you yeah let's just


---------112:46----------
call bella's breath


---------112:47----------
it's technically not correct but so what


---------112:49----------
i'm going to do is do a series of rapid


---------112:51----------
forceful exhalations followed by


---------112:55----------
a passive inhalation it's kind of hard


---------112:58----------
to describe it you'll you'll understand


---------113:00----------
i think hopefully when i


---------113:01----------
show you so we're going to breathe very


---------113:04----------
rapidly


---------113:05----------
focusing on the exhalation and then


---------113:07----------
what's going to happen is our co2 level


---------113:09----------
is going to drop really low


---------113:12----------
and so as our co2 as we become


---------113:14----------
hypocarbic


---------113:16----------
our respiratory drive is going to


---------113:18----------
compensate by


---------113:19----------
slowing down our breathing


---------113:22----------
and so as we slow down our breathing


---------113:24----------
it's gonna be like really really


---------113:26----------
natural and then we'll sort of be in


---------113:27----------
this like chill state afterward


---------113:30----------
okay so what i'm gonna do i'll just


---------113:31----------
demonstrate so we're gonna start with


---------113:33----------
like i'll do nine breaths


---------113:35----------
and i'm gonna blow out x forcefully


---------113:38----------
through the nose


---------113:40----------
nine times and um


---------113:43----------
it sounds kind of weird but i'm not


---------113:44----------
gonna focus on inhaling i'm just gonna


---------113:46----------
try to push out air


---------113:47----------
over and over and over again and then


---------113:49----------
after nine breaths i'm gonna just be


---------113:51----------
silent okay


---------113:52----------
so ready


---------113:59----------
hold on i need kleenex


---------114:03----------
the snot came out okay here we go


---------114:20----------
did you get that so nine forceful


---------114:22----------
exhalations


---------114:23----------
okay okay so i'm gonna try this let's


---------114:26----------
i'm gonna watch you do it okay


---------114:27----------
okay breathe out hard nine times and


---------114:30----------
then just chill after


---------114:34----------
okay


---------114:42----------
good so second time around we're gonna


---------114:46----------
do


---------114:46----------
let's do 15 with our eyes closed


---------114:51----------
okay so take it deep so close your eyes


---------114:53----------
take a deep breath in


---------114:55----------
and begin


---------115:23----------
all right let's do 20 now


---------115:26----------
how do you feel after the 15 breaths


---------115:29----------
confused mostly okay so let's try 20.


---------115:34----------
am i supposed to breathe in directly


---------115:36----------
after the 15 or do i hold my breath


---------115:38----------
there for a bit because


---------115:39----------
i have your breath okay just do whatever


---------115:42----------
feels natural because holding my breath


---------115:45----------
is what felt natural


---------115:46----------
because like i just didn't want to


---------115:48----------
breathe yep yep that's the point


---------115:50----------
so but don't try to hold your breath


---------115:52----------
right so i i told you there's going to


---------115:53----------
be a natural


---------115:54----------
slowing of your respiratory rate because


---------115:56----------
you're hypocarbic


---------115:58----------
so your your your your mind will st like


---------116:00----------
you'll feel like not breathing and then


---------116:02----------
as you


---------116:03----------
don't breathe it'll actually like


---------116:06----------
recruit


---------116:06----------
your vagal systems okay


---------116:11----------
right so rapid breathing is associated


---------116:13----------
with this sympathetic nervous system


---------116:14----------
activity


---------116:15----------
increased respiratory rate so what we're


---------116:17----------
doing is recruiting


---------116:19----------
naturally our vagal system okay


---------116:22----------
okay so let's do 20 breaths


---------116:26----------
ready take a deep breath in go


---------116:53----------
so we're just gonna sit in this space


---------116:55----------
for about 60 seconds


---------117:22----------
this


---------117:57----------
when you're ready go ahead and come on


---------117:59----------
back


---------118:02----------
how you feeling it feels very similar to


---------118:05----------
like a hot shower


---------118:07----------
or a hot tub or relaxing on the couch


---------118:09----------
with a loved one


---------118:12----------
interesting relaxing on the couch with a


---------118:15----------
loved one meditation


---------118:18----------
well yeah like like there's these times


---------118:19----------
where like you just find a really good


---------118:21----------
show it's not like super


---------118:22----------
like exciting but you just feel so at


---------118:25----------
peace with your


---------118:26----------
your loved one that you just kind of


---------118:28----------
like melt into the couch


---------118:30----------
you don't really know how to so that's


---------118:33----------
what we call


---------118:34----------
parasympathetic activation right that's


---------118:37----------
a beautiful way to describe it actually


---------118:39----------
is like you know you're kind of


---------118:41----------
recruiting your floatiness


---------118:43----------
your chillingness and um


---------118:46----------
you know i'd be a little bit careful


---------118:47----------
desk like i'd experiment a little bit on


---------118:49----------
your own


---------118:50----------
um maybe if you have a clinician


---------118:52----------
involved uh you know just touch base


---------118:54----------
with them but my hope would be that if


---------118:56----------
you're ramping up towards like


---------118:57----------
an autistic meltdown you may be able to


---------119:01----------
use this to recruit some of that floaty


---------119:03----------
sensation


---------119:04----------
you just got to be a little bit careful


---------119:06----------
that that initial hyperventilation phase


---------119:08----------
doesn't actually make things worse


---------119:11----------
chances are


---------119:12----------
i use this technique um for people with


---------119:14----------
who have panic attacks


---------119:16----------
and if they can do it kind of early


---------119:18----------
enough they can sort of stave off the


---------119:20----------
panic attack


---------119:21----------
and a lot of times even in the middle of


---------119:23----------
a panic attack it can be helpful


---------119:25----------
and they always tell me when i when i do


---------119:27----------
it with someone who's acutely in a panic


---------119:29----------
attack like in the emergency room


---------119:30----------
they say it doesn't help but then a week


---------119:33----------
later they're like yeah that actually


---------119:34----------
helped a lot


---------119:35----------
i just didn't realize it at the time


---------119:38----------
so i i didn't use this metaphor earlier


---------119:41----------
but i think it's a good example to


---------119:43----------
describe kind of


---------119:45----------
the the difference between neurotypical


---------119:47----------
response and autistic response


---------119:49----------
it's like we have this this water


---------119:51----------
balloon right


---------119:53----------
and so the water balloon can hold so


---------119:54----------
much water


---------119:56----------
um and eventually if too much water gets


---------119:59----------
in it it bursts


---------120:01----------
right i feel like normal individuals


---------120:04----------
have valves towards the bottom of it so


---------120:07----------
it takes a lot of water


---------120:09----------
and a lot of like miss mis fortunate


---------120:13----------
circumstances for it to actually fill


---------120:14----------
enough to burst


---------120:16----------
um so eventually like as water comes in


---------120:18----------
water goes out


---------120:20----------
for those of us with autism or at least


---------120:22----------
for myself specifically the way i would


---------120:24----------
describe it


---------120:25----------
is we have a much smaller balloon and


---------120:27----------
the valves are at the very top


---------120:30----------
so as it fills with water um


---------120:33----------
it takes longer for water to come back


---------120:35----------
out so it fills up at a much more rapid


---------120:37----------
rate


---------120:38----------
than the the water like going out


---------120:41----------
um so we're more likely to hit that


---------120:43----------
burst point


---------120:44----------
before we realize that we're full


---------120:47----------
so it's really hard and requires a lot


---------120:50----------
of


---------120:50----------
um cognition of like there's water in


---------120:54----------
here


---------120:55----------
i need to to start prepping and


---------120:57----------
preparing myself


---------120:59----------
before it even reaches those valves


---------121:03----------
well said beautiful analogy dust so


---------121:06----------
thanks a lot um for coming on you know


---------121:08----------
we really appreciate you coming on


---------121:10----------
sharing your perspectives about you know


---------121:11----------
what it's like to kind of grow up with


---------121:12----------
autism


---------121:13----------
i think you did a really awesome job of


---------121:15----------
um


---------121:18----------
showcasing kind of what the experience


---------121:21----------
is on the


---------121:22----------
inside for someone with autism in terms


---------121:24----------
of like


---------121:25----------
you know not being able to really


---------121:27----------
understand why things were hard for you


---------121:29----------
which i think is a really really good


---------121:30----------
example


---------121:31----------
i hear that the most from people not


---------121:33----------
with anxiety or depression but people


---------121:35----------
with autism and adhd


---------121:37----------
i don't understand why this is hard for


---------121:40----------
me when it seems so easy for everyone


---------121:42----------
else


---------121:44----------
um yeah yeah sorry no


---------121:47----------
go for it oh no no i was just going to


---------121:49----------
agree with you


---------121:50----------
yeah i think it's a beautiful way to


---------121:52----------
describe


---------121:53----------
you know because a lot of times people


---------121:55----------
aren't going to know like


---------121:57----------
like people who may wonder if they're


---------121:59----------
autistic i think this is a really key


---------122:01----------
takeaway


---------122:01----------
for them is that if if things just seem


---------122:05----------
really really hard for you and like they


---------122:08----------
seem so much easier for other people


---------122:10----------
there may be something going on like


---------122:12----------
autism or adhd


---------122:14----------
exactly so i think that's actually like


---------122:17----------
a really beautiful way to put it so


---------122:19----------
thanks very much for coming on


---------122:21----------
um thank you for all the work that you


---------122:22----------
do i think it's awesome that you're


---------122:23----------

---------122:43----------
i really hope that the my story and


---------122:45----------
everything's helped connected with


---------122:47----------
others and i mean one of my favorite


---------122:50----------
things is people hearing this the story


---------122:52----------
and realizing like hey maybe i'm


---------122:54----------
autistic


---------122:55----------
you know and they they start looking


---------122:56----------
into it they start pursuing it and they


---------122:58----------
might finally have answers to


---------123:00----------
why life's been so hard and not only


---------123:03----------
that but to have that connection


---------123:05----------
and to finally feel that sense of


---------123:07----------
belonging


---------123:10----------
