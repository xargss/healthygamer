---------00:00----------
so LS let me ask you something so


---------00:03----------
actually I'm gonna ask chat okay so one


---------00:05----------
of the things that I want you guys to


---------00:06----------
pay attention to so we were talking


---------00:07----------
about skill at conversation so since we


---------00:10----------
can't CLS's most of his face that's


---------00:12----------
perfectly fine so what I want chat to


---------00:14----------
pay attention to is is his eyes and


---------00:17----------
facial expressions right so let's just


---------00:19----------
try to pay attention to for a moment not


---------00:23----------
for a moment but for the duration of the


---------00:24----------
stream just see how much you guys can


---------00:26----------
interpret around how LS is feeling and


---------00:29----------
what he's doing just through his eyes


---------00:30----------
and eyebrows okay so let's just keep an


---------00:34----------
eye out for that all right so tell me a


---------00:36----------
little bit about how you've been doing


---------00:38----------
her so I I've tried the meditation thing


---------00:44----------
a few times and which meditation I don't


---------00:48----------
the one that we did at the very end


---------00:50----------
okay last time which was the sitting at


---------00:56----------
the edge of the chair trying to rewind


---------00:58----------
okay and everything right recollect a


---------01:00----------
lot of stuff and I I have no doubt that


---------01:05----------
it's my own mind doing it but I just I


---------01:08----------
can't focus and then it ends up actually


---------01:12----------
exacerbating my anxiety or like I


---------01:16----------
actually start thinking about other


---------01:18----------
things that weren't presently in my mind


---------01:21----------
sort of like how when you're asleep at


---------01:23----------
night and maybe your brain just doesn't


---------01:25----------
let you sleep and so they were there was


---------01:30----------
actually two occasions where I just had


---------01:31----------
to stop okay this last week was really


---------01:35----------
really bad


---------01:37----------
in the Lowell scene there was there was


---------01:39----------
a very dramatic thing that happened that


---------01:43----------
was centered around me in some ways so


---------01:47----------
that was very stressful oh can you tell


---------01:49----------
me about that um basically there's a


---------01:57----------
there's a an argument or a debate or I


---------02:01----------
don't know what you would want to call


---------02:02----------
it over two items within League of


---------02:07----------
Legends and it is there's a lot that


---------02:13----------
surrounds it


---------02:15----------
and the stuff that surrounds it it's


---------02:19----------
basically like you have to really go


---------02:22----------
into the minutiae go for it items in


---------02:25----------
spots so there's there's there's two


---------02:29----------
items in League of Legends there's


---------02:32----------
there's an item called liandry's torment


---------02:34----------
and there's another item called morale


---------02:37----------
and Elma calm and one of the items the


---------02:41----------
real legwork of the item comes from one


---------02:45----------
of the recipe items so you play dota so


---------02:47----------
I imagine so imagine that there's an


---------02:51----------
item that gives you 15 magic penetration


---------02:55----------
in 25 ability points okay and that item


---------03:01----------
only costs $1600 okay okay so the other


---------03:07----------
when you upgrade it you have to spend


---------03:09----------
fourteen hundred more dollars and all


---------03:12----------
that you get is 50 more ability points


---------03:15----------
I'm sorry it gives you 20 ability points


---------03:17----------
15 magic penetration and when you


---------03:20----------
upgrade it you spend fourteen hundred


---------03:22----------
more ability points eight hundred and


---------03:24----------
fifty of which is a component item that


---------03:27----------
goes into many many other items okay and


---------03:30----------
all that you get is an extra 100 HP 50


---------03:35----------
ability points and then a passive called


---------03:37----------
Grievous wounds which reduces healing by


---------03:39----------
40 percent okay so one of one of the


---------03:44----------
things that I've been I don't know if


---------03:47----------
you want to call it like preaching or


---------03:48----------
I've been very outspoken about for the


---------03:51----------
last year and a half and I've been very


---------03:53----------
vocal on Twitter and in videos and in


---------03:56----------
casts is that the original item the orb


---------04:01----------
for $1,600 is really really good


---------04:05----------
but spending the 1,400 to purchase that


---------04:10----------
the next item is oftentimes not ideal


---------04:14----------
okay because typically when you've


---------04:18----------
completed your first item and then


---------04:20----------
you're going into your second item the


---------04:23----------
game at that period enters into these


---------04:25----------
like Lowell states where it starts to


---------04:29----------
get slower everything's a lot more


---------04:31----------
controlled you only tend to fight around


---------04:34----------
neutral objectives when they're up and


---------04:36----------
the game pacing is a lot different


---------04:38----------
mm-hmm so I'm one of the one of the one


---------04:43----------
of the nicknames that people use like as


---------04:45----------
a play on my name there's even some


---------04:47----------
people in your chat with it


---------04:48----------
it's like laundry salesman because the


---------04:50----------
other item is called liandry's torment


---------04:52----------
and so I operated version is called


---------04:58----------
liandry's torment of another item yeah


---------05:01----------
in the game and I am a really big


---------05:04----------
advocate that the orb is really really


---------05:08----------
good because if you have that orb as


---------05:11----------
well as another item you can almost deal


---------05:14----------
true damage to certain champions in the


---------05:16----------
game okay but the mirela nomicon item in


---------05:20----------
itself is very awkward to sort of


---------05:24----------
evaluate because it applies a debuff for


---------05:27----------
2.5 seconds and it only reduces healing


---------05:30----------
by 40% and the amount of gold that


---------05:32----------
you're dumping into it is is very


---------05:35----------
awkward to evaluate because healing is


---------05:38----------
weirding itself there's active healing


---------05:40----------
which means that a champion has to be


---------05:42----------
hitting you in order to receive benefit


---------05:44----------
from their healing okay and in addition


---------05:46----------
to that you can't always sort of control


---------05:50----------
if the debuff is on them when they get


---------05:52----------
there he'll just get the nature of


---------05:54----------
teamfights sure so there's gonna be some


---------05:57----------
there's gonna be some variants and if


---------06:00----------
you actually get a kick out of the


---------06:01----------
debuff


---------06:02----------
the other thing though is the other item


---------06:05----------
liandry's torment is 3100 gold so


---------06:08----------
there's another item called void staff


---------06:10----------
which is 2600 and then there's another


---------06:13----------
item Robin's death cap which really


---------06:15----------
makes your ability points very big and


---------06:20----------
my argument is that oftentimes when


---------06:23----------
players are building oblivion or the


---------06:25----------
game is that a very stable state


---------06:28----------
oftentimes and because they're


---------06:30----------
professional players and not even


---------06:32----------
professional players so look you can do


---------06:33----------
it as well there's no reason to allocate


---------06:36----------
1400 gold for this very small bump in


---------06:38----------
power unless something is absolutely


---------06:41----------
necessary it's a lot better to take the


---------06:44----------
850 gold out of the 1400 and allocate it


---------06:48----------
into another item okay then factoring in


---------06:50----------
average assumed gold per minute you only


---------06:54----------
end up being a couple of minutes away


---------06:55----------
from another major item completion that


---------06:57----------
would then give you a much bigger boost


---------06:59----------
power spike because write a much bigger


---------07:02----------
power spike like liandry's torment or


---------07:05----------
Death Cap or void staff or something


---------07:08----------
like that


---------07:09----------
and the argument gets very twisted and


---------07:14----------
misconstrued and a lot of people don't


---------07:18----------
entertain all the variables and all this


---------07:20----------
other stuff and they'll ultimately label


---------07:24----------
it at a rudimentary level as Morello


---------07:27----------
versus Leon tree but that's not what the


---------07:29----------
argument ever was it was always oblivion


---------07:31----------
orb sitting on it because that that's


---------07:33----------
where the real power comes from the item


---------07:35----------
mm-hmm because the upgraded thing


---------07:38----------
doesn't really give you all that much it


---------07:40----------
gives you Grievous wounds a little bit


---------07:41----------
of ability power and HP and you can


---------07:44----------
argue that the HP is negligible on a


---------07:46----------
mage so what's what's the source of like


---------07:51----------
conflict or scandal so the scandal is


---------07:54----------
that myself and many other analysts or


---------08:00----------
people inside of the scene but I I'm the


---------08:01----------
figurehead of this argument or this that


---------08:05----------
this topic basically there was there was


---------08:10----------
a video made by another peer or


---------08:15----------
colleague


---------08:16----------
how I would describe it basically


---------08:18----------
someone that's in the same exact line of


---------08:19----------
work is me just in a different region


---------08:21----------
okay


---------08:22----------
and they made a video where I was the


---------08:27----------
thumbnail of the video so my face


---------08:29----------
literally my face a greater than sign


---------08:34----------
for the Morello


---------08:35----------
Dursley Andres the title of the video is


---------08:38----------
debunking Morello versus Leon Druce so


---------08:41----------
I'm basically being used as a figurehead


---------08:44----------
throughout the course of the video I'm


---------08:46----------
the only analyst referenced I'm the only


---------08:49----------
analyst whose name appears in the video


---------08:50----------
I'm the only analyst who has other


---------08:53----------
mentions in the video videos 27 minutes


---------08:57----------
long there's a lot of stuff that is also


---------09:00----------
emitted from the video like to me it


---------09:04----------
feels like a very giant straw man


---------09:05----------
because there's so many things that are


---------09:07----------
emitted from the arguments I'm on air so


---------09:11----------
often that I explained myself


---------09:12----------
ad nauseam to certain different people


---------09:14----------
but there's no compiled area perception


---------09:18----------
argument so there's a 24 24 minute long


---------09:23----------
video showcasing examples where Morello


---------09:26----------
is better than Lee Andres in a vacuum


---------09:28----------
but that was never at the argument in


---------09:31----------
the in the first place so it feels like


---------09:33----------
this is 24 minutes of attacking


---------09:35----------
something that just didn't exist in the


---------09:37----------
first place


---------09:38----------
yep but presenting it as such and that


---------09:40----------
made him feel really bad in Wow then


---------09:43----------
there was a three-minute ending where I


---------09:46----------
got very angry on stream maybe maybe you


---------09:49----------
could even watch the clip if you want I


---------09:51----------
don't know I got very angry and I said


---------09:55----------
some pretty explicit stuff about again


---------09:58----------
another person within the same line of


---------10:00----------
work in another region and when that


---------10:04----------
stream had ended I had actually felt


---------10:07----------
really bad after blowing up I deleted


---------10:10----------
the the stream the clips etc and I


---------10:16----------
thought to myself you know I was feeling


---------10:18----------
really stressed and tilted in the moment


---------10:21----------
mm-hmm


---------10:23----------
and it was it was during one of my LCS


---------10:26----------
KO streams that's like permission that


---------10:28----------
Riot Games grants


---------10:29----------
certain individuals that allows them to


---------10:32----------
actually stream that the premier


---------10:34----------
tournament PLC yes uh-huh so in the


---------10:37----------
middle of one of my streams


---------10:38----------
I got linked a donation I had a lot of


---------10:40----------
my chat flaming me saying that I got


---------10:43----------
flamed on an official European broadcast


---------10:46----------
so I think to myself what the hell is


---------10:48----------
this so I watched the clip on stream I


---------10:52----------
see stuff that I believe I talked about


---------10:55----------
this actually with you last time but


---------10:57----------
this is before the blow up in the


---------10:58----------
community happened I said what you know


---------11:03----------
I felt really awkward listening to


---------11:07----------
something that was being said and I felt


---------11:09----------
like it was being misconstrued and then


---------11:11----------
he post my chat is flaming me and I


---------11:14----------
received other stuff about this from


---------11:16----------
other mediums like on Twitter and stuff


---------11:19----------
it felt really bad so I reacted very


---------11:22----------
poorly inside of the moment so so what


---------11:24----------
in what way do you see you use the


---------11:26----------
phrase feel bad a couple of times in


---------11:29----------
what way do you feel bad I feel bad


---------11:34----------
knowing that that's not how I would want


---------11:39----------
to ever really conduct myself and then I


---------11:43----------
know that if someone spoke about me in a


---------11:48----------
similar manner like that it would feel


---------11:50----------
bad as well even if I can take it or I


---------11:55----------
can a like if the person is is like


---------11:58----------
accurate maybe in their assessment or


---------12:00----------
what they're saying maybe it hurts less


---------12:02----------
but it's just not good for anyone and it


---------12:05----------
shouldn't have to be that way and it


---------12:08----------
shouldn't get to that point okay also I


---------12:12----------
feel regret that I didn't manage it I


---------12:16----------
didn't manage my stress my stress in the


---------12:19----------
moment better as well as my frustration


---------12:22----------
like pent up frustration okay um yeah so


---------12:27----------
let me let me ask you this okay so some


---------12:31----------
of this is I actually Alice can you hold


---------12:33----------
on a second I think he may have just


---------12:34----------
figured out what I need to do to fix


---------12:36----------
this my video sorry for that


---------12:42----------
yeah so bad [ __ ] okay I'm not gonna


---------12:48----------
touch anything cuz I'm a just okay I'm


---------12:52----------
gonna just leave okay


---------12:53----------
so so so one is that so it sounds like


---------12:57----------
you felt bad and you felt bad because


---------13:00----------
you were you didn't represent yourself


---------13:08----------
in a way that you're happy with right


---------13:10----------
right so what does it feel like to what


---------13:15----------
does it feel like to be strong and on


---------13:16----------
the internet um it well I know that the


---------13:22----------
last three like few days I contemplated


---------13:25----------
what the [ __ ] am I even doing in the


---------13:29----------
sense that it does what is that like I


---------13:32----------
was just on air right so much the last


---------13:36----------
the last month and a half


---------13:38----------
for instance and as much as I was on air


---------13:42----------
as much as I had conversations with


---------13:46----------
either professional players or other


---------13:48----------
people on air because it's not compact


---------13:52----------
and available in one small like video or


---------13:56----------
something like that it's spread out


---------13:59----------
throughout you know turn hours and hours


---------14:02----------
upon hours of streams and castings and


---------14:05----------
to see that something can just be picked


---------14:09----------
and pride and strawman and then have


---------14:11----------
that actually impact you in a very


---------14:15----------
negative way potentially is very I don't


---------14:23----------
know I


---------14:23----------
I remember sitting there I remember


---------14:27----------
thinking to myself I'm gonna I'm gonna


---------14:30----------
blow up bi I was streaming wait wait


---------14:33----------
wait to myself wait one second so so


---------14:36----------
yeah before you start thinking about


---------14:38----------
what your reaction was what is the


---------14:40----------
feeling to being straumann on the


---------14:43----------
Internet


---------14:43----------
what is that it feels surreal that they


---------14:50----------
okay there can be so much that just it's


---------14:55----------
really weird um it's not that it can't


---------14:59----------
be refuted or shown as such it's that it


---------15:02----------
takes a lot of effort to do it and it


---------15:04----------
just it's it's so [ __ ] insane to me


---------15:07----------
how easy it is to do it but it's also


---------15:11----------
it's very angering the nature of it like


---------15:15----------
how I I don't know man it pisses you off


---------15:20----------
it sickens me in any way because I


---------15:25----------
attribute it with dishonesty and I


---------15:30----------
attribute it to I attributed to like to


---------15:35----------
like false journalism if you know what I


---------15:37----------
mean when everyone just wants to get a


---------15:39----------
piece out to be the first one but they


---------15:41----------
don't care about the accuracy yep and I


---------15:45----------
remember I did that to someone once


---------15:47----------
there was actually um there was a there


---------15:50----------
was a there was a thing on Reddit in


---------15:51----------
2016 i falsely I don't know I I did math


---------15:58----------
incorrectly on a situation and even


---------16:01----------
though it didn't detract from the


---------16:03----------
original argument in context the end


---------16:06----------
video that I put out and produced was


---------16:09----------
inaccurate and ultimately disingenuous


---------16:12----------
and it was


---------16:15----------
it was just bad to do and I remember


---------16:18----------
reflecting on that and thinking that


---------16:20----------
anytime that I'm really gonna get into


---------16:22----------
the nitty gritties or something or


---------16:23----------
really die on top of a hill I need to


---------16:26----------
make sure that I've looked at a lot more


---------16:29----------
angles and understood more unless why is


---------16:32----------
it important to convince people on the


---------16:34----------
internet that you're right not let's


---------16:39----------
talk about something that twitch chat


---------16:40----------
can relate to right like let's just they


---------16:46----------
don't practice like cuz it cuz that's


---------16:48----------
what we're talking about we're talking


---------16:49----------
about like someone else out there who's


---------16:51----------
being unjust that's what I'm sensing


---------16:54----------
from you that there's a sense of


---------16:55----------
injustice and unfairness and also that


---------16:58----------
it's so easy to tear down it's so much


---------17:01----------
easier to attack your position than it


---------17:06----------
is to like defend it yes it's a lot


---------17:10----------
easier and it also feels really bad if I


---------17:13----------
feel like I I feel I feel like I'm


---------17:18----------
always on a is it a tightrope catwalk


---------17:21----------
I'm not sure precipice yeah no no okay


---------17:29----------
but help me understand catwalk ah I'm


---------17:34----------
not sure what your analogy on our first


---------17:36----------
two because like I don't know what


---------17:38----------
you're about to say so you got it I have


---------17:40----------
what you


---------17:42----------
I feel like I have to be on point okay


---------17:45----------
or I have to always be alert okay what


---------17:50----------
happens I gotta look what happens if


---------17:53----------
you're not alert I feel like so for


---------17:57----------
instance this last video it came out I


---------18:00----------
woke up 10 hours into it being out right


---------18:03----------
I feel like if I'm alert or I'm on


---------18:08----------
standby for certain things I can I can


---------18:11----------
better squash any misunderstandings or


---------18:17----------
whatever a lot easier mm-hmm but if it's


---------18:21----------
allowed to fester and grow before


---------18:24----------
response is able to you know hmm occur


---------18:30----------
then it potentially does a lot of damage


---------18:32----------
okay that how am I able to be what what


---------18:36----------
kind of damage does it do um I think it


---------18:41----------
it can potentially damage credibility I


---------18:43----------
think it can damage perception which


---------18:48----------
attributes to credibility I think that


---------18:53----------
it can alter I think it can even alter


---------19:02----------
fuse of how much would you say integrity


---------19:05----------
is a part of credibility I I think that


---------19:07----------
there are sure I think you're very


---------19:09----------
concerned about your integrity in the


---------19:11----------
community yes yes so Ellis can I just


---------19:18----------
think for a second yep


---------19:36----------
you


---------19:43----------
give me give me a second okay yep


---------19:50----------
okay so I'm struggling a little bit to


---------19:54----------
try to I wanted so I think what you're


---------19:56----------
going through is actually quite


---------19:58----------
relatable and can be generalized and


---------20:00----------
maybe more applicable to chat so I'm


---------20:03----------
gonna start talking about things in a


---------20:04----------
slightly more abstract sense okay so by


---------20:09----------
abstract I'm gonna generalize it away


---------20:11----------
from you specifically but we could


---------20:12----------
certainly talk about you so the first


---------20:13----------
question LS is when we consider a


---------20:20----------
situation that affects you in some way


---------20:23----------
there's sort of a personal effect and


---------20:25----------
then there's actually like an external


---------20:27----------
consequence right so the first thing we


---------20:31----------
have to understand is that like this


---------20:32----------
situation is affecting you internally


---------20:34----------
and it's affecting you externally by


---------20:37----------
externally I mean like you know


---------20:38----------
affecting your likelihood of getting a


---------20:40----------
job or how you're perceived or things


---------20:42----------
like that and then it's also affecting


---------20:44----------
you internally because it's causing you


---------20:46----------
suffering yes do you understand that


---------20:49----------
distinction yes okay so how closely tied


---------20:55----------
are the suffering that you feel from


---------20:58----------
what the world like what is the


---------21:01----------
relationship between what happens in the


---------21:03----------
external world and your suffering so I'm


---------21:14----------
also gonna Jen yeah go ahead yeah no do


---------21:17----------
you mean in a general sense sure I think


---------21:25----------
that I constantly worry I guess


---------21:32----------
actually I don't know how to answer that


---------21:33----------
okay so I'm gonna ask you in a specific


---------21:36----------
way okay and now apologies cuz we're


---------21:39----------
gonna have sort of like a three-way


---------21:40----------
conversation because I'm gonna touch I'm


---------21:42----------
gonna ask twitch add some things to do


---------21:43----------
okay so how much of you being upset


---------21:47----------
about this situation or maybe upset


---------21:50----------
isn't even let's just use the word


---------21:51----------
suffering so how much of your suffering


---------21:53----------
is related to something about the


---------21:55----------
outside world like the way that you're


---------21:58----------
being misrepresented the way that people


---------22:00----------
are going to view you sort of a loss of


---------22:02----------
integrity like how much of it has to do


---------22:04----------
with them but the outside world like oh


---------22:06----------
now that like these this guy made this


---------22:08----------
video people are gonna think that you're


---------22:09----------
dumb like they're not going to respect


---------22:12----------
you but like it's unfair because you


---------22:15----------
know he's not accurately representing


---------22:17----------
your viewpoint I would say that within


---------22:22----------
my job that's a very very big stressor


---------22:26----------
or within my line of work okay so how


---------22:30----------
much of your suffering do you think is


---------22:31----------
tied to the external like something


---------22:34----------
about the outside world like either how


---------22:37----------
you're viewed or you know how you're


---------22:39----------
respected or whether you're


---------22:40----------
misrepresented outside world I don't


---------22:45----------
really bother with too much unless


---------22:51----------
you're also talking about well like I'm


---------22:55----------
talking about the league community you


---------23:00----------
I've been differentiating like work


---------23:02----------
within the composers like them so what


---------23:05----------
I'm saying is that like there's there's


---------23:07----------
like there's something going on inside


---------23:08----------
you like you're suffering in here right


---------23:10----------
you feel like things are unfair and


---------23:13----------
unjust and I'm trying to figure out how


---------23:15----------
much of that suffering comes from the


---------23:18----------
outside world and how much of it comes


---------23:20----------
from you like how much of it is is like


---------23:23----------
the reason I'm suffering is because I'm


---------23:25----------
afraid I'm gonna lose my job


---------23:27----------
the reason I'm suffering is because


---------23:29----------
people are not going to respect me or


---------23:31----------
treat me with integrity


---------23:32----------
the reason I'm suffering is because


---------23:34----------
people misunderstand my viewpoint like


---------23:36----------
I'm trying to figure out in that because


---------23:38----------
like is that accurate um I think that I


---------23:45----------
think a lot of my suffering or I think a


---------23:48----------
lot of my mental pain and stressors


---------23:49----------
lately is that the deeper that I seem to


---------23:54----------
be going in a lot of things the more I


---------23:56----------
seem to lose my idea of what I'm doing


---------24:01----------
more and that harms me what is that a


---------24:05----------
lot in the sense that when I when I


---------24:09----------
experience things like this like I'm


---------24:12----------
adding or stuff like that it makes me


---------24:15----------
think there might not be a real purpose


---------24:19----------
to anything that I'm doing and that


---------24:21----------
starts to really just get to me yeah


---------24:24----------
because it it makes me think I'm wasting


---------24:26----------
a lot of time okay so so let me just


---------24:30----------
make sure I understand that so what I


---------24:32----------
hear you saying is like like if you try


---------24:34----------
to do something right like so in the


---------24:37----------
league community like you you go like


---------24:39----------
you've gotten harder and deeper into the


---------24:41----------
league community like you're streaming


---------24:43----------
you know to tournaments at a time you're


---------24:45----------
posting things you're sharing your


---------24:47----------
opinions you really love strategy


---------24:49----------
strategy's a beautiful thing it's like


---------24:51----------
what motivates you it's it's what's


---------24:53----------
motivated you always and and the further


---------24:56----------
you get in this community the more you


---------24:58----------
wrap yourself up in it you get some


---------25:01----------
something happens that's negative and


---------25:04----------
then it makes you question whether your


---------25:06----------
commitment to like all this time


---------25:07----------
investment everything that you've been


---------25:09----------
doing is like worth it or not worth it


---------25:13----------
yeah and then it brings me to some


---------25:15----------
really dark places sure right so that it


---------25:20----------
makes it makes you the question how


---------25:22----------
you're spending your time whether it's


---------25:24----------
worth it to do this and then if you if


---------25:26----------
it's not worth it to do this then you're


---------25:27----------
Sol because it's not like you've


---------25:30----------
invested in other things yeah


---------25:35----------
that's it's it's a really it's a really


---------25:38----------
unsettling spot that I I'm actually in


---------25:41----------
right now yeah also yeah yeah so


---------25:47----------
continue because I don't want to segue


---------25:48----------
so so this is gonna be tricky so I'm


---------25:54----------
gonna ask twitch chat for a second okay


---------25:56----------
yeah how do we even do this hold on


---------26:07----------
I'm gonna need a minute yeah so let me


---------26:24----------
ask you something what do you think the


---------26:25----------
consequences of this are


---------26:35----------
[Music]


---------26:37----------
what are the consequences of the video


---------26:41----------
the video didn't actually seem to III


---------26:45----------
think that I overreacted in my own mind


---------26:49----------
about things it actually seems like from


---------26:53----------
a lot of like private messages that I


---------26:54----------
got as well as some private


---------26:56----------
conversations I've had as well as like


---------26:58----------
the public perception there was a


---------27:01----------
counter video that not counter video but


---------27:03----------
there was there was a counter post that


---------27:06----------
came out it actually didn't um it it


---------27:11----------
seemed like and I could be wrong I I


---------27:14----------
don't know I mean I looked everywhere


---------27:16----------
that I could it seemed like the


---------27:22----------
community actually defended me a lot


---------27:26----------
more than an any sort of attack it


---------27:30----------
seemed like the community was actually


---------27:32----------
very aware that all the points that were


---------27:34----------
actually brought up there was lots of


---------27:36----------
people referencing like specific things


---------27:38----------
that actually do exists on the internet


---------27:41----------
that showcase the video as being a straw


---------27:44----------
man and and other stuff like that that


---------27:51----------
that felt really relieving but there


---------27:55----------
were still a very there was still a very


---------27:57----------
unsettling feeling where there's some


---------28:01----------
other people that are not in the


---------28:03----------
community but rather in the workplace


---------28:05----------
that seemed to not endorse but promote


---------28:13----------
the video and that disturbed me because


---------28:16----------
it would suggest that either they're not


---------28:19----------
doing their own research or they're okay


---------28:22----------
with the dis ingenuity that was being


---------28:27----------
portrayed at least and my feeling and


---------28:30----------
that just makes me go what the [ __ ] is


---------28:32----------
wrong with you but I yeah yeah okay okay


---------28:43----------
I'm really sorry about this guys I just


---------28:44----------
need a second to really try to because I


---------28:47----------
think we're on the cusp of something big


---------28:48----------
and I'm trying to figure out how to make


---------28:49----------
it applicable to a chat okay so let's


---------28:53----------
just think about this Ellis


---------28:54----------
so you're you painted this picture right


---------28:57----------
and you painted this let let's just


---------28:58----------
think back through like what paint what


---------29:01----------
picture you painted for me and and us


---------29:03----------
and let's think about what the actual


---------29:06----------
situation is so you were kind of saying


---------29:07----------
okay this post happened it made you feel


---------29:10----------
bad it made you feel unsettled that this


---------29:14----------
person was attacking you he was strong


---------29:16----------
Manning you he was not like accurately


---------29:19----------
representing your viewpoint and that


---------29:21----------
this affects the other others to what


---------29:25----------
other other he references other people I


---------29:29----------
I took my gripe with it as serious as I


---------29:32----------
did because I was the only one


---------29:34----------
constantly referenced throughout the


---------29:36----------
video yeah so so that's yeah that's what


---------29:39----------
you said is that I mean it's clearly


---------29:40----------
like it's your face that's on the video


---------29:42----------
yeah yeah right okay so it makes you


---------29:45----------
feel bad makes me makes you feel


---------29:48----------
unsettled go ahead


---------29:49----------
it made me feel like it was a personal


---------29:52----------
attack masqueraded us analysis was the


---------29:55----------
literal line that I used a few times


---------29:56----------
when you could ask me to explain how I


---------29:58----------
felt okay and it do you ever buy me that


---------30:03----------
it seemed like there were so many other


---------30:06----------
people that also felt the same way


---------30:08----------
within both the community and in the


---------30:10----------
workplace and yet at the same time there


---------30:13----------
were other people within the workplace


---------30:14----------
that seemingly just turned a blind eye


---------30:16----------
to that okay and then you want one of


---------30:22----------
the goals Alice I'm I'm gonna interrupt


---------30:24----------
you


---------30:25----------
yeah okay so I'm gonna try to make a


---------30:27----------
couple of points okay so


---------30:31----------
so the picture that you painted is that


---------30:34----------
you're kind of under attack you feel


---------30:35----------
like things are unfair unjust you also


---------30:38----------
talked about like the the difficulty of


---------30:40----------
defense right that it's like really easy


---------30:43----------
to attack but it's like really hard to


---------30:46----------
defend against because because you've


---------30:49----------
made your point very clearly time and


---------30:51----------
time and time again but anyone the on


---------30:53----------
the Internet can like creatively edit


---------30:56----------
things and make you look like a dumbass


---------30:59----------
yes right and that's what it sounds like


---------31:02----------
he did it sounds like it was unfair like


---------31:04----------
he made you look like a dumbass like he


---------31:05----------
didn't he didn't frame the argument


---------31:07----------
correctly he didn't do he just didn't do


---------31:09----------
any up and then your concern so and this


---------31:12----------
is what I think I'm still not quite sure


---------31:13----------
that I was able to convey what my


---------31:16----------
question was but then your suffering is


---------31:18----------
kind of like twofold one is that you


---------31:21----------
feel attacked one is kind of internal


---------31:24----------
and because you were attacked and the


---------31:27----------
other is that like you're suffering


---------31:29----------
seems very very closely tied to your


---------31:32----------
perception about how you're about your


---------31:39----------
perception in the external world and


---------31:41----------
then you also talked about like it was


---------31:42----------
very frustrating that you couldn't


---------31:44----------
respond right away like it was ten hours


---------31:46----------
yeah the video had been up for ten hours


---------31:49----------
and like it had been like it's like a


---------31:51----------
you know building that's been on fire


---------31:52----------
for ten hours and now you guys yeah


---------31:54----------
right that's that that's the connect


---------31:57----------
what you count 10 like 10 out like who


---------32:00----------
counts 10 hours like less than a day


---------32:03----------
right but it's it's not less than a day


---------32:06----------
to like if it's been up for like less


---------32:07----------
than a day and you saw it like that


---------32:09----------
doesn't seem like that big of a deal to


---------32:10----------
me but to you 10 hours like 6 hours and


---------32:13----------
10 hours and 14 hours feel significant


---------32:15----------
because of the way that you're framing


---------32:16----------
the problem and in turn feels


---------32:19----------
significant to you because like if you


---------32:20----------
could have responded by hour to hour 4


---------32:22----------
and no wonder you sleep with your cell


---------32:24----------
phone under your pillow and like like I


---------32:27----------
got a check it like I actually I was


---------32:29----------
woken up by constant calls saying you


---------32:32----------
need to get you need to get to read it


---------32:34----------
you need to get to read it you need to


---------32:35----------
get through at it


---------32:36----------
so messages so now now we think okay so


---------32:41----------
now now we're getting it right okay so


---------32:43----------
now the question is how much of your


---------32:45----------
suffering comes from within you and how


---------32:48----------
much of it comes from the outside world


---------32:50----------
I don't know how to answer that even in


---------32:58----------
like a number of percentage yeah I think


---------32:59----------
that it varies depending on topics I


---------33:01----------
come I understand it's a hard question


---------33:04----------
to answer right so here's here's what I


---------33:06----------
think is going on so I think you're


---------33:09----------
trying to control things out there and


---------33:12----------
if you try to control things out there


---------33:14----------
that's the way that you feel better


---------33:16----------
within yourself because you're telling


---------33:18----------
me that when you get the win something


---------33:20----------
like this negative happens it's like a


---------33:22----------
tsunami that hits you and then your


---------33:25----------
psychology goes like like when someone


---------33:27----------
one negative event which by the way


---------33:29----------
doesn't actually sound that negative


---------33:31----------
because it sounds like you're well


---------33:32----------
respected by the community and people


---------33:34----------
are coming to your defense all over the


---------33:35----------
place that they can see this guy for


---------33:37----------
what he is and that you actually are


---------33:40----------
respected but that doesn't seem to


---------33:42----------
matter that comes in we've been talking


---------33:44----------
to now we've been talking about it's not


---------33:47----------
yeah no I said I don't know that


---------33:51----------
sentence didn't sit with me it's not the


---------33:53----------
guy for what he is it's just the video


---------33:55----------
okay fine yeah but my point is that that


---------33:59----------
for the first 35 minutes of our


---------34:00----------
conversation it's you've you've talked


---------34:03----------
about this in the perspective impact it


---------34:06----------
has on you and yet when we actually ask


---------34:09----------
you about the impact it seems like on


---------34:10----------
the contrary you have a lot of reasons


---------34:12----------
to feel positive because not only like


---------34:15----------
do you not have to defend yourself


---------34:16----------
people are doing it for you right but


---------34:21----------
it's weird that like that's not that's


---------34:23----------
not the sect you didn't say by the way


---------34:25----------
there's been this controversy this guy


---------34:26----------
kind of attacked me on the video and a


---------34:28----------
lot of people came to my defense the


---------34:30----------
sentence of they came to my defense is


---------34:32----------
like uncovered like late into the


---------34:34----------
conversation and part of that maybe just


---------34:36----------
you're providing a lot of context in


---------34:38----------
detail which I asked you for so we just


---------34:40----------
naturally got to it like over time


---------34:42----------
possible but I don't I don't think


---------34:45----------
that's the case


---------34:46----------
I think that that anyway so let's just


---------34:50----------
take a step back so then when this when


---------34:51----------
this thing happens like there's a


---------34:53----------
tsunami that hits your psychology and


---------34:55----------
then then as you put it you start to


---------34:58----------
think about whether this is a waste of


---------34:59----------
time should you be doing this makes you


---------35:01----------
question your life your life goes to a


---------35:02----------
dark place but while there's a tsunami


---------35:06----------
because this guy posted this video and


---------35:08----------
it makes you question your integrity or


---------35:11----------
integrity but when you're afraid that


---------35:13----------
your integrity is under attack that


---------35:17----------
you're almost it's almost like you're


---------35:19----------
paranoid that people are like you can't


---------35:21----------
be reassured that like people know you


---------35:23----------
for who you are you're paranoid that


---------35:26----------
this attack is gonna change the way that


---------35:28----------
people think about you because I can't


---------35:34----------
manage the hmm I I know about the


---------35:40----------
differences between views versus


---------35:43----------
comments versus what can't you manage


---------35:50----------
you were about to say I can't manage and


---------35:53----------
then you you cut yourself off oh I I


---------35:56----------
can't manage the people who don't read


---------36:00----------
the comments and just watch the video


---------36:02----------
yeah and I don't know what that number


---------36:04----------
is and and how does it feel to not be


---------36:07----------
able to manage that it [ __ ] feels


---------36:10----------
like holy [ __ ] just Jesus Christ


---------36:13----------
apparently this is possible what is it


---------36:16----------
that's possible anyone can just say


---------36:20----------
anything yep and I know I know I know


---------36:22----------
that that is obviously a thing but it


---------36:24----------
it's terrifying


---------36:26----------
right they you can you can work in this


---------36:28----------
industry for so long you can do such


---------36:31----------
thoughtful and detailed analysis you can


---------36:34----------
try to elevate the strategy of the


---------36:35----------
league community because strategy is a


---------36:37----------
beautiful thing and you're attracted to


---------36:39----------
it like a work of art and this [ __ ]


---------36:41----------
can just make a video I don't like I


---------36:46----------
don't like labels like that I know you


---------36:48----------
don't like labels like that this goes


---------36:49----------
back to like you need to start getting


---------36:50----------
angry at people besides yourself this


---------36:53----------
remember that right but it may be may be


---------36:56----------
so how is this


---------36:58----------
not an [ __ ] because I don't know what


---------37:01----------
the actual intention is of the sure you


---------37:04----------
do I'm not him I have an idea


---------37:07----------
but the idea can be wrong so until I


---------37:11----------
actually talk with him which actually I


---------37:13----------
have a DM from him I just haven't opened


---------37:15----------
it for two days because I'm trying to


---------37:16----------
manage my trust dude let me explain


---------37:18----------
something to you when someone puts your


---------37:20----------
face on the front of a video about


---------37:23----------
analysis and then takes all of your


---------37:25----------
analysis out of context and doesn't do


---------37:28----------
it complete I believe that is a personal


---------37:31----------
attack masquerading as analysis as you


---------37:33----------
put it I think that's a fair assessment


---------37:35----------
happens all the time on the Internet


---------37:39----------
right and I think when someone attacks


---------37:41----------
you I don't think it's out of line to


---------37:43----------
call them an [ __ ] in that situation


---------37:46----------
because it does sound like they're being


---------37:47----------
unfair so there's a lot going on here


---------37:51----------
Alice the first is that I'm still not


---------37:55----------
sure like how you understand who you are


---------37:58----------
versus what the outside world is and


---------38:01----------
where the origin of suffering is like I


---------38:05----------
think you're suffering so let me just be


---------38:06----------
very clear okay so I'm gonna just speak


---------38:08----------
now instead of trying to ask you like


---------38:10----------
questions that could be leading so I


---------38:13----------
want everyone at home to listen to this


---------38:14----------
- suffering comes from within suffering


---------38:19----------
doesn't come from the external world and


---------38:21----------
the reason that suffering comes from


---------38:23----------
within is those who try to control the


---------38:25----------
external world are the ones that suffer


---------38:27----------
on the inside so earlier I was asking


---------38:31----------
twitch chat how much of your suffering


---------38:34----------
comes from the external world and they


---------38:35----------
said between like eighty and a hundred


---------38:36----------
percent and there are a hundred percent


---------38:38----------
right the crazy thing there though is


---------38:40----------
that even though they're like a hundred


---------38:42----------
percent right they're kind of wrong in a


---------38:43----------
weird way there's another step to it


---------38:45----------
which is that you trying to control the


---------38:47----------
external world and you trying to control


---------38:50----------
people's opinions of you you trying to


---------38:52----------
control how many people like you're


---------38:55----------
tearing yourself apart because people


---------38:57----------
are watching the video and not reading


---------38:59----------
the comments and that is like that's


---------39:02----------
tearing you apart and just think about


---------39:05----------
that for a second you can't control that


---------39:07----------
absolutely right and yet we tear


---------39:10----------
ourselves apart all


---------39:12----------
time for things that are completely out


---------39:14----------
of our control and in fact the only way


---------39:16----------
you can tear yourself apart is to


---------39:18----------
control that which you cannot control so


---------39:24----------
like if you want to let go of all of


---------39:25----------
this stuff you gotta let go of all of it


---------39:29----------
right you got to understand that the


---------39:31----------
most that you can do is present your


---------39:33----------
analysis people you can't force people


---------39:35----------
to read YouTube comments and the crazy


---------39:37----------
thing LS is that that is a strategy that


---------39:40----------
is actually gonna work and we have


---------39:42----------
evidence that it works because newsflash


---------39:45----------
you're actually a professional within


---------39:47----------
the League of Legends community news


---------39:49----------
flash when someone makes an attack video


---------39:51----------
like this people rise to your defense


---------39:54----------
how did you get them to do that did you


---------39:58----------
control that I've always you know you


---------40:02----------
know the quote by Regan about like the


---------40:05----------
light and the heat you know what I'm


---------40:07----------
talking about no you're like I think


---------40:14----------
this is actually like not a problem


---------40:15----------
maybe but it's what I'm thinking of when


---------40:17----------
you're saying that I can't control this


---------40:19----------
stuff right but I think that I've lived


---------40:22----------
by especially in like mice like I don't


---------40:25----------
know survival survival instincts or


---------40:27----------
within this community especially if you


---------40:30----------
you know the the quote I think it's my


---------40:33----------
Reagan if you can't make someone see the


---------40:35----------
light you make them feel the heat you


---------40:39----------
know of the light obviously if they


---------40:40----------
choose to turn a blind eye you and I


---------40:44----------
actually feel like that that's how I got


---------40:46----------
where I am now is nice yeah make make


---------40:50----------
sense to me it's weird to me to hear


---------40:53----------
stop trying to up the heat you know yes


---------40:57----------
that's why I'm telling you because I


---------40:59----------
think I think your strategist so you


---------41:01----------
guys have to understand this okay this


---------41:03----------
is really important your strategy is not


---------41:05----------
dumb it is it is good but it also leads


---------41:09----------
to suffering all right because this is


---------41:12----------
the thing Ellis just think about this


---------41:14----------
man you are trying your personal


---------41:16----------
well-being is tied to your perception of


---------41:21----------
other people's perception of you yeah


---------41:26----------
do you see that yes if you okay right so


---------41:31----------
like and you're not alone this way right


---------41:33----------
this is how we're all wired that


---------41:36----------
everyone at home your sense of


---------41:39----------
well-being is tied to what you believe


---------41:41----------
other people think about you let's take


---------41:44----------
a guy with social anxiety who's like in


---------41:46----------
a group full of people he's tortured


---------41:49----------
because he thinks that they think that


---------41:54----------
he's not like a decent person and that


---------41:57----------
he's dumb and he looks stupid I do that


---------41:58----------
it was too thick cooking yes let just


---------42:02----------
think about that you're fighting the


---------42:03----------
shadow of a shadow like that's not a


---------42:06----------
game you can win man you are trying to


---------42:09----------
convince people it like you're you're


---------42:12----------
trying to convince someone who's


---------42:14----------
fictitious didn't you know LS actually


---------42:17----------
originally stood forth what last shadow


---------42:22----------
yeah dr. kay I gotta I gotta tell you


---------42:29----------
you know you're talking about suffering


---------42:31----------
and suffering leads to anger and you


---------42:34----------
know like anger leads to hate hate leads


---------42:37----------
to the dark side I think you're actually


---------42:39----------
a Sith okay yeah absolutely so I'll tell


---------42:46----------
you something okay so in my second year


---------42:49----------
in my second year of residency there was


---------42:52----------
one person who recognized I'm a Seth


---------42:54----------
okay so what am I so at the end of one


---------42:58----------
of my rotations I meet with the


---------42:59----------
psychiatrist who I've been working with


---------43:01----------
for three years I mean sorry three


---------43:03----------
months and so I meet with the


---------43:05----------
psychiatrist she's like it I mean she's


---------43:07----------
like older so she's been doing it for a


---------43:09----------
while she's probably in her like late


---------43:10----------
50s or early 60s or something like that


---------43:12----------
she's really good psychiatrist brilliant


---------43:14----------
right so and so usually when we so I


---------43:18----------
meet her for by post


---------43:20----------
you know rotation feedback so I've been


---------43:22----------
working in this hospital under her


---------43:24----------
supervision for three months and usually


---------43:26----------
like you know they like they'll tell you


---------43:28----------
things like you know you need to be


---------43:30----------
better at writing your notes like your


---------43:32----------
diagnosis is really good you're really


---------43:33----------
good at connecting with patients they


---------43:35----------
give you feedback about your performance


---------43:36----------
as a doctor right which is like doctor


---------43:38----------
Lee thinks


---------43:39----------
like how good at your are you a


---------43:40----------
diagnosis how good are you a treatment


---------43:42----------
how good are you at like you know


---------43:43----------
talking to families so her feedback for


---------43:46----------
me is I see you please use your power


---------43:50----------
for good and not evil that was her


---------43:54----------
feedback freak she didn't talk to me


---------43:56----------
about my notes didn't talk to me about


---------43:57----------
like my knowledge of medications or


---------43:59----------
anything like that


---------44:00----------
she's like use your power for good and


---------44:02----------
not evil and I was like okay I will do


---------44:06----------
that and so that that was that was


---------44:09----------
really where a healthy gamer was born


---------44:10----------
because I realized so like I don't know


---------44:12----------
if people realize this but you know I'm


---------44:14----------
good with people I'm good at


---------44:15----------
understanding people and you can also


---------44:16----------
like you could you know if you


---------44:18----------
understand people you can help them or


---------44:20----------
you can destroy them you could do both


---------44:21----------
yes yes justice every once in a while I


---------44:24----------
get upset with someone's happened


---------44:25----------
recently and [ __ ] terrified the [ __ ]


---------44:29----------
out of them by saying very little


---------44:31----------
because they pissed me off and they did


---------44:33----------
something that was bad and just I scared


---------44:37----------
myself that day because yeah but you're


---------44:39----------
you're right I'm a sip there you go do


---------44:42----------
you really feel like I was because I am


---------44:43----------
a sip like my whole point no I was I was


---------44:47----------
making I was just because you're telling


---------44:49----------
me to get angry right and you know


---------44:51----------
walking down that path well so here's


---------44:55----------
here's what I truly believe ls is that


---------44:57----------
there isn't like the the real way to


---------44:58----------
find peace is that we try too hard to be


---------45:01----------
Jedi's and we ignore our set and I think


---------45:04----------
that you shouldn't do either one to the


---------45:07----------
extreme but like I think I think that


---------45:10----------
you're really in some weird messed-up


---------45:11----------
place when some guys like you you


---------45:14----------
describe his video is a personal attack


---------45:19----------
masquerading as analysis and you're not


---------45:21----------
willing to call the guy an [ __ ]


---------45:23----------
because people can do [ __ ] as things


---------45:26----------
but it doesn't make them an [ __ ]


---------45:28----------
is that an [ __ ] ish thing yes okay


---------45:32----------
fine so so I agree with and fine he's


---------45:36----------
being an [ __ ] but I don't think he is


---------45:38----------
an ass okay okay we can [ __ ] being an


---------45:40----------
[ __ ] I can live with yeah yeah okay


---------45:43----------
that's that I can live with okay so I'm


---------45:45----------
glad we cleared that up anyway


---------45:46----------
that's how I felt you know so going back


---------45:49----------
to this thing so but like do you get


---------45:51----------
that you're like what's causing you


---------45:52----------
suffering


---------45:53----------
is like the idea of like the internet


---------45:56----------
listening to these people and like


---------45:58----------
accepting their arguments right like


---------46:01----------
that's what's actually like getting you


---------46:03----------
bent out of shape I think I'm an [ __ ]


---------46:06----------
too actually a lot we're all [ __ ]


---------46:10----------
yeah I know I think I I think I tend to


---------46:14----------
be an [ __ ] a lot unintentionally out


---------46:17----------
of frustration I think so too


---------46:20----------
yeah and I that's the stuff that I start


---------46:23----------
to feel bad about and it eats eats away


---------46:26----------
at me because I don't want to react in


---------46:30----------
some of the ways that I do okay good so


---------46:35----------
so I think sometimes we behave like


---------46:37----------
[ __ ] I think what makes you a true


---------46:39----------
[ __ ] is whether you're comfortable


---------46:41----------
with behaving like an [ __ ] right so


---------46:45----------
the fact that you want to change in my


---------46:47----------
mind puts you into the non-asshole camp


---------46:49----------
the fact that you're reflective and you


---------46:51----------
try to make your self into like a better


---------46:53----------
person that other people can like makes


---------46:55----------
me feel good about you now I'm gonna try


---------46:58----------
to go back to my earlier point if that's


---------47:00----------
okay yeah so I think this still goes


---------47:03----------
back to like you're trying to control


---------47:05----------
the perceptions of like people around


---------47:07----------
you and your inability to do that is


---------47:09----------
causing you an immense amount of


---------47:10----------
suffering the interesting thing is that


---------47:13----------
that they do think positively of you


---------47:15----------
like I don't think you can make it this


---------47:16----------
far if you're like a super toxic person


---------47:18----------
right like unless you actually I think


---------47:21----------
the the the strength of your and maybe


---------47:23----------
that's wrong the strength do you guys


---------47:27----------
see his eyes don't watch his eyes right


---------47:35----------
okay right so like we don't even need


---------47:37----------
the face we just need the eyes okay okay


---------47:42----------
but listen tell us look so going back to


---------47:47----------
this I want you to understand that that


---------47:49----------
your suffering is actually like


---------47:51----------
controlled by how much how attached you


---------47:55----------
are to the opinions of people in the


---------47:57----------
external world


---------47:59----------
yeah and and like for everyone that you


---------48:02----------
know I use all kinds of examples my


---------48:03----------
favorite one is like getting a girl to


---------48:05----------
fall in love with you because a lot of a


---------48:07----------
lot of our community right so I won't


---------48:09----------
even call them gamers like sometimes


---------48:11----------
they'll have romantic feelings about


---------48:13----------
someone and that's a relatively like not


---------48:16----------
a very common it it's not a very common


---------48:21----------
experience so people think they can get


---------48:23----------
over invested in relationships when they


---------48:25----------
feel like romantically interested in


---------48:27----------
someone and that at the end of the day


---------48:29----------
they just cause themselves like endless


---------48:31----------
amounts of suffering because they're


---------48:32----------
trying to control the feelings of that


---------48:35----------
person which you just can't do right and


---------48:41----------
the odd thing is that that if you really


---------48:43----------
look at it like you're saying there are


---------48:44----------
some people that your work that are kind


---------48:46----------
of like you know they're they're kind of


---------48:48----------
talking about you or there may be


---------48:49----------
thinking certain things like fine I mean


---------48:52----------
I wonder how much of that is cognitive


---------48:55----------
bias I wonder what they're actually


---------48:56----------
saying how you're being perceived but I


---------48:58----------
think at the end of the day like you


---------49:00----------
know what you've really got to focus on


---------49:02----------
like if you want to be free of this you


---------49:05----------
have to realize that first of all like


---------49:07----------
you're fighting it like you're trying to


---------49:08----------
make someone happy who's like a figment


---------49:10----------
of your imagination and actually like


---------49:14----------
your salvation and in that I see this is


---------49:17----------
because like as long as you focus on


---------49:18----------
presenting good analysis the people who


---------49:21----------
are interested in good analysis are


---------49:23----------
gonna listen and take note the people


---------49:27----------
who are not or you know you're not gonna


---------49:28----------
win them over because you're just


---------49:29----------
speaking a language that they don't


---------49:31----------
understand like they understand their


---------49:33----------
own like biases and perceptions which is


---------49:35----------
that any amount of analysis that you can


---------49:37----------
do is going to be trumped by the


---------49:41----------
champion in the last game that stopped


---------49:43----------
them you can present as much analysis as


---------49:45----------
you want to but if there was someone


---------49:47----------
that stomped them in the last game


---------49:48----------
[ __ ] Smurfs this stuff is Opie like


---------49:51----------
if I lose to it it's Opie I don't care


---------49:53----------
what you analyzed like this guy was


---------49:55----------
ridiculous it was twenty one two three


---------49:57----------
like this is so broken


---------49:59----------
has nothing to do with skill there's got


---------50:01----------
to be a smurf and it's ope like riots


---------50:04----------
dumb why don't they nerf this stuff


---------50:06----------
right like those guys exist they're us


---------50:10----------
there's a little part of us at all of


---------50:12----------
them right yeah yeah and you can't win


---------50:15----------
those people over they're gonna watch


---------50:16----------
videos like this they're gonna be like


---------50:18----------
yeah that items dumb mm-hmm and yet you


---------50:23----------
try what you got to do LSE's let go like


---------50:29----------
you've got to understand you can't


---------50:30----------
control what they think about you you


---------50:32----------
can't control what they say at work I


---------50:34----------
know you think you can you can only


---------50:36----------
conduct yourself in a particular manner


---------50:38----------
and hope that it works out can you try


---------50:40----------
to influence them absolutely but you


---------50:43----------
can't control it and whether that video


---------50:46----------
has been up for 10 hours or 12 hours or


---------50:48----------
24 hours or four hours people if you've


---------50:50----------
done a good job of analyzing stuff and


---------50:53----------
you've garnered respect through your


---------50:55----------
effort and like strong analysis people


---------50:57----------
will rise to your defense at four hours


---------50:59----------
10 hours 24 hours or 48 hours you can't


---------51:06----------
defend yourself from all of those


---------51:07----------
attacks you can't dismantle every straw


---------51:09----------
I mean you don't need to because you


---------51:12----------
have twitch at looking out for you like


---------51:14----------
literally that's how it works I see it


---------51:15----------
myself people criticize me on the


---------51:17----------
internet all the time do you remember


---------51:20----------
our first conversation I think I'd give


---------51:23----------
you that there's times where I get


---------51:25----------
uncomfortable if I'm falsely defended do


---------51:27----------
you know what I mean


---------51:28----------
yeah but how do you know if it's falsely


---------51:30----------
defended if I see my twitch chat or mic


---------51:34----------
community or followers or something if I


---------51:36----------
see them attacking someone I actually


---------51:38----------
get pretty pissed


---------51:39----------
and then also if I see them blindly


---------51:40----------
defending me and accurately or failing


---------51:44----------
to actually convey something that I said


---------51:46----------
or actually argued do to their own


---------51:48----------
ability to not do their LS what and excu


---------51:52----------
the arbiter of truth I don't I don't


---------51:56----------
know it just it feels about them yeah


---------51:58----------
but like it's not your place to say


---------52:00----------
whether someone is like like


---------52:02----------
inaccurately defending you right


---------52:05----------
may disagree with them but your you're


---------52:06----------
not the arbiter of truth about whether


---------52:08----------
they're like right and you're wrong or


---------52:10----------
the vice versa this is exactly what I'm


---------52:14----------
saying you've got to accept right things


---------52:15----------
are not black and white people are gonna


---------52:17----------
do what they're gonna do you can be


---------52:19----------
comfortable with it or you can be


---------52:20----------
uncomfortable with it but you can't


---------52:21----------
control it it's all the same thing I


---------52:23----------
agree with you I'm glad you brought it


---------52:24----------
up because it's another example you you


---------52:27----------
get upset because you're controlling


---------52:28----------
them or you want them to defend you in


---------52:30----------
the way that you want no no I want them


---------52:33----------
to not blindly defend me how do you know


---------52:37----------
it's blind no I mean if I read that it's


---------52:42----------
blind do you know what I mean exactly so


---------52:44----------
but just think about that for a second


---------52:46----------
that means that you're doing some of the


---------52:48----------
reading which means that they're defense


---------52:49----------
of you may be actually not blind


---------52:51----------
you have to be careful about the own


---------52:53----------
judgments that your mind places on


---------52:55----------
things right so take a step back and


---------52:59----------
understand that like like like just ah


---------53:02----------
this is just this is so hard to


---------53:04----------
understand is this making sense okay oh


---------53:07----------
good you guys are understanding I see


---------53:08----------
five minutes no no you're not making me


---------53:11----------
stress I I think that this is like huge


---------53:13----------
I'm excited okay and you can't see my


---------53:16----------
face so you can't see that I'm excited


---------53:18----------
but I was actually using okay stream to


---------53:21----------
look at that so whatever I turn this way


---------53:23----------
I'm looking at okay good okay yeah so


---------53:25----------
kind of going back to this no I think


---------53:28----------
this is really important to understand


---------53:29----------
right so we we live our lives as if like


---------53:32----------
we know the truth like that's how our


---------53:34----------
mind operates our mind operates under


---------53:37----------
the assumption that it's opinions are


---------53:39----------
truth and we just got to understand this


---------53:42----------
because this is like this the only way


---------53:43----------
we could survive you know like wait when


---------53:46----------
I get up and I walk into the bathroom


---------53:48----------
like my mind assumes that there is a


---------53:51----------
toilet there my mind assumes that it's


---------53:53----------
gonna flush you know when I use the


---------53:55----------
bathroom you're like our mind assumes


---------53:57----------
that it's correct all the time because


---------53:59----------
like 99% of the time it is there are all


---------54:01----------
kinds of cognitive tasks that our mind


---------54:03----------
is doing that we're not even aware of


---------54:04----------
yes yes like when you walk into our room


---------54:07----------
you immediately go for the light switch


---------54:09----------
exactly right so our mind makes all


---------54:11----------
kinds of assumptions and it operates as


---------54:14----------
if it's correct 100% of the time because


---------54:16----------
otherwise like you know can you imagine


---------54:17----------
how much anxiety you would live in


---------54:19----------
like you didn't realize that like if you


---------54:21----------
thought that every toilet may form a


---------54:22----------
clog every single time you went to the


---------54:24----------
bathroom it'd be torturous yeah


---------54:26----------
and yet our mind is just think about


---------54:31----------
this for a second our mind is not true


---------54:34----------
our mind is dumb our mind is fallible


---------54:38----------
when you have someone who has anxiety


---------54:39----------
and thinks that everyone thinks that


---------54:42----------
they're like everyone perceives them as


---------54:44----------
idiotic they treat that as real that's


---------54:48----------
the only reason that anxiety is is so


---------54:50----------
bad is because you treat your thoughts


---------54:52----------
as facts but you guys have to understand


---------54:57----------
everyone you need to understand that


---------54:58----------
your thoughts do you need to pee by the


---------54:59----------
way no okay but you treat your thoughts


---------55:08----------
as if they're facts you say like I don't


---------55:09----------
like them wrongly defending you or


---------55:11----------
blindly defending you who are you to say


---------55:13----------
that their defense is blind yeah so take


---------55:19----------
a step back and understand that at the


---------55:21----------
end of the day Alice people love you man


---------55:24----------
but do you get that I I know that you've


---------55:30----------
asked me this a few times now but I you


---------55:35----------
know you know that you know the the


---------55:36----------
stupid quote you know if you if you


---------55:38----------
don't like you don't like yourself other


---------55:42----------
people can't like you you know okay well


---------55:45----------
I'm talking about no good if you don't


---------55:47----------
love yourself someone else can't love


---------55:49----------
you alright okay it's not the quote I


---------55:51----------
don't know it so okay so I mean I


---------55:58----------
I mean I I don't like I mean hmm I don't


---------56:07----------
know how to describe this I don't like


---------56:09----------
myself at all I like the idea of what I


---------56:13----------
can do in the sense that I like seeing


---------56:20----------
growth or something erected that I can


---------56:26----------
help create because I think I've already


---------56:29----------
failed okay I've failed to see it myself


---------56:34----------
but I don't know how to describe this


---------56:39----------
you're doing a great job so what are you


---------56:45----------
LS


---------56:53----------
I think that there is a lot of things


---------56:57----------
that surround my persona


---------57:00----------
that will prohibit me from achieving


---------57:03----------
what I would want to achieve in the end


---------57:06----------
but I can have it live on through other


---------57:09----------
things and when I say live on I don't


---------57:12----------
mean my life I mean okay work within the


---------57:15----------
industry I am with you I believe that


---------57:18----------
you believe that for time asking you is


---------57:20----------
what are you I'm not asking you about


---------57:22----------
what your limitations are I'm not asking


---------57:25----------
you about how you're gonna fail at your


---------57:27----------
goals I'm asking you what are you I


---------57:34----------
don't know what that means actually I'm


---------57:36----------
sorry okay now we're getting somewhere


---------57:40----------
so how do you know what a person is


---------57:47----------
based on behavior or things that they do


---------57:53----------
things they say okay patterns they do


---------57:55----------
some casillas what color clothes they


---------57:58----------
choose to wear okay what kind of clothes


---------58:01----------
they shoes to wear okay so I'm hearing


---------58:03----------
choices and actions


---------58:05----------
yeah alright I think axons over a


---------58:08----------
prolonged period of time are infinitely


---------58:10----------
more honest than any words a person can


---------58:13----------
say I completely agree with you so I'm


---------58:15----------
gonna go back to something that you said


---------58:16----------
earlier that I forgot exactly what you


---------58:21----------
said but you said you don't like who the


---------58:23----------
person you are but you do like what you


---------58:25----------
think you can do that you think you're


---------58:28----------
capable of action but that you don't


---------58:31----------
think you're like deep down you're like


---------58:33----------
a good or decent or adequate person I


---------58:35----------
don't know exactly what that means like


---------58:37----------
this is your words you said like yeah


---------58:39----------
yeah I I like the idea that I can I can


---------58:46----------
try to help people within the community


---------58:49----------
like eventually this is longer term


---------58:53----------
right setting up more networks or like


---------58:56----------
Academy is there something just suddenly


---------58:57----------
on fire eSports continues so Ellis let's


---------59:00----------
just think about this for a second so


---------59:01----------
when I asked you like how do you


---------59:02----------
understand what a person is you set


---------59:04----------
actions and choices and when I and


---------59:07----------
your your complaint with yourself is


---------59:09----------
that you view there's an LS that is


---------59:11----------
independent of your actions because


---------59:13----------
you're actually okay with your actions


---------59:15----------
you're just not okay with who LS s yes


---------59:23----------
there may be nuances and and we can dig


---------59:27----------
into it right because you're an analyst


---------59:30----------
which means that nothing is simple and


---------59:32----------
we have to understand stats and costs


---------59:34----------
and stuff like that there a lot of


---------59:35----------
nuances I'm with you but at the core of


---------59:38----------
it this is I think your basic problem is


---------59:40----------
that you have to understand that as a


---------59:41----------
human being what you are is made up of


---------59:44----------
your actions the only thing that you can


---------59:47----------
hold yourself responsible for is your


---------59:49----------
actions it's not your fault what how


---------59:54----------
tall you are it's not under your control


---------59:56----------
how intelligent you are it's not under


---------59:58----------
your control what your circumstances are


---------60:00----------
whether you grew up rich whether you


---------60:02----------
grew up poor whether you get coronavirus


---------60:04----------
you don't correct and get coronavirus


---------60:06----------
the only thing that you can control and


---------60:08----------
the only thing that you should hold


---------60:09----------
yourself responsible for are your


---------60:11----------
actions and if we rewind this video


---------60:14----------
you're gonna be squirrely now but you're


---------60:16----------
actually happy with some of your actions


---------60:18----------
you said I don't like the person that I


---------60:21----------
am but I like what I can do that is what


---------60:24----------
you are there's no difference between


---------60:26----------
those two things


---------60:27----------
what you are is defined by what you do


---------60:29----------
that's what makes a person the problem


---------60:33----------
is that our society has allowed us to


---------60:35----------
forget this because we're judged by so


---------60:40----------
many things that we are not I think when


---------60:46----------
I say that I don't like Who I am what I


---------60:49----------
mean by that is that while I do strive


---------60:52----------
to still do like a lot of things and


---------60:55----------
whatnot I don't like the


---------60:58----------
shortsightedness that I have sometimes


---------61:00----------
and like errors are stuff that I make


---------61:02----------
and in terms of like I regret how I


---------61:05----------
conduct myself sometimes and also are


---------61:09----------
you familiar with the Japanese saying


---------61:11----------
that everyone has four masks


---------61:13----------
sort of I thought it was three um Eric


---------61:16----------
but it it might be maybe it's check I'm


---------61:19----------
thinking about a Chinese saying for


---------61:21----------
three masks okay maybe you're right I'm


---------61:24----------
wrong on the number but you have the one


---------61:26----------
mask that passerby or see right doesn't


---------61:30----------
really show anything then you have the


---------61:31----------
one mask the public sees like people


---------61:33----------
that you interact with but they're not


---------61:34----------
like close to you then you have the


---------61:36----------
third mask which is your closest friends


---------61:39----------
and family and then you have the fourth


---------61:41----------
mask which only you yourself really


---------61:44----------
knows what that is


---------61:45----------
hmm but no one else ever sees


---------61:49----------
I am very ashamed of my third and fourth


---------61:57----------
masks and so when I say that I don't


---------61:59----------
like myself I I'm referring to my third


---------62:03----------
and fourth whereas I think what you're


---------62:05----------
looking at is views of the first second


---------62:08----------
and tidbits of the third okay so now


---------62:12----------
we're getting somewhere


---------62:12----------
so now LS would tell me tell me what are


---------62:16----------
the actions that you've taken that give


---------62:20----------
you the impression that the the deepest


---------62:22----------
part of LS is not likable or is not good


---------62:26----------
what I mean is like sometimes I'm


---------62:29----------
crippled by the the fear and anxiety and


---------62:31----------
emotions right and I feel like that's


---------62:34----------
weak not weak in the sense of how people


---------62:37----------
think like weak and strong I mean that


---------62:39----------
it's not ideal you know I should be a


---------62:43----------
lot better if I wasn't like this it


---------62:45----------
would be a lot better if I could just be


---------62:47----------
deaf whose whose fault is that I mean I


---------62:52----------
blame my own my I mean I I blame myself


---------62:56----------
you know I mean I don't know if it's a


---------62:57----------
chemical imbalance or just my own


---------62:59----------
thoughts or you know okay so that's


---------63:01----------
asked to a chat twitch at is this is


---------63:04----------
fault


---------63:06----------
to suffer from fear and anxiety okay


---------63:10----------
right so so now I'm gonna ask twitch


---------63:12----------
chat again so now for so think about


---------63:15----------
yourself for a moment and do you guys


---------63:20----------
blame yourselves for your weaknesses


---------63:27----------
right so this is the problem that you


---------63:30----------
can see it in someone else and you can


---------63:32----------
see how foolish it is but you don't see


---------63:34----------
it within yourself this is the challenge


---------63:38----------
so LSI think this still comes back this


---------63:41----------
comes back to forgiveness man I think


---------63:45----------
you need to learn how to forgive


---------63:46----------
yourself and that's a tall order then I


---------63:51----------
have no clue where to even start and I


---------63:54----------
yeah there's like an existential life


---------64:00----------
crisis type thing that I think is woven


---------64:03----------
into that that's very unhealthy and I


---------64:04----------
don't know how to unweave that what do


---------64:07----------
you mean where I'm very I I'm very


---------64:12----------
grateful and aware of where I am right


---------64:15----------
now like in my career mm-hmm but I'm


---------64:18----------
very


---------64:20----------
bitter and angry it took as long as it


---------64:24----------
did to get here but also that a lot of


---------64:28----------
years from my adolescence feel stolen


---------64:30----------
from me and it gives me this like really


---------64:34----------
weird sense of self where I never got to


---------64:37----------
actually live certain parts of my life


---------64:39----------
and now that I can it's like I don't


---------64:42----------
want to yeah and it just feels [ __ ]


---------64:47----------
weird


---------64:48----------
yeah man I think what you're saying


---------64:54----------
makes a lot of sense I'm trying to think


---------64:56----------
about how to share something with you


---------64:59----------
that'll get you just on the first step


---------65:03----------
how can I actually help


---------65:14----------
so tell us I'm trying to steer away from


---------65:17----------
philosophy but let me ask you something


---------65:19----------
what would be harder for you to live


---------65:21----------
with if things if it was no one's fault


---------65:26----------
or if it was your fault


---------65:35----------
in regards to what anything just in


---------65:39----------
general yeah like let's say like your


---------65:41----------
your years of like you know what you


---------65:45----------
missed out on an adolescence would it be


---------65:48----------
harder for you to live with the idea


---------65:50----------
that like that's your fault or that that


---------65:52----------
it's no one's fault and it just sucks in


---------65:54----------
his random no one's fault is harder


---------66:02----------
right yeah yeah so I think that's what


---------66:06----------
you've got to work on so I think blaming


---------66:09----------
yourself is a way for you to protect


---------66:12----------
yourself from just the sheer unfairness


---------66:16----------
of what life has to give and and we we


---------66:22----------
seek order to comfort ourselves and one


---------66:25----------
of the quickest things that we can


---------66:27----------
always blame is ourselves so we get


---------66:28----------
really really good at it


---------66:30----------
it's really hard to acknowledge that


---------66:33----------
something bad happened to me and there


---------66:36----------
was nothing that anyone could do right


---------66:41----------
that you couldn't like it's just


---------66:43----------
inconceivable yeah to think that like


---------66:46----------
you could like you just you there's must


---------66:48----------
have been something you can do because


---------66:50----------
it's it's it's impossible to live in a


---------66:52----------
world where random bad [ __ ] happens to


---------66:55----------
you like you can't function if you walk


---------66:57----------
outside and you think that you can get


---------66:59----------
hit by a meteor it's just you can't


---------67:01----------
function in that world right I want to


---------67:03----------
believe that there's always something


---------67:05----------
that could have been done yeah yeah and


---------67:09----------
and that's just not true


---------67:11----------
like you get that objectively


---------67:17----------
interestingly enough no I becomes the


---------67:21----------
neighbor I know I know I know that that


---------67:23----------
I thought about that's actually a lot ok


---------67:25----------
ok so now we have a different meditation


---------67:28----------
technique for you ok LS so listen let me


---------67:32----------
before we transition to meditation


---------67:33----------
I think we've what do you think about


---------67:36----------
today today was I think the most


---------67:41----------
most stressful just because I think it's


---------67:45----------
also hot and recent like what happened


---------67:48----------
with him last 48 hours


---------67:49----------
uh-huh and so I think revisiting a lot


---------67:52----------
of things but also like just before this


---------67:56----------
call I was telling someone I live with


---------67:59----------
that I'm feeling a lot of the like


---------68:03----------
symptoms of my like emotional implosion


---------68:08----------
coming like the thing that I come yep


---------68:11----------
and that scares me because every single


---------68:14----------
time it happens I try to realize all the


---------68:17----------
flags and I try to you know tell myself


---------68:20----------
okay I think this is what's going on and


---------68:23----------
trying to manage this and trying to do


---------68:24----------
that trying to you know men control


---------68:27----------
control control control control of


---------68:30----------
myself yeah right sucks and and that's


---------68:34----------
hard so I I don't know I don't know how


---------68:37----------
we go about teaching you that control is


---------68:40----------
what control is the origin of suffering


---------68:42----------
and surrender is the origin of peace and


---------68:48----------
and and so I think we're gonna have to


---------68:50----------
teach you that I think it's gonna take


---------68:52----------
more time that we have today but I think


---------68:54----------
I do have a meditation practice that I


---------68:56----------
think will help you and does that okay


---------69:05----------
I'm just trying to get a sense of


---------69:07----------
whether twitch chat is followed what I'm


---------69:09----------
saying I think they are okay so let's


---------69:12----------
let's go to so okay so just one or two


---------69:19----------
messages to twitch chat okay so you guys


---------69:22----------
like y'all can see it in LS right so


---------69:24----------
first of all us I want to thank you for


---------69:25----------
coming on I know that we've hit some


---------69:27----------
things that we kind of disagree about


---------69:30----------
which is perfectly fine I'm I'm glad


---------69:31----------
you're telling me what resonates with


---------69:33----------
you and what doesn't I think that's


---------69:34----------
something that you know I'd like to


---------69:35----------
continue I'd like to have the


---------69:37----------
opportunity to continue to work on with


---------69:39----------
you it doesn't mean that I'm right you


---------69:41----------
could be right and the thing is I don't


---------69:42----------
think that you're wrong I think your


---------69:44----------
view is just incomplete and that there's


---------69:48----------
a there's a there's a thing yeah so


---------69:51----------
because I think all of your strengths


---------69:52----------
your strategies are actually correct all


---------69:55----------
the things that you believe are correct


---------69:57----------
there's just more to it right it's kind


---------69:59----------
of like it's not like Jedi or Sith like


---------70:02----------
the forth the forces about the balance


---------70:05----------
of the two things and I think your basic


---------70:07----------
problem right now is that you've just


---------70:09----------
gone too far down like you're a Jedi or


---------70:11----------
a Sith but what you really need to be is


---------70:13----------
both and so huh they're they're called


---------70:18----------
gray Jedi in the comics okay yeah you


---------70:21----------
need to be a gray jacket right yeah and


---------70:24----------
and so so the gray Jedi don't aren't


---------70:27----------
final with their view of like really


---------70:29----------
anything does that make sense and like


---------70:30----------
the only your only problem is that your


---------70:32----------
final with your view of things like


---------70:34----------
there's some things that are set in


---------70:35----------
stone for you and we need to like wiggle


---------70:38----------
that out a little bit so the other thing


---------70:40----------
is if you do a meditation practice and


---------70:42----------
it doesn't work for you don't keep doing


---------70:43----------
it that's for you and everyone at home


---------70:45----------
as well if it worsens your anxiety just


---------70:47----------
stop don't force yourself okay so part


---------70:50----------
of the thing about meditation practices


---------70:51----------
that they're supposed to help you attain


---------70:53----------
a no mind state which is like peaceful


---------70:56----------
and if the meditation technique is


---------70:59----------
agitating you then try a different


---------71:00----------
meditation technique there are 112


---------71:03----------
meditation techniques one of which


---------71:05----------
should be quite natural for every person


---------71:08----------
to it attain a no mind state so it


---------71:10----------
shouldn't be hard and if you try to do


---------71:12----------
one of these other techniques that


---------71:13----------
doesn't work for you just don't worry


---------71:14----------
about so I think what we need to teach


---------71:17----------
you is techniques around isness okay so


---------71:23----------
there isn't good there isn't bad there


---------71:25----------
is just what is okay okay so so close


---------71:29----------
your eyes so these are gonna be a little


---------71:30----------
bit I think you're also an analytical


---------71:32----------
guy so I'm gonna give you something more


---------71:33----------
of a contemplative technique it's not


---------71:36----------
asking you to do something it is asking


---------71:39----------
you to like figure something out


---------71:41----------
does that make sense so like two bit


---------71:43----------
major kind of camps of meditation


---------71:45----------
techniques they're a contemplative


---------71:46----------
techniques and there are like doing


---------71:50----------
techniques so if someone says focus on


---------71:52----------
your breath or to change your breath


---------71:53----------
through three then four seven breathe


---------71:54----------
out four seven watch the moon you know


---------71:57----------
smell something eat something mindfully


---------71:59----------
all those are doing techniques I'm not


---------72:01----------
gonna ask you to do that so I want you


---------72:02----------
to close your eyes and tell me what you


---------72:04----------
feel physically


---------72:07----------
we're gonna get so you guys should do


---------72:09----------
this to chat so close your eyes and just


---------72:11----------
notice what you feel tell me what you


---------72:13----------
feel feel my heartbeat in my hands I


---------72:24----------
feel differences maybe the air okay now


---------72:31----------
when I mentioned meditation you changed


---------72:32----------
your posture do you remember that


---------72:35----------
yeah can you go back to your old posture


---------72:40----------
this one yeah


---------72:42----------
very good yeah sure now close your eyes


---------72:46----------
yeah tell me what you feel in difference


---------72:50----------
in posture


---------72:57----------
uncomfortable in what way I feel like I


---------73:05----------
want to be moving okay like right now


---------73:08----------
I'm consciously making my limbs still


---------73:12----------
okay so okay good so let yourself move


---------73:16----------
don't hold your limb still now I don't


---------73:21----------
want all right now I don't want to what


---------73:25----------
it's really weird it's like it's like an


---------73:29----------
itch that let it happen now I'm like


---------73:34----------
locked I let go of the control let your


---------73:45----------
body move yeah I know I know I I just I


---------73:47----------
I don't think I'm in control right now I


---------73:49----------
think it's like happening on it


---------73:59----------
do you have the sensation of wanting to


---------74:02----------
move your limbs not a physical sensation


---------74:08----------
okay if that's what you mean it just it


---------74:14----------
feels like I want to move okay I don't


---------74:19----------
want to move I don't know how to


---------74:21----------
describe this okay is it like n uh-huh I


---------74:25----------
don't want to move okay


---------74:28----------
mentally I'm squirming okay so let


---------74:33----------
yourself so sit up the sit back straight


---------74:35----------
let's see what happens to your mental


---------74:37----------
squirming alright what happens close


---------74:40----------
your eyes mental squirming what's


---------74:42----------
happening okay okay


---------74:51----------
so just sit with the way that you feel


---------74:52----------
right now so any desire to physically


---------74:55----------
move no any desire to mentally squirm


---------75:09----------
okay one of the things that you might


---------75:15----------
always wear okay I do a lot of things


---------75:20----------
that try to make myself comfortable to


---------75:23----------
manage stress okay and whenever I'm


---------75:26----------
uncomfortable via physically or mentally


---------75:28----------
all I have to do is find a spot where I


---------75:30----------
feel comfortable and then it all just


---------75:32----------
releases very briefly and but it only


---------75:35----------
lasts us for a while okay so so now you


---------75:40----------
feel comfortable yeah so


---------75:51----------
so I want you to just this is gonna


---------75:54----------
sound kind of weird so I think what you


---------75:56----------
described as comfortable is actually not


---------75:58----------
good or bad it is does that make sense


---------76:05----------
yeah right so there's there's just a


---------76:09----------
certain like you're in like comfortable


---------76:12----------
for you is not necessarily good it's not


---------76:14----------
relaxing yeah exactly this so it is


---------76:17----------
isness


---------76:19----------
there is isness it's not good it's not


---------76:21----------
bad it's the gray Jedi it's not it's not


---------76:24----------
the Jedi it's not the Sith it's the


---------76:26----------
middle that's what is 'no siz it is not


---------76:29----------
but you don't you don't attach a value


---------76:31----------
judgment of good or bad it just is right


---------76:35----------
yeah you with me does that make sense go


---------76:38----------
back to leaning on your chair like other


---------76:41----------
position eyes closed what do you feel


---------76:53----------
good good to let them move mentally they


---------77:01----------
want to move physically they don't okay


---------77:03----------
so I'm not gonna force them to move try


---------77:06----------
forcing them move do it what what


---------77:11----------
happens when you force them to move the


---------77:17----------
left one well I have muscle I have like


---------77:19----------
you know well of course you know delayed


---------77:22----------
like onset muscle soreness in my left


---------77:23----------
one so that one just feels really heavy


---------77:25----------
but okay


---------77:28----------
now I'm just in the rhythm so it doesn't


---------77:31----------
feel like anything anymore okay so let


---------77:33----------
it happen now how do you feel


---------77:35----------
mental squirm eNOS no physical squirm


---------77:41----------
eNOS no okay now let your leg relax does


---------77:48----------
it feel like you have to control it to


---------77:50----------
do so or can you let it relax yeah it's


---------77:54----------
empty nothing okay okay now go back to


---------78:04----------
sitting up straight right so now try to


---------78:11----------
find your isness can you find it if you


---------78:25----------
don't know what I'm talking about just


---------78:26----------
let me know tried to find try to find


---------78:32----------
your neutrality so try to just are you


---------78:34----------
comfortable


---------78:36----------
no okay good right so now what's


---------78:40----------
uncomfortable okay good so what does


---------78:45----------
your left leg wanna do okay good so let


---------78:50----------
it stretch yeah okay and what happens to


---------78:54----------
your internal sense of so just let it


---------78:56----------
let it do what it wants to and sit with


---------78:59----------
whatever it wants to do oh and then as


---------79:03----------
are you done stretching no okay


---------79:06----------
so then just hold the stretch like


---------79:08----------
you're like stretching it out aren't


---------79:10----------
like your surest to get on something


---------79:11----------
okay good so I want you to focus fully


---------79:14----------
on the sensation of stretch


---------79:18----------
yeah the stretching feels very good


---------79:20----------
right so just sit with that and when it


---------79:26----------
is done are you trying to control it no


---------79:33----------
really good no you're not trying to


---------79:39----------
control you're letting it be yep you're


---------79:43----------
noticing it and you're letting it do


---------79:45----------
what it wants to right is there any


---------79:49----------
blame are you doing a good job


---------79:54----------
I guess I'm nothing are you doing a bad


---------80:00----------
job no yeah


---------80:06----------
do you even know what a bad job would


---------80:07----------
look like


---------80:10----------
um probably increased pain or something


---------80:14----------
okay I don't know yeah so just sit with


---------80:20----------
what you sense okay all right so now go


---------80:27----------
ahead and and sit we're gonna sit that


---------80:30----------
way for about 60 more seconds and I want


---------80:32----------
you to just sit with the sensations in


---------80:33----------
your body if your body calls to you to


---------80:36----------
do something I want you to let yourself


---------80:39----------
do it


---------81:04----------
okay now let yourself come back yeah


---------81:11----------
open your eyes what was that like for


---------81:14----------
you very end I started hearing the home


---------81:20----------
of


---------81:22----------
uh-huh


---------81:25----------
and that noise actually suits me so I


---------81:29----------
just because I just wasn't trying to


---------81:32----------
think about anything I guess I only


---------81:34----------
heard that and then that noise suits me


---------81:38----------
yeah what were you doing before you


---------81:40----------
heard the hum I was focusing on things


---------81:46----------
that didn't pertain to my work or career


---------81:49----------
or like what I mean the body sensations


---------81:54----------
okay right yeah so you remember earlier


---------81:58----------
we might yes go ahead sorry it felt like


---------82:02----------
I I tricked my body to forget yeah but


---------82:11----------
you didn't trick your body so we'll get


---------82:14----------
to that in a second okay


---------82:15----------
I think I understand I understand that


---------82:19----------
you think it's a trick it's not a trick


---------82:21----------
what you're doing day to day is the


---------82:24----------
trick that's the problem


---------82:26----------
the-the-the anyway we'll get to that


---------82:29----------
insight okay so first of all you


---------82:32----------
remember that moment where where you


---------82:34----------
felt like you were controlling your leg


---------82:35----------
and you were forcing yourself to stay


---------82:37----------
still and then I said go ahead and let


---------82:41----------
go and and move your leg and then what


---------82:44----------
happened to the sensation of wanting to


---------82:46----------
move your leg there was two different


---------82:52----------
parts one mentally wanted to move and


---------82:54----------
one yeah right so Alice I think


---------82:59----------
is what you need to do now what this is


---------83:01----------
I'm not exactly sure like I don't know


---------83:03----------
how to package this for you but like I'm


---------83:08----------
really curious this chat have any idea


---------83:11----------
like what that was like do you guys get


---------83:13----------
how this applies to what Ellis is


---------83:15----------
problem is I'm getting yeses and noes


---------83:23----------
okay so it's my fault for trying I got


---------83:26----------
to think about how to explain this so LS


---------83:30----------
what I want you to learn how to do is


---------83:31----------
essentially sit with what is okay


---------83:35----------
because I think you're gonna discover


---------83:37----------
something very strange which is that as


---------83:39----------
you try to control it requires effort


---------83:41----------
and you also create for yourself


---------83:43----------
suffering and that when you do you talk


---------83:47----------
about yourself in terms of like being a


---------83:48----------
failure or like you messed this or did


---------83:50----------
that these are all judgments you're


---------83:52----------
you're taking your experience and you're


---------83:55----------
attaching a label of like good or bad or


---------83:58----------
insufficient or like you know you're


---------84:00----------
attaching something to it it's not just


---------84:02----------
what it is it's like you something


---------84:05----------
you're adding on like your mind adds on


---------84:07----------
that LS could be doing better


---------84:10----------
like there's what you do but there's


---------84:12----------
what you do which is what you do like


---------84:13----------
that's just that's just what is right


---------84:15----------
like we're talking now you can't do any


---------84:17----------
more or less than talk afterwards you


---------84:19----------
can go back in your mind can tell you oh


---------84:21----------
like you should have done a better job


---------84:23----------
your mind attaches judgments to all


---------84:26----------
kinds of things and I think that


---------84:29----------
judgments and control like your mind


---------84:31----------
also tries to control things because if


---------84:32----------
you think about like rating yourself as


---------84:35----------
insufficient if you say oh I did a bad


---------84:36----------
job it's gonna try to control the


---------84:38----------
interaction next time does that make


---------84:40----------
sense judgment and control are


---------84:43----------
intertwined as long as you're judging


---------84:45----------
you're gonna try to control and as long


---------84:47----------
as you're controlling you're trying to


---------84:49----------
make it you're gonna make a judgement


---------84:50----------
because if you want something to change


---------84:52----------
you have to judge it for where it is you


---------84:56----------
have to say okay this is where it is


---------84:58----------
this is not where I want it to be I'm


---------84:59----------
gonna move this person from not loving


---------85:02----------
me to loving me and in order for you to


---------85:05----------
want to control them and make them fall


---------85:07----------
in love with you you have to make a


---------85:09----------
judgment about the fact that they don't


---------85:11----------
love you and that's not a


---------85:12----------
and you love that so judgment did


---------85:15----------
controller intertwined what you need to


---------85:17----------
do is sit you need your mind it needs to


---------85:20----------
practice being with what is and not with


---------85:23----------
what should be and not with what could


---------85:25----------
be or not what with what could have been


---------85:28----------
or should have been or what you would


---------85:31----------
would have liked and done should order


---------85:33----------
cut us none of them sit with what is and


---------85:36----------
if you want to move let yourself move


---------85:39----------
and you're gonna discover a couple of


---------85:41----------
weird things as you as you start the


---------85:44----------
process of surrender you're gonna


---------85:46----------
discover like weird things like oh


---------85:48----------
actually physically I don't want to move


---------85:49----------
but mentally I do like what does that


---------85:51----------
even mean how does that work how much of


---------85:54----------
your life is being driven by mental


---------85:57----------
squirming what even is that if you can


---------85:59----------
overcome that how would your life change


---------86:01----------
I'm not sure but this is what you must


---------86:03----------
explore so literally my meditation


---------86:06----------
practice for you is like the best way I


---------86:08----------
can come about like I don't even just


---------86:10----------
making this up okay I want you to sit in


---------86:13----------
five different postures every day with


---------86:16----------
your eyes closed and notice what your


---------86:17----------
body feels


---------86:20----------
pick five postures and as the sensations


---------86:23----------
arise in those postures it can be


---------86:25----------
leaning one way leaning the other way


---------86:28----------
one leg crossed over the other cross leg


---------86:31----------
sitting up straight laying down whatever


---------86:34----------
you pick five postures notice what's


---------86:37----------
happening with your body and just notice


---------86:39----------
what is and then if you have a desire to


---------86:41----------
do something if your body is saying okay


---------86:43----------
I want to shift this way notice it make


---------86:46----------
the shift and then reflect on what's


---------86:48----------
changed


---------86:51----------
got it yeah okay thoughts or questions


---------86:57----------
before we wrap up for the day how was


---------87:06----------
this was this helpful


---------87:08----------
the it's okay okay the last segment that


---------87:12----------
we just talked about with like the


---------87:15----------
isness is something that I consciously


---------87:20----------
realized actually a couple of days ago


---------87:22----------
one of my housemates his name's max


---------87:27----------
something happened with one of the


---------87:29----------
monitor cables for it broke and I


---------87:31----------
started freaking out because I thought


---------87:33----------
that it would affect my upcoming stream


---------87:35----------
and I was starting to get really


---------87:36----------
stressed and anxious and then he just


---------87:39----------
reminded me like LS nothing happened


---------87:42----------
$3 the cable is you know in the store


---------87:46----------
below the apartment you know what I mean


---------87:48----------
like I was I I don't know my mind was


---------87:51----------
just going a million places but I was


---------87:54----------
brought back just to the cable broke


---------87:58----------
it's fine go down to the you know the


---------88:01----------
store and get a new one and so nothing


---------88:04----------
happened like beautiful I was lost


---------88:06----------
yeah I didn't I told him later after I


---------88:10----------
calmed down that that really helped and


---------88:13----------
that was one of the first times that I


---------88:17----------
think someone around me in close


---------88:18----------
proximity in a very long time has even


---------88:22----------
tried something like that and I was sort


---------88:24----------
of like shell-shocked at how quickly it


---------88:27----------
helped me come down from my stress I'm


---------88:32----------
really happy that that max was able to


---------88:35----------
do that for you and I'm lucky I feel


---------88:37----------
happy that you have someone like that


---------88:39----------
yeah and I also want you to notice the


---------88:42----------
words that used if your mind is going a


---------88:44----------
million places


---------88:46----------
it cannot be where is where it is right


---------88:50----------
right so train yourself through


---------88:55----------
meditation to teach your mind how to be


---------88:58----------
with what is and if you train it and it


---------89:01----------
starts to become familiar with


---------89:03----------
what is it's like learning how to


---------89:04----------
dribble a basketball like meditation you


---------89:07----------
need to train your mind to become


---------89:08----------
automatic it going to what is and that


---------89:10----------
has to be done intentionally first and


---------89:13----------
then if you find your mind going into


---------89:16----------
what will be or going a million great


---------89:19----------
places try to tell it to come back to


---------89:21----------
what is but that has to be trained


---------89:24----------
hopefully through this technique yeah


---------89:28----------
okay yeah all right man


---------89:31----------
strong work today thanks a lot take care


---------89:36----------
of man I wish you all the best


---------89:38----------
yeah you too have a good day
