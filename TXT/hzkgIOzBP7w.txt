---------00:00----------
I'm smiling because I think you're an


---------00:02----------
absolute failure and I think that that's


---------00:04----------
perfectly okay I think that I was a


---------00:09----------
failure too


---------00:10----------
and failure is not the end of the road


---------00:13----------
it's the beginning right so now you can


---------00:18----------
really start to live your life because


---------00:20----------
you can you've you have you have burned


---------00:23----------
down potential you've burned down the


---------00:26----------
idea of I will always been able to do


---------00:28----------
things faster than everyone else


---------00:30----------
all of that expectation and potential


---------00:33----------
you're actually free of it it's a burden


---------00:36----------
and every every ounce of projected


---------00:40----------
failure that ounce of projected failure


---------00:43----------
comes from an ounce of expectation do


---------00:46----------
you see that like you can't fail if you


---------00:47----------
don't expect


---------00:53----------
what am i calling you friend Zack Zack


---------00:57----------
and so apologies first of all Zack for


---------01:00----------
our setback on Monday I had locate I'd


---------01:05----------
gone to a slightly different location


---------01:07----------
that had poor internet so now I've


---------01:10----------
decided to move back to my underground


---------01:13----------
bunker but yes I I I'm really I'm sorry


---------01:17----------
about that I hope that was kind of okay


---------01:19----------
for you but yeah that was fine actually


---------01:22----------
kind of worked out well I got some other


---------01:24----------
stuff that happened at that time so cool


---------01:25----------
well neat so tell me a little bit Zack


---------01:28----------
gum you know help me understand a little


---------01:30----------
bit about why you're coming on today and


---------01:32----------
how we can be helpful yeah so right now


---------01:38----------
and actually the last like three and a


---------01:41----------
half months or so I've been unemployed


---------01:43----------
and living in my parents basements and


---------01:47----------
making almost no progress in getting out


---------01:49----------
of that because I spend pretty much


---------01:51----------
every waking hour of the day playing


---------01:53----------
video games and watching anime and stuff


---------01:55----------
video games and anime yes


---------01:58----------
folksy video games okay um browsing


---------02:03----------
reddit usual the Holy Trinity yeah


---------02:09----------
reddit anime Trinity of not getting


---------02:14----------
anyway yeah yeah so like obviously I'm


---------02:18----------
in this best situation and things I I


---------02:23----------
mean not even a year ago like six months


---------02:26----------
ago was in grad school working towards


---------02:28----------
getting my PhD oh wow yeah and then I


---------02:33----------
had a whole bunch of stressful stuff


---------02:35----------
that happened over a couple months in


---------02:37----------
there that slowly leads to me dropping


---------02:39----------
out and yeah now I have no idea where to


---------02:43----------
go with my life and I'm kind of stuck


---------02:45----------
here can you tell us a little bit about


---------02:48----------
the stressful stuff it's a bit of story


---------02:52----------
because it was a series of things so for


---------02:58----------
the first year or so of my PhD I had


---------03:01----------
made very little progress in my research


---------03:04----------
oh are you getting a PhD


---------03:09----------
near the neuroscience branch of


---------03:13----------
biomedical engineering okay I was at the


---------03:16----------
University of Utah


---------03:19----------
so I was I went there and started


---------03:22----------
working for this professor he was new


---------03:24----------
and had some projects and one of them


---------03:27----------
interested me so I was working with him


---------03:29----------
and after about a year I didn't really


---------03:31----------
make any progress which was kind of to


---------03:34----------
be expected because it was chemistry


---------03:36----------
related and chemistry sometimes you just


---------03:38----------
nothing works the way you expect it to


---------03:41----------
and you don't know why because you can't


---------03:43----------
see the things that you're interacting


---------03:44----------
with but I didn't really get anywhere in


---------03:47----------
a year and so he was kind of upset I was


---------03:52----------
upset that nothing was happening we


---------03:54----------
weren't getting anywhere so I had some


---------03:58----------
stress that was building up because of


---------03:59----------
that because things weren't going along


---------04:00----------
as was expected and there's necessarily


---------04:03----------
conflicts between us but it was sort of


---------04:06----------
like passive aggressiveness um we just


---------04:10----------
didn't I was just sort of getting


---------04:11----------
overwhelmed well the stuff those happen


---------04:13----------
to do and then this was roughly like


---------04:17----------
August or September what are you having


---------04:19----------
to do just lots of work I guess was that


---------04:27----------
different from before kind of put this


---------04:36----------
having to do with classes and research


---------04:39----------
at the same time rather than just


---------04:41----------
classes was more than I was used to and


---------04:44----------
then also I would do what I thought was


---------04:47----------
an adequate amount of work for the day


---------04:49----------
like maybe six eight hours in the lab


---------04:53----------
and he was like you know so such isn't


---------04:56----------
done you need to be here more what I


---------05:00----------
didn't like the idea of spending what


---------05:03----------
would the head abs to be 10 12 plus


---------05:05----------
hours a day and weekends in order to get


---------05:07----------
all of them okay so when you say


---------05:11----------
overwhelmed


---------05:14----------
well we'll help me understand what we're


---------05:16----------
talking about a little bit more


---------05:18----------
precisely so one is that he's upset with


---------05:20----------
you one is you're not accomplishing what


---------05:24----------
his expectations are male-male p.i yes


---------05:29----------
okay he is principal investigator by the


---------05:32----------
way so you're so you were in someone's


---------05:35----------
lab and he was saying you need to be


---------05:36----------
here for like did he did he use those


---------05:38----------
numbers or no but is so the experiment I


---------05:43----------
was working on he wanted me to like each


---------05:47----------
such each of the tests I would do he


---------05:49----------
wanted me to do each test and like


---------05:50----------
roughly a day the test though takes


---------05:52----------
about 12 hours to do there's a breaking


---------05:54----------
point in the middle where I'm capable of


---------05:56----------
like pausing it okay not losing any


---------05:59----------
progress at about six to eight hours so


---------06:01----------
I was going up to that point and then


---------06:03----------
doing the other half the next day okay


---------06:05----------
he wants to do it like all at once go go


---------06:07----------
go okay one test today and so there was


---------06:09----------
a differential expectation set in terms


---------06:12----------
of what you wanted to do and what he


---------06:14----------
wanted you to do yeah okay so just about


---------06:18----------
like any other ph.d program yes you get


---------06:22----------
it like kind of to be expected


---------06:25----------
yes and so so I'm confused about so it


---------06:28----------
was overwhelming as you had classes on


---------06:30----------
top of that and you weren't doing


---------06:31----------
experiments but during the first half of


---------06:33----------
your first year or what um yeah so like


---------06:37----------
I was I mean obviously like in undergrad


---------06:40----------
it was just classes maybe I had like a


---------06:45----------
job on the side that I do a couple hours


---------06:46----------
every now and then but like I wasn't


---------06:48----------
really doing 12 hours back and I come in


---------06:51----------
and I knew like I was gonna have to put


---------06:53----------
in a lot of work but I didn't really


---------06:54----------
realize exactly what that meant


---------06:56----------
especially when I was applying to


---------06:58----------
schools and people from this school were


---------06:59----------
like yeah like all the professors here


---------07:01----------
really chill they don't make you work


---------07:03----------
weekends like other professors at other


---------07:04----------
schools it's like wow that sounds like


---------07:06----------
so fit for me because I don't really


---------07:08----------
like spending so many hours of my life


---------07:10----------
on my shirt so I went into this you know


---------07:15----------
expecting to do like some hard work but


---------07:17----------
I've through everything else I've done


---------07:20----------
and through all of undergrad and


---------07:21----------
everything I've always been able to get


---------07:23----------
things done faster than everyone else so


---------07:25----------
I was like I'll be able to do the same


---------07:26----------
thing


---------07:26----------
here and then yeah then when I sort of


---------07:31----------
sat down and realized I'm gonna have to


---------07:33----------
do all my classes I have to teach a lab


---------07:36----------
course because I have to do ta stuff and


---------07:39----------
then I have to do all this research in a


---------07:42----------
day I have to be talking to other


---------07:44----------
professors trying to get my committee


---------07:45----------
assembled and trying to communicate with


---------07:48----------
people from other areas and also have to


---------07:54----------
deal with all the stuff in my apartment


---------07:55----------
and paying for rent and everything like


---------07:57----------
that for which it was just a lot of


---------07:59----------
stuff and I'm so he's suspending more of


---------08:02----------
my time not doing this sure I want to


---------08:07----------
just highlight something that you said I


---------08:08----------
don't know exactly what the significance


---------08:09----------
of this is I've always been able to get


---------08:12----------
things done faster than everyone else


---------08:15----------
okay yeah I want to just note that and


---------08:20----------
okay so so then then what happened so it


---------08:23----------
sounds like you didn't want to spend 10


---------08:25----------
to 12 hours a day in the lab you had a


---------08:28----------
lot ya struggle in terms of life


---------08:30----------
responsibilities classes committee stuff


---------08:33----------
teaching it's a lot yeah yeah it was a


---------08:37----------
lot so I was to an extent like I mean I


---------08:41----------
would sort of did my 6-hour thing for


---------08:44----------
research and all my other stuff I was


---------08:46----------
like yeah you want me to do this stuff


---------08:47----------
but it's just not possible and so I just


---------08:49----------
read didn't do those things and I did


---------08:52----------
that and then after year we I didn't


---------08:54----------
make any progress so now there's what


---------08:56----------
does it not make any progress means um


---------08:59----------
so I guess I'll have to get a little bit


---------09:02----------
into the specifics for that I was trying


---------09:04----------
part of my research was to make these


---------09:07----------
special particles I guess you could say


---------09:10----------
and it was supposed to be just like a


---------09:14----------
replication of what someone else had


---------09:15----------
done and another paper and I actually


---------09:17----------
talked to her in person as well she


---------09:19----------
explained to me the process you were


---------09:20----------
just redoing it with a different set of


---------09:22----------
chemicals and in theory it should be


---------09:23----------
possible and pretty easy and we planned


---------09:25----------
on it only taking like a month to figure


---------09:27----------
it out it's 12 months in no matter how I


---------09:30----------
combined these things and we're buying


---------09:32----------
other stuff online and trying other


---------09:33----------
things nothing is working it so did you


---------09:35----------
duplicate exactly what she did with her


---------09:37----------
chemicals yes


---------09:39----------
okay and even tried freaking out okay


---------09:42----------
you know controlling for all of the


---------09:44----------
different variables and changing


---------09:45----------
everything which there was a bit of


---------09:48----------
conflict and he wanted things happened


---------09:50----------
fast so he was like just change these


---------09:51----------
five variables all at once if it doesn't


---------09:53----------
work then chop these other five


---------09:55----------
variables and I'm like we don't know if


---------09:57----------
these variables interact with each other


---------09:58----------
need to do them one at a time and so


---------10:01----------
there's a little bit of conflict they're


---------10:03----------
trying to get that settles and again no


---------10:05----------
matter what things I change eventually I


---------10:07----------
just have to give in and change five


---------10:08----------
variables at a time and sure enough it


---------10:10----------
doesn't work sure now we don't know why


---------10:12----------
which one was the faults of that and


---------10:15----------
yeah a year in I haven't made these


---------10:19----------
don't know why they don't work or what


---------10:22----------
variables are a factor sometimes I run


---------10:25----------
the same experiment twice and get


---------10:27----------
different results and it's just like I'm


---------10:31----------
completely in the dark no idea what's


---------10:34----------
going on yeah so yeah so that that


---------10:36----------
happens for like a year or so you know


---------10:40----------
you're not really getting anywhere and


---------10:42----------
still trying things out and then around


---------10:46----------
this time points there was someone


---------10:49----------
reminded me about I think it's an NIH


---------10:53----------
grant it's something that like all grad


---------10:55----------
students apply for and like their


---------10:56----------
freshman and sophomore year some like


---------10:58----------
big national grants or whatever okay and


---------11:01----------
I was like oh I had forgotten about that


---------11:03----------
and that's coming up soon and I need to


---------11:06----------
have part of my research done so that I


---------11:09----------
can have something to write about in


---------11:10----------
there and I also needs to go get people


---------11:14----------
from back and undergrad to write me


---------11:16----------
letters of recommendation and I don't


---------11:19----------
even know who to talk to at this point


---------11:20----------
for that I also have to figure out what


---------11:24----------
I'm gonna write about what the


---------11:25----------
recommendations are what the


---------11:26----------
requirements are and so now I have


---------11:28----------
another thing on my plate that I have to


---------11:30----------
worry about and that that built up some


---------11:36----------
stress and there is other stuff going on


---------11:38----------
part of it was you know I just ignore


---------11:40----------
that for a little while and then work on


---------11:42----------
the other things I had to do so of


---------11:46----------
course it just keeps blowing keeps


---------11:47----------
building cuz I'm procrastinating things


---------11:49----------
until sort of the first major breakpoint


---------11:54----------
was there was a meeting amongst grad


---------11:58----------
students for this great it was students


---------12:02----------
who had already gotten the grant


---------12:04----------
successfully we're teaching those who


---------12:06----------
hadn't how to write our papers so I went


---------12:08----------
to that meeting and sat down and they


---------12:14----------
started talking about how to write about


---------12:17----------
your achievements and other things that


---------12:19----------
you've done because that's one of the


---------12:20----------
important aspects of it and the


---------12:23----------
achievements that they listed out and


---------12:24----------
that everyone else in the room talked


---------12:26----------
about we're just so much greater than


---------12:29----------
anything that I had done at that point


---------12:32----------
that I immediately got impostor syndrome


---------12:35----------
what do you mean by impostor syndrome


---------12:38----------
like I felt like I had gotten there by


---------12:41----------
accident that I totally didn't belong I


---------12:44----------
had not achieved anything of great worth


---------12:46----------
compared to what these people have done


---------12:47----------
and that they were all aware of what


---------12:52----------
they were doing and knew how to do go


---------12:54----------
about their research and that I was


---------12:56----------
blowing him dark and that I hadn't been


---------12:57----------
made any progress because I didn't know


---------12:59----------
what I was doing and that I was


---------13:01----------
completely lost


---------13:01----------
okay and that it was a fluke that I had


---------13:04----------
ended up in this program because I was


---------13:07----------
big and stupid and didn't know what I


---------13:09----------
was gonna didn't know what to write


---------13:13----------
about and all that other stuff and yeah


---------13:15----------
I was I was really overwhelmed because


---------13:17----------
so many people I swear like one of them


---------13:19----------
like went to Africa and cured malaria


---------13:21----------
and a tribe or something like this is


---------13:23----------
wild stuff that they were doing mm-hmm


---------13:26----------
it was like what have I done with my


---------13:27----------
time I've gone home and spent my free


---------13:29----------
time playing video games like I've


---------13:31----------
always done I haven't achieved anything


---------13:33----------
like these people yeah see yeah that


---------13:37----------
that felt like at that moment and


---------13:39----------
just all the stress of everything


---------13:41----------
building up to that point and then this


---------13:43----------
corner core I guess you could say


---------13:44----------
moments of realization even though it's


---------13:46----------
not really reality in the sense I know


---------13:48----------
that it was a cause of syndrome but what


---------13:50----------
do you eat Irishman can you tell us


---------13:52----------
about some of those again like looking


---------13:57----------
at it from this perspective I mean now I


---------14:00----------
know that it was just my brain making


---------14:02----------
things up and saying what you know like


---------14:04----------
a moment of realizing that


---------14:06----------
I don't belong here I know now is


---------14:08----------
imposter syndrome but at the time when I


---------14:12----------
really stress out like that I'm thinking


---------14:14----------
I'm realizing that I don't belong here


---------14:17----------
I'm realizing that getting here I wasn't


---------14:20----------
this crazy smart person getting into


---------14:21----------
this program I actually don't belong


---------14:24----------
here


---------14:25----------
but you've always been able to do things


---------14:27----------
faster than everyone else yeah I know


---------14:31----------
right like it's it's this weird conflict


---------14:33----------
that goes on in my head but so yeah at


---------14:39----------
that moment I sort of I guess you could


---------14:42----------
say snaps and I packed up my stuff I


---------14:45----------
walked out of the meeting early I got on


---------14:47----------
the train I curled up in the ball on the


---------14:49----------
seat and then tried to forget everything


---------14:51----------
and pretend that it didn't happen which


---------14:54----------
didn't work but not in the slightest


---------14:58----------
and so then I kept feeling stressed out


---------15:03----------
and like at some point in there I want


---------15:06----------
to see a university therapist to try and


---------15:08----------
help me through these things good for


---------15:09----------
you and the next major breaking point


---------15:17----------
that I guess was sort of the peak and


---------15:19----------
caused the down spiral was when my pee I


---------15:23----------
said that I had to he came up to me we


---------15:27----------
had a lab meeting the next day he said


---------15:29----------
oh by the way the meeting that we had


---------15:32----------
tomorrow whoever was presenting isn't


---------15:33----------
gonna present it said you're going to


---------15:35----------
present your outline on this spring now


---------15:39----------
I had written anything this was like


---------15:41----------
four o'clock in the afternoon I had to


---------15:44----------
go to another lab across campus to do


---------15:46----------
more research that day and had a


---------15:47----------
homework assignment due that night so I


---------15:49----------
stayed up until like 3:00 a.m. working


---------15:51----------
on this presentation once I finally got


---------15:53----------
home and then I go in of course it's


---------15:56----------
crap because I'm super tired and I'd


---------15:59----------
haven't gotten any sleep and he just


---------16:02----------
beats the crap out of me in this


---------16:05----------
presentation about how bad everything is


---------16:07----------
what does he say and it was just I can't


---------16:12----------
even remember now this is like six


---------16:15----------
months ago but


---------16:18----------
it was it was like the the topics that I


---------16:24----------
was talking about weren't goods


---------16:27----------
I wasn't communicating the right points


---------16:30----------
I wasn't explaining it and I was


---------16:32----------
spinning in too much detail it wasn't


---------16:34----------
simple enough for like layman's terms


---------16:36----------
understands I was focusing on the wrong


---------16:40----------
points


---------16:41----------
I didn't again like for the achievements


---------16:45----------
that I've done that sort of a big


---------16:46----------
portion of this I didn't have anything


---------16:47----------
and I didn't know what to talk about


---------16:49----------
and also in my presentation he was even


---------16:53----------
nitpicking things like my graphs were


---------16:55----------
done in Excel and it's not Matt well


---------16:56----------
when they should be done in MATLAB


---------16:58----------
that's unacceptable and so I had sort of


---------17:03----------
in that looks to the other lab members


---------17:06----------
for like please for the love of God help


---------17:08----------
me and none of them did anything they


---------17:12----------
just agreed with him they're like yeah


---------17:14----------
you should work on those things I'm like


---------17:17----------
okay for support from someone else and


---------17:19----------
they left you out in the cold


---------17:21----------
yeah and so again like let's just had


---------17:27----------
been constantly building up for last


---------17:29----------
couple of months to this point and


---------17:30----------
there's already a breaking point


---------17:32----------
so it kept building from there and then


---------17:33----------
this happens so I went home that day and


---------17:37----------
I got off the train and I was walking


---------17:40----------
down the side what's in my house and I


---------17:46----------
know why this is so hard to say


---------17:55----------
I had looks I had stopped on the


---------17:58----------
sidewalk and turned towards the road and


---------17:59----------
considered walking into traffic


---------18:02----------
sure and yeah that was that was a moment


---------18:09----------
I didn't what


---------18:14----------
what are you feeling as you try to say


---------18:16----------
that I hit


---------18:22----------
oh no it's funny cuz like thinking about


---------18:27----------
okay how am I gonna tell the story I've


---------18:29----------
been through this exact moment several


---------18:32----------
times in my head I don't really feel


---------18:33----------
anything yep then that saying is


---------18:37----------
different


---------18:38----------
yep very very important observation so


---------18:43----------
what are you feeling as you say it are


---------18:45----------
you feeling something good are you


---------18:46----------
feeling something bad bad um are you


---------18:55----------
getting a piece of what it was like to


---------18:57----------
stand on that side walk a little bit


---------19:03----------
it's what I'm feeling is like the


---------19:07----------
reality of how severe it was good tell


---------19:13----------
us about that so


---------19:19----------
restating you know everything that I've


---------19:21----------
experienced again saying it feels like


---------19:27----------
it wasn't that big of a deal


---------19:29----------
like yes there was a lot of stress and


---------19:31----------
things but it's all like I'm listening


---------19:33----------
out like things that I guess you could


---------19:35----------
say normal grad students go through lots


---------19:36----------
of worker things had to do and I'm


---------19:38----------
thinking normal grad students this


---------19:40----------
wasn't anything extreme but then


---------19:43----------
thinking about that moment there it's


---------19:46----------
like no it was it was a lot worse is


---------19:49----------
that can you just pose us about your


---------19:51----------
reality in that moment that everything's


---------19:58----------
 beautifully put


---------20:02----------
what does that mean I was in a dark


---------20:10----------
place I wasn't what made it dark join


---------20:15----------
what I was doing my outlook on life and


---------20:25----------
the world was very negative in what way


---------20:30----------
was it negative I didn't really see much


---------20:35----------
of the positives of life and I viewed


---------20:37----------
everything I guess from like very


---------20:39----------
pessimistic viewpoint so to add in a


---------20:44----------
little bit to that a lot of the reddit


---------20:46----------
discussion that I was viewing around


---------20:47----------
this time was about corruption and stuff


---------20:50----------
in the world and so I was latching on to


---------20:53----------
that things like global warming whatnot


---------20:58----------
which all helps contribute to it and


---------21:00----------
then it was like I'm a victim of this I


---------21:06----------
had lots of views that academia and I


---------21:10----------
actually still kind of agree with these


---------21:11----------
the academia is very corrupt and isn't


---------21:17----------
what it's supposed to be it's supposed


---------21:18----------
to be about doing research to learn


---------21:21----------
about things that we don't understand


---------21:22----------
and instead it's about writing papers to


---------21:26----------
get money and a lot of papers are just


---------21:30----------
made-up crap


---------21:32----------
just so that they can get funded and it


---------21:35----------
was like I am in I went into this to do


---------21:39----------
something nice and great and it said I'm


---------21:41----------
here in this corrupt situation being


---------21:44----------
manipulated by the people above me who


---------21:47----------
are just in it to get money and


---------21:51----------
everything is boxing how does it feel to


---------21:55----------
be manipulated


---------21:57----------
how does it feel terrible part of the


---------22:00----------
meat that goes into the meat grinder


---------22:01----------
grinder that is a ph.d program feels


---------22:05----------
awful like oh my god how do people do


---------22:07----------
that how do people know it's it's like


---------22:15----------
super depressing


---------22:16----------
it's what's depressing about it tell me


---------22:23----------
the thoughts Zac what were the thoughts


---------22:25----------
that were going through your head


---------22:28----------
because it's not fair there we go


---------22:35----------
right cuz in your head you don't think


---------22:38----------
this is super depressing yeah what do


---------22:41----------
you think in your head stressed out I


---------22:47----------
what you think in your head overwhelmed


---------22:49----------
it's not what you think in your head


---------22:50----------
yeah I'm thinking that I put in a lot of


---------22:53----------
effort to get here I followed all the


---------22:55----------
rules


---------22:55----------
I followed the guidelines there we go


---------22:57----------
and what you followed the rules and what


---------23:02----------
and what happened I got this point word


---------23:09----------
the higher-ups are using minions they're


---------23:12----------
taking my labor they're paying me


---------23:16----------
nothing


---------23:17----------
they're expecting needs to do things


---------23:20----------
that I can't do good what else I


---------23:25----------
followed the rules and what I got but


---------23:31----------
yeah I'd say got let down as I


---------23:33----------
understand you got fuck-buddy yeah


---------23:39----------
you're taking my time did you feel alone


---------23:45----------
mm-hmm oh yeah I can only imagine right


---------23:51----------
so sitting there is your professor tears


---------23:53----------
you a new in your lab meeting


---------23:56----------
and then all of all of the other grad


---------24:00----------
students are kind of like right no one's


---------24:04----------
yeah and then you no one's protecting


---------24:06----------
you especially when the other lab


---------24:09----------
members are like making progress on


---------24:10----------
their stuff and I'm not and now it's


---------24:14----------
very isolating to feel like you're the


---------24:17----------
only one going through it because you


---------24:19----------
are right everyone else is sitting here


---------24:21----------
what are you doing yeah absolutely


---------24:23----------
nothing you're failing it's like being


---------24:27----------
in a classroom of kids who can read and


---------24:29----------
you can't yeah yeah


---------24:37----------
when we talk about feeling overwhelmed


---------24:40----------
what were you what were the thoughts


---------24:41----------
there stuff like again this is this is


---------24:50----------
too much I can't do this too many


---------24:53----------
expectations of me how can I fake it and


---------24:58----------
make it seem like I'm doing the work but


---------25:01----------
I'm not how do other people get through


---------25:06----------
it


---------25:07----------
okay can I I I think those are the I


---------25:12----------
think those make sense I'm gonna so I


---------25:14----------
can't do this


---------25:15----------
and how can I fake it I think there's


---------25:18----------
another kind of level to that which is


---------25:19----------
that how can I push off failure you


---------25:24----------
can't do this but I don't want to fail


---------25:26----------
quite yet is there anything I can do but


---------25:29----------
you know that the failure is coming you


---------25:31----------
feel if the failure is coming and is


---------25:33----------
there anything you can scrape together


---------25:34----------
to prevent going into bankruptcy like


---------25:37----------
today yeah can I push out this failure


---------25:40----------
and push out this failure and push out


---------25:42----------
this failure and each time you push out


---------25:44----------
the failure you try to buy yourself some


---------25:47----------
time to where maybe people won't notice


---------25:50----------
maybe you can pull it together maybe you


---------25:54----------
can fix it and the more time that goes


---------25:56----------
on the failure becomes more and more and


---------26:00----------
more certain and you push it out and you


---------26:03----------
push it out and you push it out and


---------26:04----------
you're faking it and you're faking it


---------26:07----------
and everyone's making progress and it's


---------26:08----------
becoming more and more inevitable


---------26:11----------
mmm-hmm is that how you felt yeah yeah


---------26:17----------
definitely how does that feel


---------26:18----------
[Music]


---------26:23----------
again like I just belong that I should


---------26:31----------
never have gone to grad school in the


---------26:33----------
first place and that it was a huge



---------26:34----------
do you sell it was the only offer you're


---------26:39----------
a huge


---------26:40----------
I guess both like there's there's a


---------26:46----------
perspective of I'm a huge cuz I


---------26:49----------
can't do this but also it was a huge


---------26:52----------
buck up decision to put myself in a


---------26:54----------
situation when I should have known that


---------26:55----------
I could've done this I should have known


---------27:00----------
like why did I think that I was so


---------27:03----------
capable I've always been able to get


---------27:07----------
things done faster than everyone else


---------27:09----------
yeah and yeah


---------27:19----------
that's a lot Zach yeah so tell us tell


---------27:24----------
us what so you're walking home you're


---------27:27----------
considering stepping into traffic


---------27:29----------
why didn't you I thought they would hurt


---------27:34----------
what did you decide to do then so it was


---------27:37----------
fear that kept you from stepping in


---------27:39----------
traffic traffic huh was mine it's hard


---------27:47----------
to explain if it was really fear is


---------27:49----------
again it was the thought that like this


---------27:51----------
will hurt I really like that yeah I'll


---------27:54----------
figure it out later


---------27:56----------
so what did you do enzyme I walked home


---------28:00----------
and I lied down a bit I cried and then


---------28:04----------
and I think I took a nap or something I


---------28:08----------
just like fell asleep then I woke up at


---------28:10----------
like 8 o'clock or something and then


---------28:13----------
made dinner plates of videogames what


---------28:16----------
did you play


---------28:17----------
I don't remember okay what are you


---------28:19----------
playing nowadays Prince Cape lots and


---------28:23----------
lots and lots of runescape okay and what


---------28:27----------
are your parents think right now I mean


---------28:32----------
I don't know exactly what their thoughts


---------28:35----------
are but my mom has like I say I think I


---------28:42----------
feel like she chides me and like bothers


---------28:44----------
me a lot when realistically it's like


---------28:46----------
maybe once every two weeks you'll say


---------28:48----------
hey have you been looking for jobs and


---------28:50----------
that's about it but he feels annoying to


---------28:53----------
me like yes duh


---------28:56----------
why is it why is it annoying it's


---------29:01----------
because it's like I'm in this situation


---------29:04----------
and you know I've been in this situation


---------29:07----------
because I was calling you while I was


---------29:09----------
going through it all you know that I


---------29:14----------
feel terrible and then I'm trying to put


---------29:17----------
a little effort at it can't I can into


---------29:19----------
it and you're still asking me about it


---------29:22----------
especially right now during the Kovac


---------29:26----------
thing it's like what jobs you want me to


---------29:30----------
get what is there you


---------29:31----------
got some that like you've you got one


---------29:33----------
I'll go find one long like sure lunch


---------29:37----------
you once you hand out to me it's so easy


---------29:39----------
to go get one why don't you tell me


---------29:40----------
where they are


---------29:41----------
I've applied for so many and they've all


---------29:43----------
rejected me and like it's not that easy


---------29:49----------
and I don't know if it's just my head


---------29:58----------
but I feel like they're disappointed I


---------30:03----------
know my my brother he has autism and so


---------30:10----------
we as a family have to take care of him


---------30:12----------
but sometimes because of his patterns


---------30:15----------
and things he will end up staying up and


---------30:17----------
super late and waking up at like 12


---------30:20----------
o'clock in the afternoon or something


---------30:21----------
which I mean I do too because I play


---------30:23----------
video games really late at night but my


---------30:26----------
parents will yell at him and be like why


---------30:28----------
are you staying up and so late why are


---------30:30----------
you getting up so like that's not good


---------30:31----------
for you and they never say it to me but


---------30:34----------
I could feel it directed it and you as


---------30:36----------
well what's it like for them to never


---------30:41----------
say it to you


---------30:47----------
it's good question


---------30:55----------
it's like passive-aggressiveness


---------30:57----------
innocence i guess it's not the right


---------31:00----------
wording but sure that's maybe describing


---------31:04----------
what it is it's not how you feel ya know


---------31:13----------
it just school can i offer something


---------31:20----------
yeah yeah there a part of you that's


---------31:22----------
like can you just call me a up and


---------31:24----------
be done with it


---------31:26----------
yeah can you just call me out on my


---------31:30----------
 instead of asking in a polite


---------31:33----------
motherly loving concern how the job


---------31:36----------
search is going can you just call me


---------31:38----------
once in your life and say why the


---------31:40----------
haven't you found a job yet what the


---------31:42----------
 is wrong with you mm-hmm


---------31:47----------
how would it feel if your mom said that


---------31:53----------
jeez the yes yep it would still


---------31:58----------
feel pretty


---------31:59----------
but anything even would also be I would


---------32:09----------
know what they're thinking very really


---------32:12----------
why don't you know what they're thinking


---------32:15----------
cuz they don't talk about it a whole lot


---------32:18----------
sure it's why don't they talk about it a


---------32:21----------
whole lot if I know probably cuz


---------32:26----------
it's hard but who is it hard for ya it's


---------32:30----------
hard for them to talk about it


---------32:31----------
cuz I mean I don't talk about these


---------32:33----------
things with them because it's hard for


---------32:34----------
me to talk about it so it's gotta be


---------32:36----------
hard for them to you right sure


---------32:38----------
do you think maybe the reason they don't


---------32:39----------
talk about it is because you don't talk


---------32:41----------
about it mean yeah so I want you to put


---------32:48----------
yourself in their shoes for a moment


---------32:49----------
Zach your son has been in a competitive


---------32:54----------
ph.d program essentially washes out you


---------32:59----------
see him sleeping till noon every day you


---------33:01----------
can tell he's struggling and so you put


---------33:04----------
on your kid gloves and you handle him


---------33:06----------
like the fragile piece of porcelain he


---------33:08----------
is right


---------33:15----------
they can see you're hurting they


---------33:18----------
probably don't want to bother you they


---------33:19----------
don't want to ask you hard questions


---------33:21----------
because they're afraid of how they're


---------33:26----------
gonna make you feel cuz they they love


---------33:27----------
you yes no yeah so what do you think


---------33:34----------
they're trying to do I mean how does


---------33:35----------
someone who loves you respond to a


---------33:40----------
situation where like yours I have no


---------33:46----------
idea how are they responding I mean


---------33:57----------
again just try not to mess with it too


---------34:01----------
much they're so trying to make sure that


---------34:03----------
I'm hopefully trying but they're also


---------34:10----------
not trying to interfere too much sure


---------34:13----------
they're trying to give you your space


---------34:16----------
hmm how hard do you think they think a


---------34:25----------
conversation about this will be for you


---------34:30----------
very I mean we had a conversation once


---------34:36----------
you told me about it while back and I


---------34:42----------
remember one this was exactly a couple


---------34:43----------
months ago but we went to there's a bar


---------34:46----------
nearby and we went there and I knew


---------34:50----------
going down like they're gonna try to


---------34:51----------
talk about it that's why they're calling


---------34:53----------
yeah and yeah they I mean I remember


---------34:57----------
whole lot cuz I'm a super lightweight


---------35:01----------
and so one single beer puts me out


---------35:02----------
pretty quickly but I do remember we


---------35:07----------
talked about that and how I was applying


---------35:10----------
for things what I was applying for what


---------35:15----------
I wanted to do better at school because


---------35:16----------
I haven't technically dropped out I'm


---------35:18----------
gonna leave of absence mm-hmm so do I


---------35:21----------
want to go back and I'm like not really


---------35:24----------
and then bringing up that they


---------35:27----------
eventually want to be empty


---------35:28----------
Esther's and so they want to try and


---------35:31----------
help me through this because they can't


---------35:33----------
keep me here forever


---------35:34----------
again like no how do you


---------35:43----------
feel about yourself sack yeah I felt


---------35:47----------
like a huge like how do you feel


---------35:51----------
I head off today like I've had so much


---------35:56----------
potential and I have drops down to this


---------35:59----------
huge love that that potential yeah


---------36:06----------
potential is a bad drug hate it


---------36:10----------
what are you hearing on it it's like


---------36:16----------
it's these high expectations that as


---------36:19----------
long as you meet them everyone praises


---------36:21----------
you but if you don't meet them it's just


---------36:24----------
like faces of scorn and like everyone


---------36:28----------
nobody talks about it like I had like


---------36:30----------
all my friends were like oh yeah my tell


---------36:32----------
everyone like how dare you talk back to


---------36:34----------
this guy he's a PhD student all's crap


---------36:36----------
and I'm nobody even talks like this when


---------36:38----------
I was like oh yeah you know I think I'm


---------36:40----------
gonna drop out I was kind of it none of


---------36:42----------
my friends ever talked about it again


---------36:43----------
it's like nobody wants to touch on the


---------36:45----------
subjects that I failed now he wants it


---------36:47----------
like when you have huge potential


---------36:49----------
everyone talks about all these like


---------36:51----------
crazy things you're gonna do and then


---------36:54----------
when you fail to meet that it's just


---------36:56----------
dropped that's everything you do feels


---------37:07----------
like failure


---------37:08----------
I stopped showing my game status on


---------37:11----------
discord because I felt ashamed yeah


---------37:16----------
everything you do feels like a failure


---------37:18----------
failure how do you feel Zach what I


---------37:25----------
mean like again like like I'm a failure


---------37:32----------
like I have Arden a Hellyer yes you like


---------37:38----------
it when I'm sitting in my parents


---------37:41----------
basement


---------37:42----------
playing video games so yeah so here's


---------37:50----------
the crazy thing I agree with you I think


---------37:52----------
you are a failure here's the difference


---------37:54----------
between me and you though why am i why


---------37:56----------
are you smiling right now no idea why am


---------38:04----------
i smiling I also don't know okay so I


---------38:08----------
think why are you smiling oh I think


---------38:10----------
you're smiling out of defensive this


---------38:11----------
because sometimes when we deal with


---------38:13----------
negative negative terrible things all we


---------38:15----------
can do is smile otherwise everything


---------38:18----------
comes crashing apart falling down I'm


---------38:20----------
smiling because I think you're an


---------38:22----------
absolute failure and I think that that's


---------38:24----------
perfectly okay I think that I was a


---------38:28----------
failure too and failure is not the end


---------38:32----------
of the road it's the beginning right so


---------38:37----------
now you can really start to live your


---------38:39----------
life because you can you've you have you


---------38:42----------
have burned down potential you've burned


---------38:45----------
down the idea of I will always been able


---------38:48----------
to do things faster than everyone else


---------38:50----------
all of that expectation and potential


---------38:53----------
you're actually free of it it's a burden


---------38:56----------
and every every ounce of projected


---------38:59----------
failure that ounce of projected failure


---------39:02----------
comes from an ounce of expectation do


---------39:05----------
you see that like you can't fail if you


---------39:07----------
don't expect like you can't see that


---------39:12----------
right so like like washing out of a ph.d


---------39:15----------
program is only an issue if you were


---------39:18----------
expected to be there and be successful


---------39:20----------
if you felt like you were like everyone


---------39:22----------
else and if you felt like you could cut


---------39:24----------
it there because you're smarter than


---------39:25----------
everyone and you can't start with the


---------39:28----------
idea that you suck at life and


---------39:30----------
then like that's where like honestly


---------39:34----------
dude that's where my life began it's


---------39:37----------
like where you are now like though the


---------39:39----------
problem is that we build this house of


---------39:41----------
cards that is potential and it gets


---------39:44----------
bigger and bigger and bigger but boy is


---------39:45----------
it fragile right that's the imposter


---------39:49----------
syndrome it looks like a house you look


---------39:50----------
at it from outside it's tall has lots of


---------39:53----------
walls and lots of rooms


---------39:55----------
puff of wind and the thing comes


---------39:57----------
crumbling down and now like that's not I


---------40:02----------
wish for you I don't wish for you


---------40:06----------
bizarrely that you had succeeded because


---------40:08----------
if you had succeeded all you would have


---------40:10----------
done is add another layer to the house


---------40:12----------
of cards do you see that yeah every


---------40:17----------
success that you had has just increased


---------40:19----------
like you're just stacking the the house


---------40:21----------
of cards higher and higher and higher


---------40:22----------
and it's a foundation because


---------40:26----------
it's gonna come tumbling down


---------40:27----------
and I think you can actually begin now I


---------40:31----------
think failure is when you begin because


---------40:32----------
now you have no expectation so you sort


---------40:34----------
of expectation still but we'll try to


---------40:36----------
disabuse you of those very soon I'm


---------40:40----------
smiling because I think that this is


---------40:42----------
like good for you I think like this is


---------40:43----------
gonna change your life and ten years


---------40:45----------
from now you're gonna look back on it


---------40:47----------
and you're gonna like realize like cuz


---------40:49----------
that's I mean that's what I hope for you


---------40:51----------
maybe ten years from now you'll you'll


---------40:52----------
be no where you'll be sitting at home


---------40:53----------
playing video games and you'll have


---------40:55----------
accomplished nothing and then that's


---------40:56----------
kind of shitty that's possibility we


---------40:59----------
have to acknowledge that I don't think


---------41:02----------
that this is gonna be easy but I think


---------41:03----------
that like there's a lot of stuff here


---------41:06----------
that's so important and I think it has


---------41:07----------
to start with like you accepting that


---------41:10----------
you are a failure like you can talk


---------41:14----------
about victimization as much as you want


---------41:15----------
to and I think that that's fair because


---------41:17----------
I think there are a lot of things that


---------41:19----------
make me furious about your experience


---------41:21----------
and the experience of PhD programs in


---------41:23----------
general and at the top of the list is if


---------41:25----------
a student fails a test whose fault is it


---------41:29----------
students incorrect PII absolutely right


---------41:38----------
there's one person in that relationship


---------41:40----------
who has knowledge and one person who


---------41:42----------
doesn't it is the responsibility of the


---------41:45----------
teacher to help the student along the


---------41:47----------
responsibility of a PI's if your


---------41:49----------
experiment isn't working for a


---------41:51----------
year like how the do you expect a


---------41:53----------
first year PhD student to figure out why


---------41:56----------
their experiment isn't working


---------41:58----------
like that's the job of a PI like if your


---------42:02----------
experiments don't work for a year and


---------42:04----------
you're doing what your PI is doing why


---------42:06----------
on earth are you accepting


---------42:08----------
responsibility your


---------42:09----------
your grad student he's the guy who's


---------42:11----------
running the lab like if he's telling you


---------42:15----------
to change five variables and it doesn't


---------42:17----------
work out like whose fault is that I want


---------42:23----------
to say him Vanessa feel like it's me for


---------42:25----------
actually doing the five variable


---------42:26----------
experiment and not say no but yeah so so


---------42:30----------
I understand where you're coming from


---------42:31----------
but this is where you have to admit that


---------42:33----------
like you have to acknowledge that


---------42:34----------
there's a power dynamic right did you


---------42:36----------
tell your your PI that you think you


---------42:38----------
guys should do one variable at a time


---------42:40----------
yes and what did he say no so what are


---------42:45----------
you like what are your options then


---------42:48----------
don't have any I guess exactly so I


---------42:51----------
think you did what you were supposed to


---------42:53----------
do you raised your concerns with your PI


---------42:55----------
and your PI is young and dumb and a


---------42:58----------
product of his academic environment and


---------43:00----------
so he decided to abuse you in the same


---------43:03----------
way that he was abused the cycle of


---------43:05----------
abuse continues mm-hmm that's like PhD


---------43:08----------
programs and academia in medicine is


---------43:10----------
like that


---------43:11----------
it's like these surgeons are like all


---------43:12----------
these medical students cry when I call


---------43:14----------
them a piece of what the hell is


---------43:16----------
wrong with them like it's like yeah and


---------43:19----------
and they're like but I got called a


---------43:21----------
piece of and it's like yeah but you


---------43:23----------
don't have to call other people a piece


---------43:24----------
of you can be nicer to them just


---------43:27----------
because you're abused doesn't mean that


---------43:29----------
you need to abuse others so I mean I do


---------43:32----------
I think that you were victimized by your


---------43:34----------
circumstances absolutely but like I


---------43:36----------
don't think in a sense I don't think


---------43:37----------
that that kind of matters like it pisses


---------43:39----------
me off and you know when I work with


---------43:41----------
students I try to take the response like


---------43:44----------
I've learned that like if they don't


---------43:46----------
learn that's like my fault


---------43:47----------
right and did I really do the best job


---------43:50----------
that I can I mean they're not to say


---------43:51----------
that I'm completely responsible because


---------43:53----------
if I like try and try and try and they


---------43:55----------
like go home and don't study and don't


---------43:57----------
do anything that I told them to do like


---------43:59----------
then I put the blame on them but as a


---------44:01----------
teacher you know if you're doing what


---------44:03----------
your PI is telling you to do and the


---------44:05----------
experiments are not working out then


---------44:07----------
it's not your fault unless you're being


---------44:09----------
negligent like so if you're being


---------44:11----------
negligent in some way and like


---------44:12----------
half-assing the experiments then then it


---------44:15----------
then it is your fault but that's why I


---------44:17----------
asked you did you run it the same way as


---------44:19----------
the previous person did your results


---------44:20----------
turn out the same and the answer to that


---------44:22----------
question is yes


---------44:23----------
which means that it sounds like you did


---------44:24----------
a good job because you got the same


---------44:25----------
results a couple of other interesting


---------44:27----------
things that I'm gonna go off on a quick


---------44:29----------
tangent but you know the other thing


---------44:31----------
there is that 70% of like studies are


---------44:33----------
like not reproducible so I think that's


---------44:36----------
a big issue and the last thing that


---------44:39----------
I just want to toss your way is like do


---------44:42----------
you know how people win a Nobel Prize in


---------44:46----------
science no actually


---------44:50----------
so they actually start with a failed


---------44:53----------
experiment all Nobel praat all most


---------44:56----------
Nobel Prizes at least that I've studied


---------44:57----------
so I've studied fifteen or sixteen Nobel


---------45:01----------
prize-winning spare experiments in in


---------45:03----------
biology or medicine and all of them


---------45:07----------
start with a failed experiment what do


---------45:09----------
you think about that why does someone


---------45:14----------
get a Nobel Prize because they've made a


---------45:18----------
huge discovery how do you make a huge


---------45:20----------
discovery what luck sure but what makes


---------45:28----------
a discovery huge what does it mean to be


---------45:31----------
a huge discovery either it has a big


---------45:34----------
impact on the world or on the field okay


---------45:38----------
but what determine a huge discovery and


---------45:41----------
big impact are synonymous Yeah right so


---------45:45----------
what makes something a big impact


---------45:49----------
changes everything it changes what


---------45:52----------
something not very what does it change


---------45:58----------
what people thought


---------46:00----------
absolutely so think about this for a


---------46:03----------
second


---------46:04----------
in order to change the way that people


---------46:06----------
think you have to start with a failed


---------46:10----------
experiment and what I mean by a failed


---------46:13----------
experiment is the people who won Nobel


---------46:15----------
prizes they did an experiment and their


---------46:16----------
results were not what they expected and


---------46:18----------
this is what separates 99% of scientists


---------46:22----------
from 1% of scientists instead of looking


---------46:24----------
at it as a failure they looked at it as


---------46:25----------
an opportunity I'm expecting this result


---------46:28----------
and in the process of figuring out why I


---------46:31----------
did not get the result I expected I'm


---------46:33----------
discovering something huge that changes


---------46:36----------
the way that we


---------46:36----------
at science do you get that like the


---------46:40----------
biggest travesty here is that your pee I


---------46:44----------
lost an opportunity to win a Nobel Prize


---------46:47----------
what you don't understand is that you


---------46:49----------
don't you don't have a year of failed


---------46:51----------
experiments you have a year of data that


---------46:54----------
suggests that something about the world


---------46:56----------
is not the way that we have conceived


---------46:57----------
and if you guys spent the time and


---------47:00----------
energy to figure out what that is that's


---------47:02----------
how you win a Nobel Prize why did you


---------47:05----------
guys fail why is it that all of your


---------47:08----------
expectations think about this Nobel


---------47:10----------
Prizes come when all of our expectations


---------47:12----------
are wrong when we have a thousand


---------47:14----------
expectations for a particular result and


---------47:17----------
that result does not happen and then we


---------47:19----------
discover why then it changes our


---------47:21----------
thousand expectations before that is a


---------47:23----------
big impact so the crazy thing here is


---------47:27----------
that all you see is a failed experiment


---------47:28----------
I don't even see failed experiments I


---------47:29----------
see data I see a wonderful opportunity


---------47:33----------
to like understand something about how


---------47:35----------
the variables like result in like


---------47:37----------
compounds in a new and different way


---------47:39----------
it's exactly why you got into a ph.d


---------47:41----------
program for the first place and I think


---------47:44----------
it's a travesty that that you are in a


---------47:46----------
situation call it luck or call it idiocy


---------47:49----------
of your pie or whatever I mean I'm being


---------47:50----------
judgemental I mean maybe the guy's


---------47:52----------
brilliant and compassionate and we're


---------47:54----------
just getting a biased view it's very


---------47:56----------
possible but like I I don't I don't


---------47:58----------
conceive what you did is a failure at


---------48:01----------
all I think are you a failure sure you


---------48:03----------
can accept that but deep down I really


---------48:04----------
don't think so right I think that in a


---------48:07----------
sense you are a victim of your


---------48:08----------
circumstances I think you did the


---------48:10----------
experiments that you were supposed to do


---------48:11----------
I think the only real mistake you made


---------48:13----------
here is that you've got a big ego and


---------48:15----------
you have unrealistic expectations yeah


---------48:18----------
there are a couple of other things like


---------48:19----------
this is the other thing is when you're


---------48:21----------
smart like you're gonna rise until you


---------48:23----------
equilibria right like if I take an


---------48:25----------
object of a certain density and I put it


---------48:27----------
into a fluid of a certain density what


---------48:29----------
is the object I'm gonna do either sink


---------48:34----------
or float depending on the density of


---------48:37----------
both of them in relation to each other


---------48:39----------
exactly so if I have a gradient of


---------48:41----------
densities a gradient of liquids of


---------48:44----------
different densities they're gonna


---------48:46----------
equilibria and then if I put an object


---------48:47----------
of different of a different density


---------48:49----------
where is it going to end up


---------48:50----------
or whichever one is equal to a sense


---------48:53----------
exactly so welcome to academia my friend


---------48:57----------
so we're you rise you got accepted to


---------49:01----------
the ph.d program because you were hot


---------49:02----------
 and undergrad and you're gonna


---------49:05----------
equilibria to like where you normally


---------49:07----------
belong and so the higher up you go like


---------49:10----------
the more average you become like


---------49:12----------
everyone thinks that such hot that


---------49:13----------
dr. K is from Harvard like in Harvard I


---------49:18----------
am subpar I'm really like no one even


---------49:20----------
knows who I am and like I work with


---------49:21----------
people like you guys think I'm brilliant


---------49:22----------
you guys have no idea I'm really


---------49:25----------
not that smart I think I'm really one of


---------49:27----------
y'all I don't think I'm really any


---------49:28----------
different from you guys and you guys are


---------49:30----------
so confused by that and it's like I


---------49:32----------
don't think you guys have been at


---------49:33----------
Harvard it's like you just want to see


---------49:35----------
smart people you should go there and and


---------49:38----------
I mean it really I mean I met people


---------49:39----------
that just blew my mind with just how


---------49:41----------
much knowledge they were able to absorb


---------49:44----------
and hold in their head I was like holy



---------49:46----------
and so the one thing to understand is


---------49:49----------
that the better you do the more you're


---------49:52----------
gonna feel in a sense like a failure


---------49:54----------
until you abandon this whole complex


---------49:56----------
right because you're gonna keep rising


---------49:58----------
and then you're not gonna be I've always


---------49:59----------
been able to get things faster than


---------50:02----------
everyone else that thought is the


---------50:03----------
problem like if I had to diagnose one


---------50:07----------
thing that I could surgically remove


---------50:09----------
from your brain it is a bad thought


---------50:11----------
there's comparison in there there's ego


---------50:13----------
in there there's an expectation of ease


---------50:15----------
in there right there's so many things


---------50:19----------
there that are just like so wrong their


---------50:21----------
potential like that's the other thing


---------50:23----------
good potential is such a curse such a


---------50:25----------
curse it's such a burden because you


---------50:30----------
can't win with potential either you meet


---------50:33----------
expectations in which no one is


---------50:35----------
surprised or you're below expectations


---------50:38----------
in which everyone is disappointed yeah


---------50:41----------
it's like average or failure like when


---------50:44----------
you sign up for potential you sign up to


---------50:46----------
be average at best or meet expectations


---------50:48----------
get a see a D or an F can't get an A if


---------50:54----------
your potential if you have very high


---------50:55----------
potential you just can't you know maybe


---------50:59----------
you can win a Nobel Prize that's the


---------51:00----------
only thing that would be impressive to


---------51:01----------
anyone


---------51:04----------
yeah that's a very good way of putting


---------51:05----------
it that I hadn't talked about before is


---------51:07----------
it's you're signing up for average yep


---------51:10----------
at this at best now I don't really know


---------51:14----------
I kind of got on my soapbox so I'm gonna


---------51:19----------
just pause for a by the way do you know


---------51:20----------
anything about IRB applications okay I'm


---------51:27----------
looking for someone to do IRB stuff I


---------51:29----------
heard yeah institutional review board so


---------51:33----------
we're trying to study healthy gamer so


---------51:35----------
we're doing like research and we're


---------51:37----------
looking for researchers so let's just


---------51:43----------
kind of go back to a couple things so


---------51:44----------
first of all all right so any thoughts


---------51:48----------
or questions so far Zack nothing comes


---------51:54----------
to mind no okay so we've got two options


---------51:57----------
one is you can tell us the rest of the


---------52:00----------
story because you actually haven't told


---------52:01----------
us everything yet which I would love to


---------52:05----------
hear if you're emotionally up for it and


---------52:06----------
the second question is like I think


---------52:08----------
there's a question of like what do we do


---------52:09----------
right or I guess the other question that


---------52:12----------
I would ask you is like how can I help


---------52:15----------
you or how can my self and twitch chat


---------52:17----------
how can we help you and so what do you


---------52:21----------
think should we tell the rest of the


---------52:22----------
story let's ask twitch @d can you see


---------52:25----------
chat yeah I can pull it up okay good


---------52:27----------
that's good that you're raising it but


---------52:29----------
I'm gonna tell us what is what does


---------52:31----------
twitch chat want to do do do we want to


---------52:34----------
hear the story or do we want to get you


---------52:38----------
know figuring out how to help you what


---------52:43----------
does chat say yeah yeah see this is what


---------52:50----------
I hate about like I always ask


---------52:53----------
them for things and it's like they don't


---------52:54----------
help both white people happy yeah like


---------52:58----------
like but like they just never they're


---------53:00----------
never satisfied you think having a pie


---------53:03----------
is bad


---------53:05----------
these guys they're never satisfied they


---------53:09----------
want everything all the time more more


---------53:12----------
MORE okay


---------53:13----------
so let's finish the story okay and okay


---------53:16----------
cry if you need to


---------53:17----------
are you hoping for emotional catharsis


---------53:18----------
by the way uh if that's what it comes to


---------53:23----------
I guess you know because I can ask you


---------53:26----------
couldn't you know leading probing


---------53:27----------
questions about your emotions but I I'm


---------53:29----------
not feeling that we're gonna get there


---------53:30----------
if that's okay with you yeah that's fine


---------53:32----------
so tell us the rest of the story so you


---------53:34----------
you went home you you wrapped you slept


---------53:37----------
you woke up you ate dinner and then what


---------53:40----------
happened yeah so woke up ate dinner


---------53:42----------
played video games went to beds next day


---------53:47----------
go back to doing research and stuff


---------53:52----------
obviously feeling very down not able to


---------53:54----------
get enough pretty much done getting not


---------53:56----------
getting any progress and I believe it


---------54:01----------
was either the day after or two days


---------54:03----------
after that when I was on the train home


---------54:06----------
browsing reddit again that I came across


---------54:09----------
a thread in our league of legends about


---------54:13----------
a former pro player who had attempted


---------54:15----------
suicide hmm he didn't succeed but they


---------54:20----------
had posted a link to his blog where he


---------54:23----------
left his last no and I read the whole


---------54:26----------
thing probably not a good decision if


---------54:29----------
it's a why do you say yeah I mean of


---------54:32----------
course everyone's like if you are in a


---------54:35----------
situation like this please don't read


---------54:36----------
this and after reading it I just it just


---------54:38----------
affirmed everything why does everyone


---------54:40----------
why does everyone can can you pull it up


---------54:45----------
I have to go archive that maybe I can so


---------54:52----------
tell me tell me why is it not a good


---------54:54----------
idea to read that note I'm confused


---------54:57----------
um because again it's it's a person who


---------55:01----------
was on the verge of suicide and his


---------55:03----------
thoughts that he was laying out and I


---------55:08----------
related with a lot of it and it's sort


---------55:12----------
of like it was a confirmation I guess I


---------55:15----------
look of everything that I was going


---------55:17----------
through and it was like you're justified


---------55:19----------
in thinking the way you are and other


---------55:22----------
people went through with it so it's okay


---------55:24----------
to go through with it I see okay that's


---------55:26----------
okay you don't have to find it I was


---------55:27----------
just kind of curious so so I mean it


---------55:29----------
sounds to me like


---------55:31----------
you feel like reading it would make you


---------55:33----------
more likely to try to hurt yourself yes


---------55:37----------
okay okay I mean there is data that


---------55:41----------
suggests that suicide happens in


---------55:43----------
clusters so maybe it is dangerous but


---------55:49----------
and what about what you read resonated


---------55:52----------
with you your um


---------55:55----------
loneliness the feeling that the world's


---------55:58----------
is off and it's not there to help


---------56:02----------
you lots of negative babies feeling oh


---------56:18----------
yeah feeling comfort in games and I


---------56:22----------
would say fantasies a whole games anime


---------56:24----------
movies books all that stuff other worlds


---------56:27----------
I guess feel like you belong more of


---------56:29----------
those growths than you do the real world


---------56:31----------
that's diving more into them and being


---------56:34----------
attached to them and he had said that he


---------56:42----------
preferred to be a third party observer


---------56:43----------
of things rather than be in the mix of


---------56:46----------
them and so that was like his motivation


---------56:48----------
for wanting to kill himself I didn't


---------56:49----------
fully agree with that but like I can see


---------56:51----------
where he's coming from and it's like


---------56:52----------
this work related to other aspects I


---------56:54----------
guess what I did and did not resonate


---------56:58----------
with you about that oddly specific thing


---------57:02----------
to remember yeah I I guess I can give an


---------57:11----------
example in that for some games that I


---------57:16----------
played there's a big speedrun scene and


---------57:18----------
I like to observe the meta of the


---------57:20----------
speedrunning and understand why they do


---------57:22----------
it but I don't really participate so


---------57:24----------
much and just be running itself what is


---------57:27----------
being an observer do um you removes a


---------57:32----------
lot of distress of the situation the


---------57:35----------
less you do like for me it allows me to


---------57:37----------
experience the joy of having solved it


---------57:40----------
quote-unquote or like solve the problem


---------57:42----------
understanding something learn something


---------57:44----------
new


---------57:44----------
that any risk yeah so interesting what


---------57:48----------
do you think about that it's a good


---------57:55----------
question I mean I don't like risk in


---------58:01----------
general I feel like it's kind of a


---------58:03----------
normal thing yeah for people but we're


---------58:05----------
asking you questions that are gonna have


---------58:07----------
very very plain and simple answers okay


---------58:10----------
so it doesn't have to be a complicated


---------58:12----------
answer yeah it's just kind of play


---------58:17----------
because the questions that you ask I


---------58:18----------
always know that you ask things that are


---------58:20----------
kind of out of the blue and unexpected


---------58:21----------
and I'm hit with them like I don't know


---------58:24----------
what I think good that's why you're here


---------58:28----------
you're not here to share with us the


---------58:30----------
answers that you already have Zak yeah


---------58:34----------
you're here to learn the things that you


---------58:36----------
don't know so what do you think about


---------58:39----------
being an observer you say and I think


---------58:43----------
it's it may mean it's may sound simple


---------58:44----------
but I think it's very good I'm glad that


---------58:46----------
you're laying down basic assumptions


---------58:48----------
because that's important I don't like


---------58:50----------
risk fair so what else I do like to work


---------58:57----------
through problems of things without ends


---------59:01----------
yeah yeah with that risk I so like yeah


---------59:04----------
I like to go like to work the problems


---------59:06----------
of things but if I can minimize or


---------59:07----------
remove risk then I like to do so mm-hmm


---------59:13----------
if it's something that requires a lot of


---------59:16----------
effort I like to give it a shot and put


---------59:18----------
in that effort but I don't want to have


---------59:21----------
that ever be wasted okay so having it be


---------59:24----------
on something that's almost hobby like


---------59:26----------
innocence means that even if I don't


---------59:28----------
figure out either someone else well and


---------59:30----------
then I can look at their answer or it's


---------59:32----------
like yeah whatever I'll just go do this


---------59:33----------
with something else mm-hmm and it


---------59:35----------
doesn't feel like I wasted any time


---------59:36----------
again low risk are you an observer for


---------59:40----------
your life


---------59:49----------
sometimes okay there are times that I


---------59:55----------
have that perspective where I observed


---------59:58----------
my own life but and what happens to you


---------60:01----------
in those times I sort of just become


---------60:05----------
detached for a lot of the emotional


---------60:07----------
aspects of it do you still feel the


---------60:09----------
emotions yeah I still feel them but not


---------60:16----------
quite to the same degree I don't know


---------60:18----------
how to explain it sure we don't have


---------60:20----------
good words for that in English by the


---------60:22----------
way yeah so what do you think I mean is


---------60:24----------
it a pleasant or unpleasant experience


---------60:27----------
to be an observer in one's life kind is


---------60:29----------
neutral okay what is it like to not be


---------60:32----------
an observer in one's life life is kind


---------60:39----------
of


---------60:42----------
feels pretty bad yeah what about when


---------60:46----------
things are good I mean it feels good in


---------60:51----------
the good situations does it feel better


---------60:57----------
to be an observer or better to feel good


---------61:00----------
in the good situations this means


---------61:04----------
specifically in the good situation it


---------61:06----------
feels good to be in them and not


---------61:08----------
observing them hmm


---------61:11----------
I think that's an experiment that you


---------61:14----------
should run I'd love to hear your answer


---------61:18----------
after you actually use your scientific


---------61:21----------
training to develop a hypothesis and


---------61:23----------
systematically collect data so what


---------61:26----------
we're talking about is exactly what


---------61:27----------
would that talked about so when you said


---------61:30----------
when I kind of asked what is it like to


---------61:32----------
not be an observant you were like well


---------61:34----------
most of life is so would this said


---------61:36----------
that we're all human being this is the


---------61:38----------
fundamental state of life is dukkha or


---------61:40----------
suffering and that the way to get free


---------61:43----------
of dukkha and suffering is to become an


---------61:45----------
observer then consciousness and mind are


---------61:49----------
separate things and that even as you


---------61:51----------
that emotion exists within the mind but


---------61:53----------
consciousness is separate of the mind


---------61:55----------
and that's hard for us to really


---------61:56----------
understand but it's kind of like what


---------61:58----------
you said it's hard to describe you still


---------61:59----------
feel the emotions


---------62:01----------
it's just there's distance between you


---------62:02----------
and the emotions it's like the


---------62:04----------
difference between being in a cage with


---------62:06----------
a lion or maybe I've just been watching


---------62:09----------
too much Tiger King or or being outside


---------62:12----------
of the cage right the lion is still


---------62:14----------
there and it hasn't changed but your


---------62:16----------
position with respect to the lion


---------62:18----------
drastically changes what you're able to


---------62:21----------
appreciate or not appreciate about the


---------62:23----------
lion does that make sense mm-hmm and and


---------62:28----------
so I how much of an observer have you


---------62:34----------
been throughout this whole saga with


---------62:35----------
with grad school I didn't really start


---------62:41----------
doing so until at some point in the


---------62:45----------
therapy that was one of those things


---------62:46----------
that they talked about was trying to not


---------62:49----------
be in the storm but be aware of the


---------62:51----------
storm being there you can't make it go


---------62:53----------
away but look at it don't be in it in a


---------62:57----------
sense yeah which I could only pull off a


---------63:00----------
handful of times at best because it's so


---------63:02----------
hard to do absolutely right so this is


---------63:05----------
why we train like we don't start


---------63:08----------
we don't dump people into the ocean to


---------63:10----------
teach them how to swim right we start in


---------63:13----------
calm waters and that's why I like


---------63:15----------
meditation is normally done like we


---------63:16----------
start by observing our breath and we


---------63:19----------
separate our mind from we sort of


---------63:21----------
develop a sense of consciousness outside


---------63:23----------
of mind but something like breath that


---------63:24----------
has like nothing no value attached to it


---------63:27----------
and the more valuable things become the


---------63:30----------
harder it is to be detached mm-hmm and


---------63:33----------
in your case it's it's hard right this


---------63:35----------
is what I think is really unfortunate


---------63:38----------
you know we teach this stuff as


---------63:40----------
treatment and therapists do it instead


---------63:43----------
of teaching it as a basic skill that


---------63:45----------
everyone learns in school which is


---------63:47----------
really where I think it should be taught


---------63:48----------
like it's kind of like okay like a


---------63:50----------
therapist is sort of like someone who


---------63:51----------
teaches you how to swim but people don't


---------63:54----------
seek out therapists until they're


---------63:55----------
drowning in the ocean it's like kind of


---------63:57----------
really bass-ackwards yeah and and so


---------64:01----------
that's part of you mean that's part of


---------64:02----------
why we do this right so I'm part of our


---------64:04----------
goal here is to help people understand


---------64:07----------
some of these skills and start to


---------64:08----------
develop them and and hopefully be


---------64:10----------
prepared for when when stuff like what


---------64:12----------
happens to you happen but let's kind of


---------64:14----------
go back


---------64:15----------
to your story so what happened the next


---------64:17----------
day uh I think X the next day I went to


---------64:22----------
therapy and I told her all about it and


---------64:26----------
then she was like you should go home


---------64:28----------
today or well it was it was more like if


---------64:31----------
like I think that you should you should


---------64:33----------
decide for yourself but if you think


---------64:35----------
that you shouldn't you should go home to


---------64:36----------
it so that was on like a Friday or


---------64:39----------
something and so I took that day off I


---------64:41----------
just emailed my PA I was like I can't do


---------64:44----------
today above the blah I didn't even like


---------64:46----------
really read much whatever I would just


---------64:47----------
sense it and then that day and that


---------64:50----------
entire weekend I spent playing path of


---------64:52----------
Exile non-stop for like 18 hours a day


---------64:55----------
just trying to not experience anything


---------65:01----------
mathematics I was very good at that yes


---------65:06----------
then I had to go back to work on Monday


---------65:09----------
I don't remember a whole lot at some


---------65:14----------
point in there I I just I don't wanna


---------65:20----------
say like forcefully but like convinced


---------65:22----------
my PI like I can't write this paper it's


---------65:25----------
not going to happen and also it was like


---------65:29----------
I'm in a pretty place right now I'm


---------65:33----------
thinking about either taking leave of


---------65:36----------
absence or dropping down to the master's


---------65:38----------
program or something like that I've been


---------65:39----------
talking with the therapist about this he


---------65:41----------
was kind of hesitant eventually at some


---------65:43----------
point I had to as I brought up with her


---------65:46----------
she was like dude I'm gonna write you a


---------65:47----------
letter to your PI so he understands how


---------65:50----------
serious the situation is cuz he's not


---------65:52----------
taking it seriously eventually decided


---------65:57----------
we decided to drop downs the master's


---------66:00----------
program instead of the PhD cuz I was


---------66:04----------
almost done with my credits and I was


---------66:07----------
like cool finished my credits and now


---------66:08----------
just graduate take my degree and go do


---------66:10----------
something else and then I found out that


---------66:11----------
I had to write a thesis still and they


---------66:14----------
were like yeah you got like since you


---------66:15----------
haven't gotten anywhere in your research


---------66:17----------
that's like at least another six months


---------66:18----------
before you down with that I can't take


---------66:20----------
this for six more months and then that's


---------66:23----------
when I attempted weep absence and okay


---------66:29----------
yeah


---------66:30----------
then moved out came back here and spent


---------66:34----------
three and a half months playing video


---------66:37----------
games and not talking about it how does


---------66:40----------
it feel to talk about it today it's nice


---------66:45----------
to address it it's like it's been there


---------66:51----------
and it's been kind of eating away very


---------66:53----------
slowly because I try not to focus on it


---------66:56----------
but it's been sitting there and yeah I


---------67:00----------
mean I've been watching a lot of streams


---------67:01----------
and trying to appear strains are trying


---------67:03----------
to like address it myself but there's


---------67:05----------
kind of only so far I can get stuck in


---------67:07----------
my own head mm-hmm


---------67:11----------
yeah it's it's nice to address it and


---------67:14----------
talk about it and get it out I guess do


---------67:20----------
you want to move forward


---------67:21----------
I guess define that a little bit better


---------67:31----------
cuz


---------67:37----------
I don't like I want to get out a feeling


---------67:41----------
 all the time but I also just don't


---------67:45----------
really have any I don't like I don't


---------67:47----------
want to go back to what I was


---------67:48----------
experiencing before of this like super


---------67:50----------
high effort thing you're just so done


---------67:54----------
good good


---------67:57----------
I don't think I needed to find it I


---------67:58----------
think you understood the nuance of my


---------68:00----------
question and you gave me a very good


---------68:01----------
answer right so there's a presumption


---------68:03----------
that progress is completing your prior


---------68:07----------
goal mm-hmm


---------68:09----------
but it sounds like you don't want to you


---------68:11----------
want to do more than what you're doing


---------68:13----------
right now but you don't necessarily want


---------68:16----------
to quote-unquote succeed


---------68:18----------
yeah she's interesting right because


---------68:21----------
that's not usually how we think you


---------68:24----------
think that if I fail a test what's my


---------68:26----------
goal Cass the next ones yeah there's a


---------68:31----------
presumption that you keep going mm-hmm


---------68:34----------
right but it's good I'm glad I think


---------68:36----------
it's actually a huge step forward that


---------68:38----------
you realize that you may not want to do


---------68:40----------
that so now we're gonna get so how do


---------68:43----------
you think we can help you Zach what


---------68:47----------
would be helpful


---------68:49----------
um I guess how to like solve these sort


---------69:02----------
of emotional attachments I still have


---------69:04----------
that because like you say I there's this


---------69:08----------
feeling that I have to live up to


---------69:10----------
certain expectations even still even


---------69:12----------
though like I failed and there is I


---------69:16----------
would hope eventually a release from


---------69:18----------
that I still feel attached to those


---------69:20----------
expectations


---------69:21----------
sure awesome it's the burden of


---------69:23----------
potential okay yep absolutely so I think


---------69:26----------
some of this is going to be propagated


---------69:29----------
by you and some of it as an echo so


---------69:32----------
you've got a choice you just what was


---------69:36----------
your reaction they're like what we echo


---------69:42----------
confusion okay so so what I mean by that


---------69:45----------
is like like so the the burden of


---------69:47----------
potential is something that has been fed


---------69:50----------
you


---------69:50----------
been feeding it every day growing up


---------69:52----------
being the kid who's always been able to


---------69:55----------
get things done faster than everyone


---------69:56----------
else every time you have that thought


---------69:58----------
every time you make that observation you


---------70:01----------
feed the act of the the sort of beast of


---------70:04----------
potential now you failed I don't think


---------70:09----------
that you think very often that I've


---------70:11----------
always been able to do things faster


---------70:12----------
than everyone else right so you've


---------70:15----------
stopped feeding that echo you start


---------70:18----------
stopped feeding that beast of potential


---------70:20----------
but an echo remains it's not the


---------70:22----------
original sound it's just the like you


---------70:26----------
know it's the after-effects or the


---------70:27----------
shadow of that potential which is gonna


---------70:30----------
still be bouncing around in your head


---------70:32----------
for a while the main issue is whether


---------70:34----------
you continue to feed it or not if you


---------70:37----------
don't feed it it's gonna die down on its


---------70:39----------
own like you'll start to accept that


---------70:42----------
like you know you should I mean


---------70:44----------
hopefully what you'll do is start to


---------70:45----------
accept that like you shouldn't plan your


---------70:47----------
life based on what you think you should


---------70:49----------
do or what you're capable of but you'll


---------70:52----------
start to devote yourself towards like


---------70:54----------
doing things that you care about and not


---------70:56----------
really like worrying about whether you


---------70:58----------
do a good enough job you know I think if


---------71:00----------
you have a love for science you should


---------71:02----------
pursue science but you shouldn't get


---------71:04----------
bogged down and getting a PhD does that


---------71:06----------
mean you will get a PhD yeah sure why


---------71:08----------
not


---------71:09----------
but it doesn't mean that getting a PhD


---------71:11----------
is the goal like the PhD is just because


---------71:13----------
otherwise like it's gonna be hard to do


---------71:15----------
science if it's like kind of this


---------71:17----------
rigorous rat race kind of stuff you're


---------71:19----------
gonna like learn whatever skills you


---------71:21----------
want to or learn sign so then you can go


---------71:23----------
work in industry or you can be an


---------71:25----------
academic like whatever it doesn't matter


---------71:26----------
but like if your goal is a love for


---------71:29----------
science then that's what you should


---------71:30----------
pursue and don't worry about potential


---------71:33----------
now the interesting thing is that you're


---------71:35----------
also feeding another beast which is sort


---------71:37----------
of the the beast of like lack of


---------71:39----------
self-worth and this is the thing that


---------71:41----------
sort of says that because I fail I am a


---------71:44----------
bad person like there's a difference


---------71:46----------
between family like it this beast is the


---------71:49----------
one that confuses failing at a task with


---------71:54----------
being a failure so for you to be able to


---------71:58----------
take a step back and realize that like


---------72:00----------
once again if you didn't do well in a


---------72:02----------
ph.d program and you were


---------72:04----------
exactly what your P I told you to do


---------72:06----------
like how on earth is at your fault


---------72:09----------
mm-hmm sure if you're like a fifth year


---------72:12----------
grad student and you've got autonomy to


---------72:15----------
design your own experiments like if


---------72:17----------
you're working in experimental design


---------72:19----------
and then the the experiment doesn't work


---------72:21----------
that's different but it sounds like you


---------72:24----------
didn't do anything the experimental


---------72:25----------
design you were given you were like hey


---------72:27----------
monkey go ahead and perform this dance


---------72:30----------
for me and then do it again every day


---------72:32----------
for ten hours a day and you were dancing


---------72:36----------
the way they told you to and it didn't


---------72:37----------
work out so I don't really think that


---------72:38----------
that's your fault but you don't see that


---------72:40----------
right and this is where I think that


---------72:42----------
there's there's a lot here where like


---------72:43----------
you kept on using phrases like stressed


---------72:46----------
out and overwhelmed but that's not


---------72:48----------
really those are indicators of amplitude


---------72:53----------
they're not like indicators of like


---------72:56----------
direction or quality does that make


---------72:58----------
sense like overwhelmed is quantity it's


---------73:02----------
not quality so what is the quality of


---------73:05----------
what you are feeling are you dealing


---------73:07----------
with shame probably are you dealing with


---------73:10----------
fear are you dealing with anger right so


---------73:14----------
shame I'm sure we can all accept like


---------73:16----------
that we've seen pretty clearly that you


---------73:19----------
are a failure but are you afraid I mean


---------73:25----------
I was I was mostly angry that like my P


---------73:30----------
I wasn't taking anything that I was


---------73:32----------
saying seriously and I was like I wasn't


---------73:38----------
in control of the situation my input and


---------73:40----------
why I was taken there wasn't valued and


---------73:43----------
I was mad about that and I was mad that


---------73:46----------
things were going the way they were are


---------73:49----------
you still mad I wasn't able to do


---------73:50----------
anything yes how mad are you yeah


---------74:01----------
not like crazy super mad but like it's


---------74:05----------
like it frustrated like Oh stupid okay


---------74:09----------
good


---------74:10----------
no so now the question becomes how mad


---------74:13----------
are you


---------74:14----------
and how suppress as your anger question


---------74:24----------
I don't feel like it's that surprised I


---------74:32----------
don't know okay


---------74:35----------
okay well trusty right so it's good that


---------74:37----------
you you noticed the question it sounds


---------74:39----------
like you actually did some exploration


---------74:41----------
there's a good for you


---------74:42----------
are you afraid afraid of what you tell


---------74:47----------
me see everyone thinks that I make I


---------74:55----------
help people but I don't help people I


---------74:57----------
don't make your lives harm wants


---------75:05----------
to come on in be on stream I don't think


---------75:07----------
you guys realize how heavy this is


---------75:08----------
recession this is definitely different


---------75:12----------
than I was expecting different being in


---------75:15----------
the hot seat isn't it it's it's it's


---------75:17----------
really different even when you're from


---------75:19----------
the even you're sitting there you're


---------75:20----------
like oh how would I react if he asked me


---------75:22----------
these questions like you usually come up


---------75:23----------
with something then you sit and seat


---------75:25----------
you're like dude I got nothing like yeah


---------75:27----------
so are you afraid Zak I'm afraid that if


---------75:35----------
I try to branch out of my comfort zone I


---------75:40----------
can't roll it down if I if I try to like


---------75:45----------
I spent my whole life in science and


---------75:47----------
engineering and chemistry and like these


---------75:49----------
are the things that I've always been


---------75:50----------
good at I'm afraid that if I try to go


---------75:52----------
outside of that that it won't and well


---------75:57----------
I'm afraid that I mean again living up


---------76:02----------
to expectations I'm afraid that I'll I


---------76:04----------
won't meet anyone's expectations or what


---------76:07----------
I think will be good won't be good to


---------76:10----------
anyone else and that that will affect me


---------76:16----------
I'm afraid that I won't be able to break


---------76:18----------
out of the cycle that I'm in right now


---------76:25----------
yeah I'm afraid that whatever I end up


---------76:30----------
doing is gonna fail fairness right so


---------76:38----------
now let's just think about that for a


---------76:40----------
second so first of all as you say those


---------76:42----------
things do you feel fear yes are you an


---------76:50----------
observer


---------76:58----------
kind of right answer right so I think


---------77:03----------
you feel the fear but I think your


---------77:05----------
acknowledgment of them so when you're


---------77:07----------
feeling the fear fully and it takes over


---------77:10----------
your mind you can't articulate it does


---------77:13----------
that make sense mm-hmm your capacity to


---------77:15----------
articulate only comes with distance


---------77:19----------
right so I asked you a question are you


---------77:21----------
afraid and then you didn't know how to


---------77:23----------
answer it and then a few seconds later


---------77:25----------
then we talked for a moment about how


---------77:27----------
hard it is to answer questions and then


---------77:29----------
you went often you gave like half a


---------77:31----------
dozen specific fears that you have


---------77:35----------
that's progress that's what you're here


---------77:39----------
for right so now you know that these are


---------77:42----------
things that you carry with you right


---------77:44----------
these are the different debuffs and


---------77:45----------
you've got to think a little bit about


---------77:47----------
each of these D buffs and how you want a


---------77:50----------
gear in response to those Big D buffs so


---------77:53----------
it sounds like you fought and we haven't


---------77:57----------
really talked about this but I'm sure


---------77:58----------
other people have subconsciously pieced


---------78:00----------
this together that he's thought about a


---------78:02----------
career outside of science he's thought


---------78:05----------
about maybe doing something else right


---------78:07----------
and because he shared with us that he


---------78:09----------
has a fear that he's not going to be


---------78:11----------
successful elsewhere that's a specific


---------78:14----------
fear so that's kind of like okay and so


---------78:17----------
then like if you have a like if you have


---------78:19----------
a debuff that increases your your


---------78:21----------
vulnerability to fire you have to like


---------78:23----------
gear up with like fire resistance gear


---------78:25----------
right and so as you move in as you


---------78:28----------
explore other career options just be


---------78:30----------
aware that you're gonna feel less


---------78:33----------
confident than you do in science which


---------78:34----------
is gonna be bizarre in a second because


---------78:36----------
you don't feel confidence in science


---------78:37----------
anyway but that like that's an


---------78:40----------
additional fear that you have to account


---------78:42----------
for now that fear is not reality like in


---------78:45----------
general I think you're gonna be fine


---------78:46----------
outside of science I don't think people


---------78:48----------
have a talent for chemistry like I think


---------78:51----------
what you're good at is probably some


---------78:53----------
amount of hard work analytical


---------78:55----------
capability experimental design like all


---------78:57----------
that I mean you could be a


---------78:58----------
strategic consultant and all that stuff


---------79:00----------
is going to apply you could go into


---------79:02----------
finance if you cared about it and like


---------79:04----------
analyze financial models like in run


---------79:06----------
experiments I saw a really cool video


---------79:10----------
from three blue one


---------79:11----------
you guys should check it out about


---------79:13----------
simulating pandemics it's like a YouTube


---------79:16----------
channel that's very cool so he does like


---------79:18----------
statistical analyses and he just like


---------79:20----------
simulates like so he has one about


---------79:21----------
simulating pandemics and different kinds


---------79:23----------
of interventions and stuff like that I


---------79:25----------
think that the things that make you good


---------79:27----------
at science are gonna apply to a bunch of


---------79:29----------
fields you could even go into like


---------79:31----------
marketing and branding if you want to


---------79:33----------
and just be heavily metric and analytic


---------79:35----------
focus like that's fine I think what


---------79:37----------
makes you good at being you is like not


---------79:40----------
content specific so I'm good at being a


---------79:45----------
psychiatrist I'm also good at like


---------79:47----------
corporate consulting but my take on


---------79:51----------
corporate consulting is I tend to be


---------79:52----------
like an observer of human behavior an


---------79:54----------
observer of people and I try to teach


---------79:56----------
people about themselves so I'm a pretty


---------79:57----------
good teacher I'm a pretty good


---------79:58----------
psychiatrist I'm a pretty good


---------80:00----------
meditation teacher and I'm also pretty


---------80:02----------
good consultant but it's like it that's


---------80:04----------
because I don't define myself by a


---------80:06----------
particular profession I define myself by


---------80:09----------
like a particular kind of skill Sattar


---------80:12----------
interest and in your case I think you'll


---------80:14----------
do fine outside of science provided that


---------80:16----------
you get to do that which you really


---------80:18----------
enjoy which is like learning about


---------80:20----------
things and figuring things out right so


---------80:24----------
like in strategic consulting for example


---------80:26----------
you know there'll be a company that will


---------80:28----------
go to like McKinsey or Bane or whatever


---------80:32----------
and they'll say like hey we're thinking


---------80:33----------
about opening up a power plant in


---------80:35----------
Southeast Asia which country should we


---------80:38----------
open it in and so what they do is like


---------80:41----------
they just take a bunch of information


---------80:43----------
try to analyze it and then try to give


---------80:45----------
someone a recommendation we think you


---------80:47----------
should open it in Thailand here are


---------80:48----------
reasons a B C and D if you want to open


---------80:51----------
it in Cambodia here are the things that


---------80:53----------
are different and this is why we think


---------80:54----------
you should do Thailand it's done in


---------80:55----------
Cambodia


---------80:57----------
something tells me is act that you would


---------80:59----------
be good at a lot of different stuff


---------81:02----------
besides science and chemistry what do


---------81:05----------
you think I mean yeah I can agree I do


---------81:11----------
rent the situation of when I look at


---------81:15----------
various jobs and I you know maybe yet


---------81:17----------
maybe I can apply my skillset to this


---------81:19----------
then I don't meet the stupid


---------81:22----------
requirements and I can't apply anyways


---------81:24----------
but sure


---------81:25----------
right so I wouldn't let not meeting the


---------81:28----------
requirements prevent you from applying


---------81:30----------
so not to say that you should apply for


---------81:32----------
a bunch of jobs where you don't meet the


---------81:34----------
requirements but if there's something


---------81:35----------
you're genuinely interested I think you


---------81:37----------
should write a good cover letter and


---------81:38----------
send it off


---------81:39----------
I have master's like a master's in


---------81:42----------
chemistry is pretty respectable like no


---------81:43----------
matter where you end up I think you


---------81:45----------
should get your masters by the way cuz


---------81:46----------
that's just that'll be something but


---------81:51----------
anyway maybe not but the so the first


---------81:55----------
thing is to understand that you have


---------81:56----------
different fears and that as you think


---------81:58----------
about how to move forward just


---------82:00----------
acknowledge those fears because those


---------82:01----------
fears are part of what's keeping you at


---------82:03----------
home playing runescape does that make


---------82:05----------
sense what else is keeping you at home


---------82:09----------
hmm


---------82:10----------
virus sure I was saying that there's


---------82:23----------
probably another fear which is that


---------82:26----------
whatever I do it'll end up the same way


---------82:32----------
that was that was one of the things


---------82:37----------
that's really I was conflicted with when


---------82:39----------
I was thinking about what to do I'm did


---------82:41----------
you drop out or not cuz I was like I


---------82:43----------
mean I just had like a severe depressive


---------82:46----------
episode and I haven't fully recovered


---------82:48----------
with it and if I keep going I'm worried


---------82:50----------
that I'll just fall right back in again


---------82:52----------
are you still in mental health treatment


---------82:55----------
not right now no okay so I'd consider


---------82:58----------
getting back into mental health


---------82:59----------
treatment but I think that that too now


---------83:01----------
you have a some scar if you you're


---------83:02----------
familiar with some scars weird the word


---------83:05----------
a thousand times nice so that everybody


---------83:06----------
needs so so what it is is sort of like a


---------83:08----------
ball of undigested emotion that kind of


---------83:11----------
lingers with you and like colors your


---------83:14----------
vision about the future you can also


---------83:16----------
think about it like an unprocessed


---------83:18----------
trauma so this entire experience has


---------83:20----------
been traumatic for you and so as you


---------83:24----------
move forward as long as that trauma is


---------83:26----------
there like you know if you have if you


---------83:27----------
get married to someone and you have an


---------83:29----------
abusive husband or wife and they beat


---------83:33----------
you even after you like leave them


---------83:36----------
you're gonna have the fear that the next


---------83:38----------
is gonna turn out that way and even the


---------83:41----------
more sicker thing about the human mind


---------83:43----------
is you may select for those kinds of


---------83:45----------
people which which is sort of like


---------83:48----------
because sometimes our mind prefers and


---------83:50----------
this is sort of this goes back to our


---------83:52----------
conversation with your mom and your


---------83:54----------
parents where like it would sometimes


---------83:56----------
almost be easier if they just called you


---------83:57----------
a up to your face because at least


---------84:00----------
that makes sense to you if they have


---------84:03----------
faith and hope and who you are and your


---------84:05----------
possibility of success how does that


---------84:07----------
make you feel yeah it's like it's just


---------84:14----------
why yeah right so like like oddly enough


---------84:18----------
so like now this is that now we can


---------84:20----------
understand why of people who have been


---------84:22----------
abused seek out abusive partners because


---------84:26----------
when someone treats them genuinely


---------84:27----------
they're like what the this is a lie


---------84:31----------
and then someone treats them the letters


---------84:33----------
like no like ah this is a game I


---------84:36----------
know how to play and so bizarrely our


---------84:40----------
mind prefers that which we know to that


---------84:42----------
which is good for us and you've got to


---------84:45----------
be really really careful because you're


---------84:47----------
not a have you failed sure but


---------84:50----------
like you failed because of a combination


---------84:51----------
of circumstance and an experience it's


---------84:54----------
not you aren't a failure but have you


---------84:56----------
failed absolutely and that's okay and so


---------85:01----------
going forward you've got to be really


---------85:02----------
careful about that in this too I think


---------85:04----------
your your your answer is gonna be to


---------85:06----------
certain degree in observation right so


---------85:08----------
you have to notice that there's gonna be


---------85:09----------
a part of your mind that's gonna tell


---------85:11----------
you that I'm gonna fail at everything


---------85:12----------
I've done but like by the way did you


---------85:14----------
finish second grade second grade yeah


---------85:19----------
like like elementary school sex right


---------85:21----------
yes


---------85:22----------
there died succeeded at it I I got


---------85:25----------
through it what about third grade yes


---------85:27----------
fourth grade you know fifth grade where


---------85:32----------
you're saying like got through it and


---------85:34----------
succeeded right yeah


---------85:35----------
yes okay so you have succeeded at stuff


---------85:38----------
you graduated from high school yes you


---------85:40----------
graduated from college yep but I thought


---------85:43----------
you were gonna fail at everything you do


---------85:46----------
do you like okay yeah


---------85:49----------
what do you feel no tell me


---------85:51----------
well like its let me know if you need


---------86:00----------
help yeah


---------86:06----------
yeah I need help so those don't count


---------86:08----------
right yeah


---------86:11----------
is that what you're thinking like it


---------86:12----------
doesn't count yeah yeah it's it's it was


---------86:15----------
stuff that happened earlier it was


---------86:17----------
easier just it doesn't count it doesn't


---------86:21----------
count it doesn't count right is that how


---------86:24----------
you feel


---------86:25----------
yes yeah so let's just think about that


---------86:28----------
for a second your mind is coming up with


---------86:30----------
all kinds of reasons why it doesn't


---------86:31----------
count as second grade who fails


---------86:33----------
second grade sometimes people do it


---------86:37----------
doesn't count so just now see what kind


---------86:40----------
of look at what rigged ass game your


---------86:42----------
brain is playing with you it's funny cuz


---------86:49----------
you say that and like yeah my brains


---------86:51----------
rigged my princess ring you're talking


---------86:54----------
about like so tell me how is the game


---------86:59----------
ranked very good now you're growing what


---------87:06----------
am I saying


---------87:06----------
I'm saying the game's rigged I I'm


---------87:11----------
taking one single event and I fixating


---------87:14----------
on it ends yeah and what are you doing


---------87:22----------
to all of the other data points ignoring


---------87:25----------
them absolutely right I'm gonna run an


---------87:28----------
experiment Zack and I'm going to say


---------87:32----------
that feeding a plant with beer is better


---------87:37----------
than feeding it with water and I'm gonna


---------87:39----------
take a dozen plants and I'm gonna give


---------87:41----------
him 11 of them water and I'm gonna give


---------87:44----------
one up a beer


---------87:45----------
and after two months I have 11 healthy


---------87:49----------
plants and I have one kind of stunted


---------87:51----------
plant and what I'm essentially doing is


---------87:53----------
taking my 11 doh the healthy plants I'm


---------87:54----------
saying this I'm gonna dump him in


---------87:57----------
the trash and there's my beer plant see


---------87:58----------
I was right all along


---------87:59----------
it's the only one that's growing the


---------88:02----------
game is rigged because your


---------88:05----------
discarding data all the time this is


---------88:06----------
what how a cognitive bias works and this


---------88:08----------
all comes from your emotion because


---------88:11----------
that's like it's irrational so it's


---------88:12----------
coming from your emotion fine you can't


---------88:14----------
convince it otherwise and when I pointed


---------88:16----------
out to you rationally even your rational


---------88:18----------
mind is like yeah the game is rigged but


---------88:19----------
then the other part of you that's what


---------88:22----------
does that part saying that parts is like


---------88:25----------
of course it's not rigged this is like


---------88:27----------
everything else doesn't count this is


---------88:29----------
you know this is what happens this sucks


---------88:32----------
and this is the way it is yeah right so


---------88:35----------
just see that about yourself right and


---------88:37----------
let's like laugh at it that's kind of


---------88:38----------
 up yeah yeah right but that's


---------88:43----------
that's how it is so when we have our


---------88:45----------
emotions aren't rational so we can't


---------88:46----------
expect them to be rational understand


---------88:48----------
that there's a part of yourself that is


---------88:51----------
hurt and there's a part of yourself that


---------88:53----------
has lost confidence now the real


---------88:55----------
challenge is is in your struggle with


---------88:59----------
that part I wouldn't say you should try


---------89:00----------
to fight it or overcome it


---------89:02----------
because that doesn't really work too


---------89:03----------
well what I'd say is you should take it


---------89:05----------
with you just take it with you right


---------89:08----------
like every everything that you do take


---------89:12----------
this failure with you and say there's a


---------89:14----------
decent chance like this part of me is


---------89:16----------
saying like there's a logical part of my


---------89:17----------
mind that says that actually I'm not


---------89:19----------
really a family or in this part of is


---------89:20----------
like no you you are a failure


---------89:22----------
nothing you could do is right and then


---------89:24----------
you're like okay treat it like a you


---------89:28----------
know like a eccentric uncle who comes to


---------89:32----------
all of your family gatherings and you


---------89:34----------
can't get rid of him like eleven people


---------89:37----------
are dressed normally and he's wearing


---------89:39----------
you know underwear over his pants


---------89:44----------
because he feels like he's a superhero


---------89:45----------
and like he's just gonna be who he's


---------89:47----------
gonna be like the part of you that feels


---------89:49----------
that you're a failure is gonna feel like


---------89:50----------
it's a failure and it's gonna take time


---------89:52----------
for you to comfort and reassure that


---------89:55----------
part and for him to kind of calm down


---------89:57----------
it's like a dog that has gotten like


---------89:59----------
riled up and is afraid that like


---------90:01----------
someone's in his intruder you just have


---------90:03----------
to smell you can't take the dog out the


---------90:04----------
dog is gonna be with you your failure is


---------90:06----------
gonna be with you so carry it with you


---------90:08----------
let it be with you and then also don't


---------90:09----------
let it control you


---------90:12----------
does that make sense yeah easier said


---------90:15----------
than done but absolutely so how do we


---------90:17----------
make it easier to do


---------90:19----------
what do you think yeah I got nothing so


---------90:22----------
dad I'm trying to come up with so I


---------90:24----------
think this is where as you deal with


---------90:26----------
each of the deep as we identify things


---------90:28----------
they become easier to deal with that's


---------90:30----------
number one so if you're saying I'm


---------90:31----------
stressed and I'm overwhelmed you can't


---------90:33----------
do anything with that people don't just


---------90:35----------
wake up one day and say I'm on


---------90:37----------
overwhelmed now done right so if we


---------90:40----------
think about like you know something like


---------90:42----------
therapy what happens is we help people


---------90:44----------
identify the reasons that they're


---------90:46----------
overwhelmed and then it's like we've


---------90:48----------
I've used this analogy before it's like


---------90:50----------
detection in a game right like you have


---------90:52----------
invisible things that are attacking you


---------90:55----------
and that's overwhelmed because remember


---------90:57----------
it's not like quality you don't know


---------90:58----------
what it is all you know is you're taking


---------91:00----------
a shitload of damage every round like I


---------91:03----------
can't see it I don't know I'm


---------91:04----------
overwhelmed but just the dps is through


---------91:06----------
the roof


---------91:07----------
and then once you identify it then you


---------91:09----------
can start to actually like do something


---------91:10----------
like oh there's like this like mob


---------91:12----------
that's here that's attacking me let me


---------91:14----------
like move over this way and then like


---------91:16----------
its effect on you lesson so


---------91:17----------
identification is the first thing


---------91:19----------
noticing is the second thing and this is


---------91:21----------
where we come back to the observer so


---------91:24----------
the more that you can act from the


---------91:25----------
observer the less powerful all of this


---------91:28----------
stuff becomes and so this is where if


---------91:32----------
you can develop a meditative practice go


---------91:34----------
for it I think you should consider


---------91:35----------
getting back into mental health


---------91:36----------
treatment if it's an option that'll help


---------91:38----------
you for it


---------91:39----------
then also give yourself some time I


---------91:40----------
think three three months of playing like


---------91:42----------
runescape is not that bad


---------91:44----------
I mean not to say that you know it's


---------91:47----------
good or that it's unacceptable I'm sure


---------91:48----------
there are people who have been playing


---------91:49----------
group scared for seven years and I'm an


---------91:51----------
accomplished anything and you know


---------91:52----------
comparison and stuff is bad but I'm just


---------91:53----------
saying like give yourself some time and


---------91:55----------
cut yourself some slack


---------91:56----------
it's April kovat is going on anyway like


---------91:57----------
you're not gonna finish your semester


---------91:59----------
I'd say take some time to take care of


---------92:01----------
yourself and work work on yourself like


---------92:04----------
your goal is to like repair damage


---------92:06----------
between now and the fall of next year if


---------92:09----------
you need to apply for something consider


---------92:11----------
applying for something but basically


---------92:13----------
take care of yourself get get rid of the


---------92:15----------
depression you know or handle that try


---------92:18----------
to grow the observer try to notice your


---------92:20----------
fears and then try to you know get get


---------92:23----------
yourself ready by like August if you


---------92:27----------
want to I mean I'm tempted that I'm


---------92:29----------
actually tempted to start writing


---------92:30----------
letters to people


---------92:32----------
is a psychiatrist to let them just play


---------92:34----------
video games for like a month


---------92:35----------
at home like just give them just like a


---------92:37----------
you know burn out Eve thoughts questions


---------92:45----------
[Music]


---------92:55----------
yes I mean I'm still feeling like I


---------93:00----------
don't want to go back it's fine


---------93:05----------
so I'm sort of in a state of like okay


---------93:07----------
what do I do about that I got you so you


---------93:09----------
don't do anything about that right now


---------93:11----------
okay right so you don't have to make


---------93:13----------
that decision today and you don't even


---------93:14----------
have to make it a month from now like


---------93:16----------
you make it and if it's too late and you


---------93:17----------
missed the deadline then you miss the


---------93:18----------
deadline whatever what I'm saying is


---------93:21----------
that like you're it's gonna be really


---------93:22----------
hard for you to make so like do you


---------93:24----------
acknowledge that your mind is irrational


---------93:26----------
right now so do you want to be making


---------93:28----------
decisions with this mind no there you go


---------93:32----------
that's why I'm saying like for a couple


---------93:34----------
months just focus on yourself and like


---------93:36----------
try to heal and try to get into a better


---------93:37----------
place and then though the answers about


---------93:40----------
what you do with your career and stuff


---------93:41----------
like that like this is the big problem


---------93:43----------
if you plan like they say like okay


---------93:45----------
should I go back to school should I


---------93:46----------
switch careers like to forget all of


---------93:47----------
that that's all that sheet isn't


---------93:48----------
unimportant actually right now the


---------93:50----------
important thing is that your instrument


---------93:52----------
is miscalibrated you're a scientist and


---------93:55----------
if you don't like tear your scale at the


---------93:57----------
beginning like how are all of your


---------94:01----------
experiments gonna be pretty exactly


---------94:04----------
it's the first thing that you should do


---------94:06----------
is just tear your scale right tear is ta


---------94:11----------
re by the way it's calibrate so you've


---------94:14----------
got a calibrate first and then we don't


---------94:16----------
think about it this way we don't give


---------94:17----------
ourselves time to heal we don't give


---------94:19----------
ourselves we just say like oh I'm a


---------94:20----------
failure like yeah so like deal with your


---------94:22----------
emotional you know


---------94:25----------
aftermath first and give yourself some


---------94:29----------
time to heal play some ruse or enscape


---------94:31----------
man go for it you know but like don't


---------94:33----------
just do runescape for 18 hours a day


---------94:36----------
like find a therapist spend some time


---------94:38----------
meditating you know it sounds like you


---------94:40----------
watch the marked streams and stuff so


---------94:41----------
continue doing that I'd consider reading


---------94:44----------
in your case meditations by Mark


---------94:46----------
sir alias have you ever rabbit do you


---------94:48----------
like to read yes so read meditations by


---------94:51----------
Marcus Aurelius right there it's like a


---------94:55----------
99 cent thing you can get on Amazon I


---------94:57----------
like to read hard copies of stuff it's


---------94:59----------
free because it was written like five


---------95:00----------
thousand years ago or something or like


---------95:02----------
a thousand or two thousand years ago so


---------95:03----------
it's in the public domain but you know


---------95:07----------
read a little bit and learn a little bit


---------95:09----------
and grow a little bit and give yourself


---------95:11----------
time to like heal from the damage and


---------95:13----------
understand that your instrument is not


---------95:15----------
calibrated or healthy right now so any


---------95:17----------
of the decisions this is where people


---------95:18----------
like this is the problem as they get


---------95:20----------
into this self-fulfilling prophecy if


---------95:21----------
you you try to move forward and you


---------95:23----------
it up because you're just not ready to


---------95:25----------
move you've got two broken legs and you


---------95:27----------
try to get up and you fall down again


---------95:29----------
and then it reinforces the idea that


---------95:31----------
you're a failure and then you try to get


---------95:33----------
up again and then you still fall down


---------95:36----------
because your legs are broken and then


---------95:38----------
you try again and you try again and the


---------95:40----------
more you try the more it becomes true


---------95:44----------
that you were a failure and then you


---------95:46----------
wind up stuck because at this point


---------95:48----------
instead of one incident you have a dozen


---------95:50----------
instruments in you have a dozen data


---------95:54----------
points and then your mind which believes


---------95:57----------
that wants to discard good data now now


---------95:59----------
it's it's one thing for you to be able


---------96:00----------
to see okay I have 12 years of successes


---------96:03----------
in one year of failure but once you have


---------96:05----------
12 years of successes in 12 years for


---------96:07----------
failure of failure that becomes a way


---------96:09----------
harder battle to win even rationally so


---------96:14----------
give yourself time to heal first because


---------96:15----------
otherwise you're gonna convince yourself


---------96:18----------
and you're gonna be true you're gonna be


---------96:19----------
right that you are a failure thoughts


---------96:23----------
questions before we wrap up that make


---------96:24----------
sense yeah that makes perfect sense I'm


---------96:27----------
sorry I couldn't transform your life but


---------96:29----------
that doesn't really happen yeah it makes


---------96:32----------
sense okay well good luck man yeah thank


---------96:36----------
you you have any assistly any clothes I


---------96:38----------
don't mean to end things abruptly but


---------96:39----------
that's sort of my schpeel no I mean we


---------96:43----------
touched on everything that I want to


---------96:44----------
touch on since yeah it was it's helpful


---------96:48----------
it's all let's meditate actually


---------96:50----------
oh yeah yeah so sorry go ahead it's the


---------96:52----------
things we do here isn't it


---------96:57----------
yeah it's it's good to talk about it


---------97:00----------
again and yeah last thing last concrete


---------97:06----------
thing that you should do is have a


---------97:07----------
conversation with your parents that's


---------97:10----------
gonna be emotionally hard right but you


---------97:14----------
need to ask them I would ask them


---------97:17----------
because I think the reason you don't


---------97:18----------
have the conversation is because you're


---------97:19----------
afraid of what they're gonna say there's


---------97:22----------
a part of you that knows that until you


---------97:23----------
talk to even though you believe that


---------97:25----------
they think you're a piece of


---------97:26----------
there's a part of you that's holding on


---------97:28----------
to hope that they're gonna say something


---------97:30----------
hopeful and there's a part of you that


---------97:31----------
it's I don't know how else to describe


---------97:33----------
this but it's so hard to hear their


---------97:37----------
positivity towards you right now that's


---------97:40----------
yeah that's almost exactly I was gonna


---------97:42----------
say is like there's the part that does


---------97:43----------
it wants to hear though yeah but you've


---------97:46----------
got to do that right so like it can be a


---------97:49----------
simple conversation I wouldn't have a


---------97:50----------
drink while you're doing it but you can


---------97:52----------
just say you know what do you guys what


---------97:54----------
do you guys think about this last year


---------97:56----------
I'd love to get your thoughts and then


---------98:00----------
you can share with them like this is how


---------98:01----------
the suit last year is gone for me and


---------98:03----------
then they're gonna always look forward


---------98:05----------
don't worry about looking forward or


---------98:06----------
have you found a job are you applying


---------98:08----------
for a job just to ask them like what


---------98:09----------
they think about your situation


---------98:11----------
you'll be surprised if you can get the


---------98:12----------
ball rolling it's gonna like the


---------98:14----------
conversations gonna go on its own


---------98:15----------
getting it started is really the hardest


---------98:17----------
part but and that too is like it's hard


---------98:21----------
to do so you just think about that a


---------98:22----------
little bit but I think right now you're


---------98:25----------
you're trying to make decisions and move


---------98:27----------
forward when you've got all this


---------98:28----------
like you're encumbered so you've got on


---------98:31----------
burden all that and then becomes way


---------98:33----------
easier you'll be back to where you are


---------98:34----------
as a key


---------98:35----------
okay okay your meditation let's think


---------98:41----------
have you seen triphasic breathing yeah


---------98:46----------
okay so let's do that


---------98:48----------
so I'm gonna teach you how to breathe so


---------98:52----------
I want you to sit up straight okay and


---------98:58----------
[Music]


---------99:00----------
okay so I want you to first observe the


---------99:04----------
breath in your chest and now I want you


---------99:12----------
to focus on your stomach


---------99:21----------
and as you breathe in I want you to push


---------99:23----------
your stomach out like expand your


---------99:27----------
stomach and suck the air down into your


---------99:30----------
abdomen and notice that as you breathe


---------99:37----------
out huh sorry I have a focus being


---------99:41----------
stupid in my head Oh be stupid in your


---------99:44----------
head go for him


---------99:45----------
let the focus go and then as you breathe


---------99:50----------
out notice that your stomach contracts


---------99:56----------
pulls in


---------100:03----------
so you can just focus on the sensation


---------100:06----------
of belly moving out and belly moving in


---------100:09----------
or you can visualize your belly button


---------100:14----------
or navel moving away from your spine


---------100:16----------
during inhalation and then pulling


---------100:20----------
towards your spine during exhalation


---------100:37----------
you can really push it all the way out


---------100:40----------
kind of drastically pull it all the way


---------100:43----------
and like suck in your spine to where you


---------100:45----------
can sort of where people would be able


---------100:48----------
to see your rib cages


---------100:58----------
and now what I want you to do is as you


---------101:01----------
belly breathe try to keep your chest


---------101:05----------
somewhat still so there may be an


---------101:10----------
inclination to expand everything when


---------101:12----------
you breathe it breathe in belly in chest


---------101:15----------
try to focus the expansion on your belly


---------101:31----------
during inhalation and exhalation let


---------101:34----------
your chest remain still


---------101:44----------
so this is the first phase of breathing


---------101:47----------
focusing on the abdomen


---------101:54----------
and now we're gonna add the second phase


---------101:56----------
as you breathe in and with a full belly


---------102:00----------
of air then I want you to forcibly


---------102:03----------
expand your chest or sort of


---------102:05----------
intentionally expand your chest


---------102:07----------
afterward and breathe in just a little


---------102:09----------
bit more so phase one is abdomen and


---------102:12----------
phase two breathe in with a full chest


---------102:14----------
of air and then out abdominal breathing


---------102:25----------
chest breathing and out


---------102:35----------
abdomen chest and out


---------102:48----------
and do one more breath


---------102:58----------
and now we'll add phase three so abdomen


---------103:01----------
chest and then raise your shoulders a


---------103:04----------
little bit spike up your shoulders raise


---------103:07----------
your clavicles and breathe just a little


---------103:08----------
bit more and then out it's not going to


---------103:13----------
be very much in that last phase just


---------103:16----------
five percent in with the belly in with


---------103:22----------
the chest and then up with the shoulders


---------103:24----------
and out


---------103:33----------
in with the belly expand the chest raise


---------103:40----------
the shoulders and out now do three


---------103:47----------
breaths just like that


---------103:59----------
let them flow together let your breath


---------104:03----------
be slow


---------104:14----------
if you begin to feel dizziness or


---------104:16----------
lightheaded let your breath pause after


---------104:22----------
the exhalation just sit and then as your


---------104:27----------
respiratory drive awakens breathe again


---------104:42----------
practice for about another minute


---------105:29----------
now go ahead and finish the breath that


---------105:31----------
you're on let your eyes remain closed


---------105:37----------
just feel the person that you are


---------105:51----------
you may have a feeling of failure you


---------105:54----------
may have fear anger shame you notice


---------106:01----------
that those are just pieces of you


---------106:07----------
either underneath that all or even


---------106:11----------
encompassing all those feelings is the


---------106:14----------
real you that all of the fluctuations of


---------106:21----------
the mind and the self happen within the


---------106:25----------
space of you


---------106:46----------
and now sort of feel the outline of your


---------106:49----------
physical form feel your head your


---------106:57----------
shoulders your arms almost like a


---------107:01----------
tracing


---------107:06----------
and notice that the fear and the shame


---------107:08----------
and the anger the failure they exist


---------107:13----------
somewhere within your belly somewhat


---------107:15----------
within your chest somewhere within your


---------107:17----------
throat possibly your head but they


---------107:21----------
mostly live in the torso or the abdomen


---------107:26----------
and now notice for a moment that that is


---------107:28----------
not the whole you that you have arms you


---------107:31----------
have shoulders you have feet you have


---------107:33----------
legs there's no fear or shame there


---------107:38----------
there's no anger or failure


---------107:45----------
but you were not those things


---------107:55----------
and sit with that sensation


---------108:14----------
in the world may victimize you may take


---------108:17----------
advantage of you circumstances could


---------108:21----------
change your job applications could be


---------108:24----------
rejected you may have a grade on your


---------108:32----------
transcript


---------108:34----------
but that none of those things can take


---------108:40----------
you away from this all those things may


---------108:45----------
be true but they are not this and that


---------108:50----------
this is your birthright to be in this


---------108:54----------
place and that this is who you are and


---------108:56----------
you carry this person with you all the


---------108:59----------
time


---------109:09----------
it's not about finding it's about


---------109:11----------
returning


---------109:25----------
now I'll let yourself come back


---------109:33----------
it's April 1st


---------109:37----------
world is falling apart and how do you


---------109:42----------
feel today Zach do anything that day


---------109:49----------
looks kind of chill good kind of chill


---------109:58----------
do you feel like playing runescape oh


---------110:00----------
yeah I noticed that too right notice


---------110:07----------
that desire that impulse


---------110:09----------
don't become attached to it quite yet


---------110:13----------
but notice it's there do not just the


---------110:16----------
negativity anyway any thoughts or


---------110:21----------
questions for you wrap up for the day


---------110:22----------
man


---------110:23----------
no awesome dude I feel better now listen


---------110:27----------
man good luck


---------110:27----------
I really wish you all the best take care


---------110:31----------
of man thank you


---------110:37----------
alrighty


---------110:38----------
oh there we go we forgot to ask him


---------110:43----------
about his um yeah go ahead play


---------110:47----------
runescape


---------110:51----------
we're gonna have to wrap up so we're at


---------110:52----------
our time for today I know people are


---------110:54----------
asking questions and stuff ah how do you


---------110:56----------
get rid of the potential version so


---------110:57----------
that's why I like that's a whole like


---------110:59----------
that's a whole hour about how to deal


---------111:01----------
with potential and how to understand so


---------111:05----------
how do you deal with major life setbacks


---------111:06----------
I think so let's let's answer that


---------111:08----------
question okay so how do you deal with


---------111:10----------
major life setbacks so you recognize


---------111:12----------
that it's a setback you recognize it's a


---------111:14----------
failure that's okay it's not the end of


---------111:16----------
the world that you survive failure and


---------111:19----------
you also notice the damage of the


---------111:22----------
failure so you've got to figure out like


---------111:24----------
where did you take damage and whether


---------111:26----------
they be emotions whether they be you


---------111:30----------
know the house of cards coming down


---------111:32----------
senses of failure being able to unable


---------111:34----------
to move forward you start by identifying


---------111:36----------
all of the ways in which you've taken


---------111:38----------
damage and then you recognize that like


---------111:41----------
all of those problems that you face or


---------111:44----------
all that damage that you've taken is


---------111:46----------
gonna make it so that your mind does not


---------111:48----------
function properly and so then you like


---------111:49----------
even if you try to move forward this is


---------111:51----------
the hard thing is that people who face


---------111:53----------
setbacks they try so hard to rebuild


---------111:56----------
their lives that like you guys know this


---------111:59----------
right you guys actually try really hard


---------112:01----------
you struggle very very hard to like not


---------112:03----------
plays runescape it's not that you're not


---------112:05----------
trying it's just that you're not


---------112:07----------
succeeding and you don't no one sees the


---------112:10----------
effort but you feel the effort like in


---------112:12----------
moments you feel the effort so intensely


---------112:15----------
so intensely and so the problem is not


---------112:18----------
one of lack of trying it's not that you


---------112:20----------
guys are actually lazy it's just that


---------112:23----------
you guys are using an instrument that


---------112:26----------
like is not functioning properly so the


---------112:30----------
way to deal with a setback is not like


---------112:31----------
positive thinking you can do it buddy


---------112:34----------
know it's to recognize okay what what


---------112:38----------
within me is broken


---------112:39----------
what within me is busted what have I


---------112:44----------
learned from this experience like am I


---------112:46----------
scared of ever trying so be it recognize


---------112:48----------
that see that be like okay how do I deal


---------112:51----------
with that like let me just see that


---------112:52----------
thing and let me carry it with me when


---------112:55----------
you go to the job applicant for a job


---------112:57----------
interview for example and you feel like


---------113:00----------
you're not gonna get it


---------113:01----------
you don't like suppress that part you


---------113:03----------
don't say


---------113:04----------
like Oh like there's no use in going


---------113:05----------
because if you suppress it that's what


---------113:07----------
happens it actually takes control it


---------113:10----------
takes control through suppression it


---------113:13----------
exerts its influence in the subconscious


---------113:15----------
and then prevents you from acting so you


---------113:17----------
got to bring it to the conscious notice


---------113:20----------
it and then like say you to it


---------113:22----------
right you say okay


---------113:24----------
fine you don't say you can say you say


---------113:27----------
okay you're a dog that has been really


---------113:28----------
really frustrated with my whole


---------113:30----------
situation fine you think we're gonna be


---------113:32----------
a failure maybe you're right maybe


---------113:34----------
you're wrong I'm gonna let you be where


---------113:36----------
you are and I'm gonna go ahead and go to


---------113:37----------
the job interview anyway and I'm gonna


---------113:39----------
do the best job that I can do it let it


---------113:45----------
be with you accept it and move forward


---------113:49----------
don't let it control you and you say


---------113:52----------
like oh just don't let it control me


---------113:53----------
like how do you not let it control you


---------113:55----------
you let it not control you by accepting


---------113:58----------
it because so far you haven't accepted


---------114:00----------
it and it controls you all the time


---------114:02----------
acceptance leads to freedom so


---------114:05----------
Alcoholics Anonymous is the most is the


---------114:08----------
best evidence-based treatment to get rid


---------114:10----------
of alcoholism there's a great


---------114:12----------
meta-analysis about this recently I


---------114:14----------
think from the Cochrane Collaboration


---------114:15----------
in the first law I mean I don't agree


---------114:18----------
with everything around Alcoholics


---------114:19----------
Anonymous I think I don't really I do a


---------114:21----------
different kind of thing and I tend to be


---------114:22----------
pretty effective but their first thing


---------114:24----------
is that they acknowledge that they're


---------114:26----------
powerless in the face of alcohol it's


---------114:29----------
like how on earth does that work like


---------114:30----------
even if you don't agree with Alcoholics


---------114:31----------
Anonymous or you think there are


---------114:33----------
different ways to do it


---------114:34----------
their first step is to acknowledge that


---------114:39----------
they're powerless in this in the face of


---------114:42----------
this so they cede control and thereby


---------114:46----------
get success she's really weird but


---------114:50----------
there's like actually scientific data


---------114:52----------
that suggests that that psychological


---------114:55----------
principle which by the way is what would


---------114:57----------
though has been teaching or taught a


---------114:59----------
couple thousand years ago but this


---------115:01----------
started teaching it a couple thousand


---------115:02----------
years ago even before but the so like


---------115:04----------
what those teachers were essentially


---------115:05----------
Yogi's right so if you call that


---------115:08----------
Hinduism or not that's up to you I think


---------115:10----------
Hinduism is sort of a Western construct


---------115:12----------
but people have been saying that like in


---------115:14----------
India and China for thousands of years


---------115:16----------
and along comes


---------115:18----------
and even Christianity says that an a a


---------115:21----------
sort of encapsulate that concept and


---------115:25----------
then people take like this


---------115:26----------
neurobiological addiction to alcohol and


---------115:29----------
there's somehow a are able to overcome


---------115:31----------
it through that concept so acceptance of


---------115:34----------
the thing actually leads to liberation


---------115:42----------
outcome absolutely
