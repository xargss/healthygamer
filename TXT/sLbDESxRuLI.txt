---------00:00----------
so a couple of things guys today is a


---------00:02----------
very exciting


---------00:03----------
day because we're launching our uh


---------00:06----------
coaching platform to the public to the


---------00:09----------
pubs


---------00:10----------
the plebs the noobs so


---------00:13----------
just a quick explanation about what


---------00:16----------
coaches are and what they aren't so


---------00:17----------
they're


---------00:18----------
you know they're people from they're you


---------00:21----------
guys


---------00:22----------
who've said hey i want to help other


---------00:24----------
gamers and or


---------00:26----------
i guess we've even expanded beyond


---------00:27----------
gamers now but


---------00:29----------
you know i want to help noobs let's call


---------00:30----------
let's call it that


---------00:32----------
and uh they um


---------00:35----------
so i train them for a few months and


---------00:37----------
then we kind of like go through


---------00:39----------
you know understanding other people how


---------00:40----------
to talk how to listen and what they


---------00:42----------
really try to help you do is help you


---------00:44----------
understand yourself better


---------00:45----------
and once you understand yourself you can


---------00:47----------
like do more of the things that you want


---------00:48----------
to do so it's my belief that


---------00:50----------
part of the reason that we're stuck is


---------00:52----------
because you guys know what you need to


---------00:53----------
do but you get you can't figure out how


---------00:54----------
to do it


---------00:56----------
like you know what you should be doing


---------00:57----------
but like you can't do the things that


---------00:59----------
you should do so why is that


---------01:01----------
and so our coaching program is really


---------01:02----------
developed to like help people understand


---------01:04----------
themselves because like once you


---------01:05----------
understand


---------01:06----------
you know once you understand the


---------01:08----------
controls then


---------01:10----------
it becomes so much easier to play the


---------01:11----------
game okay but let's


---------01:13----------
let's get into the league league exparts


---------01:21----------
yo how's everybody doing today


---------01:24----------
good how about you okay good so you guys


---------01:27----------
are a bunch of like league experts


---------01:31----------
something like that that's awesome right


---------01:35----------
um can we and we're talking a little bit


---------01:38----------
today about like


---------01:38----------
league positivity and toxicity


---------01:43----------
is that right yep do you guys want to


---------01:46----------
talk about something else


---------01:49----------
it's your show or your uh your stream


---------01:53----------
yeah but i i never figure out what we


---------01:55----------
talk about it's usually the guests who


---------01:56----------
determine


---------01:57----------
i know it's kind of weird right it's the


---------01:59----------
first thing i'll ask people is like


---------02:01----------
what do you want to talk about today i


---------02:03----------
see so you gave us a topic but then we


---------02:05----------
don't actually have to talk about the


---------02:06----------
topic


---------02:07----------
not if y'all don't want to i mean i


---------02:09----------
think that's why we assembled this


---------02:10----------
particular group of people but


---------02:12----------
ultimately if you guys so y'all are the


---------02:14----------
experts right


---------02:16----------
so you guys know what our community


---------02:18----------
needs and what you guys need and if you


---------02:20----------
all want to talk about something else


---------02:21----------
that's


---------02:22----------
cool


---------02:26----------
i mean if something comes up and


---------02:28----------
whatever happens happens yeah absolutely


---------02:29----------
buddy


---------02:30----------

---------02:34----------

and i play top


---------04:18----------
you know what this sounded like what you


---------04:21----------
know like uh


---------04:23----------
when you go to like those sharing


---------04:24----------
circles when they talk about like


---------04:25----------
addiction and they get like the


---------04:26----------
alcoholic yeah yeah yeah


---------04:28----------
it's like my name is danny lee i'm 27


---------04:30----------
and i


---------04:31----------
play league of legends


---------04:35----------
dr casey you're damn right


---------04:38----------
you guys see how you fell right into


---------04:39----------
that trap i was like we could talk about


---------04:42----------
whatever you want to and it's like a


---------04:43----------
share circle at the beginning of an aaa


---------04:45----------
meeting


---------04:48----------
my name is you said it's it's chris or


---------04:52----------
search searches yeah so search has is


---------04:56----------
actually uh my name backwards


---------04:57----------
so chris e with the z but uh that's how


---------05:01----------
people call me so i just stuck with it


---------05:02----------
searches


---------05:03----------
yeah so search has this like i'm a i'm a


---------05:06----------
singe


---------05:07----------
spammer pretty much yeah


---------05:10----------
the only champion i know to play yeah so


---------05:13----------
you guys um


---------05:14----------
so let me just kind of dive right in and


---------05:16----------
danny that's hilarious man


---------05:18----------
so you guys mentioned earlier that that


---------05:20----------
you know search has kind of apologized


---------05:22----------
for losing a game right


---------05:25----------
um and then and then boy boy was like no


---------05:28----------
man it's not your fault


---------05:29----------
it's that other [ __ ] noobs fault


---------05:32----------
right so we get to we get to the


---------05:34----------
beginning of league which is like what's


---------05:36----------
it like


---------05:37----------
when you blame a teammate like why does


---------05:39----------
that happen like what what do y'all


---------05:40----------
think about that


---------05:45----------
i think it's pretty natural reaction


---------05:49----------
for people to look for


---------05:52----------
other reasons outside of themselves


---------05:54----------
whether it's true or not


---------05:57----------
to like you know put a lot of the


---------05:59----------
responsibility or


---------06:00----------
a lot of times it turns out the blame


---------06:02----------
and it happens a lot in league right


---------06:04----------
like um you know someone might have a


---------06:07----------
someone might be playing well all game


---------06:09----------
they might not even make a mistake but


---------06:11----------
someone might just


---------06:12----------
something might go wrong and they might


---------06:13----------
think it's their fault and then they'll


---------06:14----------
start like typing flaming them


---------06:16----------
they'll get mad and just like go off on


---------06:18----------
them and that kind of stuff and i mean


---------06:19----------
it


---------06:20----------
there's so many different situations and


---------06:23----------
and contexts where that kind of happens


---------06:25----------
but i think it's it's like super meta um


---------06:28----------
at least an elite community to just kind


---------06:29----------
of


---------06:30----------
look for reasons to like tier other


---------06:33----------
people


---------06:34----------
especially on your team down um or like


---------06:36----------
find someone to like you know be a


---------06:38----------
scapegoat or blame for whatever happens


---------06:40----------
and


---------06:41----------
i feel like that's kind of like been


---------06:44----------
been been around since like you know i


---------06:46----------
mean it's just like a gaming thing but


---------06:47----------
it's definitely gotten worse over time


---------06:49----------
in the league community i think as well


---------06:52----------
what do you all think about that


---------06:56----------
um sorry i'm glad no no go ahead okay uh


---------07:00----------
i think


---------07:00----------
personally shifting blame is like one of


---------07:03----------
the easier ways to


---------07:06----------
like i don't know it's just something


---------07:10----------
that a lot of people


---------07:11----------
do um and i notice it a lot and i think


---------07:14----------
unless you're at the


---------07:15----------
highest of the highest levels of play


---------07:17----------
nobody ever plays


---------07:19----------
perfectly and it is like


---------07:22----------
from my experience one of the


---------07:25----------
like the worst things that you can do to


---------07:29----------
stop yourself from improving um


---------07:32----------
because i think like instead of looking


---------07:35----------
at what others did wrong


---------07:37----------
you should look at what you did wrong in


---------07:39----------
that certain situation but


---------07:41----------
it's very hard to do in like the


---------07:44----------
in the moment because


---------07:48----------
like something just went wrong the game


---------07:49----------
is potentially lost you have 20 minutes


---------07:51----------
of


---------07:52----------
pain ahead of you playing a game that


---------07:54----------
probably just got lost


---------07:55----------
and like despite that you still have to


---------07:58----------
look at what you did wrong


---------08:00----------
and so i think that's just like


---------08:03----------
difficult to do


---------08:04----------
in that environment especially when


---------08:05----------
everybody else is


---------08:07----------
already sort of tilted what makes it


---------08:10----------
hard to do


---------08:13----------
um


---------08:14----------
[Music]


---------08:16----------
well your ego gets in the way


---------08:20----------
and that that's something that you have


---------08:21----------
to really


---------08:23----------
like be real with yourself about


---------08:26----------
especially in league you'll find that


---------08:28----------
it's much easier to blame others for a


---------08:31----------
play


---------08:32----------
than to blame yourself you guys think


---------08:35----------
that's specific to league


---------08:39----------
no no i think right


---------08:42----------
real life other games it's the same in


---------08:45----------
my opinion


---------08:46----------
yeah so why do we do that so it's like


---------08:49----------
kind of like there's something actually


---------08:50----------
really


---------08:51----------
cool about this is that you guys are


---------08:54----------
talking about something and i can't tell


---------08:55----------
that you guys are talking about me


---------08:58----------
there's ego involved you look for other


---------09:00----------
reasons besides yourself


---------09:02----------
for the failures that you face


---------09:06----------
right which is like this is crazy i


---------09:07----------
never connected these dots until now but


---------09:09----------
i wonder if people can transform their


---------09:11----------
lives by understanding


---------09:14----------
themselves in league because if you guys


---------09:16----------
are saying it applies outside a league


---------09:18----------
like


---------09:18----------
interesting right so i've known plenty


---------09:20----------
of people who are happy to blame their


---------09:22----------
parents their siblings their teachers


---------09:25----------
anyone but yourself


---------09:29----------
yeah that's a good point so when curry


---------09:32----------
like i'm sorry go for it point


---------09:35----------
i was going to say like it it kind of


---------09:37----------
seems like a lot of people


---------09:39----------
i kind of want to see like they lack


---------09:40----------
like perspective i guess


---------09:43----------
like when people get stuck in like a


---------09:45----------
bubble


---------09:46----------
they they think about this one way or


---------09:49----------
they tunnel it and they forget to think


---------09:50----------
about it in different


---------09:52----------
ways or um


---------09:55----------
yeah they just like they're just so


---------09:57----------
tunneled on it and they these same guys


---------09:59----------
just like wake up and get mad every day


---------10:02----------
you know they probably kind of fall into


---------10:03----------
the same routine but they don't really


---------10:05----------
try to actively switch it up so


---------10:08----------
i feel like it's hard to change right


---------10:10----------
you just it's really easy to fall into


---------10:12----------
you know do the same thing every day


---------10:17----------
yeah so


---------10:18----------
how does one so you guys used a couple


---------10:20----------
of terms which i think it's important to


---------10:22----------
kind of explore


---------10:23----------
one is ego and the other is losing


---------10:26----------
perspective


---------10:27----------
so what would you guys say like what is


---------10:29----------
when kareem says ego what do you all


---------10:31----------
think he means


---------10:37----------
ego you just don't want to be seen as


---------10:38----------
like weak or worse than other people


---------10:41----------
you don't want to be seen as weak or


---------10:45----------
worse than


---------10:46----------
other people do you guys


---------10:52----------
problem i encounter a lot in league is


---------10:54----------
that


---------10:55----------
people will automatically like they


---------10:58----------
really don't like to get blamed


---------11:01----------
on i guess like um


---------11:04----------
he's how do i work this um


---------11:09----------
you give after me on this point let's so


---------11:12----------
can anybody help danny


---------11:14----------
out wait wha


---------11:17----------
would you you said they don't like to


---------11:18----------
get blamed on


---------11:21----------
yeah like they they hate being the


---------11:23----------
victim they hate


---------11:24----------
feeling like weak or like bad yeah yeah


---------11:28----------
yeah um yeah i think


---------11:31----------
it's it i feel like i it's kind of like


---------11:35----------
[Music]


---------11:37----------
i guess one just immediate way to put it


---------11:39----------
is like it's like you have like


---------11:40----------
two junglers and like they're fighting


---------11:42----------
over like this finite resource which is


---------11:44----------
like scuttle crabs


---------11:46----------
and like usually two spawn one on each


---------11:49----------
side of the map and like


---------11:50----------
you know one jungler can like go for one


---------11:51----------
the other can go for another or like


---------11:52----------
they can contest the same one


---------11:54----------
and a lot of times especially since it


---------11:56----------
was introduced like


---------11:57----------
you'll have a lot of junglers like like


---------11:59----------
mental boom because


---------12:00----------
they want to go for one and then like


---------12:02----------
whatever the situation is like whether


---------12:04----------
they don't have


---------12:04----------
priority in lanes they can't get help


---------12:06----------
from their team or they have


---------12:08----------
worse like early game champions on your


---------12:09----------
team like they'll just over they'll over


---------12:11----------
force it or if they don't get it or


---------12:12----------
whatever they'll just be like all right


---------12:13----------
we lost like the game's over when it's


---------12:15----------
literally like you know it's worth like


---------12:16----------
100 gold like a bit of exp like it's not


---------12:18----------
it doesn't really matter that much


---------12:19----------
in the grand scheme of like a whole


---------12:21----------
league of legends game


---------12:23----------
but i've had people like literally leave


---------12:25----------
my like the game at like three minutes


---------12:27----------
in


---------12:27----------
so many times because they like didn't


---------12:29----------
get scuttle crap or whatever or they


---------12:30----------
like they felt like someone like screwed


---------12:32----------
them over


---------12:33----------
and it's just kind of like that's like a


---------12:35----------
microcosm of like what happens


---------12:37----------
all the time in league which is like


---------12:38----------
yeah if like if like you feel like


---------12:40----------
you're


---------12:41----------
the thing that you cared about the most


---------12:43----------
or like your personal strength or like


---------12:45----------
your ability to carry or like be the


---------12:46----------
hero


---------12:47----------
or like you know whatever objective that


---------12:49----------
you had in mind or


---------12:50----------
you know if that if that gets derailed


---------12:52----------
because of someone's else or because


---------12:54----------
because you think it is or you just want


---------12:56----------
to blame someone else it kind of just


---------12:58----------
like breeds like kind of like a


---------13:01----------
negative like outburst and like some


---------13:03----------
toxic behavior and stuff like that and i


---------13:05----------
mean i've


---------13:06----------
seen it a lot over the years and in like


---------13:08----------
different forms and stuff like that


---------13:10----------
um but yeah people definitely don't want


---------13:12----------
to like


---------13:13----------
you know feel like they can't like


---------13:17----------
be like the like they want to be like a


---------13:19----------
single-player game where like they're


---------13:20----------
it's like their story and stuff like


---------13:21----------
that


---------13:22----------
and if anything happens and they can


---------13:24----------
find a reason that like it wasn't


---------13:26----------
that that stopped them from doing that


---------13:28----------
in the way they wanted like they'll just


---------13:29----------
they'll just like


---------13:30----------
you know go off on people and i don't


---------13:32----------
know obviously it's


---------13:33----------
it's a little different in each


---------13:35----------
situation but i feel like


---------13:36----------
i see that quite often


---------13:40----------
what did you guys hear from voyboy's


---------13:42----------
story what do you think are the


---------13:43----------
important


---------13:44----------
points from his example


---------13:48----------
i think people just don't like to admit


---------13:52----------
their mistakes so though like you i


---------13:54----------
think he was mentioning like how


---------13:56----------
people like to force things and um


---------13:59----------
you know it's not um what do you call


---------14:02----------
it's not favorable for


---------14:04----------
to like follow up with whatever the


---------14:05----------
person is trying to do


---------14:07----------
because you can end up losing more like


---------14:09----------
um


---------14:10----------
sometimes you know i'm top lane and my


---------14:13----------
jungler wants to gank


---------14:14----------
like tower dive and if i commit to it i


---------14:17----------
know i'm gonna die also


---------14:18----------
so is it it's better to just let him die


---------14:20----------
than have me die


---------14:22----------
and at that at that point the jungler


---------14:24----------
gets really mad saying oh how come you


---------14:25----------
didn't commit with me


---------14:27----------
uh you suck and then he starts blaming


---------14:28----------
me for losing the game and then


---------14:30----------
it's the whole game he just type scenes


---------14:32----------
like oh you suck this guy


---------14:33----------
top gap everything and it's just chopped


---------14:36----------
one


---------14:36----------
to do oh they say like top gap like


---------14:39----------
there's a top difference like the other


---------14:40----------
players better than you


---------14:41----------
oh got it yeah okay


---------14:45----------
so i got something kind of bizarre to


---------14:47----------
say


---------14:48----------
what if i told you guys so like you guys


---------14:49----------
are talking about basically like this


---------14:51----------
principle in league where


---------14:52----------
something relatively minor goes wrong


---------14:54----------
right like let's say he dives the top


---------14:56----------
tower and he dies and you don't


---------14:58----------
die with him and what he wanted more


---------14:59----------
than anything else is you to die with


---------15:01----------
him because now that you haven't died


---------15:02----------
with him we're going to lose the game


---------15:05----------
which is a [ __ ] up logic for it's in


---------15:06----------
its own way


---------15:08----------
but and then avoid boy was kind of


---------15:10----------
talking about


---------15:11----------
scuttle which is like you know you lose


---------15:13----------
your scuttle and you really wanted that


---------15:14----------
scuttle like that was supposed to be


---------15:15----------
your scuttle


---------15:17----------
and it's not your scuttle now and then


---------15:19----------
you like kind of throw in the towel


---------15:21----------
right what if i told you guys that


---------15:22----------
that's not restricted to leak


---------15:24----------
what if i were to say that i think half


---------15:26----------
the problem with the people who


---------15:27----------
feel stuck in life and join our


---------15:29----------
community is because they throw in the


---------15:31----------
towel because something didn't go their


---------15:33----------
way


---------15:36----------
yep sounds about right makes sense i


---------15:38----------
agree


---------15:40----------
right so like what do we do about that


---------15:41----------
like this is actually really bizarre


---------15:43----------
because i think what you guys


---------15:44----------
y'all are using league terminology but


---------15:46----------
what i'm hearing you guys talk about is


---------15:48----------
people that i work with


---------15:51----------
right they had something so like let's


---------15:53----------
try to understand


---------15:55----------
what is it that makes like why do people


---------15:58----------
do this like how does that


---------16:01----------
work in their mind where


---------16:05----------
i wanted to scuttle and i didn't get it


---------16:07----------
so [ __ ] everyone


---------16:09----------
and most of all [ __ ] me i'm gonna end in


---------16:12----------
real life


---------16:17----------
so that's what we do right we int in


---------16:19----------
real life too


---------16:21----------
we self-sabotage i gotta be on a test


---------16:24----------
[ __ ] it i'm never going to class again


---------16:26----------
they literally throw they throw they


---------16:29----------
take their gpa and they toss it out the


---------16:31----------
window


---------16:35----------
which is really kind of bizarre but the


---------16:37----------
really thing that i didn't really think


---------16:39----------
that we were going to get here


---------16:40----------
but i think bizarrely you guys may have


---------16:42----------
an answer to transform


---------16:45----------
the lives of thousands of people


---------16:48----------
if you guys can figure out why do people


---------16:50----------
do this in league


---------16:56----------
i think people have a certain like idea


---------16:59----------
and a certain mindset before even


---------17:01----------
getting into a game of league when they


---------17:02----------
decide to queue up


---------17:04----------
for example if you're going to play a


---------17:06----------
really aggressive champion


---------17:07----------
you have a way of thinking how the lane


---------17:10----------
is going to play out or how


---------17:11----------
the matchup is going to play out and


---------17:13----------
sometimes it just doesn't go your way


---------17:16----------
and then depending on your mental


---------17:19----------
you can either


---------17:23----------
like improve on it see what happened


---------17:24----------
wrong avoid it in the future


---------17:26----------
and then in the moment adapt to the


---------17:28----------
situation and see how you can play from


---------17:30----------
behind


---------17:31----------
or do what i think is the easy way out


---------17:34----------
and just


---------17:35----------
self sabotage [ __ ] everything i'm just


---------17:36----------
gonna end


---------17:39----------
so kareem said these are your three


---------17:41----------
options what would you guys


---------17:42----------
say to that


---------17:46----------
damn options suck


---------17:49----------
yeah um rick i mean i think it's just


---------17:52----------
like


---------17:53----------
i want to get back to the thing called


---------17:54----------
perspective like yep


---------17:56----------
i think maybe it's like


---------18:00----------
most people get mad like it's all they


---------18:02----------
know they haven't like experienced much


---------18:04----------
else


---------18:05----------
like to them like league is everything


---------18:08----------
right


---------18:08----------
but they lose this game like they're


---------18:09----------
losing everything but like


---------18:11----------
you know some things aren't how much


---------18:14----------
value are going to put on losing


---------18:15----------
league of legends games just one league


---------18:17----------
of legends game unless you're like you


---------18:18----------
know pro play where everything is


---------18:20----------
on the line like how much is this one


---------18:23----------
loss really worth you know like maybe


---------18:26----------
you could step outside like live life a


---------18:27----------
little bit and like there's


---------18:29----------
there's more things in life than you


---------18:31----------
know at one legal legislative


---------18:35----------
so i think yeah so danny


---------18:39----------
i feel like theoretically that's true


---------18:42----------
but that's not how people treat it


---------18:46----------
right so we can say whatever we want to


---------18:48----------
we can say oh like


---------18:49----------
depression is bad it shouldn't be there


---------18:53----------
and but it's true and kind of going back


---------18:56----------
to kareem's like okay either you learn


---------18:58----------
from it


---------18:59----------
you rage like those are the two options


---------19:03----------
kareem's


---------19:04----------
right so i think our question so you


---------19:07----------
guys have done a fantastic job of laying


---------19:08----------
out okay so people lack perspective


---------19:11----------
people can learn from it or they can


---------19:13----------
rage the question is


---------19:15----------
why why do they do like if i it's like


---------19:18----------
let me give you guys a choice column is


---------19:20----------
learn from your mistakes


---------19:21----------
column b is let your mistakes determine


---------19:24----------
the rest of your life


---------19:26----------
and so it's a no-brainer like no no i'm


---------19:28----------
going to pick column a


---------19:29----------
i want i want to learn from my mistakes


---------19:32----------
but it's not actually what people do


---------19:34----------
people [ __ ] pick column b all the


---------19:36----------
time


---------19:38----------
so what on earth do they do that it's


---------19:40----------
like it's just a scuttle man like why


---------19:42----------
are you


---------19:44----------
getting bent out of shape because once


---------19:45----------
you start hinting then you're actually


---------19:47----------
gonna lose


---------19:49----------
so why fulfilling prophecy you're damn


---------19:52----------
right it is so why do people choose


---------19:54----------
the clearly crappier option


---------19:58----------
because it's easier sorry oh yes


---------20:02----------
i think it's yeah it's easier on us i


---------20:03----------
think it's they also want to bring other


---------20:04----------
people down to their level


---------20:06----------
because like for example with what


---------20:09----------
shifter said


---------20:10----------
he said um when uh


---------20:13----------
you know they they think it's just a


---------20:14----------
league game so


---------20:16----------
they're gonna leave how's it gonna


---------20:17----------
affect them but when they leave it also


---------20:19----------
affects their teammates


---------20:20----------
because the other like their teammates


---------20:22----------
they want to win


---------20:23----------
it's not just him getting infected so


---------20:26----------
him leaving


---------20:27----------
also affects the teammates and he


---------20:28----------
probably just wants to bring everyone


---------20:29----------
else down with him


---------20:30----------
or her yep and you guys said it was


---------20:34----------
it's easier what's easier about it


---------20:40----------
i think it's like how they release their


---------20:41----------
anger right like it's not like someone


---------20:43----------
like like


---------20:43----------
a small like a punching bag like they


---------20:46----------
release anger like


---------20:47----------
they see something and then like maybe


---------20:50----------
like just get to like put it out a


---------20:51----------
little bit i don't know


---------20:53----------
so let me ask you guys a question how


---------20:54----------
does it feel to int


---------21:00----------
it feels good in the moment i can say


---------21:02----------
from experience


---------21:04----------
it feels good in the moment you bastard


---------21:08----------
you you can't help but feel bad about it


---------21:12----------
i mean i know some people are so far


---------21:14----------
deep into this downward spiral that


---------21:16----------
they don't feel bad about it and they've


---------21:18----------
kind of become known


---------21:20----------
for doing or this kind of behavior but


---------21:25----------
yeah it definitely feels good at the


---------21:27----------
moment but they're


---------21:28----------
for sure healthier things to do for


---------21:31----------
yourself for the game in the long run


---------21:34----------
yes i'm not so interested in those right


---------21:36----------
because they're they're healthier things


---------21:38----------
for


---------21:39----------
everyone in our community to do right


---------21:42----------
and they don't want to yeah


---------21:46----------
i know what it feels like to be on the


---------21:48----------
receiving end of it


---------21:50----------
how does that feel um


---------21:53----------
honestly like


---------21:57----------
i've i myself and like a lot of people


---------22:01----------
a lot of these guys like we we know how


---------22:03----------
it feels to like


---------22:05----------
be into it whether it's like targeted


---------22:06----------
because we're streaming or because


---------22:08----------
people like don't like us for a reason


---------22:10----------
um or like you know people have


---------22:13----------
people like put like bounties on my head


---------22:15----------
in solo queue and like


---------22:17----------
paid off like booster and stuff just to


---------22:18----------
like just like run it down on my game


---------22:20----------
and like clip the reaction and then be


---------22:22----------
like haha look how like sad he is this


---------22:23----------
kind of stuff


---------22:25----------
it's like when i'm streaming and stuff


---------22:26----------
like obviously trying not to show


---------22:28----------
like how how like annoyed or like


---------22:31----------
upsetting it is but like really like


---------22:33----------
when i when i like have like a stream


---------22:35----------
like like into like three


---------22:36----------
three games or something like that and


---------22:37----------
then and i like barely get to play it's


---------22:39----------
just


---------22:40----------
it really sucks man like it actually is


---------22:41----------
like really


---------22:43----------
over time like over years and like stuff


---------22:45----------
like that it is pretty depressing


---------22:47----------
um just like not really get to do the


---------22:49----------
thing you love and then


---------22:50----------
like like at the way you want to and


---------22:54----------
just have like your experience ruined


---------22:55----------
and like it's just a game right like


---------22:57----------
to a lot of people it's just like oh


---------22:58----------
like these like you know streamers


---------22:59----------
they're just like playing games like why


---------23:01----------
are they like stressed out but like


---------23:02----------
to me like league is like you know it's


---------23:04----------
been my life for like you know 10 years


---------23:06----------
and then just to like have it happen and


---------23:08----------
just like you know have riot do nothing


---------23:10----------
about it


---------23:11----------
so for so long and then just have people


---------23:12----------
like kind of normalize that kind of


---------23:14----------
stuff and


---------23:15----------
you know belittle like when it happens


---------23:18----------
or like justify it or whatever like


---------23:20----------
that kind of i don't know it's it


---------23:22----------
definitely sucks


---------23:24----------
um yeah it definitely sucks a lot um


---------23:27----------
so i don't know i i've tried always


---------23:31----------
just like obviously losing a game by


---------23:35----------
itself


---------23:36----------
feels really shitty for anyone right but


---------23:38----------
then just to like you know


---------23:39----------
put yourself out there and like try your


---------23:41----------
best in a game


---------23:42----------
and just have like someone whether


---------23:44----------
because a play went wrong or they're


---------23:46----------
like you know just trying to like you


---------23:48----------
know get back at someone or


---------23:50----------
whatever their their reasoning it


---------23:51----------
doesn't really matter just to like


---------23:53----------
single-handedly decide like all right


---------23:55----------
like your experience is ruined and


---------23:57----------
you're not you're not gonna get to like


---------23:58----------
play the game that you like and we're


---------24:00----------
gonna just like make this


---------24:02----------
make this one game or this moment or


---------24:03----------
maybe multiple games like feel really


---------24:05----------
shitty


---------24:06----------
uh for you and then you have to like you


---------24:07----------
know be on stream and like


---------24:09----------
you know just do your best to be like


---------24:11----------
well guys sorry this guy's like running


---------24:13----------
it down


---------24:14----------
um you know hopefully next game will be


---------24:16----------
better uh


---------24:17----------
how's everyone's day going like it's


---------24:18----------
just like what what do you what do you


---------24:20----------
do at that point like


---------24:21----------
there's not there's not that many


---------24:22----------
options um but yes


---------24:25----------
it's definitely not a good feeling i


---------24:26----------
guess search as i saw you nodding


---------24:31----------
i relate to like i i'm known for just


---------24:34----------
always being positive and


---------24:36----------
never getting mad at anything but yeah i


---------24:38----------
mean couple times


---------24:39----------
people do in and um same same attitude i


---------24:43----------
have to pretend that


---------24:44----------
it doesn't affect me and i just try to


---------24:47----------
you know tell my community like hey guys


---------24:48----------
well that sucks it's just you know it


---------24:50----------
happens gotta move on next game


---------24:54----------
how does it feel though i mean it pretty


---------24:58----------
much it kills the mood it kills the mood


---------25:00----------
and you kind of just don't want to play


---------25:01----------
anymore


---------25:02----------
but i i do enjoy the game it's just


---------25:05----------
getting losses like that like i don't


---------25:07----------
mind losing


---------25:08----------
yeah losing sucks but you know losing


---------25:12----------
because of a player that's purposely


---------25:13----------
trying to lose the game for you


---------25:15----------
makes the the loss much worse and you


---------25:17----------
just kind of kills the boot to play


---------25:19----------
another game


---------25:21----------
what makes it so much worse


---------25:25----------
i don't think that it just makes you


---------25:28----------
feel um


---------25:30----------
i can't really describe the feeling but


---------25:31----------
it's just you're hostage


---------25:34----------
yeah like you're being held hostage for


---------25:36----------
20 30 minutes


---------25:41----------
can you say more about that uh danny or


---------25:43----------
kareem


---------25:45----------
um yeah because uh i mean usually


---------25:49----------
most of like the bad stuff happens all


---------25:50----------
the negatives that will happen in the


---------25:51----------
first maybe five minutes or so


---------25:53----------
um but a game will always drag on to


---------25:56----------
like minimum


---------25:56----------
15 minutes is when you can early as you


---------25:58----------
can send her now but


---------26:00----------
easily games will just go like 20


---------26:01----------
minutes and you're just trapped there


---------26:02----------
for like 15 20 minutes dealing with it


---------26:04----------
because you can't just leave


---------26:05----------
it's not like a game like like fortnight


---------26:08----------
whatever like whatever


---------26:09----------
if you don't like your teammate you just


---------26:10----------
takes out there's no repercussions


---------26:12----------
really


---------26:12----------
like in the league you're stuck with


---------26:14----------
them and it's a team game you know you


---------26:16----------
need to work with your teammates to


---------26:19----------
progress and if they don't want to work


---------26:21----------
together with you then


---------26:23----------
you know a [ __ ] so that's what i'm


---------26:26----------
looking for right


---------26:27----------
like so danny says so all you guys are


---------26:29----------
saying something at the


---------26:30----------
tail end you'll talk about something and


---------26:33----------
at the end there's some


---------26:34----------
emotionally the [ __ ]


---------26:38----------
what is that right because that's the


---------26:40----------
closest


---------26:42----------
to the authentic what you feel like


---------26:46----------
what is that


---------26:50----------
at the nuts feels like kicking the nuts


---------26:54----------
right so this is something that men do


---------26:56----------
when i ask you guys about feelings


---------26:59----------
you describe physical sensation


---------27:02----------
that's the way that we represent


---------27:04----------
emotions because you can't come up with


---------27:06----------
a word


---------27:08----------
they're words to describe how we feel


---------27:11----------
we call those words emotions


---------27:15----------
sag right so this is actually really


---------27:18----------
fascinating because


---------27:19----------
as a community we've come up for our own


---------27:22----------
vocabulary because we don't know how to


---------27:23----------
use the vocabulary of normal humans


---------27:27----------
right that's what we feel like what is


---------27:29----------
sad it's kind of like sad


---------27:32----------
but it's like i just learned about sag


---------27:36----------
right it's kind of it's like really


---------27:37----------
awesome it's like cool to see us


---------27:40----------
develop our own like


---------27:43----------
language to describe our internal


---------27:45----------
sensations and everyone understands what


---------27:47----------
pepe hands means


---------27:49----------
we all know that feeling


---------27:52----------
right like so what is the feeling


---------27:56----------
what how do you guys feel when someone


---------27:58----------
shows up on your stream


---------28:00----------
first of all how does it feel to have


---------28:01----------
someone putting a bounty


---------28:03----------
on your head like [ __ ]


---------28:07----------
there it is so boy boy keeps on saying


---------28:09----------
like [ __ ] what does that mean


---------28:23----------
um like like me


---------28:26----------
and all of us i guess like we're like


---------28:28----------
pretty positive streamers


---------28:30----------
um like it's like when someone comes up


---------28:32----------
to you like in real life like


---------28:34----------
they like speak like in the face like


---------28:36----------
what's your natural response like maybe


---------28:37----------
freaking you want to fight them right


---------28:39----------
like push them away but like


---------28:41----------
for us like we genuinely try to uphold


---------28:43----------
like


---------28:44----------
you know some sort of like positive


---------28:47----------
environment community


---------28:48----------
so it's like it's very draining for us


---------28:51----------
to like


---------28:52----------
hold it and hold it in because you don't


---------28:53----------
want to step down to their low


---------28:56----------
their level we want you to be better


---------28:58----------
than that


---------28:59----------
yeah so i'm hearing a lot of stuff so oh


---------29:01----------
boy boy i'm going to ask you and i i


---------29:03----------
don't mean to pick on you by the way so


---------29:04----------
i think that


---------29:05----------
the reason that you say like [ __ ] is


---------29:07----------
because i think there's a lot of stuff


---------29:09----------
encompassed under that umbrella


---------29:12----------
so danny talks about it being draining


---------29:16----------
like you know that feeling right where


---------29:17----------
like you you have all these like


---------29:19----------
feelings that come up


---------29:20----------
and you're like if i was a noob


---------29:24----------
i could just let loose


---------29:27----------
but i'm not and so there are parts of


---------29:30----------
myself i think part of the reason that


---------29:32----------
we don't know


---------29:33----------
how to describe our feelings is because


---------29:34----------
we actually take those things and we


---------29:37----------
shove them off into a closet and close


---------29:38----------
the door because you guys are


---------29:40----------
positive streamers and if you show if


---------29:43----------
they see


---------29:45----------
that it works


---------29:48----------
that's just going to increase it yeah


---------29:51----------
um no for sure i mean it's something


---------29:54----------
that i've struggled a lot with over the


---------29:56----------
years like


---------29:57----------
i'm i i did like a


---------30:00----------
like a 10 minute video where i was just


---------30:01----------
like talking to the camera like


---------30:04----------
a few months back and i was just like


---------30:06----------
talking about how horrible


---------30:08----------
like solo queue is and how riot's not


---------30:09----------
doing anything and how like you know


---------30:11----------
like target hinting and like people just


---------30:13----------
running it down like it was one part of


---------30:15----------
it but


---------30:15----------
it was just something that i i just


---------30:17----------
eventually just like need to get off my


---------30:18----------
chest and just like


---------30:19----------
hoping like ryan would do something or


---------30:22----------
the community would like stop


---------30:23----------
enabling um this kind of stuff because


---------30:26----------
like


---------30:28----------
i don't i don't know man like it's


---------30:30----------
pretty hard like


---------30:32----------
i've been i've been playing in like


---------30:33----------
streaming league for like nine years and


---------30:36----------
i guess what just feels kind of bad


---------30:39----------
sometimes is like


---------30:43----------
i guess like i don't know like i feel


---------30:45----------
like i've always tried so hard


---------30:46----------
to like set a good example and like be


---------30:49----------
like


---------30:50----------
a good member of like the scene and the


---------30:52----------
communion stuff and like never like


---------30:54----------
never like ran down on people never just


---------30:56----------
like went off for no reason like always


---------30:58----------
like tried to like


---------30:59----------
show like you know like the best


---------31:01----------
qualities you can like in game and like


---------31:03----------
out of it


---------31:04----------
for like the players and just hope that


---------31:07----------
you know other people could could pick


---------31:10----------
up on that and like and like run with it


---------31:12----------
too and then just to have like you know


---------31:13----------

---------31:18----------
then just


---------31:19----------
to like not be able to play the game


---------31:21----------

---------31:23----------

---------31:25----------
people are just like insulting me and


---------31:27----------

---------31:39----------
yeah but they're like literally


---------31:40----------
controlling like my like actual life


---------31:42----------
like when you're playing a game when


---------31:43----------
you're streaming and stuff


---------31:45----------
you know that's that's what you're doing


---------31:46----------
that's like what that's something that's


---------31:47----------
like who i am basically


---------31:48----------
so i mean yeah it's definitely something


---------31:52----------
that's


---------31:52----------
like weighed down on me for like years


---------31:55----------
now and


---------31:55----------
definitely got like it's been really


---------31:57----------
like the worst


---------31:59----------
um like this year but yeah i i don't


---------32:02----------
really know like


---------32:03----------
what to do about it and like yeah it


---------32:05----------
does i feel like showing like that it


---------32:07----------
affects you or like


---------32:08----------
even like when it's happening being like


---------32:10----------
you know like not just like laughing it


---------32:12----------
off like i don't really know what to do


---------32:13----------
besides just trying to laugh it off even


---------32:15----------
though sometimes it's like


---------32:16----------
pretty hard um you know whenever it's


---------32:18----------
happening and


---------32:20----------
yeah i don't know like i just i just


---------32:22----------
feel like


---------32:24----------
it's it's not really fair i guess and


---------32:27----------
that's when i say


---------32:28----------
like it feels like [ __ ] it's just you


---------32:29----------
know it's just encapsulating


---------32:33----------
that those kind of things over the years


---------32:34----------
i suppose um


---------32:36----------
but yeah can i say something


---------32:40----------
uh i think i'm a bit of an outlier in


---------32:44----------
the way that


---------32:45----------
i handle some situations compared to


---------32:47----------
some of these guys i mean


---------32:49----------
i'm not i don't claim to be like this


---------32:51----------
beacon of positivity


---------32:52----------
i mean like i know what it's like to be


---------32:55----------
watched


---------32:57----------
and to have something happen to you that


---------32:59----------
you couldn't do yourself because you are


---------33:01----------
a streamer


---------33:03----------
and i think that well i just want to say


---------33:06----------
like the way that you guys


---------33:08----------
handle those situations takes so much


---------33:13----------
mental strength it is ridiculous like


---------33:15----------
you you could never understand


---------33:16----------
unless you are put yourself into this


---------33:18----------
situation and like i really


---------33:20----------
commend that and i have so much respect


---------33:22----------
for guys like voyboy shifter searches


---------33:25----------
like for having the mental strength to


---------33:29----------
not do what others do


---------33:33----------
and to not like um have this sort of eye


---------33:36----------
for an eye mentality


---------33:37----------
and that's something that i'm working on


---------33:38----------
myself


---------33:41----------
uh yeah i just want to say like because


---------33:43----------
that video


---------33:44----------
i think was the beginning of something


---------33:47----------
that


---------33:48----------
was like a lot bigger and


---------33:51----------
although like it hasn't really gotten to


---------33:55----------
that point yet where we can


---------33:56----------
say that there has been some like


---------33:59----------
obvious


---------34:00----------
changes in the way that people think i


---------34:02----------
think it is


---------34:03----------
for sure like happening


---------34:07----------
so like i just wanted to say like how


---------34:08----------
much respect i have for for you guys and


---------34:11----------
like to keep going and not to give up i


---------34:14----------
guess


---------34:15----------
yeah thanks man


---------34:18----------
no problem


---------34:22----------
what's it like to hear that from korean


---------34:28----------
it's nice because uh i mean sometimes it


---------34:30----------
feels like we're


---------34:32----------
fighting like a hopeless war is it


---------34:36----------
like there's a reason why you know


---------34:39----------
positive


---------34:40----------
reinforcing streamers kind of died out


---------34:42----------
over the years we've lost a lot of


---------34:44----------
favors like that um so it's


---------34:48----------
definitely nice to know that you know


---------34:49----------
we're at least showing


---------34:51----------
impact or we'll see our efforts


---------34:56----------
why do positive streamers yeah go ahead


---------34:58----------
such as


---------34:59----------
it's it's uh it's definitely uh


---------35:01----------
uplifting and encouraging to keep


---------35:04----------
doing what we're doing um it's you know


---------35:07----------
it's hard


---------35:08----------
to see if we're making a difference or


---------35:10----------
not but you know


---------35:12----------
it's really good to hear feedback from


---------35:14----------
other people


---------35:15----------
you know just encourage us to keep going


---------35:17----------
and um


---------35:22----------
definitely


---------35:28----------
i know this sounds kind of weird but um


---------35:31----------
so kareem said something that was very


---------35:33----------
warm and supportive


---------35:35----------
did anybody find themselves having sort


---------35:37----------
of like a negative reaction towards what


---------35:39----------
he said


---------35:42----------
no not at all


---------35:46----------
no it's something that


---------35:50----------
sorry no go for it


---------35:55----------
i was just gonna say like um


---------36:01----------
i guess yeah what kareem said like the


---------36:03----------
encouragement


---------36:04----------
like you know showing respect like i i


---------36:05----------
guess like there are definitely


---------36:08----------
a lot of people that that do vocalize in


---------36:10----------
that way and like you know


---------36:12----------
do kind of encourage what we've what


---------36:14----------
we've always tried to


---------36:15----------
been doing but i feel like it's


---------36:18----------
the almost feels like the vocal majority


---------36:21----------
in the community kind of drowns it out


---------36:22----------
sometimes so it's like a little easy to


---------36:26----------
not hear those things or not see them or


---------36:28----------
kind of like forget about it


---------36:29----------
when you're when you're kind of faced


---------36:31----------
with like


---------36:32----------
some of the more toxic sides so it


---------36:35----------
definitely


---------36:36----------
feels you know good every time you know


---------36:38----------
someone someone's like hey like


---------36:40----------
you know keep keep up keep up you know


---------36:43----------
what what you've been doing and


---------36:45----------
just trying to set a good example and


---------36:48----------
that kind of stuff so


---------36:49----------
i it definitely feels good


---------36:54----------
can i think for a second yep


---------36:57----------
great you guys have anything else you


---------37:00----------
want to say i i mean uh


---------37:02----------
i feel like i'm sniffing something i'm


---------37:04----------
just i need to package my thoughts but


---------37:05----------
if you guys have more to add


---------37:07----------
i'd love to hear


---------37:20----------
okay


---------37:25----------
so karim you say that you're not like


---------37:27----------
these are the guys


---------37:29----------
right how does it feel to end


---------37:36----------
that's a funny question um


---------37:40----------
in the moment again it does feel good


---------37:42----------
but you know you're not doing the right


---------37:43----------
thing and it feels shitty because


---------37:46----------
like you have people in the chat calling


---------37:48----------
you out for it


---------37:50----------
and then you have this inner conflict of


---------37:52----------
like


---------37:54----------
but everybody else does it why is it bad


---------37:56----------
when i do it


---------37:58----------
and then it's again you have these


---------38:00----------
voices and it's like


---------38:01----------
okay but i'm supposed to be held to a


---------38:03----------
higher standard because i'm a streamer


---------38:05----------
so it's just there's a there's a lot


---------38:07----------
it's it's


---------38:09----------
like you have to balance out a lot of


---------38:10----------
things when you're streaming league of


---------38:11----------
legends


---------38:12----------
and there are a lot of many different


---------38:16----------
things that can get to you kareem does


---------38:18----------
it feel


---------38:18----------
fair to int it does feel fair yes


---------38:22----------
damn right it does yeah


---------38:26----------
what do you guys think about that it's a


---------38:28----------
weird question to ask does it


---------38:29----------
feel fair what do y'all think about that


---------38:37----------
i think it feels fair but it isn't sure


---------38:41----------
yeah why does it feel fair


---------38:44----------
because like what what i'm hearing from


---------38:46----------
from these other guys these


---------38:48----------
positive guys is that it's not fair


---------38:51----------
it feels hopeless it's so exhausting


---------38:54----------
right tiring but hinting is like


---------38:57----------
the opposite of all those things yeah it


---------39:00----------
feels fair


---------39:02----------
it's invigorating


---------39:06----------
right right yeah that's how like how can


---------39:09----------
people do


---------39:10----------
like like boy boy streams for four hours


---------39:12----------
and he's wiped at the end of it


---------39:14----------
these [ __ ] ain't for 12 hours


---------39:15----------
straight and they're still going


---------39:18----------
right it's weird right


---------39:21----------
how do y'all understand that


---------39:26----------
it's like a very personal thing where


---------39:29----------
it's just like you feel like you're


---------39:31----------
giving back what's being dished out to


---------39:32----------
you


---------39:33----------
damn right yeah and what was dish out to


---------39:37----------
you kareem


---------39:39----------
um that same thing what i've been


---------39:42----------
being into yeah so so like in those


---------39:45----------
moments when you in what are you giving


---------39:47----------
back to them


---------39:49----------
well i think the problem is you're not


---------39:51----------
necessarily giving back to the same


---------39:52----------
people


---------39:54----------
when you like when you had a rough game


---------39:56----------
previously


---------39:58----------
and you go into the next one with an


---------39:59----------
inting mindset


---------40:01----------
it's not fair but it feels fair i know


---------40:04----------
but what are you giving back


---------40:05----------
right and who are you giving it back to


---------40:07----------
i agree you're giving something back


---------40:08----------
maybe to the wrong person right you're


---------40:11----------
giving back [ __ ]


---------40:12----------
yeah giving back a horrible experience


---------40:14----------
yeah for sure


---------40:16----------
to who to


---------40:20----------
yourself and to others no i i toss that


---------40:23----------
i'm gonna toss out a word


---------40:24----------
you're giving it back to the universe


---------40:27----------
yeah because the universe [ __ ] gave


---------40:28----------
it to you


---------40:29----------
right right last


---------40:33----------
last game the universe or riot or call


---------40:35----------
it whatever you want to


---------40:36----------
life gave you these shitties


---------40:40----------
these smurfs on the other team and this


---------40:43----------
top gap noob


---------40:44----------
on your team right


---------40:47----------
this afk jungler and so you're gonna


---------40:51----------
you're


---------40:52----------
gonna punch back


---------40:55----------
does that sound like it makes sense


---------40:57----------
sounds about right yeah


---------41:00----------
and so i'm gonna just start talking is


---------41:02----------
that okay


---------41:04----------
yep you guys let me know if i'm like on


---------41:05----------
the right track or the wrong track feel


---------41:06----------
free to jump in if you guys have


---------41:08----------
thoughts or questions first of all thank


---------41:09----------
you guys so much for sharing all this i


---------41:10----------
think it's actually


---------41:12----------
really fascinating um because what i'm


---------41:14----------
actually hearing is not


---------41:15----------
something i'm not really hearing you


---------41:17----------
guys talk about league i'm hearing you


---------41:18----------
guys talk about life


---------41:21----------
which is bizarre but i'm going to start


---------41:23----------
with this idea of like not fair


---------41:26----------
so here you are trying to live a good


---------41:28----------
life


---------41:30----------
and then they're all the shitties


---------41:33----------
in the shitties i don't know why we're


---------41:35----------
not quite sure


---------41:37----------
but maybe we'll figure it out by the end


---------41:39----------
for some reason they do things to you


---------41:41----------
that are like


---------41:42----------
hard and painful and danny used to


---------41:46----------
play as [ __ ] depressing hopeless war


---------41:51----------
right because that's what it feels like


---------41:53----------
to try to be like positive


---------41:55----------
in a game and sometimes that's also what


---------41:57----------
it feels like to be positive


---------41:59----------
in your own life is that you're fighting


---------42:02----------
this like hopeless war


---------42:04----------
against i'm not quite sure what


---------42:07----------
but i think it comes back to the scuttle


---------42:11----------
it comes back to this idea that like you


---------42:12----------
woke up today and you got into a game


---------42:16----------
and you had this idea about what was


---------42:19----------
supposed to happen


---------42:21----------
and somebody took that away from you


---------42:24----------
who took it away from you


---------42:28----------
anyone but yourself it was


---------42:31----------
not enough lane pressure as you guys put


---------42:33----------
it


---------42:34----------
or you know like the other team like


---------42:38----------
having a sm like


---------42:39----------
someone took something away from you and


---------42:42----------
then you get angry


---------42:44----------
and you feel hurt because you had this


---------42:46----------
idea of what you wanted but it's not


---------42:47----------
what they gave you


---------42:49----------
poor boy boy wakes up every day and he's


---------42:50----------
like i love league of legends i used to


---------42:52----------
be pro i like to stream i just want to


---------42:54----------
play this [ __ ] game


---------42:55----------
because i love the game and it's cool


---------42:58----------
like


---------42:58----------
i'm okay losing i'm okay winning


---------43:01----------
i just want to play that's all i want to


---------43:03----------
do if i get crushed i get crushed no big


---------43:06----------
deal


---------43:07----------
i just want to play the game but instead


---------43:10----------
so he has this idea right like he has


---------43:12----------
this expectation


---------43:14----------
that's the word you guys haven't used


---------43:15----------
yet but that's the word i'm gonna toss


---------43:17----------
out is the root of all this


---------43:18----------
hey this expectation it's like i'm gonna


---------43:21----------
queue and i'm gonna get to play league


---------43:22----------
of legends


---------43:23----------
not an unreasonable expectation


---------43:26----------
and then someone someone somewhere out


---------43:28----------
there puts a bounty on his head


---------43:31----------
and then he doesn't get to play that


---------43:34----------
game


---------43:35----------
and i know it's like like kind of apples


---------43:37----------
and oranges and i don't mean to


---------43:39----------
suggest that boyboy's like the guy who


---------43:42----------
you know rages when he


---------43:43----------
loses the scuttle in the first five


---------43:45----------
minutes but there is actually an


---------43:47----------
interesting parallel because like


---------43:49----------
it's about an expectation that gets


---------43:52----------
dashed right and i i think that one is a


---------43:55----------
more


---------43:56----------
far more reasonable expectation but at


---------43:57----------
the end of it i still see an expectation


---------43:59----------
he just doesn't get to play the game and


---------44:01----------
it's not fair


---------44:03----------
now the interesting thing is like when


---------44:05----------
we look at voyboy we can say yeah dude


---------44:07----------
actually you're right it's not fair but


---------44:10----------
the interesting thing


---------44:12----------
is how does the scuttle player feel when


---------44:15----------
he loses the sky


---------44:18----------
it's not fair


---------44:23----------
and so if it's not fair to me it sure as


---------44:26----------
hell isn't going to be fair to you


---------44:29----------
if i'm diving the top tower your ass is


---------44:31----------
coming with me


---------44:34----------
if i'm going to throw you're gonna throw


---------44:35----------
two because i ain't thrown alone


---------44:40----------
and we get to this like idea of i don't


---------44:42----------
know exactly how this turns into like


---------44:44----------
sabotaging but it also is like


---------44:45----------
taking the world with you


---------44:49----------
and and now i'm kind of like a little


---------44:51----------
bit of a loss but i feel like there's


---------44:52----------
something


---------44:53----------
really important about


---------44:57----------
you know making it fair and


---------45:00----------
and sort of this sense that that cream


---------45:02----------
is like yeah it feels fair


---------45:04----------
right like it's like what what i feel


---------45:05----------
about someone who hints


---------45:07----------
you know what i really think describes


---------45:08----------
them as righteous


---------45:11----------
what do you guys think about that


---------45:20----------
i think it makes sense


---------45:23----------
i think you know it's


---------45:28----------
like i mean in the context of league


---------45:29----------
like it's a team game


---------45:31----------
there's like 10 people playing and


---------45:33----------
there's so many factors that determine


---------45:34----------
the results


---------45:35----------
but at the end of the day like if you


---------45:37----------
want to single-handedly decide the


---------45:38----------
result for your whole team


---------45:40----------
you can you could literally just leave


---------45:42----------
the game or


---------45:43----------
you know buy mobi's and run it down mid


---------45:47----------
um so it's like you're taking all the


---------45:49----------
control away from everyone else and


---------45:51----------
like it's it's you have all the control


---------45:54----------
right like you


---------45:55----------
you basically just decided everybody's


---------45:56----------
fate um for better or for worse


---------46:00----------
and so i don't know maybe like


---------46:04----------
i mean you're the expert but that's i


---------46:06----------
don't know maybe that's


---------46:07----------
kind of in parallel with with what


---------46:09----------
you're saying


---------46:11----------
maybe maybe not sir chess what do you


---------46:12----------
think


---------46:15----------
um i honestly i don't know okay


---------46:18----------
but i'm gonna stick with what boy boy


---------46:20----------
said


---------46:23----------
yeah so so i think there's something


---------46:25----------
really important here right so like


---------46:26----------
let's forget about the term


---------46:27----------
righteousness for a second but i think


---------46:29----------
there's something about


---------46:30----------
taking control when control has been


---------46:32----------
taken away from you


---------46:36----------
what do you guys think about that


---------46:41----------
i think somewhere along the way this


---------46:43----------
game stopped being


---------46:45----------
um team focused in the way that people


---------46:48----------
view it and became a lot more individual


---------46:50----------
focused


---------46:52----------
uh when people queue up and that kind of


---------46:54----------
removed the idea that sometimes


---------46:57----------
uh there are going to be circumstances


---------47:00----------
where


---------47:01----------
it's actually not good to contest an


---------47:04----------
objective or


---------47:05----------
to make a play um


---------47:09----------
and that in turn


---------47:12----------
like leads to those events those


---------47:14----------
unfavorable


---------47:15----------
events and then that leads to


---------47:19----------
the behavior that comes with that


---------47:23----------
if that makes sense can somebody help me


---------47:26----------
understand that


---------47:29----------
yeah no i think it does make sense um


---------47:33----------
everyone it was kind of like the first


---------47:35----------
thing we like we're talking about too


---------47:37----------
like


---------47:38----------
it's everyone wants to be like


---------47:41----------
it's like you're playing skyrim or


---------47:42----------
something like you go into a game and


---------47:44----------
you're just like


---------47:44----------
this is what i want to do this i'm going


---------47:46----------
to win like i just watched like you know


---------47:49----------
this pro player or like tarzan like


---------47:51----------
jungle like oh i know exactly like


---------47:53----------
how to like 1v9 this game and then like


---------47:55----------
oh this like


---------47:58----------
this and then they go for something and


---------47:59----------
like they don't get the help or they


---------48:01----------
they mess


---------48:02----------
they mess up or they want to like find


---------48:03----------
something else like you know it's just


---------48:05----------
it's just figuring out like the


---------48:07----------
why did it go wrong why was it not me


---------48:09----------
and some people some people will be like


---------48:10----------
oh that was my bad like they'll learn


---------48:11----------
from it


---------48:12----------
they'll improve as a player like that's


---------48:14----------
really good but i think it's kind of


---------48:16----------
meta


---------48:17----------
at least it has been in the community to


---------48:18----------
like yeah


---------48:20----------
it's all about you like how who can i


---------48:22----------
blame


---------48:23----------
if if if it's not going the way i want


---------48:25----------
if the game's gonna be hard or like


---------48:27----------
a little bit arduous for my personal pov


---------48:29----------
maybe like


---------48:30----------
maybe it's worth just like giving up


---------48:32----------
like let's just open like running it


---------48:33----------
down like whatever the way you want to


---------48:35----------
like


---------48:36----------
like kind of kind of deal with that


---------48:37----------
feeling i guess


---------48:39----------
um and it like everyone has their own


---------48:40----------
way of dealing with it


---------48:42----------
like for me if i'm jungling and i want


---------48:44----------
to go for scuttle


---------48:45----------
and their lanes collapse and i lose it


---------48:48----------
or i die like


---------48:50----------
i'm not going to run the game down


---------48:51----------
because it happened some people will


---------48:52----------
some people won't some people will keep


---------48:54----------
playing their best like


---------48:54----------
but just from freezing from my


---------48:56----------
perspective i'll just be like okay that


---------48:57----------
sucks


---------48:58----------
but like what can we do from here like


---------49:00----------
how do we play this game out because i


---------49:02----------
i really think most solo games are


---------49:03----------
winnable and that's why i try to like


---------49:05----------
encourage my teams to like never give up


---------49:07----------
and like


---------49:07----------
play it out and focus on like what win


---------49:09----------
conditions that we can find even if it's


---------49:11----------
like a small chance right like


---------49:13----------
i've gone flat for this over the years


---------49:15----------
but like yeah if if if you start off a


---------49:17----------
game with like a 50


---------49:18----------
chance of winning and like your regular


---------49:20----------
elo and then things are going poorly


---------49:22----------
and then it turns out you know you're


---------49:24----------
really behind and maybe it's a 10 chance


---------49:26----------
a lot of


---------49:26----------
people would just like want to go next


---------49:28----------
immediately and


---------49:30----------
i'm not saying this is correct but this


---------49:31----------
is like how i've always approached it


---------49:32----------
like


---------49:33----------
i want to play for that like 10 chance


---------49:34----------
of like winning the game usually


---------49:36----------
um which is like very far gone from like


---------49:39----------
giving up as soon as you lose like the


---------49:41----------
first


---------49:41----------
thing that you're fighting for just like


---------49:42----------
a scuttle cover whatever which is maybe


---------49:44----------
the percent chance to lose the game


---------49:46----------
after that went down by like


---------49:48----------
like two or three or something like that


---------49:50----------
who even knows like one percent like


---------49:52----------
i'm not i don't know exactly but i don't


---------49:54----------
know it's


---------49:55----------
how did this kind of sorry how did the


---------49:57----------
meta


---------49:58----------
become that way


---------50:04----------
uh i think oh sorry sorry no okay


---------50:07----------
i think over time like i think i think


---------50:10----------
lots of it has to do with riot i think


---------50:13----------
like


---------50:15----------
it's just it's just we've been like i


---------50:16----------
know with like the video on the stairs


---------50:18----------
like


---------50:19----------
asking for help and stuff like we've


---------50:21----------
been doing that for


---------50:22----------
years years we've been talking like


---------50:25----------
directly like one-on-one and like your


---------50:26----------
personal stuff like


---------50:28----------
toxicity like people like believing gays


---------50:31----------
and stuff like this has been happening


---------50:32----------
ages and i think like


---------50:35----------
we've been waiting for so long and it's


---------50:37----------
just never really happened


---------50:39----------
i think something was just like yeah


---------50:40----------
like in the last little hope


---------50:42----------
right to like solve this issue it's just


---------50:44----------
kind of spiraled out of control it was


---------50:45----------
like


---------50:47----------
mm-hmm yeah are you angry at that 100


---------50:50----------
what is this video you said video on the


---------50:52----------
stairs


---------50:55----------
oh what does that mean


---------50:59----------
it was it was yeah it was just it was


---------51:02----------
like a vlog i did


---------51:03----------
talking about solo queue and league and


---------51:05----------
how riot hasn't like done anything and


---------51:07----------
for years and how the system's just kept


---------51:09----------
getting worse


---------51:10----------
um and people were just like abusing it


---------51:12----------
and like there's no consequences and


---------51:14----------
stuff so it was based it was basically


---------51:15----------
asking like


---------51:17----------
riot to like fix [ __ ] and help us right


---------51:20----------
um because i do think a lot of the blame


---------51:22----------
is on riot


---------51:24----------
you know like their system has been


---------51:25----------
broken for like so long


---------51:27----------
and if you like we're talking about


---------51:30----------
people like why people end like this


---------51:31----------
kind of stuff but like if you go into a


---------51:32----------
game you just like start running it down


---------51:34----------
like


---------51:35----------
you should get punished for that you


---------51:36----------
shouldn't be able to like just queue


---------51:38----------
back up and go into another game and do


---------51:39----------
the same thing and ruin like you know


---------51:41----------
nine other people's experience


---------51:43----------
but like for so many years like that's


---------51:46----------
just


---------51:46----------
it's like people people literally have


---------51:48----------
like ran down like 50 games in a row and


---------51:50----------
like even their automated


---------51:52----------
detection systems haven't done anything


---------51:54----------
in a lot of cases so


---------51:55----------
it's just it's been like a pretty big


---------51:57----------
problem for


---------51:58----------
for a while now so yeah like the stairs


---------52:00----------
thing was just me sitting down like


---------52:01----------
doing like a


---------52:02----------
like a vlog talking about and like


---------52:04----------
asking right to help because like we've


---------52:06----------
been saying the same things for so many


---------52:08----------
years and


---------52:09----------
um at least that video like a lot of


---------52:11----------
people like resonated with the message


---------52:13----------
and like shared it and write like


---------52:15----------
you know watched it and responded and


---------52:16----------
stuff like that but i mean it's we're


---------52:18----------
still far from like


---------52:19----------
a good system but what they say um you


---------52:22----------
know


---------52:23----------
um uh yeah they i mean they they they


---------52:26----------
say they said like yeah we've been


---------52:27----------
working on stuff like we hear you guys


---------52:29----------
like


---------52:30----------
all this stuff and they've been posting


---------52:32----------
like more consistent updates about like


---------52:34----------
how they're approaching like the systems


---------52:36----------
and toxicity


---------52:37----------
and like you know fix like improving


---------52:39----------
their automated system


---------52:41----------
um all these kind of things but yeah i


---------52:44----------
mean obviously it takes time


---------52:45----------
um i don't think anyone expects it to


---------52:47----------
like but it's been like a problem for


---------52:48----------
like so many years but


---------52:50----------
with that said like it does take time


---------52:52----------
but um


---------52:53----------
yeah i don't know hopefully hopefully


---------52:55----------
like you know going into next season


---------52:56----------
there


---------52:57----------
there'll be a more robust system i guess


---------53:01----------
and some of the problems can be


---------53:03----------
addressed but i


---------53:04----------
i don't really know like it's kind of


---------53:06----------
like a wait and see


---------53:08----------
thing at this point so so pardon my


---------53:11----------
ignorance but


---------53:12----------
and does anybody else want to uh bounce


---------53:14----------
off of what roy boy said i want to give


---------53:16----------
people a chance but i had a couple of


---------53:18----------
like general questions about


---------53:19----------
week


---------53:22----------
so so like does league have a report


---------53:24----------
system


---------53:26----------
yeah but it's the most flawed uh


---------53:29----------
system ever it is useless what do you


---------53:32----------
mean by flawed how does it flaw


---------53:34----------
it's flawed in that punishable behavior


---------53:37----------
isn't punished


---------53:38----------
or very rarely is like


---------53:44----------
there have been so many instances where


---------53:46----------
there was blatant


---------53:47----------
things that are against like


---------53:51----------
the summoner's code or whatever that


---------53:53----------
have been


---------53:54----------
reported but not punished and then there


---------53:57----------
are


---------53:58----------
like on the complete end where on the


---------54:01----------
complete other end where there are


---------54:02----------
things that shouldn't


---------54:04----------
like be seen as serious


---------54:08----------
get punished i think


---------54:11----------
yeah and and is there anything like


---------54:14----------
you guys know what the concept of the


---------54:16----------
behavior score and dota


---------54:19----------
no you guys heard about this okay no so


---------54:22----------
dota actually has a pretty interesting


---------54:23----------
thing which they implemented a couple of


---------54:25----------
years ago i mean some people


---------54:26----------
complain about the system generally


---------54:28----------
experience my generally speaking my


---------54:30----------
experience with it has been pretty


---------54:31----------
positive


---------54:32----------
so you have this thing called a behavior


---------54:34----------
score that goes from zero to ten


---------54:36----------
thousand


---------54:37----------
and generally speaking i don't know


---------54:38----------
exactly how it's like on the back end


---------54:40----------
you don't really know


---------54:41----------
i don't know how your behavior score


---------54:43----------
changes but if you have a high behavior


---------54:46----------
score you get paired with


---------54:47----------
other people with a high behavior score


---------54:51----------
and what i tend to find is since they


---------54:52----------
implemented behavior scores


---------54:54----------
generally speaking in my games i've been


---------54:56----------
very surprised by like when i [ __ ] up


---------55:00----------
people will be like hey man that's okay


---------55:02----------
don't worry about it


---------55:04----------
and and i also hear that there's an


---------55:06----------
absolute cesspool


---------55:08----------
of like low behavior score people


---------55:11----------
so like for example if you disconnect


---------55:13----------
from a game you get put into something


---------55:14----------
called


---------55:15----------
low priority queue which means they take


---------55:18----------
all the re


---------55:19----------
all the degenerates and they stick them


---------55:21----------
in games and


---------55:22----------
literally what could happen is you can


---------55:23----------
get stuck in low priority queue


---------55:27----------
because everyone is ending all the time


---------55:30----------
and it's just like constantly like all


---------55:32----------
the ragers just being paired with each


---------55:34----------
other


---------55:35----------
and get out of that if you decide that


---------55:37----------
you have to finish


---------55:39----------
all you have to do it's like [ __ ]


---------55:41----------
jail i kid you not it's like purgatory


---------55:43----------
you have to like like complete five low


---------55:46----------
priority q games


---------55:48----------
or something like that and and i've


---------55:51----------
never


---------55:52----------
i've never i mean i've always been


---------55:53----------
curious but i've never been in a little


---------55:56----------
private eq game before


---------55:58----------
and and so i'm i'm afraid to go because


---------56:01----------
i'm afraid i'm never going to be able to


---------56:02----------
get out


---------56:04----------
but i think it is kind of interesting


---------56:05----------
that like you know they have implemented


---------56:07----------
things and generally speaking like


---------56:08----------
people are pretty


---------56:09----------
positive in in the games that i play i


---------56:12----------
mean there's still people who are upset


---------56:13----------
and stuff and i think in dota


---------56:15----------
you know you're not locked in for 25


---------56:17----------
minutes it's 45 minutes baby


---------56:20----------
it's it's damn near an hour and


---------56:23----------
and so that's that's really painful and


---------56:25----------
you can't surrender in dota


---------56:27----------
there's no conceived button which which


---------56:30----------
also is kind of an interesting


---------56:31----------
design choice um


---------56:35----------
but uh yeah what do you guys think about


---------56:38----------
that


---------56:40----------
um i think it's like i think it's a good


---------56:42----------
idea i mean very rarely


---------56:44----------
do i get in a game where everyone's


---------56:46----------
positive like very rare i probably like


---------56:48----------
one game every


---------56:50----------
month and i play like 10 games a day


---------56:53----------
or more so it's very rare but when when


---------56:55----------
you get in those kind of games


---------56:56----------
even when you're losing your whole team


---------56:58----------
is so positive everyone just has fun


---------57:00----------
about it they're like oh we're losing


---------57:02----------
and


---------57:02----------
we just like start playing around and


---------57:04----------
you know have fun losing and


---------57:06----------
that's like the kind of you know kind of


---------57:09----------
games i want to play


---------57:10----------
daily you know to me have more enjoyment


---------57:12----------
playing league


---------57:14----------
yeah i would rather oh no you guys


---------57:17----------
uh those systems typically only work for


---------57:19----------
like lower rating


---------57:21----------
just because there's more people playing


---------57:22----------
so you actually find a match with


---------57:24----------
actual like the amount of positive


---------57:26----------
people i want to return higher


---------57:28----------
i'm pretty yeah the real players is


---------57:30----------
lower so yeah


---------57:32----------
i imagine like maybe if they implement


---------57:34----------
that take like


---------57:35----------
hours to find a game yeah that's


---------57:38----------
probably why they don't do it


---------57:40----------
yeah uh that's i was gonna say something


---------57:43----------
um relate to that too so i don't think


---------57:46----------
ryan would do something like that


---------57:48----------
because of that problem and also like i


---------57:50----------
mean like they tried with


---------57:51----------
with like the whole honor system right


---------57:53----------
but


---------57:55----------
the thing with the honor system that


---------57:57----------
ryan implemented like


---------57:58----------
what ends up happening is usually people


---------58:00----------
just honor like it's like you can honor


---------58:02----------
for like


---------58:02----------
like i think it's like shock calling


---------58:05----------
like


---------58:06----------
what are the other ones guys like i


---------58:07----------
don't even know like like positive and


---------58:09----------
yeah like a good game yeah like having


---------58:10----------
like it's like there's like a heart one


---------58:12----------
and then i don't know i


---------58:13----------
for me like i just at this point just


---------58:14----------
default like people that like


---------58:16----------
even like yeah i i don't think anyone


---------58:18----------
uses the honor system like the way it


---------58:19----------
was designed people just usually just be


---------58:21----------
like oh who like popped off the hardest


---------58:23----------
kind of


---------58:23----------
and they just honor them so if you have


---------58:25----------
like a high honor level it's usually


---------58:26----------
just like


---------58:27----------
oh you just probably like carry like a


---------58:29----------
decent percentage of your games


---------58:31----------
um so but it's kind of weird it's called


---------58:34----------
honor and like there's like rewards tied


---------58:36----------
to it like you get like little skin


---------58:38----------
capsules and stuff like that but


---------58:40----------
it doesn't really help in like the sense


---------58:43----------
that like


---------58:44----------
incur i don't think it really encourages


---------58:46----------
like those kind of behaviors or like


---------58:48----------
makes the community truly better um i


---------58:50----------
don't know maybe i'm wrong i don't like


---------58:51----------
the numbers like that but i never felt


---------58:53----------
like


---------58:54----------
it really uh did anything productive


---------58:57----------
at least from my perspective yeah


---------59:02----------
would you guys describe the league


---------59:04----------
community as


---------59:05----------
toxic yes


---------59:08----------
yes yeah majority of it probably


---------59:13----------
really so you guys this isn't like a


---------59:15----------
vocal minority kind of thing it sounds


---------59:18----------
so surprising


---------59:19----------
this is like public yeah everyone


---------59:23----------
thinks that way everyone will think of


---------59:26----------
biggest thoughts


---------59:30----------
why


---------59:35----------
probably just have more bad experiences


---------59:37----------
than good ones and playing a game


---------59:39----------
and like you play games for fun normally


---------59:41----------
if you eat it casually


---------59:42----------
you probably just ran into more bad


---------59:44----------
experiences than good


---------59:47----------
interesting you know so this is kind of


---------59:50----------
a random aside but


---------59:51----------
you know the problem with the behavior


---------59:53----------
score system so like you guys


---------59:54----------
this is going to be a random question i


---------59:56----------
have no idea if you guys have any


---------59:57----------
experience with this


---------59:58----------
you know if you have a kid who acts out


---------60:01----------
like do you guys know what the like


---------60:04----------
so if i let's say there are 10 kids in


---------60:07----------
10 classes that act out


---------60:10----------
do you guys know what happens when i


---------60:12----------
take all those 10 kids out of those


---------60:14----------
classes and stick them in a class


---------60:15----------
together


---------60:19----------
nope so the interesting thing is that


---------60:22----------
generally speaking if you want to


---------60:23----------
rehabilitate people


---------60:25----------
you don't separate you keep them


---------60:29----------
with like so if you take like a toxic


---------60:30----------
person so if you think about like uh


---------60:33----------
you know like if you think about


---------60:34----------
alcoholics for example maybe this is an


---------60:35----------
easier example


---------60:36----------
so if we have a bunch of alcoholics and


---------60:39----------
you actually like


---------60:40----------
put an alcoholic with a group of sober


---------60:42----------
people


---------60:43----------
that's actually how they get sober


---------60:46----------
does that make sense you don't do it by


---------60:49----------
like putting a bunch of alcoholics


---------60:50----------
together and i know people sort of they


---------60:52----------
say but


---------60:52----------
isn't out is an alcoholic synonymous


---------60:54----------
like a bunch of alcoholics together


---------60:56----------
well yes but they're also sober they're


---------60:58----------
sober alcoholics


---------60:59----------
right so the interesting thing the


---------61:02----------
downside i think to the behavior score


---------61:03----------
system is that it actually


---------61:05----------
concentrates all of the positivity in


---------61:07----------
one area which is great if you're a


---------61:09----------
positive person


---------61:10----------
but also makes it a hopeless


---------61:13----------
for everyone else and


---------61:16----------
and i what i'm kind of curious about is


---------61:18----------
like when you guys talk about like the


---------61:19----------
meta has become toxicity


---------61:22----------
and so what my question is to you guys


---------61:23----------
is like how do we change that


---------61:28----------
and i know you guys have said riot needs


---------61:30----------
to do something so fine but


---------61:32----------
you know that's them


---------61:36----------
we gotta make everyone positive how do


---------61:38----------
you do that


---------61:43----------
i mean i don't even like i don't even


---------61:46----------
think


---------61:47----------
i don't even want like the whole


---------61:48----------
community to be like like positive like


---------61:51----------
necessarily


---------61:52----------
just like i just wish people would be


---------61:53----------
like more mellow like chill like


---------61:56----------
not like you know so


---------62:01----------
just getting so hyphy and like vicious


---------62:03----------
on each other for like you know maybe


---------62:04----------
having a bad game or


---------62:06----------
you know playing poorly or whatever like


---------62:10----------
you know whatever


---------62:10----------
their percep perceived like offenses i


---------62:13----------
don't know i just like


---------62:14----------
it's just so easy to to tear people down


---------62:18----------
whether you're playing a game or like


---------62:20----------
watching a stream or like


---------62:21----------
you know posting a reddit comment or


---------62:23----------
like a youtube comment like whatever


---------62:24----------
like i know this is like it's the


---------62:26----------
internet like i don't know it's it's


---------62:27----------
kind of


---------62:29----------
i mean you're asking like what can we do


---------62:30----------
about it like it's just i


---------62:32----------
i just it's just hard when like you a


---------62:35----------
lot of places that you look it's like


---------62:37----------
there's so much negativity and


---------62:39----------
you know it can be draining over time


---------62:41----------
even if it's not even directed at you


---------62:42----------
right just seeing it like


---------62:44----------
so consistently um and honestly i have


---------62:48----------
no idea like like i said


---------62:53----------
you know just i feel like trying like on


---------62:55----------
our like we're just like we're just like


---------62:56----------
a few streamers right like people


---------62:58----------
i'm sure there's a lot of people


---------62:58----------
watching this or like you know might


---------63:00----------
hear like this convo that


---------63:02----------
might might you know be a part of people


---------63:04----------
that want want like a more chill


---------63:06----------
community like want


---------63:07----------
more positivity like less less you know


---------63:10----------
negative hyphy behavior


---------63:12----------
um but like you know what what can we


---------63:14----------
all do right like that's the thing


---------63:16----------
like it's it just feels like


---------63:19----------
it just feels like i'm not gonna say


---------63:21----------
like


---------63:23----------
like for example i've been sorry i'm


---------63:24----------
like saying like a lot and so um i'm not


---------63:27----------
i'm trying to figure out like where i'm


---------63:28----------
going with this but it's like i've been


---------63:30----------
streaming for like


---------63:30----------
10 years almost like lee and i feel like


---------63:33----------
i've always tried to


---------63:34----------
you know set a good example and like do


---------63:36----------
my best


---------63:38----------
not like not like being fake like i'll


---------63:39----------
get mad all like i'll


---------63:41----------
i'll be like this guy literally through


---------63:42----------
the game like i'll call people out but


---------63:44----------
like i've just tried my best to like


---------63:46----------
not be the the things that you know i


---------63:48----------
feel like really tear me down or tear


---------63:50----------
other people down that i see it


---------63:51----------
sometimes in the community and i just


---------63:53----------
feel like all


---------63:54----------
i just feel like at the end of the day


---------63:55----------
like what did i really accomplish like


---------63:58----------
it just feels like there's so much


---------63:59----------
overwhelming like


---------64:01----------
negativity around and it feels like


---------64:03----------
there's nothing i can really do on an


---------64:05----------
individual level or like you know we can


---------64:07----------
really do to like change that


---------64:09----------
um that's that's honestly like like


---------64:12----------
danny says like a hopeless war like i'm


---------64:14----------
not saying i like i've like given up or


---------64:15----------
anything like that but it really just


---------64:17----------
feels like


---------64:19----------
like i haven't like we have no clue like


---------64:21----------
what we could possibly do


---------64:23----------
to like change that it's like we're


---------64:26----------
waiting for reinforcements


---------64:27----------
but all we get is like little timmy


---------64:29----------
little waggy little sword in the back


---------64:31----------
but some key fragments yeah where's that


---------64:34----------
where's our help


---------64:36----------
what i'm hearing is that positive league


---------64:39----------
players are an endangered species


---------64:43----------
yes i get the sense i mean this hopeless


---------64:45----------
war analogy of like you guys are like


---------64:47----------
you know stalwart warriors falling one


---------64:49----------
at a time


---------64:51----------
and every time one of you falls you like


---------64:53----------
look behind you to see if reinforcements


---------64:55----------
coming and no one's gone


---------64:59----------
it sounds pretty bleak to be honest guys


---------65:01----------
sounds hard


---------65:08----------
um again like i i'm not sitting here


---------65:11----------
pretending to be a very very positive


---------65:13----------
person i'm not


---------65:14----------
and i i also don't think that it's


---------65:16----------
realistic to


---------65:17----------
think that there is a date that's going


---------65:20----------
to come where the majority


---------65:22----------
of the community is going to be positive


---------65:26----------
um however i think


---------65:31----------
like with the like it it's undeniable


---------65:34----------
that it has been a downward spiral


---------65:36----------
because a few seasons ago it was


---------65:38----------
never the way that it is today


---------65:42----------
so i i'm just so curious as to what


---------65:44----------
happened there must have been like this


---------65:46----------
it's like a a community but it's also


---------65:49----------
like a culture in a way


---------65:51----------
where it's become


---------65:54----------
normalized to be toxic


---------65:59----------
and uh like i'm not sure where that


---------66:00----------
comes from uh maybe it's


---------66:02----------
just from the fact that most people


---------66:04----------
don't play this as a job


---------66:06----------
and they just um queue up for a game of


---------66:09----------
league to


---------66:10----------
like escape or lash out or whatever the


---------66:12----------
case may be


---------66:14----------
but i just wonder like i'm really not


---------66:16----------
sure how it got to this


---------66:18----------
point


---------66:22----------
yeah you know i think that's a


---------66:23----------
fascinating question i sometimes wonder


---------66:26----------
so pretty much like there are big trends


---------66:29----------
that are happening so sometimes i wonder


---------66:30----------
if the trends that we see in gaming have


---------66:32----------
nothing to do with riot or the actual


---------66:34----------
games they have to do with the people in


---------66:36----------
them


---------66:37----------
so what has happened to people's lives


---------66:40----------
over the last three or four years


---------66:42----------
generally speaking one thing that we


---------66:44----------
know is that mental illness has


---------66:46----------
now surpassed heart disease in cancer


---------66:49----------
and is now number one in the united


---------66:51----------
states for


---------66:52----------
what we call morbidity and mortality


---------66:54----------
which means that like


---------66:56----------
the burden of disease is now


---------67:00----------
worse so we're number one so something


---------67:03----------
is going on with people's minds


---------67:05----------
in general like across the developed


---------67:07----------
world


---------67:08----------
probably also true in like third world


---------67:10----------
countries or developing countries as


---------67:11----------
well


---------67:12----------
but generally speaking like people's


---------67:14----------
minds are becoming


---------67:16----------
more toxic


---------67:20----------
and i wonder if if that has something to


---------67:22----------
do with it like i think there are big


---------67:24----------
macro trends


---------67:26----------
i do think that i'm not ready to give up


---------67:30----------
hope yet


---------67:31----------
and i know that you guys and that's


---------67:32----------
probably because i'm new and naive


---------67:35----------
and i'm timmy with poop little sword


---------67:38----------
because i just i just don't train a


---------67:40----------
little timmy though huh


---------67:43----------
we gotta train little timmy though


---------67:44----------
that's sure so maybe a little teammate


---------67:46----------
needs to learn how it is


---------67:48----------
but i have a couple of like crazy


---------67:50----------
thoughts i mean so i think the first is


---------67:52----------
that


---------67:52----------
i think we can understand as a community


---------67:54----------
like how


---------67:56----------
um where like tilt comes from and i


---------67:59----------
think we have to understand that like


---------68:00----------
tilt the reason that tilt happens and


---------68:02----------
the reason that there's so much toxicity


---------68:03----------
is because i think it feels good


---------68:06----------
right like like we said earlier i know


---------68:08----------
it sounds kind of bizarre but being


---------68:09----------
positive is going to wipe you out


---------68:11----------
in four hours raging at the internet


---------68:14----------
is like something that you can sustain


---------68:16----------
for hours on end


---------68:18----------
and i don't quite understand why that is


---------68:20----------
or how that is i think part of it feels


---------68:22----------
like very validating


---------68:24----------
or resonant for lack of a better term


---------68:28----------
like it feels right and so you know you


---------68:31----------
can do a lot of things that feel right


---------68:34----------
whereas like you know restraining


---------68:36----------
yourself like we were talking about


---------68:37----------
earlier if you feel hopeless if you


---------68:39----------
don't want to display your negativity


---------68:40----------
that comes at a cost whereas like


---------68:44----------
letting loose and i think it kind of


---------68:46----------
goes back to what kareem was saying


---------68:47----------
earlier about


---------68:48----------
you know you can rage when you lose or


---------68:50----------
you can learn


---------68:52----------
and karim why do you think why don't you


---------68:54----------
think people


---------68:55----------
pick learn


---------69:00----------
i think either because they don't want


---------69:03----------
to learn and play the game


---------69:05----------
casually or because


---------69:09----------
it is the harder like route to take


---------69:12----------
so what makes it harder and this kind of


---------69:16----------
comes back to what danny was saying


---------69:17----------
about perspective


---------69:19----------
right so danny was saying like if people


---------69:20----------
can get perspective they don't tell


---------69:23----------
so what makes perspective hard why don't


---------69:26----------
people have perspective


---------69:29----------
let's do something different i'm sorry


---------69:33----------
you gotta do something different like


---------69:35----------
learn that


---------69:37----------
yeah yeah like like i'll say again like


---------69:39----------
they respond to the same routine that


---------69:41----------
they don't want to change


---------69:42----------
or do anything different because it's


---------69:43----------
just easy easy to do the same thing


---------69:46----------
what makes it easy to do the same thing


---------69:49----------
because you know it


---------69:50----------
you know what to do you feel comfortable


---------69:51----------
doing it because


---------69:53----------
you're in your zone you don't want to


---------69:54----------
step out of that zone


---------69:56----------
yeah you're not really challenging


---------69:58----------
yourself and putting yourself in a


---------69:59----------
position to fail i guess when you're


---------70:00----------
doing


---------70:01----------
the same thing that you know you're


---------70:03----------
putting other people in position to fail


---------70:06----------
[ __ ] that if you're gonna fail they're


---------70:08----------
gonna fail too


---------70:10----------
right i'm diving i'm diving the top


---------70:14----------
tower your ass is coming with me


---------70:18----------
if i'm gonna have a bad game you're


---------70:20----------
gonna have a bad game


---------70:23----------
yeah so i think that's a big part of it


---------70:25----------
so like here are a couple of


---------70:26----------
i mean you guys have anything else like


---------70:28----------
i feel like sort of i have a couple of


---------70:30----------
conclusions to share with you guys i'm


---------70:31----------
just curious what you think


---------70:33----------
and i wanted to sort of give you guys


---------70:34----------
some chances to respond or


---------70:36----------
or tell me i'm an idiot


---------70:40----------
and tilt is that okay


---------70:43----------
yeah yeah because i think i've learned a


---------70:45----------
lot from what y'all have to say


---------70:47----------
and i'll start with this once again i've


---------70:49----------
said it two or three times already but


---------70:50----------
the first thing is that it it blows my


---------70:54----------
mind


---------70:54----------
how parallel what you guys are


---------70:56----------
describing is to


---------70:58----------
actual real life and it kind of starts


---------71:01----------
with this idea of expectation


---------71:04----------
right so like i'll give you guys just


---------71:05----------
like a real life example let's say i'm


---------71:07----------
smart


---------71:08----------
because that's what we are as gamers


---------71:10----------
right we're smart


---------71:12----------
and then we go to school and


---------71:16----------
we've been smart so like i i've i've


---------71:17----------
gotten straight a's


---------71:19----------
through the sixth grade and seventh


---------71:22----------
grade after flex on us


---------71:24----------
huh so you didn't have to flex


---------71:27----------
oh straight a's through the sixth grade


---------71:28----------
is flexing now


---------71:32----------
and so so i go to the seventh grade and


---------71:34----------
i find that i get a b


---------71:37----------
and then what does that mean about me


---------71:38----------
being smart


---------71:42----------
what do you guys think it threatens it a


---------71:45----------
little bit


---------71:46----------
absolutely so how do i get an a


---------71:49----------
what do i have to do now in seventh


---------71:50----------
grade you gotta study


---------71:53----------
and what is work harder what does


---------71:55----------
studying say about me being smart


---------71:59----------
you're not as smart as you thought you


---------72:00----------
were you're damn right


---------72:02----------
it's interesting right so what i need to


---------72:06----------
do


---------72:06----------
actually threatens who i am i'm stuck


---------72:09----------
i'm screwed


---------72:10----------
paralyzed because if i study i'm not


---------72:12----------
smart anymore


---------72:15----------
and if i don't study i'm going to get a


---------72:16----------
b and i'm not smart anymore


---------72:18----------
so what is the only way i can preserve


---------72:20----------
my intelligence


---------72:25----------
you guys know not studying


---------72:31----------
and why i'm still getting a's nope


---------72:36----------
it's actually a stop trying yeah you


---------72:38----------
don't even get tested or whatever you


---------72:40----------
don't even


---------72:40----------
absolutely oh yeah you you just don't


---------72:42----------
you just don't want to see the result


---------72:44----------
absolutely you're damn right i just say


---------72:48----------
oh yeah


---------72:48----------
i don't care about learning english


---------72:53----------
i read dostoyevsky in my free time i


---------72:55----------
don't need to read this middle school


---------72:57----------
[ __ ]


---------72:58----------
you denigrate it and then it's okay to


---------73:00----------
get a b


---------73:02----------
because you're smart so it starts with


---------73:05----------
an expectation i don't know how exactly


---------73:07----------
that translates into league


---------73:08----------
but i think there's something in there


---------73:10----------
about not learning and not getting


---------73:12----------
better


---------73:13----------
it's the easy road right kareem was like


---------73:15----------
it's hard to learn


---------73:17----------
danny's like it's hard to change who you


---------73:19----------
are


---------73:20----------
so these people preserve who they are


---------73:23----------
because it's easier


---------73:24----------
so i'm going to be bronze and call


---------73:26----------
everyone else a shitty


---------73:28----------
bronze is a rank in league is that right


---------73:30----------
yeah


---------73:31----------
okay so like i'm gonna say bronze and


---------73:33----------
i'm just gonna call everyone else


---------73:35----------
shitties


---------73:36----------
so i think there's something there the


---------73:37----------
second thing is like oh man gg go next


---------73:41----------
oh god if there's one problem in our


---------73:43----------
society right now it's gg go next


---------73:45----------
because this is what we do like people


---------73:47----------
who are stuck at home


---------73:48----------
they wake up one day and they're like


---------73:49----------
yeah today i'm gonna learn how to code


---------73:52----------
and they load up league and then


---------73:55----------
what happens after one hour is they tell


---------73:57----------
themselves gg go next


---------74:00----------
and you know what next is it's tomorrow


---------74:03----------
and then they wake up tomorrow and


---------74:04----------
they're like today i'm gonna learn how


---------74:05----------
to code


---------74:07----------
and they play one game and they say gg


---------74:09----------
go next


---------74:11----------
right it's it's like the first five


---------74:13----------
minutes when you lose the scuttle you


---------74:14----------
give up on the game and you're like gg


---------74:16----------
go next


---------74:17----------
i want it to be perfect otherwise it's


---------74:19----------
not the game that i


---------74:20----------
envisioned oh [ __ ] like coding turns out


---------74:24----------
that it's like it's way


---------74:25----------
muddier and it's not the expectation


---------74:27----------
that i had like


---------74:28----------
i knew what i wanted to do this game i


---------74:30----------
was gonna be a tarzan or whatever


---------74:32----------
and i was gonna own everyone 1v9 and


---------74:34----------
someone ruined it for me so [ __ ] that


---------74:36----------
expectation


---------74:40----------
and we have expectations for our rise


---------74:44----------
from the shittiness of our life


---------74:47----------
right we're going to be transformed and


---------74:49----------
like some people like i'm going to be


---------74:50----------
the next boy boy


---------74:52----------
i'm going to be the next positive


---------74:53----------
streamer i'm going to be the next kareem


---------74:56----------
i'm gonna be the next xyz and i'm gonna


---------74:59----------
become a big league streamer


---------75:02----------
and then when things don't go their way


---------75:03----------
when they start streaming for like two


---------75:04----------
or three days and they they have like 30


---------75:06----------
viewers


---------75:08----------
they're like ah screw that


---------75:11----------
like it's easier to say gg go next and


---------75:13----------
give up than it is to actually like try


---------75:15----------
to learn


---------75:18----------
and that kind of gets to this issue of


---------75:19----------
like you know what are our choices


---------75:22----------
either we rage or we learn and there is


---------75:24----------
something really really awesome


---------75:26----------
about raging and giving up because it


---------75:28----------
feels good it just feels really good


---------75:31----------
it feels really good to say gg go next


---------75:33----------
and i thought it was really interesting


---------75:35----------
so if you guys listened


---------75:36----------
to kareem's words he said it feels good


---------75:38----------
but you know it's not the right thing


---------75:41----------
and i think there are a lot of people on


---------75:43----------
twitch


---------75:44----------
who do things because they feel good and


---------75:47----------
they know it's not the right thing


---------75:50----------
like you know you should stop playing


---------75:52----------
league after one game and like maybe


---------75:54----------
learn how to code


---------75:56----------
but there's that voice in all of us


---------75:58----------
that's like it's not the right


---------76:00----------
what i'm doing is not the right thing


---------76:01----------
but i want to do it anyway


---------76:04----------
because it feels good so then the


---------76:06----------
question is why do you get that


---------76:08----------
is this okay am i just ranting am i


---------76:09----------
losing you guys no no you're great


---------76:11----------
that's good awesome okay


---------76:14----------
so then we get to like okay so then why


---------76:16----------
is that


---------76:17----------
and i think it's beautiful because you


---------76:19----------
guys gave it to us like in the first


---------76:20----------
five seconds of stream


---------76:21----------
ego right if we think about like like


---------76:24----------
where does ego go into this


---------76:26----------
i think a lot of toxicity comes from ego


---------76:29----------
a lot of toxicity comes from this idea


---------76:31----------
that like like i'm intelligent like i


---------76:33----------
have this


---------76:34----------
identity is i'm very smart


---------76:38----------
look at how five head i am and the more


---------76:41----------
that we attach ourselves to that


---------76:43----------
identity of i


---------76:44----------
am this way like the more we get to this


---------76:47----------
bass awkward sort of situation where


---------76:49----------
like i get a b


---------76:49----------
in class and i'm relegating myself to bs


---------76:52----------
or c's


---------76:53----------
or d's or dropping out for the rest of


---------76:55----------
my life


---------76:56----------
because that's what gg go next looks


---------76:58----------
like for the people who are 23 and


---------77:00----------
living at home and watching twitch


---------77:02----------
all day i love you guys but your problem


---------77:04----------
started when you started saying gg go


---------77:06----------
next


---------77:08----------
so the really crazy thing that i had


---------77:10----------
never envisioned before


---------77:12----------
is that an antidote to this problem of


---------77:14----------
all places


---------77:15----------
is league of legends this is the really


---------77:17----------
crazy thought


---------77:19----------
and i've never really thought about this


---------77:20----------
until this moment but the way you guys


---------77:22----------
are describing league of legends makes


---------77:24----------
me think that


---------77:25----------
if you can take a toxic player and


---------77:27----------
transform them in league of legends


---------77:29----------
the same formula is what's necessary to


---------77:31----------
transform your real life


---------77:34----------
because it's the same [ __ ] it's ego


---------77:38----------
it's expectation it's perspective what


---------77:40----------
does perspective mean


---------77:42----------
perspective is something that i would


---------77:43----------
call attachment


---------77:45----------
you are one in the game your identity is


---------77:48----------
lost in the game


---------77:49----------
it's not just a game it's everything


---------77:53----------
for that person in that moment league is


---------77:56----------
everything


---------77:56----------
and you [ __ ] [ __ ] you took my


---------77:58----------
scuttle you're taking everything away


---------78:00----------
from me


---------78:03----------
and so how do you cultivate that


---------78:05----------
perspective


---------78:06----------
right because some of you guys are able


---------78:08----------
to do it but it's like really hard


---------78:10----------
and even in your case boy boy i think


---------78:12----------
you could bet everyone can benefit from


---------78:14----------
perspective


---------78:15----------
when you have a hundred percent


---------78:16----------
perspective you guys know what we call


---------78:18----------
that


---------78:18----------
or what people what another term for


---------78:21----------
that is


---------78:23----------
and it's kind of a weird open-ended


---------78:24----------
question when you have like a hundred


---------78:27----------
percent perspective all the time


---------78:29----------
that's what buddha called enlightenment


---------78:32----------
distance from the thing that you are


---------78:35----------
doing


---------78:36----------
the ability to recognize that all of


---------78:38----------
your emotions


---------78:39----------
that get wrapped up in that is not a


---------78:41----------
real thing but it feels so real in that


---------78:43----------
moment


---------78:45----------
it's being able to take distance from it


---------78:47----------
and saying like that's just


---------78:48----------
the game and what would they realize is


---------78:50----------
that life is actually just one big game


---------78:53----------
and you don't have to get bent out of


---------78:54----------
shape that life


---------78:56----------
can do crappy things to you but this is


---------78:58----------
a big revelation that he had


---------79:00----------
most of what sucks about life is what we


---------79:03----------
do to ourselves when life does something


---------79:06----------
to us


---------79:08----------
because the damage doesn't come when we


---------79:10----------
get a b the damage comes


---------79:12----------
the way that we respond to the b when i


---------79:15----------
lose scuttle i haven't lost a league of


---------79:17----------
legends game


---------79:18----------
what causes me to lose the league of


---------79:19----------
legends game


---------79:23----------
when i run down mid and this is the


---------79:26----------
shocking thing that i don't think people


---------79:28----------
get


---------79:29----------
is that most of what's ruining their


---------79:31----------
lives


---------79:32----------
is not the scuttle it's the [ __ ]


---------79:34----------
running down mid


---------79:36----------
and this is where things like you guys i


---------79:38----------
know y'all are hopeless


---------79:39----------
but this is what gives me hope i know it


---------79:41----------
sounds crazy


---------79:43----------
you may not have control over the


---------79:44----------
scuttle but you actually have control


---------79:47----------
over running down mid


---------79:50----------
and so you can actually win that game in


---------79:53----------
fact


---------79:54----------
it's probably pretty chances are like


---------79:56----------
maybe 51.49


---------79:58----------
or like 49.51 like not in your favor


---------80:00----------
after losing to scuttle


---------80:02----------
but the way that we respond to what life


---------80:05----------
gives us is ultimately what determines


---------80:08----------
whether we win or we lose


---------80:11----------
and that's like really really bizarre


---------80:13----------
but i refer back to the studying example


---------80:15----------
because getting a b it's like weird but


---------80:17----------
we get on this trajectory


---------80:19----------
of like throwing and we just throw it


---------80:22----------
life


---------80:24----------
and then we feel hopeless


---------80:27----------
but here's the crazy thing like so let


---------80:29----------
me ask you guys when someone loses


---------80:31----------
scuttle and


---------80:32----------
starts running down mid on a scale of 1


---------80:34----------
to 10


---------80:35----------
10 being completely hopeless and one


---------80:38----------
being having all the hope in the world


---------80:40----------
where are they where are they


---------80:43----------
where are they oh in the game


---------80:46----------
no like like on a scale of hopelessness


---------80:50----------
in the context of the game or yeah in


---------80:52----------
the context of the game oh


---------80:53----------
i mean obvi like hope like hopeless i


---------80:56----------
guess absolutely right


---------80:58----------
yeah so but the funny thing there is


---------81:01----------
it's the hopelessness which causes them


---------81:03----------
to run down mid


---------81:04----------
it's the hopelessness which causes us to


---------81:07----------
not act


---------81:10----------
but the crazy thing is that the


---------81:11----------
hopelessness


---------81:13----------
is like kind of false like we know that


---------81:16----------
in the context of league of legends


---------81:17----------
right


---------81:19----------
like you're not actually like what the


---------81:20----------
[ __ ] man you just lost 100 gold


---------81:24----------
item like we can still dumpster these


---------81:26----------
shitties


---------81:28----------
just play the [ __ ] game


---------81:30----------
[Music]


---------81:32----------
but that's not what we do because once


---------81:34----------
we feel hopeless


---------81:36----------
then we don't see like in that moment


---------81:38----------
we're not able to see


---------81:39----------
and what is it that lets us see danny


---------81:42----------
lee baby


---------81:43----------
perspective


---------81:46----------
perspective hey take a step back man and


---------81:49----------
this is the other thing that wood that


---------81:50----------
taught


---------81:51----------
expectation leads to attachment


---------81:54----------
attachment leads to suffering i'm like i


---------81:57----------
[ __ ] you guys not if you guys go back


---------81:58----------
and you read the poly or the sunscreen


---------82:01----------
it's it's exactly what you guys said


---------82:03----------
about league of legends when i go into


---------82:05----------
the game


---------82:05----------
i'm gonna get i'm gonna get to the top


---------82:08----------
scuttle first or left scuttle or right


---------82:10----------
skunk or whatever one of the scuttles


---------82:11----------
i'm going to beat the other jungle


---------82:13----------
player to it and then i'm going to go


---------82:15----------
and i'm going to get the bottom skull 2


---------82:17----------
and then i'm going to be 200 g up and


---------82:19----------
buy this item i'm a gank mid


---------82:20----------
we're going to roll these [ __ ]


---------82:23----------
expectation


---------82:24----------
attachment now i'm going to leave you


---------82:26----------
guys with one other question


---------82:28----------
who is more likely to to tilt the person


---------82:30----------
who goes


---------82:31----------
2 and 0 in a game or the person who goes


---------82:33----------
on 2 in the game


---------82:38----------
i think it depends on player themselves


---------82:43----------
okay


---------82:47----------
because like i mean there's games where


---------82:49----------
i'll be like


---------82:50----------
i'll be like 10-0 like hard smurfing and


---------82:53----------
then like


---------82:53----------
i'll make one mistake and like we'll


---------82:55----------
lose like an objective or something


---------82:57----------
and i'll feel really bad i'll be i'll


---------82:59----------
actually


---------83:00----------
be like pretty tilted but i mean i can


---------83:01----------
still bounce back and there'll be games


---------83:02----------
where i'm just getting camped


---------83:04----------
and i'll be like oh and five but i know


---------83:06----------
we can win and i know that like


---------83:07----------
you know the jungler's permatop we're


---------83:09----------
getting stuff on the other side of the


---------83:10----------
map


---------83:11----------
like you know it's like a balance like


---------83:13----------
and there's some games like


---------83:15----------
i'm just i'm just like completely


---------83:17----------
neutral and i'll be tilted


---------83:18----------
like pretty hard and i know it's like a


---------83:21----------
pretty big spectrum for everybody


---------83:23----------
i agree so yeah go ahead i think it's a


---------83:26----------
lot more likely for the o2 to turn into


---------83:29----------
an o10 than for the 2o


---------83:31----------
to turn into 8.


---------83:35----------
not in that the 2o might not be


---------83:38----------
tilted they might be tilted but still


---------83:40----------
continue to try


---------83:41----------
but once you're 2-0 there's or once


---------83:43----------
you're o2 there's that level of


---------83:45----------
hopelessness that settles in and the


---------83:47----------
more you die


---------83:48----------
the worse it gets okay if that makes


---------83:51----------
sense yep


---------83:52----------
so like if you go 0 and 2 so i i think


---------83:54----------
that there's a subtle thing there did


---------83:56----------
some i'm sorry did somebody else want to


---------83:57----------
say something


---------83:58----------
oh okay right so so i i


---------84:02----------
think that there's a there's a really


---------84:03----------
interesting thing there right so i i


---------84:05----------
hear what you guys are saying i think it


---------84:06----------
is like kind of a simple


---------84:08----------
i mean it's a complex it's a complicated


---------84:10----------
issue that i'm trying to turn into a


---------84:11----------
simple question to illustrate a point


---------84:15----------
so i i definitely know people who go 0


---------84:17----------
and 2 who feel


---------84:18----------
super [ __ ] tilted


---------84:21----------
because what was supposed to happen


---------84:27----------
i was supposed to go 2-0 they're


---------84:30----------
right and so here's the crazy thing so


---------84:33----------
most of chat seems to think that two and


---------84:34----------
o is more likely to tilt


---------84:38----------
and why is that i think it's because


---------84:40----------
once you're two and o


---------84:41----------
what do you expect to happen for the


---------84:43----------
rest of the game


---------84:45----------
you expect everything to go in your


---------84:47----------
favor absolutely


---------84:49----------
so when you're 0-2 absolutely when


---------84:52----------
you're 0-2


---------84:53----------
and you get a kill how do you feel


---------85:02----------
when you're two and 0 and you die how do


---------85:04----------
you feel


---------85:07----------
like you just threw absolutely right so


---------85:10----------
it's about expectation


---------85:12----------
expectation is key what do you expect


---------85:16----------
every day when you wake up


---------85:19----------
and the more that you expect the the


---------85:21----------
closer you are


---------85:22----------
to the thing i don't know how else to


---------85:24----------
put that i don't know if that makes


---------85:25----------
sense and then you lose perspective


---------85:28----------
and the more that you can separate


---------85:30----------
yourself out the less


---------85:32----------
more expectation will melt away you can


---------85:34----------
see like there's no


---------85:35----------
expectation is about being invested does


---------85:37----------
that make sense


---------85:38----------
like i can expect certain things to


---------85:40----------
happen but they're not going to bother


---------85:41----------
me unless i'm invested


---------85:44----------
i can go into a game and i can be like


---------85:45----------
okay i should win because this is a


---------85:47----------
favorable match up


---------85:49----------
but like maybe i won't


---------85:53----------
and then you do well and so the crazy


---------85:56----------
thing here is that when


---------85:58----------
when it comes down to it i think that


---------85:59----------
like


---------86:01----------
okay how to wrap up so like let me just


---------86:03----------
try to piece this together so i see


---------86:05----------
i see a lot of this stuff around


---------86:06----------
expectation and perspective


---------86:09----------
of gaining perspective and i also see


---------86:12----------
like some themes where i get that you


---------86:13----------
guys are hopeless but i don't i'm not


---------86:15----------
hopeless


---------86:16----------
and that's probably just because i


---------86:17----------
haven't played enough league of legends


---------86:20----------
and and the reason that i'm not hopeless


---------86:22----------
is i think that you guys are hopeless


---------86:23----------
for the same reason


---------86:25----------
i think there's some common element


---------86:27----------
although your situation does sound


---------86:28----------
genuinely are we dropping what's going


---------86:30----------
on


---------86:31----------
i think voyn then you just deceived


---------86:34----------
gg he had to go next yeah gg go next


---------86:38----------
next stream gigi disco there's lots of


---------86:42----------
talk of gg go next


---------86:46----------
we lost voice uh anyway i forgot what i


---------86:50----------
was saying did you guys


---------86:51----------
y'all remember sometimes i just started


---------86:55----------
going and i don't remember exactly where


---------86:56----------
i was


---------87:01----------
i do that nope we cut out so i don't


---------87:03----------
know i was i was listening intently but


---------87:05----------
then


---------87:06----------
you're here i was listening but


---------87:10----------
okay anyway i don't know what to say but


---------87:13----------
okay let me try to get it back


---------87:15----------
so i was talking to you guys about like


---------87:16----------
expectation right so


---------87:18----------
that the reason the 20 person tilts is


---------87:21----------
because they have an expectation that


---------87:22----------
they're going to continue to dumpster


---------87:25----------
and it's that expectation that actually


---------87:27----------
screws them


---------87:29----------
because the second that you you tell


---------87:31----------
yourself like oh i'm i got this [ __ ]


---------87:33----------
i got this [ __ ] on lock that's the


---------87:35----------
moment that you open yourself up to tilt


---------87:39----------
and if it's sort of like hey i've got an


---------87:41----------
advantage let's see if we can turn this


---------87:43----------
into a 3-0


---------87:44----------
but maybe they'll compensate and by the


---------87:46----------
way like i'm worth way more because now


---------87:48----------
i want to kill streak


---------87:50----------
right so there's like there's like a


---------87:52----------
rubber band mechanic built into the game


---------87:54----------
this is definitely not unlocked let's


---------87:56----------
see if i can dumpster these shitties


---------87:58----------
so there's a big difference between i'm


---------88:00----------
going to and let's see if


---------88:05----------
anyway this kind of gets back to the


---------88:07----------
sort of the last issue of like what do


---------88:09----------
we do about toxicity in league and i i


---------88:11----------
hear that


---------88:12----------
you know hopefully riot does more


---------88:14----------
they're working on it sounds like pretty


---------88:16----------
cool and hopeful


---------88:17----------
at the same time i would be careful


---------88:19----------
about underestimating your own impact


---------88:23----------
so one of the things that you kind of


---------88:26----------
learn as a therapist is that


---------88:28----------
oftentimes you don't realize like how


---------88:32----------
helpful you are


---------88:33----------
like if i if i'm working with someone


---------88:34----------
who's got bad depression they come into


---------88:36----------
my office every week and they're like


---------88:37----------
depressed every week what am i gonna


---------88:40----------
feel like


---------88:42----------
am i going to feel like i'm doing a good


---------88:43----------
job


---------88:46----------
maybe not


---------88:50----------
so sometimes the most important thing


---------88:52----------
that you can offer


---------88:53----------
someone is like your constancy


---------88:57----------
in the face of hopelessness


---------89:01----------
so i cannot underplay


---------89:05----------
how important it is that you guys do


---------89:08----------
what you do


---------89:10----------
because there's like there's a lot of


---------89:12----------
victory and overcoming hopelessness


---------89:15----------
there's something like wonderfully noble


---------89:17----------
about standing against it anyway


---------89:21----------
right so you guys are on the front lines


---------89:23----------
everyone except for cream


---------89:24----------
so cream


---------89:29----------
a little bit behind us right so like


---------89:32----------
just the fact that you guys show up day


---------89:34----------
after day dealing with the [ __ ] that you


---------89:36----------
deal with i don't think you guys realize


---------89:38----------
like


---------89:39----------
how important that is and don't


---------89:41----------
underestimate your inability to see it


---------89:44----------
for the lack of effect


---------89:48----------
because if we listen to kareem you know


---------89:49----------
he's kind of saying three years ago


---------89:50----------
things weren't like this


---------89:52----------
so oftentimes we as human beings don't


---------89:55----------
realize how profound of an impact we


---------89:57----------
have on other human beings


---------89:59----------
we don't see it but it doesn't mean that


---------90:01----------
it isn't important


---------90:03----------
and i've seen time and time and time


---------90:05----------
again that all it takes is like one


---------90:07----------
person


---------90:08----------
to like transform something


---------90:11----------
like a community and in your case like i


---------90:15----------
don't know exactly what's going to come


---------90:16----------
from this i find it hard to believe that


---------90:18----------
anyone who's watching this stream


---------90:20----------
is going to be more likely to tilt a


---------90:23----------
rage at the end of the stream


---------90:26----------
i have to say that something about what


---------90:28----------
you guys have shared


---------90:30----------
and the perspective that we've gained is


---------90:32----------
going to positively impact


---------90:34----------
things in in some way


---------90:38----------
i just you know i don't i don't think


---------90:40----------
what you guys say is rage inducing


---------90:42----------
i don't think it tilts people more i


---------90:44----------
think it's actually like positive and


---------90:46----------
inspiring


---------90:48----------
i something tells me like people who are


---------90:49----------
watching have to


---------90:51----------
go into their league games at some point


---------90:53----------
and like maybe


---------90:54----------
rage a little bit less what do you guys


---------90:57----------
think about that


---------91:02----------
yeah it makes sense um


---------91:05----------
like i had you know sometimes i get you


---------91:07----------
know hate mail


---------91:08----------
or hate messages people will just hate


---------91:11----------
on me for some no reason like


---------91:14----------
i haven't done anything to them i'm very


---------91:15----------
positive and stuff so i have


---------91:17----------
i don't see why they hate me that's why


---------91:19----------
they just


---------91:20----------
oh okay we'll talk about that in a


---------91:22----------
second but


---------91:24----------
keep going i didn't mean to derail you


---------91:26----------
oh yeah


---------91:27----------
um usually you know i just


---------91:31----------
ignore those kind of messages but um i


---------91:34----------
did respond to one


---------91:36----------
i i said i don't know why you hate me


---------91:39----------
but i hope the best for you


---------91:41----------
and it was crazy because he responded


---------91:42----------
back you know it's like why are you


---------91:44----------
requesting the best for me


---------91:45----------
like i'm making like i'm i hate you and


---------91:48----------
all stuff but


---------91:49----------
wow man thank you and he started being


---------91:51----------
more positive so i was like oh


---------91:53----------
okay well that's cool i think he got


---------91:56----------
lucky there bro


---------91:58----------
i i know i got the person i responded to


---------92:01----------
no but i i think so so does anybody have


---------92:04----------
any idea why so many people hate chris


---------92:08----------
yes let me know guys why do you hate me


---------92:09----------
no there's no way


---------92:12----------
why do you guys think people hate him or


---------92:15----------
i shouldn't say so many people i should


---------92:16----------
say the ones that hate him a lot


---------92:19----------
and take the time out of their day to dm


---------92:22----------
him


---------92:23----------
what do you guys think that is


---------92:26----------
and i think like maybe trying to spread


---------92:28----------
like a positive message or at least a


---------92:31----------
different message in their eyes that


---------92:33----------
like how you're thinking


---------92:34----------
it's like different from theirs in a


---------92:36----------
sense you tell them they're wrong or


---------92:38----------
in a way i think yep it's terrifying


---------92:43----------
so like let me ask you guys a question


---------92:45----------
we're gonna go back to the sixth grader


---------92:47----------
who's now in seventh grade and got to be


---------92:48----------
on a test


---------92:50----------
and who's debating between do i stop


---------92:53----------
studying


---------92:54----------
or do i study and then therefore i lose


---------92:56----------
my smartness


---------92:58----------
and then like the person that that


---------93:01----------
who does that person hate the most


---------93:04----------
it's the person who they perceive as


---------93:06----------
smart who they one day find out has been


---------93:09----------
studying


---------93:14----------
right so i think i think chris the


---------93:15----------
reason that people send you hateful


---------93:17----------
messages


---------93:19----------
is because if they had chosen


---------93:21----------
differently


---------93:22----------
they could have been who you are


---------93:26----------
they see themselves in you the thing


---------93:29----------
that inspires


---------93:30----------
in my opinion the most vitriolic hate


---------93:33----------
is when you see the person that you are


---------93:35----------
making the choice that you didn't make


---------93:39----------
because that's hard


---------93:43----------
the most engaging to the ego


---------93:47----------
because i can't tolerate that because if


---------93:48----------
sanchez does it that means that my


---------93:50----------
entire life


---------93:50----------
has been a lie


---------93:55----------
maybe it's because the champions you


---------93:56----------
spam


---------93:58----------
yeah like cinch


---------94:02----------
[ __ ] people watch


---------94:05----------
uh chris's stream and then as a result


---------94:08----------
they're picking cinched in by games


---------94:10----------
and they're losing


---------94:13----------
yeah so [ __ ] you sorry man


---------94:18----------
i'm trying to teach them the right way


---------94:22----------
so any any kind of we've been running at


---------94:24----------
it for close to


---------94:26----------
like an hour and a half or so a little


---------94:27----------
over you guys have any like thoughts or


---------94:30----------
questions


---------94:33----------
um


---------94:38----------
well i guess what what you said about


---------94:42----------
how we do have an impact even if we


---------94:44----------
can't always see it um


---------94:47----------
yeah it definitely i i definitely like


---------94:52----------
appreciate and understand that like


---------94:55----------
when like i'll get messy i'll get like


---------94:57----------
hate messages but also get like


---------94:59----------
you know positive messages from people


---------95:01----------
would be like hey boy like just like


---------95:02----------
watching your stream like just seeing


---------95:04----------
like


---------95:04----------
you know how you how you are in game and


---------95:07----------
like how you don't give up and just


---------95:09----------
keep trying and and try to like rally


---------95:10----------
your team up and stuff like it


---------95:12----------
it helped me out like not only in game


---------95:14----------
but also like


---------95:15----------
in like other aspects of life which i i


---------95:19----------
personally


---------95:20----------
um i don't i don't really understand


---------95:22----------
because like for me it's like pretty


---------95:24----------
easy to like


---------95:25----------
think about win conditions in league and


---------95:26----------
like know like how we can come back in a


---------95:28----------
game even if it's losing and stuff like


---------95:30----------
that


---------95:30----------
but like you know translating that like


---------95:33----------
you're like you were talking about how


---------95:34----------
like we can like


---------95:36----------
have an example for like real life like


---------95:37----------
translating into my own life it's like a


---------95:39----------
lot harder right like


---------95:40----------
i think in league like i can all it's


---------95:42----------
really easy for me like be positive


---------95:43----------
because i understand the game and i


---------95:44----------
understand like how we can win like


---------95:46----------
what are the options like if it's


---------95:48----------
hopeless then i'll be like all right


---------95:49----------
well maybe we lost this but like in life


---------95:51----------
it's just


---------95:52----------
it's just so so much of a mystery right


---------95:54----------
and there's just so many unknowns and


---------95:55----------
like so much


---------95:56----------
that it's not like a game like in league


---------95:59----------
where like


---------96:00----------
the rules are voiced what's the


---------96:02----------
difference between real life and league


---------96:04----------
when it comes to you


---------96:15----------
um


---------96:18----------
i i i don't know that's that's really


---------96:21----------
hard actually


---------96:22----------
sorry yeah so it's kind of a weird ass


---------96:26----------
question does it does anyone even


---------96:28----------
understand the question


---------96:32----------
i get it but i i think it's such a


---------96:38----------
like a like a special case


---------96:41----------
i i think uh like voy has put in


---------96:46----------
his life into the game so league in a


---------96:49----------
way has become


---------96:51----------
his life you're damn right yeah


---------96:55----------
so he says life is so much harder and


---------96:58----------
that's because boy has dedicated a


---------97:00----------
decade of his life to


---------97:01----------
understanding league and voy how much of


---------97:04----------
your life have you dedicated


---------97:06----------
to understanding life


---------97:10----------
i probably stopped about a decade ago if


---------97:13----------
i


---------97:14----------
my calculations are correct


---------97:18----------
only reason to me that it is harder than


---------97:20----------
league for you


---------97:22----------
is because you have taken and i know


---------97:23----------
this is going to sound weird in


---------97:25----------
vogue memes but you have taken your


---------97:27----------
massive


---------97:28----------
intellect and dedication and you put it


---------97:30----------
into one thing for a decade


---------97:32----------
and then you're saying oh [ __ ] this is


---------97:35----------
so much easier


---------97:37----------
than this other thing well no [ __ ]


---------97:38----------
wonder man that's because you've been


---------97:40----------
investing in it for a decade


---------97:46----------
yeah when you play like that


---------97:50----------
let me explain something to you guys


---------97:51----------
life is not actually harder


---------97:53----------
than games the big difference is we just


---------97:57----------
don't


---------97:58----------
[ __ ] practice one


---------98:03----------
like we don't think about it we don't


---------98:06----------
try to improve


---------98:08----------
we don't do replay analysis we don't


---------98:10----------
watch streamers


---------98:15----------
think about someone that you know that's


---------98:17----------
good at life


---------98:19----------
think about someone that you know that's


---------98:21----------
good at league how do you learn from the


---------98:23----------
league player


---------98:24----------
you watch their [ __ ] stream how do


---------98:26----------
you learn from the person at life


---------98:28----------
you don't


---------98:32----------
if they try to have a conversation with


---------98:33----------
you you run for the hills


---------98:38----------
oh [ __ ] he's good at life i'm a reject


---------98:40----------
who plays lol all day


---------98:41----------
i can't interact with him


---------98:45----------
like this is the thing that blows my


---------98:46----------
mind like i've literally taken


---------98:49----------
like these like cases so this is like


---------98:52----------
something so i was in a class at harvard


---------98:54----------
business school okay


---------98:56----------
and i had this case for a bunch of


---------98:58----------
[ __ ] there were 100 physicians in a


---------99:00----------
class at harvard business school


---------99:02----------
and they gave me this case study which


---------99:03----------
is like a complex problem


---------99:05----------
it's like a 16-page thing about


---------99:08----------
optimizing revenue in a urology clinic


---------99:14----------
i took i took this case to a group of my


---------99:16----------
gamer buddies


---------99:17----------
and i was like what do you guys think


---------99:18----------
about this


---------99:20----------
they work on it for a day tell me what


---------99:22----------
they think i go into class the next day


---------99:25----------
and they're like what do people think


---------99:26----------
about the case i raise my hand and i say


---------99:28----------
what my gamer buddies told me


---------99:31----------
professor is impressed


---------99:37----------
just turn your focus it's about your


---------99:40----------
attention and your focus


---------99:43----------
think about the way that you play the


---------99:45----------
game of week think about all of the


---------99:47----------
struggles that you go through all the


---------99:48----------
energy you expend


---------99:50----------
in streaming and you don't expend a


---------99:53----------
fraction of that in the rest of your


---------99:54----------
life


---------99:56----------
so like no wonder you suck at it but it


---------99:58----------
doesn't mean


---------99:59----------
that you suck you suck at it


---------100:03----------
you're not bad you just haven't invested


---------100:06----------
in it bro


---------100:10----------
like that's what i'm telling you guys


---------100:11----------
like i invested a couple years of my


---------100:13----------
life into learning how i work as a human


---------100:15----------
being


---------100:16----------
and absolutely worth the investment


---------100:18----------
where does desire come from what is the


---------100:20----------
nature of attachment and suffering


---------100:22----------
who is more likely to tilt two and o or


---------100:24----------
o and two


---------100:26----------
how do you work as a human being


---------100:31----------
learn these things i think you guys


---------100:32----------
actually understand a lot of stuff you


---------100:33----------
all have a leg up because you all seem


---------100:35----------
to be good league players


---------100:36----------
that means you guys are like smart and


---------100:37----------
dedicated and if you just shift the


---------100:39----------
focus


---------100:40----------
you'll be amazed at what you can learn


---------100:44----------
you guys just don't know the vocabulary


---------100:46----------
it's like like


---------100:47----------
boy boy today's been to feels like [ __ ]


---------100:48----------
feels like [ __ ] feels like [ __ ]


---------100:50----------
right and that's just because it's like


---------100:52----------
what's like if i came to you guys and i


---------100:54----------
said


---------100:55----------
you're like hey dr k how's the league


---------100:57----------
game going and i i'm like i lose


---------100:59----------
like why do you lose i suck then i play


---------101:01----------
again and they're like why'd you lose


---------101:02----------
that game i suck


---------101:04----------
i suck you guys


---------101:07----------
realize like you don't lose a game of


---------101:08----------
game of league of legends because you


---------101:10----------
suck right like you lose a game because


---------101:11----------
of all kinds of complicated reasons


---------101:13----------
which no one understands because i just


---------101:14----------
don't i haven't spent the time with it


---------101:16----------
oh i don't know how to last hit i'm


---------101:18----------
rotating poorly i bought the wrong items


---------101:21----------
i had a singed on my team


---------101:26----------
top captain was good don't hate on the


---------101:30----------
cinch


---------101:32----------
right you see how easy it is to adopt


---------101:33----------
the toxicity i don't even know who is


---------101:36----------
that canadian on stage


---------101:38----------
toxicity comes so naturally


---------101:43----------
but boy boy dude and for the rest of


---------101:44----------
y'all too and everyone watching at home


---------101:46----------
just put fraction of what you put into


---------101:48----------
league into the rest of your life you


---------101:50----------
will be amazed


---------101:52----------
because this is the thing that people


---------101:53----------
don't understand everyone thinks gamers


---------101:55----------
suck like i think gamers are the biggest


---------101:57----------
untapped potential in the world today


---------102:01----------
no one gives them any kind of respect or


---------102:03----------
any kind of responsibility


---------102:05----------
this entire organization was built on


---------102:07----------
rejects healthy gamer built on rejects


---------102:10----------
built from people from our community who


---------102:12----------
he said you know what


---------102:13----------
actually i don't care that you haven't


---------102:15----------
graduated from college


---------102:17----------
we'll give you a shot don't let us down


---------102:19----------
and it's been amazing


---------102:22----------
absolutely amazing


---------102:25----------
and so just take this dedication and


---------102:27----------
look at other parts of your life man


---------102:31----------
and you'll be amazed you guys are


---------102:33----------
badasses y'all are giants in the making


---------102:36----------
you guys are already giants fighting


---------102:38----------
against the hopeless hordes


---------102:40----------
of toxic zombies who are hinting right


---------102:43----------
and left at high elo which i hear is


---------102:44----------
really bad actually in league


---------102:46----------
you'd expect you know high elo to be


---------102:48----------
like less toxic but i hear it's bad


---------102:52----------
and y'all are awesome


---------102:55----------
and you guys are inspiring other people


---------102:57----------
whether you realize it or not


---------102:58----------
and if y'all weren't there like imagine


---------103:00----------
what would happen


---------103:03----------
the hordes would take over right there's


---------103:06----------
someone somewhere out there who watches


---------103:07----------
your games goes into a league of legends


---------103:10----------
game and then decides to try to emulate


---------103:12----------
you


---------103:16----------
and i think as long as you guys keep at


---------103:18----------
it you may not see the change but i


---------103:19----------
think it'll happen


---------103:21----------
generally speaking that's been my


---------103:23----------
experience if you study like you may not


---------103:25----------
get a b right you may not get an a right


---------103:27----------
away you may get a b for a little while


---------103:28----------
but you keep keep working at it and


---------103:30----------
you'll learn how to study you'll get


---------103:31----------
better and you'll start getting a's


---------103:34----------
yep okay oh yeah


---------103:39----------
danny i'm sorry you wanted to say


---------103:40----------
something and then we'll get to kareem's


---------103:41----------
question oh i was just saying like yeah


---------103:43----------
once


---------103:43----------
you know people stop trying i mean we're


---------103:45----------
[ __ ] as long as people try


---------103:47----------
to effort maybe other people put an


---------103:49----------
effort to


---------103:50----------
yep


---------103:54----------
so if you try maybe you're [ __ ] and if


---------103:56----------
you don't try you're certainly [ __ ]


---------104:00----------
kareem you had a question yeah i just


---------104:03----------
had a question


---------104:04----------
relating to um


---------104:08----------
bettering yourself as a person and then


---------104:11----------
translating that into league where we


---------104:14----------
talk about the analogy of the


---------104:16----------
the a student going into b what does


---------104:20----------
practice or studying in that case


---------104:24----------
look like for somebody who is trying to


---------104:28----------
better themselves mentally


---------104:31----------
someone who used to be good mentally and


---------104:34----------
then finds themselves not good mentally


---------104:36----------
or somebody that's just not good


---------104:39----------
mentally and that's never been good


---------104:40----------
trying to


---------104:42----------
get good so how do you


---------104:46----------
get good when it comes to your mental


---------104:49----------
right it's a fantastic question


---------104:54----------
so the answer to that question is


---------104:58----------
what healthy gamer is all about and i


---------105:00----------
can't answer it simply but i'm going to


---------105:02----------
try anyway


---------105:04----------
right so i think honestly kareem


---------105:07----------
the foundation is awareness and noticing


---------105:11----------
so the first thing to recognize is that


---------105:14----------
so


---------105:15----------
too many times do people especially


---------105:17----------
within our community


---------105:18----------
equate their value as a person with a


---------105:21----------
particular thing


---------105:22----------
outside of themselves first thing to


---------105:25----------
understand


---------105:26----------
just because you're bad at life does not


---------105:29----------
mean you're bad


---------105:31----------
but most people don't think like that


---------105:34----------
like if i can't find a date to prom what


---------105:37----------
does that say about


---------105:38----------
me as a human


---------105:44----------
nothing incorrect


---------105:48----------
that's technically true and actually


---------105:50----------
true but what do i think about myself


---------105:52----------
boy


---------105:54----------
that no one likes you


---------105:57----------
not just that no one likes me that i'm


---------105:59----------
not worth liking


---------106:02----------
do you guys see the difference between


---------106:03----------
those two statements because there's an


---------106:05----------
entire chasm


---------106:08----------
no one likes me i'm not worth liking


---------106:12----------
so the first thing preem is to


---------106:14----------
disidentify yourself


---------106:16----------
with your problem i'm not a bad league


---------106:20----------
player


---------106:21----------
i'm just a nude there's a huge


---------106:23----------
difference between sucking at league


---------106:25----------
and being a noob which i know we equate


---------106:28----------
the two right like even in our society


---------106:30----------
in our community


---------106:31----------
we equate the two but lack of experience


---------106:35----------
is different from like talent or value


---------106:39----------
so the first thing is that you may not


---------106:40----------
you're not bad at life you just haven't


---------106:42----------
learned how to live it


---------106:45----------
because how have you tried so that's i


---------106:48----------
know that sounds weird but that's


---------106:49----------
actually the foundation that's the first


---------106:50----------
thing


---------106:51----------
second thing is okay so fine i accept i


---------106:53----------
haven't learned how to live it


---------106:55----------
how do i learn how to live it and so


---------106:58----------
i'll teach you guys how to meditate in a


---------106:59----------
minute


---------107:00----------
but i'd say oftentimes the the biggest


---------107:02----------
and most important foundation is


---------107:04----------
awareness


---------107:05----------
so you have to understand what is going


---------107:07----------
on inside you


---------107:09----------
and the cool thing is like you can do


---------107:10----------
that any number of ways you just have to


---------107:12----------
pay attention so it could be something


---------107:14----------
as simple as


---------107:15----------
the next time you play so cream you say


---------107:16----------
you're not like these positive


---------107:19----------
dick wads here but like some days you're


---------107:22----------
super toxic in league and some days


---------107:24----------
you're less


---------107:24----------
less toxic and league right


---------107:27----------
yeah sure so what's the difference


---------107:36----------
the it just kind of depends their


---------107:39----------
outside um


---------107:43----------
i guess variables and also depending on


---------107:45----------
how


---------107:46----------
previous games have gone it's very easy


---------107:47----------
to sort of get caught up on


---------107:50----------
something that's happened in the past um


---------107:53----------
having one event in a certain game


---------107:56----------
dictate the way that your mood is


---------107:58----------
for the rest of your games that day okay


---------108:00----------
so like that's


---------108:01----------
that's a that's a decent answer but it's


---------108:04----------
not nearly specific


---------108:06----------
right so you say so you have vague


---------108:09----------
strokes of like [ __ ] that happened in


---------108:10----------
the previous game affects me in this


---------108:12----------
game


---------108:13----------
so then the question becomes if you want


---------108:14----------
to get good at life you have to figure


---------108:16----------
out


---------108:16----------
what is it in the game that affects you


---------108:18----------
what is it that carries over the next


---------108:20----------
game what is it that stays behind


---------108:22----------
what has to happen for me to get from


---------108:24----------
point a to point b


---------108:25----------
what are all of those variables and


---------108:27----------
getting good at life


---------108:29----------
is about understanding those a simple


---------108:32----------
example


---------108:33----------
if i don't sleep well what happens to me


---------108:38----------
right so getting good at life is an


---------108:39----------
understanding like how you function as a


---------108:42----------
person


---------108:42----------
and that starts with paying attention so


---------108:46----------
and here's a kind of a pitch that i give


---------108:48----------
to people when i'm trying to convince


---------108:49----------
them to


---------108:50----------
hire me for consulting so i'll go to


---------108:52----------
like a corporation or like a startup or


---------108:54----------
something and i'll say


---------108:56----------
what's the difference between a good day


---------108:58----------
and a bad day


---------109:02----------
what do you guys think so i'll go to


---------109:04----------
like a hospital


---------109:06----------
i'll have a group of surgeons like 40


---------109:09----------
surgeons in a room and i'll ask them


---------109:11----------
what's the difference between a good day


---------109:12----------
and a bad day you [ __ ] up in surgery


---------109:14----------
today


---------109:14----------
why what do you guys think


---------109:26----------
i'm actually not sure i don't know do


---------109:29----------
people have good days


---------109:31----------
yeah do people have bad days yeah yeah


---------109:35----------
what's the difference like let's just


---------109:37----------
think about this from the surgeon's


---------109:38----------
perspective


---------109:40----------
so you went through your training on


---------109:41----------
monday your training was let's say


---------109:44----------
15 years and one day


---------109:47----------
and you make a mistake and then on


---------109:50----------
tuesday


---------109:51----------
your training is 15 years and two days


---------109:53----------
and you do a good job


---------109:55----------
has your biology changed has your brain


---------109:58----------
changed have you lost dexterity


---------110:00----------
do you know less surgery did you forget


---------110:02----------
some surgery no


---------110:04----------
ridiculous how can human beings like


---------110:07----------
just think about this for a second


---------110:08----------
if our cars worked like we do as human


---------110:11----------
beings no one would ever [ __ ] drive a


---------110:13----------
car


---------110:15----------
that's true crazy


---------110:18----------
and so what is this pile that we call


---------110:21----------
humanity


---------110:22----------
like how do we work no one understands


---------110:24----------
this [ __ ] what's the difference between


---------110:25----------
a good day and a bad day and everyone's


---------110:27----------
like i don't know but i have good days


---------110:28----------
and i have bad days so why don't you


---------110:30----------
start [ __ ] paying attention that's


---------110:31----------
number one


---------110:33----------
the next time you have a bad day try to


---------110:35----------
like ask yourself because this is the


---------110:37----------
cool thing is you guys can actually come


---------110:39----------
up with answers


---------110:39----------
if you bother to try


---------110:42----------
think about how you guys learn learn


---------110:44----------
league of legends you took this thing up


---------110:46----------
here which is actually pretty badass


---------110:48----------
and you pointed it at something and then


---------110:51----------
as long as you point it at something


---------110:52----------
you're going to figure [ __ ] out does


---------110:54----------
that make sense yeah


---------110:55----------
you're going to get better you just have


---------110:56----------
to point it in the right direction how


---------110:58----------
long have you spent pointing it at


---------110:59----------
yourself


---------111:02----------
not much so point it at yourself that's


---------111:05----------
what awareness is


---------111:07----------
why am i having a bad day today what's


---------111:08----------
the best that i can figure out


---------111:10----------
then you experiment what happens if i


---------111:13----------
sleep


---------111:15----------
what hap how much did i sleep yesterday


---------111:17----------
is there a correlation be scientific


---------111:20----------
study yourself and the third thing you


---------111:22----------
can do is like


---------111:23----------
read right so reading is good but like


---------111:25----------
you should use it to inform what you


---------111:27----------
understand because the cool thing about


---------111:28----------
this is you guys actually know all this


---------111:30----------
stuff


---------111:31----------
right boy boy knows how it feels he


---------111:33----------
knows it's draining the reason it feels


---------111:35----------
shitty is because it's draining


---------111:36----------
why is it draining because is karim put


---------111:38----------
together i have two choices i can rage


---------111:41----------
or i can learn


---------111:42----------
one is easy and feels good one is hard


---------111:44----------
one requires more mana


---------111:46----------
so i want you guys to think about league


---------111:47----------
of legends is like expending mana


---------111:50----------
every time you rage you fill up your


---------111:52----------
mana bar and every time you control that


---------111:54----------
rage


---------111:55----------
you drain your mana bar at some point


---------111:57----------
your mana bar runs out and then what do


---------111:59----------
you start doing


---------112:04----------
raging absolutely


---------112:07----------
you guys know this stuff right so you


---------112:10----------
know what they call


---------112:11----------
mana bar and regular people speak


---------112:18----------
willpower


---------112:22----------
right so every day when voyboy logs on


---------112:25----------
he's got a mana bar


---------112:26----------
with a hundred points of willpower every


---------112:29----------
time someone


---------112:30----------
puts a bounty on his ass he loses it


---------112:34----------
it's not feeling like sure those


---------112:36----------
feelings and stuff


---------112:37----------
but this is a principle of science boy


---------112:40----------
boy is a human being


---------112:41----------
you can only put up with so many


---------112:43----------
bounties before you crack it has nothing


---------112:45----------
to do with your


---------112:46----------
strength as a person your resilience


---------112:48----------
your worth but that's what it


---------112:49----------
feels like


---------112:52----------
but as a human being you have limits you


---------112:54----------
just don't know what they are and


---------112:58----------
danny's got some of this [ __ ] too


---------112:59----------
right because he's talking about


---------113:00----------
perspective so buddha says


---------113:02----------
expectation is where suffering comes


---------113:05----------
from


---------113:06----------
then there's this third principle of


---------113:08----------
it's what we do to ourselves because of


---------113:10----------
what life does to us that really screws


---------113:12----------
us


---------113:13----------
this is the principle of two arrows life


---------113:15----------
shoots us


---------113:17----------
shoots one arrow at us hits us the


---------113:19----------
second arrow is the one that we shoot at


---------113:21----------
ourselves because we got hit by the


---------113:22----------
first one


---------113:24----------
it's [ __ ] dumb but we do it all the


---------113:26----------
time


---------113:29----------
right so like start to understand these


---------113:31----------
basic principles about yourself


---------113:34----------
and look at yourself and you'll be


---------113:35----------
amazed at what you can accomplish


---------113:39----------
does that answer your question sort of


---------113:41----------
ranted at you for a minute


---------113:43----------
because it's a really complex question


---------113:45----------
but i wanted to try to give you a good


---------113:46----------
answer


---------113:51----------
other questions


---------113:57----------
i wanted to ask about meditation and


---------114:00----------
how obviously it helps and we all know


---------114:03----------
that it helps


---------114:04----------
but not to get too specific because i


---------114:07----------
know it'll take a while but how it helps


---------114:09----------
and


---------114:10----------
how to use it um


---------114:13----------
like efficiently sure that actually is


---------114:16----------
not


---------114:16----------
too hard of a question so when you say


---------114:18----------
how it helps what


---------114:19----------
what kind of help are we talking about


---------114:21----------
we're talking about like tilt prevention


---------114:24----------
right and keeping that mana at a hundred


---------114:28----------
okay so keeping the man at 100 and tilt


---------114:30----------
prevention are two different things


---------114:33----------
okay so i know i know that sound


---------114:36----------
so let me explain so let's talk about


---------114:38----------
both of them the first thing is


---------114:40----------
one form of meditation i'm going to


---------114:41----------
teach you guys


---------114:43----------
two techniques today um


---------114:46----------
so yeah i'll teach you two one is going


---------114:49----------
to help you with tilt


---------114:50----------
actually both of them will help you with


---------114:52----------
tilt and both of them help you with mana


---------114:53----------
but their mechanisms are different


---------114:54----------
so in terms of tilt prevention how do


---------114:57----------
you feel


---------114:58----------
like what are the emotions that you


---------114:59----------
experience when you're


---------115:02----------
tilting


---------115:06----------
sad frustrated embarrassed


---------115:12----------
sadjay okay right


---------115:15----------
so what do you guys think is happening


---------115:17----------
to your heart rate when you're tilted


---------115:20----------
it goes up yep sometimes you have


---------115:23----------
diaphoresis or sweating


---------115:25----------
right your body is activated you're


---------115:27----------
pissed you're angry you're in fighting


---------115:28----------
mode


---------115:30----------
so that i don't know how else to say


---------115:32----------
this but that is actually governed by


---------115:34----------
physiology


---------115:35----------
does that make sense like there are


---------115:38----------
there are hormones that are flowing


---------115:40----------
through your body that actually increase


---------115:42----------
your heart rate


---------115:43----------
and make you feel angry


---------115:46----------
so there are some chemicals that can


---------115:48----------
make you feel angry and other chemicals


---------115:49----------
that will make you feel sad


---------115:51----------
or calm or whatever so the first thing


---------115:54----------
is i'm going to teach you guys a


---------115:56----------
technique called alternate nostril


---------115:57----------
breathing


---------115:58----------
that literally balances the two modes of


---------116:01----------
your central nervous system


---------116:02----------
so your central nervous system so we


---------116:04----------
have two kinds of nervous system a


---------116:06----------
peripheral nervous system which is all


---------116:07----------
the nerves in our hands and fingers and


---------116:09----------
everything outside of the brain in the


---------116:11----------
spinal cord


---------116:12----------
and then we have this thing called the


---------116:14----------
central nervous system which is our


---------116:15----------
brain and our spinal cord


---------116:17----------
our central nervous system has two modes


---------116:19----------
of operation


---------116:21----------
it has a yin and a yang or


---------116:24----------
a surya and a chandra which means a sun


---------116:26----------
and a moon


---------116:27----------
or what's scientifically called a


---------116:29----------
sympathetic or a parasympathetic nervous


---------116:31----------
system


---------116:32----------
and what that means that our body has


---------116:34----------
two modes it has a fight or flight mode


---------116:37----------
right so you guys can think about this


---------116:38----------
as like stances


---------116:40----------
so we have a fight-or-flight stance and


---------116:42----------
we have a rest and digestants


---------116:45----------
one stance is for activity one stance is


---------116:47----------
for like


---------116:48----------
recuperation so what happens after you


---------116:52----------
haven't eaten for eight hours and you


---------116:53----------
eat a gigantic ass burrito


---------116:56----------
what happens to your body and your mind


---------117:03----------
uh food coma absolutely right so how the


---------117:05----------
[ __ ] does that work


---------117:06----------
so what is a food coma a coma implies a


---------117:10----------
mental function


---------117:11----------
you guys get that yeah so what happens


---------117:15----------
chris in your mind after you eat a


---------117:18----------
burrito and you're in a food coma what


---------117:20----------
does that mean what does it feel like to


---------117:21----------
be in a food coma


---------117:23----------
uh yet sleepy yup so why does that


---------117:26----------
happen


---------117:27----------
because the parasympathetic nervous


---------117:28----------
system is engaged


---------117:31----------
so when we eat a big meal our body says


---------117:34----------
yo bro we have a lot of this food in our


---------117:36----------
stomach


---------117:37----------
we're going to literally divert blood


---------117:40----------
from our brain our arms and our legs


---------117:44----------
and increase the size of our our


---------117:47----------
diameter not size


---------117:48----------
of arteries to our stomach and our


---------117:50----------
intestines to digest this food


---------117:53----------
and as a result you literally get sleepy


---------117:56----------
it's because there's literally less


---------117:57----------
blood flow going to your brain


---------118:00----------
so on the flip side tilt is the opposite


---------118:04----------
of the food coma


---------118:05----------
you feel angry agitated your thoughts


---------118:08----------
move fast


---------118:09----------
also your peripheral vision collapses


---------118:12----------
from like


---------118:13----------
120 degrees to 30 degrees when your


---------118:16----------
sympathetic nervous system is active


---------118:17----------
this is what adrenaline does


---------118:19----------
literally you cannot see outside the


---------118:20----------
sides of your vision when you have


---------118:22----------
adrenaline


---------118:24----------
also does it cognitively so we see that


---------118:26----------
cognitively when you're tilted


---------118:28----------
you can't consider things out here


---------118:31----------
you're just zeroing in on the scuttle


---------118:34----------
and this goes back to what danny was


---------118:35----------
saying perspective you lose perspective


---------118:38----------
literally adrenaline causes a collapse


---------118:40----------
of your peripheral vision


---------118:42----------
and a collapse of your cognitive vision


---------118:44----------
to only see


---------118:45----------
one thing it's a [ __ ] scuttle


---------118:49----------
so there's actually a practice which i


---------118:52----------
can teach you


---------118:53----------
which will balance those two nervous


---------118:54----------
systems it'll turn one off and turn the


---------118:57----------
other one on


---------118:59----------
and literally glad you're yawning boy


---------119:02----------
boy


---------119:02----------
the other thing that it can do is it can


---------119:04----------
balance the other way too so what it


---------119:06----------
really does is it balances them


---------119:10----------
so we're going to see and boy you should


---------119:12----------
yawn if you guys feel like yawning you


---------119:14----------
guys should just go ahead and i was just


---------119:15----------
gonna say it


---------119:16----------
i was gonna say i just didn't i just


---------119:18----------
didn't sleep much so it's not like i'm


---------119:20----------
i wasn't like bored or anything i'm not


---------119:21----------
offended don't worry about it okay i


---------119:23----------
think if you if you need to yawn you


---------119:24----------
should listen to the signals of your


---------119:25----------
body


---------119:27----------
okay and you may yawn more so that's


---------119:29----------
okay so we're gonna see


---------119:30----------
so i think it's actually useful because


---------119:32----------
like if you're tired right now let's see


---------119:34----------
how you feel


---------119:35----------
after the meditation practice and you're


---------119:37----------
allowed to say more tired if that's what


---------119:39----------
really happens that's okay


---------119:41----------
so the first thing is to balance your


---------119:43----------
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous


---------119:44----------
system there's another one that actually


---------119:45----------
increases your mana bar but let's start


---------119:47----------
with one


---------119:48----------
did that sound okay cream yep 100 okay


---------119:51----------
so sit up straight


---------119:57----------
okay so what i want you guys to do so


---------120:01----------
your back should be straight


---------120:04----------
so the simplest way to tell if your back


---------120:05----------
is straight is if your knees are lower


---------120:07----------
than your hips


---------120:10----------
your knees lower than your hips yeah


---------120:14----------
if they're not you can sit on a pillow


---------120:17----------
it'll elevate your hips


---------120:18----------
and it'll move your knees down right if


---------120:20----------
you sit on a pillow


---------120:21----------
but anyway okay so i want you guys to do


---------120:24----------
this it's kind of complicated right hand


---------120:26----------
thumb out


---------120:28----------
two fingers if you go like this that's


---------120:31----------
totally cool don't worry about it


---------120:32----------
yep awesome okay


---------120:36----------
so then what we're gonna do thumb on


---------120:38----------
your right nostril plugging it


---------120:40----------
block it and then breathe in through


---------120:42----------
your left


---------120:46----------
switch so block the other nostril with


---------120:50----------
the other two fingers


---------120:52----------
yep and breathe out


---------120:58----------
in


---------121:04----------
switch there you go


---------121:07----------
and out


---------121:13----------
in


---------121:18----------
switch and out


---------121:27----------
in and don't switch in


---------121:35----------
switch and out now close your eyes


---------121:42----------
eyes closed in


---------121:49----------
switch out


---------122:02----------
and


---------122:06----------
switch out


---------122:10----------
and now continue at your own pace we'll


---------122:12----------
practice for about 60 seconds


---------122:15----------
remember to breathe in switch on a full


---------122:19----------
breath


---------122:20----------
and then out


---------122:23----------
then in through the same nostril before


---------122:25----------
you switch again


---------123:21----------
go ahead and finish the breath that


---------123:23----------
you're on


---------123:25----------
let your eyes remain closed


---------123:28----------
and let your hands relax


---------123:34----------
and now feel the person that you are


---------123:39----------
take a note of how you feel


---------123:50----------
notice that you spend a lot of your day


---------123:52----------
thinking certain things


---------123:55----------
feeling certain things


---------124:00----------
and that those things may just be


---------124:04----------
quieter


---------124:07----------
you're still you but you're a different


---------124:11----------
kind at you


---------124:24----------
you may also notice that


---------124:27----------
fatigue could be returning you may be


---------124:29----------
feeling it more fully


---------124:31----------
it's okay too just notice whatever you


---------124:36----------
feel


---------124:44----------
when you're ready open your eyes


---------124:57----------
how do y'all feel


---------125:03----------
that was that was really cool


---------125:06----------
i feel a lot i felt like during and


---------125:10----------
after like


---------125:12----------
a lot more relaxed um


---------125:16----------
i definitely like pretty tired today but


---------125:21----------
like anxious as well and then i guess


---------125:24----------
just


---------125:25----------
yeah doing the breathing it was like it


---------125:27----------
was nice just like focus on that


---------125:29----------
and just kind of not really worry about


---------125:33----------
anything else for like a moment


---------125:35----------
so it was there's a good feeling for


---------125:37----------
sure


---------125:41----------
so i'm gonna comment on what voy boy


---------125:43----------
said for a second to teach a principle


---------125:45----------
and then i'll ask the rest of you guys


---------125:47----------
i want you to imagine how run ragged


---------125:51----------
your mind is


---------125:52----------
when you never give it a break so much


---------125:56----------
to worry about


---------125:57----------
so much to think about so much to do


---------126:03----------
your mind deserves a break from time to


---------126:04----------
time and it can feel amazing


---------126:06----------
you guys know how long we meditated


---------126:11----------
two three minutes two minutes that's it


---------126:13----------
bro


---------126:15----------
do this [ __ ] for half an hour a day you


---------126:17----------
will be a different person in eight


---------126:18----------
weeks


---------126:20----------
two minutes you guys know why i don't


---------126:23----------
teach


---------126:24----------
30 minutes of meditation on stream


---------126:29----------
why ain't nobody got time for that


---------126:32----------
right


---------126:36----------
right but what i want you guys to see is


---------126:38----------
the difference in such a small time


---------126:42----------
i gave you guys a taste before we get


---------126:44----------
you really hooked


---------126:50----------
other experiences


---------126:55----------
um go ahead for me it's just like a lot


---------126:58----------
to process just the entire


---------127:00----------
little session we had so you would take


---------127:03----------
like a step back and like


---------127:04----------
get a almost get it like pull the whole


---------127:07----------
thing out


---------127:08----------
out of a hat like to focus on like


---------127:11----------
only focus on that instead of spreading


---------127:12----------
your focus to all the things


---------127:15----------
was what i got out of it


---------127:18----------
so this is really important you guys


---------127:21----------
know


---------127:22----------
why people get stuck it's because their


---------127:25----------
focus is spread


---------127:30----------
laser focus is what creates progress


---------127:34----------
you guys think about like y'all are


---------127:35----------
generally speaking good law players


---------127:37----------
right


---------127:38----------
what's the difference between you and a


---------127:40----------
bad law player


---------127:45----------
when it comes to getting good at life i


---------127:47----------
would argue that the biggest difference


---------127:49----------
between


---------127:50----------
people who are good at life and bad at


---------127:52----------
life is spread attention versus focused


---------127:55----------
attention


---------127:56----------
if we think about discipline what is


---------127:58----------
discipline


---------127:59----------
it's the restraint of your attention


---------128:01----------
where you tell it to go


---------128:03----------
that's it so if you practice


---------128:07----------
spreading your attention and focusing it


---------128:10----------
you'll like literally get better at life


---------128:12----------
which is what the data suggests


---------128:15----------
other experiences


---------128:20----------
um my mind feels lighter i guess like


---------128:24----------
i was there's a lot of you know things


---------128:27----------
to process like you're mentioning


---------128:28----------
because there's a big topic so


---------128:30----------
you know thinking of all the stuff that


---------128:32----------
you've mentioned in the past and then


---------128:34----------
after the meditation i feel lighter and


---------128:36----------
i can like take in more


---------128:38----------
after the meditation


---------128:42----------
maybe we should have started with it


---------128:46----------
i've been a good idea yeah but that's


---------128:49----------
cool right so like i think


---------128:50----------
you guys use this word like i i always


---------128:52----------
ask people how they feel after


---------128:53----------
meditation they say relax and it pisses


---------128:55----------
me off a little bit


---------128:56----------
what you are is so much more than


---------128:57----------
relaxed bro


---------128:59----------
it's not like you just got a massage you


---------129:01----------
know like we talk about lighterness of


---------129:02----------
the mind like what is that


---------129:04----------
it's actually like something very


---------129:06----------
specific like if we hear


---------129:08----------
chris and he's kind of saying that my


---------129:10----------
mind is now more receptive i can absorb


---------129:12----------
more information


---------129:13----------
like how opi is that just imagine if you


---------129:15----------
were studying


---------129:17----------
and you were like oh [ __ ] i can absorb


---------129:19----------
more information now after


---------129:20----------
90 seconds of this ancient himalayan


---------129:22----------
technique and people would be like oh


---------129:24----------
[ __ ] that's so op


---------129:25----------
hacks


---------129:31----------
but yeah so kareem you were asking a


---------129:33----------
question how do i get better at life


---------129:35----------
you start with things like this you


---------129:38----------
start by buffing yourself


---------129:40----------
and doing things that are opie that


---------129:42----------
other noobs don't have access to


---------129:46----------
and then you crush them because you're a


---------129:47----------
[ __ ] cheater at the game of life


---------129:53----------
any last thoughts or questions for you


---------129:55----------
wrap up sorry that's


---------129:57----------
over the top


---------130:01----------
i'm gonna try i'm gonna try the the 30


---------130:04----------
minutes


---------130:05----------
and see how i feel 100 yeah yep


---------130:08----------
so can i give you guys a suggestion yep


---------130:11----------
start with two to five so remember that


---------130:15----------
the brightest candle burns out the


---------130:17----------
fastest


---------130:18----------
so you all are pumped awesome start with


---------130:21----------
five


---------130:22----------
do it a couple times a week don't sign


---------130:24----------
up for one day


---------130:25----------
you're gonna do it every day unless


---------130:27----------
you're a pretty disciplined person and


---------130:28----------
you can anchor it at some time of your


---------130:29----------
day


---------130:30----------
then fine but let yourself


---------130:33----------
don't let your enthusiasm try to


---------130:37----------
string out your enthusiasm throughout


---------130:39----------
