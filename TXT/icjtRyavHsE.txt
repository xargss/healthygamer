---------00:00----------
and if there is one thing that I think


---------00:02----------
is responsible for the most change in


---------00:04----------
meditation that I've seen it is the


---------00:06----------
development of a one pointed mind and so


---------00:09----------
the practice of meditation is about


---------00:10----------
developing one pointed mind so let's


---------00:13----------
just think a little bit about this so


---------00:15----------
here's an analogy for you guys okay


---------00:17----------
so let's say I have a light bulb so if I


---------00:19----------
have a light bulb then the light is like


---------00:22----------
shines out in all directions right so


---------00:25----------
that's just kind of what light does is


---------00:27----------
like you're sending rays in all these


---------00:28----------
different directions and that's pretty


---------00:30----------
cool but like a light bulb doesn't do


---------00:32----------
much besides provide sight right it


---------00:35----------
provides light and that's what a light


---------00:36----------
bulb is for if you get really close to a


---------00:38----------
light bulb you can start to feel heat


---------00:41----------
but it doesn't actually affect any


---------00:42----------
change in the world that just offers


---------00:44----------
some illumination so a light bulb is a


---------00:47----------
case of a source of light that is


---------00:48----------
dissipated in all directions


---------00:50----------
compare that to a laser beam so a laser


---------00:53----------
beam is a source of light or multiple


---------00:56----------
sources of light that are concentrated


---------00:58----------
through a focus and like just think


---------00:59----------
about what a laser beam can do a laser


---------01:01----------
beam can like literally cut through


---------01:03----------
things and if you think about sort of


---------01:05----------
the energy from a light bulb in the


---------01:07----------
energy from the laser beam those are


---------01:09----------
relatively I mean in theory they can be


---------01:12----------
somewhat similar but the difference


---------01:13----------
between a light bulb 'ln and laser beam


---------01:15----------
is that one has like a focused kind of


---------01:19----------
like a concentration of energy in focus


---------01:21----------
and the other one is dissipated so when


---------01:24----------
I teach people to meditate one of the


---------01:26----------
main goals that I have is to is to help


---------01:28----------
them create a concentrated mind and then


---------01:30----------
once you concentrate all of your mental


---------01:32----------
energy and you train yourself to keep it


---------01:35----------
in one area and focus it a lot of


---------01:38----------
wonderful things start to happen so the


---------01:40----------
features of a concentrated mind are


---------01:42----------
their three that we're gonna talk about


---------01:44----------
one is that it focuses so this is kind


---------01:47----------
of the ability to follow through which


---------01:48----------
we'll talk a lot about it and and this


---------01:50----------
is I think the main reason that I wanted


---------01:52----------
to talk about this today the second is


---------01:54----------
that it creates a relaxed mind in the


---------01:56----------
third is that it creates an it like an


---------01:58----------
insatiable so a concentrated mind leads


---------02:02----------
to kind of follow through leads to


---------02:05----------
relaxation and leads to enjoyment so


---------02:08----------
we're gonna talk about the first one


---------02:08----------
which is focus


---------02:10----------
so a strong mind is one that is focused


---------02:13----------
and a weak mind is one that is


---------02:14----------
dissipated so it's it's spreading his


---------02:17----------
energy in lots of different areas and if


---------02:19----------
I had to kind of go through what I think


---------02:21----------
the central problem of a lot of people


---------02:23----------
that I work with today it's that they


---------02:24----------
have a weak mind and what I mean by a


---------02:26----------
weak mind is that their mind has


---------02:28----------
dissipated it's going in this direction


---------02:29----------
it's going in that direction it's going


---------02:31----------
over here it's going over there and that


---------02:33----------
if you think about people who tend to be


---------02:35----------
accomplished in life their mind is


---------02:37----------
strong and what we think about is strong


---------02:39----------
what the way I'm defining why they're a


---------02:42----------
strong mind is one that is capable of


---------02:44----------
focus so this is also like the point


---------02:47----------
that I need to kind of make a segue with


---------02:50----------
which is that a lot of people think that


---------02:51----------
they're lazy and I get where you're


---------02:54----------
coming from like you think you're lazy


---------02:55----------
but if we really tunnel down and this is


---------02:57----------
a lot of what we're gonna do today is


---------02:58----------
we're gonna tunnel down and define in


---------03:01----------
our mind what these broad terms me so if


---------03:05----------
you think about someone who is lazy


---------03:07----------
there's someone who thinks about doing


---------03:10----------
something but doesn't actually do it


---------03:11----------
because then they start thinking about


---------03:13----------
other things like I need to clean my


---------03:15----------
room but then you're like I don't feel


---------03:17----------
like cleaning my room let me watch TV


---------03:20----------
you turn on the TV and then you're


---------03:21----------
occupied by the TV that is laziness


---------03:23----------
right but like that's laziness is like a


---------03:26----------
behavior but if we think about what's


---------03:28----------
going on in the mind it is literally a


---------03:30----------
mind that is fluctuate a mind that is


---------03:33----------
dissipated a mind that is going in


---------03:34----------
different places so laziness is a weak


---------03:38----------
mind and a weak mind it is a dissipated


---------03:40----------
mind and a strong mind is one that is


---------03:42----------
focused that once you focus your mind


---------03:44----------
and you point it in a particular


---------03:45----------
direction that's the direction that it


---------03:47----------
goes through to and this is the problem


---------03:50----------
of follow-through right so a lot of


---------03:52----------
people have difficulty with


---------03:53----------
follow-through it's like one of the most


---------03:54----------
basic problems and so if we think about


---------03:56----------
fundamentally how do we how do we fix


---------04:00----------
follow-through it is to develop a


---------04:02----------
concentrated mind a mind that is capable


---------04:04----------
of thinking about the same thing for a


---------04:07----------
long period of time and this is what I


---------04:09----------
think is awesome about meditation


---------04:11----------
because meditation is teaching youth


---------04:13----------
Hana which is literally practicing the


---------04:16----------
concentration of your mind on a single


---------04:18----------
point without wavering and if you can


---------04:20----------
attain that skill then you will no


---------04:22----------
longer be lazy


---------04:24----------
and when I say no longer be lazy what I


---------04:26----------
mean is be lazy in the way that I'm lazy


---------04:28----------
so I'm still a lazy [ __ ] you guys saw


---------04:32----------
like the dough Don on my screen and


---------04:34----------
stuff like that so like like I still am


---------04:36----------
lazy I don't like to work I don't enjoy


---------04:38----------
working but the difference between me


---------04:40----------
and a lot of other people they think


---------04:42----------
that oh I'm like super hard-working I


---------04:44----------
have a lot of willpower I'm super smart


---------04:46----------
I'm way smarter than I am but once again


---------04:49----------
I've maintained from the very beginning


---------04:50----------
I'm really not that much smarter than


---------04:52----------
anyone or may not be smarter than the


---------04:53----------
average person who's watching the stream


---------04:55----------
the difference between me and all of you


---------04:58----------
guys and I'm making assumptions there is


---------05:00----------
that I have trained my mind to


---------05:02----------
concentrate on one point


---------05:03----------
that's it it's not an issue of laziness


---------05:06----------
it's not an issue of intelligence it is


---------05:08----------
an issue of I have spent the time and


---------05:11----------
trained my mind to concentrate on one


---------05:15----------
thing that's it so let's go back to


---------05:19----------
follow-through so follow-through is due


---------05:22----------
to scattering of mind okay so like let's


---------05:25----------
just think about this one day I resolved


---------05:28----------
to do something right so I say like okay


---------05:30----------
tomorrow I'm gonna stop playing video


---------05:32----------
games or tomorrow I'm gonna like wake up


---------05:34----------
and I'm gonna work out every day and if


---------05:37----------
you think about it like if you study


---------05:38----------
your mind in that moment the resolve of


---------05:41----------
your mind is actually like through the


---------05:42----------
roof the power of your mind is actually


---------05:45----------
really high it's not that you're like


---------05:47----------
half-assing your desire or your your


---------05:50----------
your desire to commit to something


---------05:52----------
you're committed in that moment your


---------05:53----------
commitment is real it's authentic and


---------05:55----------
you're like you're really hardcore


---------05:57----------
you're not deluding yourself you're not


---------05:59----------
faking it you're not pretending the


---------06:01----------
power of your mind in that moment is


---------06:03----------
actually really strong so why don't


---------06:07----------
people follow through so you're like


---------06:08----------
yeah tomorrow tomorrow I'm gonna do it


---------06:10----------
I'm gonna go to the gym and you resolve


---------06:11----------
to yourself if you think about it the


---------06:13----------
power of the mind in that moment is


---------06:14----------
actually strong the next day we say that


---------06:17----------
your resolve wavers so what does that


---------06:20----------
truly mean what goes on in the mind does


---------06:22----------
it mean that the strength of your mind


---------06:23----------
is different so you may think so you may


---------06:26----------
think like oh I had all that passion and


---------06:28----------
that that energy then and today I don't


---------06:30----------
but if I would argue that the strength


---------06:32----------
of your mind is still the same the


---------06:34----------
analytical capability of mind is still


---------06:36----------
the same


---------06:36----------
it's actually the focus that has been


---------06:39----------
lost that a resolution of mind is a high


---------06:42----------
degree of focus on one area and then you


---------06:45----------
were focused and I was looking over


---------06:46----------
there okay Jim Jim Jim Jim Jim and then


---------06:48----------
the next day video games


---------06:51----------
Netflix going to the grocery store


---------06:53----------
hanging out with my friends going to the


---------06:55----------
dog Oh Jim I feel like hanging out with


---------06:58----------
my dog I got to take my dog for the walk


---------07:00----------
I got a shower I got a clean I gotta do


---------07:02----------
this I gotta do that I got to play some


---------07:04----------
dota I got to watch some Netflix so it's


---------07:07----------
not actually strength of the mind it's


---------07:10----------
not analytical capability it's not


---------07:11----------
intelligence it's not laziness it is


---------07:14----------
concentration is it it is a fluctuation


---------07:17----------
and your ability to focus so your mind


---------07:21----------
resolves in one direction and then it


---------07:23----------
resolves in the complete opposite like


---------07:24----------
oh yeah I'm gonna go to the gym tomorrow


---------07:26----------
you wake up the next day I'm gonna play


---------07:27----------
some dota like just think about how


---------07:29----------
resolved your mind is you think about


---------07:31----------
that as a loss of resolution it isn't a


---------07:34----------
loss of resolution you are super


---------07:36----------
resolved to going to the gym yesterday


---------07:38----------
and you are equally resolved to do


---------07:40----------
anything but go to the gym today this is


---------07:43----------
what procrastination is right you are


---------07:46----------
you are resolved to do anything but the


---------07:48----------
work that needs to be done so your mind


---------07:51----------
is still has the same degree of


---------07:53----------
resolution it just it's focus is lacking


---------07:56----------
the resolution fluctuates what you put


---------07:59----------
your mind to fluctuates over time so the


---------08:03----------
fundamental problem with follow 3 and


---------08:05----------
procrastination or all this [ __ ] is a


---------08:07----------
lack of concentration on one point in


---------08:09----------
the mind so your mind thinks in one way


---------08:12----------
and then thinks in the other way so it's


---------08:15----------
not about strength it's not about lake


---------08:16----------
laziness it's about focus so the goal of


---------08:19----------
meditation is to develop a practice


---------08:22----------
where you train your mind to focus on


---------08:26----------
one point and once it learns how to


---------08:28----------
focus on one point it's sort of like


---------08:30----------
teaching a dog like a trick right like


---------08:32----------
once you train a dog like once you train


---------08:34----------
it how to be potty trained then like it


---------08:36----------
knows like where do we use the bathroom


---------08:38----------
and at the beginning it's tough but once


---------08:40----------
it knows where to use the bathroom it


---------08:42----------
always goes there and it does the


---------08:43----------
bathroom where it's supposed to


---------08:45----------
and so the difference between me and a


---------08:48----------
lot of the people who think that I'm Way


---------08:49----------
smarter or way over Harvard and a


---------08:51----------
fivehead nd whatever is it's not that


---------08:54----------
I'm smarter it's not that I have greater


---------08:56----------
willpower


---------08:56----------
I'm still lazy it's just that I have


---------08:59----------
like levelled up my concentration skill


---------09:01----------
and by leveling up my concentration


---------09:03----------
skill what I'm able to do is I tell my


---------09:05----------
mind to do something and then it


---------09:07----------
actually like runs with that for a while


---------09:09----------
it doesn't run with it forever but it


---------09:11----------
runs with it longer than many other


---------09:13----------
people and I'd say that's the difference


---------09:15----------
between like where I was let's say at


---------09:17----------
the age of 21 and where I am today which


---------09:20----------
is like 15 16 years later which is that


---------09:22----------
ice I learned how to like concentrate my


---------09:24----------
mind and then I started like


---------09:25----------
concentrating it and I'd say like okay


---------09:28----------
I'm gonna do some research so I like sat


---------09:29----------
down and like I did research for a while


---------09:31----------
still played a lot of video games still


---------09:32----------
did a lot of procrastination but I


---------09:34----------
learned enough of the skill of


---------09:36----------
concentration to where my mind was


---------09:38----------
focused on one thing so the next quality


---------09:41----------
of the mind is that a mind is is relaxed


---------09:45----------
and is also like enjoyable so if we


---------09:49----------
think about people who describe a flow


---------09:51----------
state so there I get a lot of questions


---------09:52----------
about a flow state so a flow state is is


---------09:55----------
a state of mind where your mind is kind


---------09:56----------
of like concentrated on one thing and


---------09:58----------
people find the experience of a flow


---------10:00----------
state to be Pleasant right it's like fun


---------10:02----------
to be in a flow State it's fun to sort


---------10:04----------
of be lost in like a certain kind of


---------10:06----------
work like if I'm sitting down and I'm


---------10:08----------
painting I don't paint but I've talked


---------10:10----------
to people who have painted and they sort


---------10:11----------
of enter this meditative state where


---------10:12----------
they really enjoy it they're absorbed in


---------10:14----------
the painting they're doing exactly what


---------10:15----------
they want to do it's kind of fun it's


---------10:17----------
relaxing and it's concentrated so those


---------10:20----------
three things go together right focus of


---------10:22----------
the mind relaxation and to find


---------10:24----------
something enjoyable and so now let's


---------10:27----------
think about this for a second so like -


---------10:29----------
like what does that mean if you say that


---------10:30----------
a concentrated mind is enjoyable but


---------10:32----------
aren't like external things enjoyable


---------10:35----------
like when we think about enjoyment we


---------10:37----------
don't think about a state of mind right


---------10:39----------
we think about an external thing so I


---------10:41----------
say like okay I enjoy a movie or I enjoy


---------10:43----------
a particular food or I enjoy spending


---------10:45----------
time with someone so like we think about


---------10:47----------
enjoyment is coming from external things


---------10:49----------
we don't try to understand enjoyment in


---------10:51----------
terms of ourself so let's do that for a


---------10:53----------
second let's try to see if we can


---------10:55----------
understand the nature of enjoyment and


---------10:57----------
how enjoyment relates to


---------10:59----------
my mind so it is my belief or my


---------11:05----------
experience that enjoyment has to do with


---------11:07----------
concentration of the mind and if we


---------11:08----------
think about enjoyable experiences if we


---------11:11----------
actually study our mind while we are


---------11:13----------
enjoying something we will see that our


---------11:15----------
mind is concentrated so if I go to the


---------11:17----------
movies and like the movie is engaging


---------11:19----------
then my mind is fully focused on the


---------11:22----------
movie I mean then my mind is fully


---------11:23----------
focused on the movie right and that


---------11:25----------
means I'm enjoying the movie the


---------11:27----------
definition of a movie that's enjoyable


---------11:28----------
is one that fully concentrates your mind


---------11:30----------
and so let's think about what can cause


---------11:33----------
a movie to not be enjoyable let's say


---------11:35----------
someone rings of their cell phone rings


---------11:38----------
and they start talking in the theater


---------11:39----------
what does that do to your enjoyment it


---------11:41----------
shatters your enjoyment what does that


---------11:43----------
do to the concentration of your mind the


---------11:45----------
reason that that makes your your mind


---------11:47----------
not have fun is because your


---------11:49----------
concentration moves from the movie to


---------11:51----------
the the person who's talking on the cell


---------11:52----------
phone so we can see that as the


---------11:54----------
concentration of your mind wavers our


---------11:57----------
enjoyment drops and if we think about


---------12:00----------
something like a boring movie so what is


---------12:03----------
a movie that we call boring it's a movie


---------12:05----------
that doesn't capture our attention and


---------12:07----------
concentrate our mind on the movie our


---------12:10----------
mind starts to wander that's what


---------12:12----------
happens when you're bored your mind


---------12:13----------
starts to wander and boredom is the


---------12:15----------
opposite of enjoyment therefore we can


---------12:17----------
see that like enjoyment involves


---------12:19----------
concentration of the mind and boredom


---------12:21----------
involves a wandering mind and therefore


---------12:23----------
is like a wandering mind is going to be


---------12:25----------
an unenjoyable mind right it's kind of


---------12:28----------
like simple if you just stop and you


---------12:29----------
look at the nature of enjoyment you'll


---------12:32----------
see that enjoyment involves


---------12:33----------
concentration of the mind and if you can


---------12:35----------
shatter or change the concentration of


---------12:37----------
the mind that experiences is going to be


---------12:39----------
less enjoyable okay I'm talking in


---------12:42----------
sweeping generalizations and I'm sort of


---------12:44----------
doing that for educational purposes or


---------12:46----------
instructive purposes so you can also


---------12:49----------
think about other things like let's say


---------12:50----------
you get a massage so like when you get a


---------12:53----------
massage if the massage is like really


---------12:54----------
good your mind is concentrating on the


---------12:57----------
massage you're like feeling let's say


---------12:58----------
they're like they're massaging your neck


---------13:00----------
or your shoulders or something like that


---------13:01----------
and then like you're fully focused on


---------13:03----------
that and you're like man that feels


---------13:04----------
amazing or if you're eating food like if


---------13:07----------
you really really enjoy food if you eat


---------13:08----------
something that's delicious like take a


---------13:10----------
bite of something and it's just like so


---------13:11----------
delicious you're my


---------13:12----------
is concentrated on that point right like


---------13:15----------
that's kind of how it works


---------13:16----------
and then like imagine you're at a


---------13:17----------
massage like you're getting a massage


---------13:19----------
and then your cell phone rings and then


---------13:20----------
it sort of like breaks your immersion


---------13:22----------
and if it breaks your emotion the


---------13:24----------
concentration of your mind begins to


---------13:26----------
waver and is the concentration of your


---------13:28----------
mind begins to waver then you you start


---------13:30----------
to experience less enjoyment so along


---------13:35----------
with enjoyment I'm sort of tossing in


---------13:37----------
relaxed we're gonna kind of gloss over


---------13:38----------
that for now but the next point that I


---------13:41----------
kind of want to talk about is that a


---------13:42----------
concentrated mind is capable of greater


---------13:44----------
understanding it's not just analysis but


---------13:47----------
it's kind of like this issue of like a


---------13:49----------
light bulb or a laser beam where if I


---------13:51----------
concentrate my mind


---------13:54----------
the amount of understanding I'm able to


---------13:57----------
gain from a particular set of like


---------14:00----------
information is gonna be way greater so


---------14:03----------
I've talked about this a little bit on


---------14:04----------
stream before but if you think about the


---------14:06----------
process of studying right like if I


---------14:08----------
study like let's say I have a textbook


---------14:10----------
in the first page of the textbook I'm


---------14:12----------
reading it and I read it and I like


---------14:15----------
don't understand it so I read it again


---------14:17----------
and I read it again and I read it again


---------14:19----------
and the fifth time I read it I


---------14:20----------
understand everything on the page so


---------14:23----------
let's just think about how that works


---------14:25----------
from sort of like a like a science or


---------14:28----------
mathematics of the mind does that mean


---------14:31----------
that with each time I read the paper I


---------14:33----------
gain 20 percent of the information no


---------14:35----------
because there are other times where I


---------14:38----------
can read the page once and I understand


---------14:40----------
everything that the page says so why do


---------14:43----------
I sometimes have to read the page five


---------14:44----------
times and other times I have to read the


---------14:46----------
page once it's because of the nature of


---------14:49----------
the concentration of my mind if I'm


---------14:51----------
studying and someone is distracting me


---------14:54----------
then I have to read the page multiple


---------14:56----------
times the greater the distraction the


---------14:58----------
more I have to to read the page if I'm


---------15:01----------
fully focused then I have to read the


---------15:03----------
page fewer times so if we think about


---------15:05----------
things like let's say adderall or other


---------15:08----------
medications that artificially improve


---------15:10----------
your focus like caffeine these are


---------15:13----------
things that increase the concentration


---------15:15----------
of the mind increase our ability to


---------15:17----------
focus and improve the quality of


---------15:19----------
studying but at the end of the day the


---------15:22----------
key thing is it's not the adderall makes


---------15:23----------
you a better study err it's that anytime


---------15:25----------
your


---------15:27----------
is focused on one thing you're able to


---------15:29----------
understand more so this has nothing to


---------15:35----------
do with logic or analysis it just means


---------15:38----------
that we're sort of focusing our mind on


---------15:40----------
one thing and the more that you focus


---------15:42----------
your mind the the easier it is to


---------15:45----------
understand and that applies to more than


---------15:47----------
just studying as well so just another


---------15:50----------
way to think about it is like if I go to


---------15:52----------
the library and I'm studying but I'm


---------15:53----------
stressed out about something let's say


---------15:55----------
that I'm worried that you know like my


---------15:58----------
my one of my parents is sick and if we


---------16:01----------
think about how does worry affect our


---------16:03----------
ability to study so when we worry our


---------16:05----------
concentration from the piece of paper


---------16:08----------
waivers to other things right the


---------16:10----------
concentration of the mind dissipates the


---------16:12----------
mind becomes weaker and we're unable to


---------16:14----------
focus as we're unable to focus it


---------16:16----------
becomes more difficult to study so we


---------16:19----------
can see that at the end of the day it is


---------16:21----------
all about concentration of the mind so


---------16:24----------
I'll give you guys a couple of other


---------16:26----------
examples so when I work with people like


---------16:29----------
some cool stuff sometimes happens so I


---------16:31----------
teach people how to meditate and I think


---------16:33----------
one of the biggest things that's


---------16:34----------
responsible for their the changes in


---------16:36----------
their life is is meditating and people


---------16:38----------
are kind of like well why should I


---------16:39----------
meditate what does it do for me and so


---------16:41----------
it's hard for me to kind of describe


---------16:42----------
until now because I sort of sat down and


---------16:44----------
concentrated on this and then figured it


---------16:47----------
out and that's why we started stream


---------16:48----------
late but it all comes down to focusing


---------16:51----------
the mind so I had a patient who I had


---------16:53----------
taught to meditate and they wanted to


---------16:55----------
quit smoking and so they would come to


---------16:57----------
my office every week and we do this


---------16:58----------
technique called motivational


---------16:59----------
interviewing which is sort of an


---------17:01----------
evidence-based psychotherapy or


---------17:04----------
intervention that you can do that helps


---------17:06----------
people stop using substances that they


---------17:08----------
don't want to use and we did


---------17:10----------
motivational interviewing for awhile I'm


---------17:12----------
a pretty good therapist they were pretty


---------17:13----------
committed and they still sort of like


---------17:14----------
they would stop smoking for a while and


---------17:16----------
they would continue smoking after they


---------17:17----------
would like relapse and they'd start


---------17:19----------
smoking again they'd stop start stop


---------17:21----------
start so this is all a wavering mind


---------17:23----------
right so they as they continued to


---------17:27----------
meditate they ended up going hiking and


---------17:29----------
they were doing some mountain climbing


---------17:31----------
and one day their mind just sort of


---------17:35----------
focused on one point so they were like


---------17:37----------
like climbing a mountain and they


---------17:38----------
started like


---------17:39----------
huffing and puffing and they were like


---------17:41----------
oh wow


---------17:45----------
smoking is my breath and the more I


---------17:48----------
smoke the harder it is for me to breathe


---------17:50----------
and my breath is more important to me


---------17:54----------
than smoking is and they quit and


---------17:57----------
they've quit smoking it's just it just


---------17:59----------
happened like they had this moment of


---------18:01----------
realization where you know


---------18:04----------
intellectually let that makes perfect


---------18:05----------
sense logically that makes perfect sense


---------18:08----------
like it's not any like rocket science


---------18:10----------
that smoking and breath are related like


---------18:12----------
everyone knows that but it's not


---------18:14----------
information or logic that actually


---------18:16----------
causes people to change their behavior


---------18:18----------
it's understanding and in that moment I


---------18:21----------
think this is because she was meditating


---------18:23----------
among lots of other things so you can


---------18:25----------
argue about what happened there with her


---------18:26----------
but in my experience this is what I see


---------18:29----------
when I teach people to meditate is that


---------18:31----------
they have a degree of like focus and


---------18:33----------
concentration in their mind where they


---------18:35----------
sort of have this revelation and then


---------18:37----------
they have some kind of understanding and


---------18:39----------
once they have that understanding then


---------18:41----------
their behavior changes it's kind of like


---------18:43----------
really hard to describe but but that's


---------18:45----------
what I see time and time and time again


---------18:47----------
and this is what we call kind of the


---------18:50----------
light bulb going off in someone's mind


---------18:52----------
right they're like something clicks and


---------18:53----------
then they change and it's my belief that


---------18:56----------
clicking is facilitated through the


---------18:59----------
concentration of mind and that that


---------19:01----------
concentration of mind leads to greater


---------19:03----------
understanding because like your mind is


---------19:05----------
fully focused you're kind of fully zoned


---------19:06----------
into that and then you're able to


---------19:08----------
understand things in kind of a different


---------19:09----------
way and the cool thing about this is


---------19:12----------
that when I teach people to meditate


---------19:13----------
it's not just like one part of their


---------19:16----------
life gets better so when I work with


---------19:18----------
people usually what happens is like a


---------19:19----------
lot of different dimensions of their


---------19:21----------
life gets better they get happier in


---------19:23----------
their job sometimes they change jobs


---------19:25----------
they get their like their marriages


---------19:27----------
improve they start to feel like better


---------19:29----------
about themselves their confidence


---------19:30----------
improves they start to take better


---------19:32----------
physical care of themselves it's kind of


---------19:34----------
bizarre like they're like every


---------19:35----------
dimension of their life starts to change


---------19:37----------
and I don't think it's because I'm a


---------19:39----------
miracle worker I mean I think in general


---------19:41----------
there's this saying in psychiatry that


---------19:42----------
all boats rise together so there's a


---------19:45----------
water level and like if you have you


---------19:47----------
know arthritis and depression if your


---------19:49----------
arthritis gets better than your


---------19:50----------
depression gets better if your


---------19:51----------
depression gets better there's your


---------19:53----------
try to skits - there's a lot of evidence


---------19:54----------
that suggests that this is just common


---------19:56----------
within humans but in my experience I've


---------19:59----------
seen the application of meditation work


---------20:01----------
in each of their dimension of their life


---------20:04----------
because once you concentrate your mind


---------20:06----------
and you understand the thinking of your


---------20:08----------
mind better you understand that things


---------20:09----------
around you better you understand work


---------20:10----------
dynamics better you work understand


---------20:12----------
relationship dynamics better you


---------20:13----------
understand yourself better so


---------20:15----------
concentration of the mind sort of helps


---------20:17----------
your mind be fully focused on analyzing


---------20:20----------
all these problems and so it sort of


---------20:22----------
makes sense that all of them are going


---------20:23----------
to improve because if you improve if you


---------20:26----------
level up the instrument through which


---------20:28----------
you're like acting in all of these


---------20:30----------
dimensions in your life and then all of


---------20:33----------
those dimensions are going to get better


---------20:35----------
right it's not anything magical it's


---------20:37----------
sort of like if I'm playing an RPG and I


---------20:39----------
have a sword and like I get a better


---------20:41----------
sword like my DPS against all kinds of


---------20:44----------
monsters is going to go up that's just


---------20:45----------
how the mind works so meditation is


---------20:49----------
about developing concentration of the


---------20:50----------
mind and the first way to develop


---------20:53----------
concentration of the mind is the Hana


---------20:55----------
pattern means a focusing practice and


---------20:57----------
we're gonna get to that okay I'm gonna


---------20:59----------
take a break for a second because I got


---------21:00----------
a drink with some water and then also I


---------21:02----------
want to just check in because I can't


---------21:03----------
see chat okay okay I'm gonna just check


---------21:22----------
in with you guys so like how is this for


---------21:24----------
y'all is this good like is that you guys


---------21:31----------
with me okay it's like this is like a


---------21:33----------
summary from like start to finish to


---------21:34----------
understand these different things okay


---------21:36----------
so I'm gonna talk for a few more minutes


---------21:38----------
and we're gonna get to questions okay


---------21:42----------
all right so now we're gonna talk about


---------21:45----------
gaming okay so let's just think about


---------21:49----------
like what effect does gaming okay I'm


---------21:51----------
gonna interact a little bit with chat on


---------21:53----------
this one okay what an effect isn't


---------21:55----------
gaming have on the mind what is gaming


---------21:57----------
do to your mind


---------22:08----------
okay so I'm seeing a lot of different


---------22:11----------
stuff right great so some people are


---------22:14----------
saying focus some people are saying


---------22:15----------
distraction so when you are playing a


---------22:18----------
game is your mind thinking about a lot


---------22:21----------
of things or thinking about one thing


---------22:28----------
that is focused right so we're not


---------22:31----------
talking about and good someone said this


---------22:33----------
depends that is focused that's what I'm


---------22:35----------
not talking about like so like


---------22:36----------
distraction and psychology


---------22:39----------
and dopamine and neuroscience we're not


---------22:41----------
talking about any of that right now


---------22:42----------
we're just talking about understanding


---------22:45----------
literally what is happening in your mind


---------22:47----------
in a moment is it focused or is it


---------22:48----------
wavering and people are saying it


---------22:51----------
depends right people are saying escape


---------22:53----------
so let's just think about that the


---------22:55----------
reason it is an escape is because your


---------22:57----------
mind doesn't want to think about this


---------22:58----------
and when I play a game I get lost in the


---------23:01----------
game I get focused in the game so this


---------23:04----------
is important video games create an


---------23:06----------
artificial set or non or artificial mr.


---------23:09----------
they they concentrate your mind on the


---------23:11----------
game and this and remember what is a


---------23:14----------
concentrated mind do it makes a


---------23:16----------
concentrated mind is enjoyable and


---------23:18----------
relaxed right so your mind really really


---------23:22----------
enjoys gaming because gaming is an


---------23:23----------
artificial sort of induction of like


---------23:27----------
Adana it's almost like a tyrant like it


---------23:29----------
focuses your mind and then you can


---------23:31----------
forget about everything else and that


---------23:32----------
feels really good because it feels good


---------23:35----------
to have a concentrated mind now let's


---------23:38----------
think through a couple of examples in


---------23:39----------
gaming where your mind wavers in its


---------23:43----------
concentration and let's see what impact


---------23:46----------
it has on like the enjoyment so let's


---------23:52----------
say that I'm playing the game like let's


---------23:54----------
say I'm playing a game of overwatch and


---------23:57----------
I'm just focusing on like I'm playing


---------24:00----------
reinhardt and like I'm focusing on like


---------24:02----------
like like you know just blocking


---------24:06----------
people's like I'm focusing on you know


---------24:08----------
shielding whatever thing is moving


---------24:11----------
actually let's forget about it watch


---------24:12----------
because again my mind is not able to


---------24:14----------
come up with the analogy as well enough


---------24:16----------
okay so let's let's talk about data so


---------24:18----------
if I'm playing a game of dota let's say


---------24:21----------
yeah cuz I just can't I can't compute


---------24:23----------
the analogies so if I'm playing a game


---------24:26----------
of dota like I'm focused on winning my


---------24:27----------
lane right and I'm like super super


---------24:29----------
focused on winning in my lane I'm having


---------24:31----------
fun and then someone like tee pees down


---------24:35----------
to my lane and feeds and then what does


---------24:38----------
my mind do right so like if I start


---------24:41----------
thinking if I stop thinking about the


---------24:43----------
game and start thinking about what


---------24:45----------
someone else is doing in the game then I


---------24:48----------
start to rage or tilt right that's true


---------24:50----------
of all games so forget about which one


---------24:52----------
but let's just think about at that point


---------24:54----------
what is my mind actually thinking about


---------24:56----------
it's not thinking about the game it's


---------24:58----------
thinking about this other person and the


---------25:01----------
more that I think about my teammates


---------25:04----------
what does that do to my enjoyment of the


---------25:06----------
game it drops like a [ __ ] lodestone


---------25:12----------
the more that I just played the game if


---------25:14----------
I'm playing the game I'm like let's see


---------25:15----------
what we can do like like if I'm focused


---------25:17----------
on the game I'm just playing the game


---------25:18----------
but if I start thinking about my


---------25:19----------
teammates then my enjoyment of the game


---------25:21----------
stopped goes down right and I can kind


---------25:24----------
of like fluctuate like my mind is like


---------25:26----------
oh this guy's are [ __ ] this guy's an


---------25:27----------
idiot like this guy's doing this this


---------25:29----------
guy's doing that and then my enjoyment


---------25:31----------
of the game goes down and then when I


---------25:34----------
start thinking about like if I just play


---------25:38----------
the game like so I know you guys have


---------25:40----------
done this because everyone has done this


---------25:41----------
right where you play the game and then


---------25:43----------
you have someone on your team who's bad


---------25:45----------
but you don't really think about that


---------25:47----------
you're like okay this guy's gonna show


---------25:48----------
up and he's gonna die


---------25:49----------
but like I'm gonna still like I'm just


---------25:51----------
gonna play the game and we can still win


---------25:52----------
and the more that you focus on the game


---------25:55----------
and like they're people that die and


---------25:56----------
whether you're playing overwatch or dota


---------25:58----------
they're their noobs that are dying like


---------26:00----------
all the time


---------26:01----------
in any game they're gonna be noobs that


---------26:04----------
are dying so why is it that one game you


---------26:06----------
rage in one game you don't it's because


---------26:08----------
in one game your concentration or your


---------26:10----------
focus remains on the game and on the


---------26:13----------
other one your your concentration


---------26:15----------
dissipates and it starts to think about


---------26:18----------
other people so as long as you focus


---------26:21----------
your attention on one thing and just


---------26:23----------
play the game then your performance


---------26:26----------
improves your enjoyment improves


---------26:28----------
and it's just an overall better


---------26:30----------
experience and people know that right so


---------26:32----------
like when you mute your allies what is


---------26:35----------
that doing for your mind


---------26:37----------
it is literally helping your mind retain


---------26:41----------
focus on the game and if you mute your


---------26:43----------
allies you are gonna have a better game


---------26:48----------
and like so this is what I'm trying to


---------26:51----------
tell you guys is that the mind works in


---------26:53----------
this way like if I'm let's say like I'm


---------26:57----------
having a great meal that I really enjoy


---------26:59----------
like let's say I go to a sports bar and


---------27:01----------
I'm having some wings and I'm watching


---------27:03----------
like UT football and then like someone


---------27:07----------
comes in and starts playing the bagpipes


---------27:09----------
like that's not gonna be a fun


---------27:11----------
experience for if I can mute the bad


---------27:15----------
bagpipes I'm gonna like go back to like


---------27:18----------
enjoying the game but the more that your


---------27:20----------
mind is focused not only do you perform


---------27:22----------
better you understand things better it's


---------27:25----------
more enjoyable it's more relaxed right


---------27:31----------
like that's how the mind works


---------27:33----------
so gaming creates an artificial sense of


---------27:36----------
focus it's not artificial I mean it


---------27:37----------
creates a focus mind that's why it's fun


---------27:39----------
what I mean by artificial is it doesn't


---------27:42----------
it doesn't it's not because our training


---------27:44----------
our mind to do that it automatically


---------27:46----------
does that for us and generally speaking


---------27:48----------
when we talk about things being


---------27:49----------
enjoyable those are things that


---------27:51----------
artificially cause our mind to focus on


---------27:54----------
something so even delicious food versus


---------27:56----------
like less delicious food the delicious


---------28:00----------
food is gonna cause our mind to be


---------28:01----------
focused on it's like wow like that


---------28:03----------
flavor oh my god there's like Meyer


---------28:05----------
lemon in there and a hint of pepper and


---------28:08----------
you can really taste that that rendered


---------28:10----------
bacon fat like it's crisp it's delicious


---------28:13----------
it's fresh it's got a hint of heat like


---------28:17----------
you know that's enjoyment it's


---------28:19----------
understanding enjoyment relaxation they


---------28:21----------
all come together thank you guys for the


---------28:25----------
sub subs okay so let


---------28:33----------
just that's that's my schpeel okay so


---------28:36----------
I'm gonna summarize so at the end of the


---------28:39----------
day the first thing that we're gonna


---------28:40----------
learn is Dharma pattern a is the


---------28:43----------
Sanskrit word for focus it spelled eh-eh


---------28:46----------
are a na da Derna okay


---------28:50----------
what is dodged I don't know what that


---------28:52----------
means
