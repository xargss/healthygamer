thank you for having me i see you are


---------00:47----------
very vibrant still


---------00:49----------
and colorful okay i used to not be i


---------00:53----------
literally got my hair dyed not even two


---------00:55----------
days ago


---------00:56----------
um yeah it looks great thank you what


---------00:59----------
what prompted getting the hair dyed


---------01:02----------
um my i always hear my mom say like oh


---------01:06----------
my god like i wish i


---------01:07----------
could have pink hair of blue hair but


---------01:09----------
i'm too old and a lot of my friends have


---------01:12----------
colored hair and i was like


---------01:13----------
i'm just i'm just gonna do it i i'm i


---------01:16----------
used to be really attached to my hair


---------01:17----------
so it's kind of empowering to just be


---------01:19----------
like yeah i'm gonna bleach the entirety


---------01:20----------
of my head and make it pink


---------01:23----------
what's empowering about that help me


---------01:24----------
understand that


---------01:26----------
i think um


---------01:29----------
a lot of my life has been caring about


---------01:32----------
the perception


---------01:33----------
of myself to others and while i do care


---------01:37----------
uh i don't want that to hold me back


---------01:38----------
from expressing myself and so


---------01:40----------
this was like very different than i


---------01:43----------
think even my last yourself would expect


---------01:46----------
from me


---------01:47----------
what was your last year of self it had


---------01:49----------
would have expected from you


---------01:51----------
i think my last yourself and all the


---------01:54----------
years prior


---------01:55----------
especially with streaming uh has cared a


---------01:58----------
lot about


---------01:59----------
how my first impression is


---------02:02----------
like when people make that first


---------02:04----------
judgment of you


---------02:06----------
or even see you on a thumbnail while


---------02:07----------
they're scrolling twitch


---------02:09----------
like i wanted to be perceived in a


---------02:11----------
certain way


---------02:12----------
i see um in order to yeah how did that


---------02:15----------
change


---------02:17----------
oh i got so sick and tired of it i was


---------02:19----------
just like oh like i'm not


---------02:21----------
myself i don't fee like i feel like i'm


---------02:24----------
constantly trying to appeal to something


---------02:26----------
that is not what i want


---------02:27----------
um yeah so it was kind of more just like


---------02:31----------
like rebellion kind of thing oh wow okay


---------02:35----------
so it sounds like you've discovered


---------02:37----------
yourself


---------02:39----------
well maybe maybe we're like halfway


---------02:41----------
there okay


---------02:42----------
uh so cool that's um sorry for diving


---------02:45----------
right in i i don't know if this is yeah


---------02:47----------
i don't mind at all is there i was just


---------02:48----------
curious about you know the appearance


---------02:50----------
because it happened two days ago and it


---------02:51----------
seems like


---------02:52----------
yeah it's like significant for you


---------02:55----------
that you did this thing um


---------02:58----------
definitely is i feel i feel really happy


---------03:01----------
though like i'm giddy about it


---------03:02----------
so yeah so you're you're like expressing


---------03:05----------
yourself


---------03:07----------
and it's is there something in


---------03:09----------
particular that you want to talk about


---------03:10----------
today or


---------03:12----------
anything that maybe i could help you


---------03:13----------
with when


---------03:15----------
i was asked that question we had listed


---------03:18----------
off


---------03:19----------
the feeling just of being a girl as a


---------03:23----------
streamer and how


---------03:24----------
you're kind of pushing against the grain


---------03:26----------
and then


---------03:28----------
uh how intrusive thoughts make me feel


---------03:33----------
kind of like inherently terrible


---------03:37----------
um they have a way of doing that


---------03:41----------
and i think i struggle with


---------03:46----------
trust friendships


---------03:49----------
okay and that would be all that i can


---------03:52----------
think of right now


---------03:54----------
that's plenty he thinks jody


---------03:58----------
what do you want to start with so we've


---------03:59----------
got intrusive thoughts


---------04:01----------
uh being a female on twitch um


---------04:05----------
and uh trusts and friendships


---------04:10----------
what feels um any of them


---------04:14----------
feel equally as okay so yeah so let me


---------04:17----------
just


---------04:17----------
maybe i can just ask you a little bit


---------04:19----------
about yourself and kind of lay like a


---------04:20----------
foundation for like maybe 10 or 15


---------04:22----------
minutes and then we can kind of see


---------04:23----------
where that takes us


---------04:26----------
i suddenly find myself feeling like


---------04:27----------
really excited to like dig into this


---------04:29----------
stuff with you and i hope we can really


---------04:31----------
learn something together


---------04:32----------
um and i'm optimistic that we can it's


---------04:35----------
weird i'm feeling


---------04:36----------
unusual maybe it's just because you're


---------04:37----------
so energetic i'm like oh


---------04:39----------
i'm like nervous am so nervous i feel


---------04:42----------
like i'm jittering


---------04:44----------
so i thought you know it's kind of


---------04:45----------
exciting i mean i'm excited i am but i'm


---------04:48----------
also extremely nervous and try i think


---------04:50----------
i'm trying to cope with that nervousness


---------04:51----------
by


---------04:52----------
being extra wobbly


---------04:55----------
oh no i wonder if now i will feel


---------04:58----------
anxious


---------04:59----------
and bubbly okay no no no i'm not feeling


---------05:02----------
i'm excited


---------05:03----------
i'm i'm just as equally excited okay


---------05:05----------
let's let's ask you so can you tell me a


---------05:07----------
little bit about


---------05:08----------
what growing up was like for you oh


---------05:12----------
um


---------05:16----------
growing up


---------05:19----------
i think i was a really happy kid like i


---------05:22----------
i looked


---------05:22----------
back on my childhood with fondness i've


---------05:26----------
there was also some traumatic


---------05:27----------
experiences and such but everything


---------05:30----------
who doesn't go through that and then um


---------05:34----------
i mean my family is really supportive my


---------05:37----------
parents are super supportive of what i


---------05:38----------
do i mean my hair is pink and they still


---------05:40----------
love me and it's great and they're like


---------05:42----------
oh my god i love it


---------05:43----------
and uh i've gamed my whole life


---------05:46----------
my my parents gamed actually like i


---------05:48----------
remember


---------05:49----------
just like waking up in the middle of


---------05:51----------
night and hearing them play halo


---------05:52----------
on like legendary campaign until 2am um


---------05:56----------
so they're like very uh


---------06:00----------
understanding and with the times i would


---------06:02----------
say


---------06:03----------
wow interesting so yeah you know


---------06:05----------
ballpark answers are fine how old are


---------06:07----------
your parents i'm


---------06:10----------
oh yeah yeah my dad is


---------06:15----------
57


---------06:17----------
and i want to say my mom is 46.


---------06:23----------
so how did they learn how to use a


---------06:25----------
controller


---------06:27----------
i have no idea um it's very unusual


---------06:32----------
my i'm sure that my brother


---------06:35----------
influenced my parents gaming so my


---------06:37----------
brother was super into gaming as well


---------06:38----------
growing up


---------06:39----------
more even than me and then i'm sure that


---------06:42----------
through my brother's interest in gaming


---------06:43----------
that my parents were like oh well now we


---------06:45----------
have this console let's give it a try


---------06:47----------
um so that would have been around the


---------06:49----------
time it would be like


---------06:51----------
yeah around 7 20 20 something years ago


---------06:53----------
because i'm 23.


---------06:54----------
so okay took the next question out of my


---------06:58----------
mouth and how old is your brother it


---------06:59----------
sounds like he's older


---------07:00----------
yeah he's 20 25


---------07:05----------
6. okay i should know that i should


---------07:08----------
definitely know that


---------07:08----------
no no we're ballparking you do know that


---------07:10----------
right we're just ballparking for privacy


---------07:13----------
yeah and you have one brother


---------07:16----------
yeah any other siblings no just one


---------07:19----------
brother can you tell me a little bit


---------07:20----------
about him


---------07:23----------
um he is


---------07:27----------
opposite of me okay in many ways


---------07:31----------
i think that i don't know what that


---------07:33----------
means though because i don't know you


---------07:35----------
right he is


---------07:41----------
a lot of the things that i saw growing


---------07:43----------
up that i didn't like was actually in my


---------07:45----------
brother


---------07:45----------
and so i tried to go the opposite way


---------07:49----------
um he i don't consider him a very


---------07:54----------
considerate individual i think he's very


---------07:57----------
in his head about himself


---------07:58----------
and uh has a hard time maybe seeing


---------08:01----------
outside of his situation


---------08:03----------
and so that has definitely affected my


---------08:06----------
life


---------08:07----------
uh because obviously i grew up with him


---------08:09----------
and he he didn't move out to i moved out


---------08:12----------
really


---------08:13----------
so yeah spent a lot of time with him


---------08:15----------
shared a bathroom with


---------08:16----------
him and such he's


---------08:20----------
but he's very like


---------08:24----------
i don't really have anything good to say


---------08:26----------
um


---------08:27----------
well it sounds like he's one of us


---------08:31----------
yeah and i say that with love well yeah


---------08:34----------
so i mean i think a lot of times you


---------08:36----------
know siblings can


---------08:38----------
dislike things about their other


---------08:39----------
siblings and it takes some time to


---------08:41----------
really get to know your sibling


---------08:43----------
you know in a way that is like it's like


---------08:46----------
a process


---------08:46----------
it's like a relationship that develops


---------08:48----------
over time and i wouldn't be surprised if


---------08:50----------
you guys felt quite differently


---------08:51----------
you know five years from now 10 years


---------08:53----------
from now um


---------08:55----------
but i'm i'm almost hearing that maybe


---------08:57----------
there were times when you were growing


---------08:59----------
up that like


---------09:00----------
maybe you could have really used his


---------09:02----------
support a little bit but


---------09:03----------
maybe he was a little bit caught up in


---------09:05----------
himself and maybe wasn't quite as


---------09:08----------
available


---------09:09----------
to you i think that of course they have


---------09:11----------
the same parents so i think that a lot


---------09:13----------
of the things that we


---------09:14----------
felt or were going through as a result


---------09:17----------
of having the same parents


---------09:18----------
uh we could have talked about and i feel


---------09:22----------
like could have definitely relied on


---------09:23----------
each other but


---------09:27----------
yeah i not sure


---------09:30----------
we just have never connected and have


---------09:33----------
always had issues


---------09:34----------
or not okay i like just not gotten along


---------09:37----------
i would say


---------09:38----------
hmm what does that look like


---------09:41----------
um well when i used to live with him and


---------09:44----------
my parents


---------09:45----------
it was a lot of like fighting


---------09:48----------
in a sense where i'm like hi can you do


---------09:51----------
this and he'll be like


---------09:52----------
uh no like that why would i do that and


---------09:55----------
i'd be like


---------09:56----------
well because like this bothers me he's


---------09:58----------
like eh


---------10:00----------
yeah and i'm like okay


---------10:03----------
so that's like really um


---------10:06----------
frustrating so that was a lot of like


---------10:08----------
just


---------10:09----------
fighting and then it came to a point


---------10:11----------
where i stopped caring i was like okay


---------10:14----------
yeah we're just never gonna have that


---------10:15----------
relationship and you're just so


---------10:17----------
drastically different from me


---------10:19----------
and then yeah and then i moved out and


---------10:23----------
we


---------10:23----------
don't talk like he'll text me sometimes


---------10:27----------
i'll like say happy birthday


---------10:29----------
we don't really talk past that


---------10:32----------
how do you feel about that i have a lot


---------10:35----------
of resentment towards him


---------10:37----------
uh not because of me like i don't really


---------10:40----------
care how he's affected me


---------10:41----------
because he i don't feel like he's a


---------10:43----------
really like thing on my life but


---------10:46----------
um i'm like upset with how he affects my


---------10:49----------
parents


---------10:51----------
because yeah he's just


---------10:54----------
um i think like a kind of a withdrawal


---------10:56----------
sometimes


---------10:58----------
but um yeah


---------11:01----------
so um jody i'm just noticing like


---------11:05----------
i don't want this to turn into a you


---------11:06----------
know


---------11:08----------
brother bashing session and it crosses


---------11:10----------
my mind that this is public so i


---------11:12----------
wouldn't want


---------11:12----------
us to talk about anything that um would


---------11:15----------
reflect poorly on him


---------11:17----------
or make him feel embarrassed or called


---------11:19----------
out or anything like that


---------11:20----------
we may have already crossed that bridge


---------11:22----------
but um


---------11:24----------
the reason i'm asking i just wanna


---------11:26----------
because i think we've got kind of an


---------11:27----------
interesting


---------11:28----------
fork in the road here where this feels


---------11:30----------
important to me


---------11:32----------
um it feels like it's actually like a


---------11:34----------
significant part of your life like i


---------11:36----------
know you've learned how to live with it


---------11:38----------
and sort of like wall it off and it's


---------11:39----------
like


---------11:40----------
you know we text each other on birthdays


---------11:43----------
you know


---------11:44----------
um it's like that steam friend that you


---------11:47----------
you know you've got on your steam


---------11:48----------
friends list that like you used to play


---------11:50----------
games with a few years ago and then they


---------11:51----------
changed their names a couple times and


---------11:53----------
they changed their icon a couple times


---------11:54----------
you don't even know who they are anymore


---------11:56----------
you don't know what games you guys used


---------11:58----------
to play


---------11:58----------
it's just the perfect it's just it's


---------12:00----------
just like it's just on your friends list


---------12:03----------
right you're like i don't even know who


---------12:04----------
that person is but like


---------12:06----------
i don't know well continuing i will say


---------12:09----------
like i love my brother


---------12:10----------
and i do see the good things in him it's


---------12:12----------
just that my i can


---------12:14----------
understand how great my brother is if i


---------12:16----------
wasn't his sibling


---------12:18----------
i think because i am his sibling i get


---------12:20----------
to see a different side of him and i


---------12:22----------
and understand just a little bit more so


---------12:25----------
like


---------12:25----------
i if for anyone listening i do love my


---------12:28----------
brother my brother is a great guy like


---------12:29----------
it's just that i get to see totally


---------12:33----------
just a different side of him that i


---------12:35----------
think everybody has it's just that


---------12:37----------
yeah my brother yeah so i think that's


---------12:40----------
where like you know if you want to talk


---------12:41----------
about it i think it's still useful to do


---------12:43----------
so i think we should just understand


---------12:44----------
that


---------12:45----------
the point of exploring these things is


---------12:47----------
to


---------12:49----------
really try to improve on them and i'm


---------12:50----------
sure that you know when it comes to


---------12:52----------
brothers and


---------12:53----------
and sisters that you know text each


---------12:55----------
other occasionally i'm sure you had your


---------12:57----------
fair share


---------12:57----------
in contributing to that relationship you


---------13:00----------
know


---------13:00----------
i mean it's not like a one-way well


---------13:02----------
sometimes sometimes it is but


---------13:04----------
you know usually it's like it goes both


---------13:06----------
ways um


---------13:08----------
so you know i am i i do find myself


---------13:10----------
curious but i also want to kind of


---------13:11----------
acknowledge that


---------13:12----------
it could make him look bad and and make


---------13:14----------
sure that you're kind of comfortable


---------13:15----------
with me continuing to ask questions


---------13:18----------
like i'm really curious when you said i


---------13:20----------
kind of you have some resentment built


---------13:22----------
up for some of the


---------13:23----------
his relationship with your parents so


---------13:24----------
i'm curious about that


---------13:26----------
yeah um i like


---------13:29----------
my parents are i think fine with my


---------13:32----------
brother


---------13:33----------
i just see what my brother does and i'm


---------13:35----------
like you


---------13:37----------
could definitely sorry my cat is eating


---------13:40----------
my mouth


---------13:41----------
um you could definitely yeah


---------13:44----------
uh just be a little bit more considerate


---------13:47----------
and


---------13:48----------
it would make their lives a little bit


---------13:49----------
easier sure it's just


---------13:51----------
that he what is that


---------13:54----------
what is the what do you what do you ask


---------13:56----------
him to do or what do you wish he did


---------13:57----------
differently


---------13:59----------
so i haven't been home so i don't know


---------14:00----------
exactly what his like behavior is like


---------14:02----------
right now


---------14:03----------
but a lot of uh what


---------14:06----------
i have seen in him and know that he does


---------14:09----------
is just like


---------14:11----------
doesn't really pick up after himself


---------14:13----------
doesn't really


---------14:15----------
help out around the house um


---------14:18----------
and is like i said very like


---------14:21----------
one track minded and maybe he tunnels


---------14:25----------
on like his own life um


---------14:28----------
plays a lot of video games but he works


---------14:30----------
really long hours


---------14:31----------
so i can understand that he like went


---------14:34----------
through a really bad breakup and moved


---------14:35----------
back into my


---------14:36----------
parents house and like adopted a dog


---------14:39----------
but i guess didn't really take care of


---------14:41----------
the dog too well like my parents did a


---------14:43----------
lot of it


---------14:44----------
um so yeah


---------14:47----------
sounds like he works really hard maybe


---------14:50----------
had some stuff going on that wasn't too


---------14:51----------
great


---------14:52----------
but also sounds like one of us in the


---------14:54----------
sense that he doesn't


---------14:55----------
play pick up after himself is kind of


---------14:57----------
lost in game sometimes and


---------14:59----------
is maybe a little bit infantilized by


---------15:01----------
your mom and dad


---------15:03----------
yes um so there's a really interesting


---------15:06----------
diagnostic question about whether he's


---------15:08----------
one of us or whether he's not one of us


---------15:10----------
does he do his own laundry


---------15:13----------
i want to say yes there may be hope for


---------15:17----------
him


---------15:17----------
[Laughter]


---------15:22----------
you know doing your own laundry is a big


---------15:24----------
big part of it


---------15:26----------
um my cat is just absolutely destroying


---------15:29----------
my room right now


---------15:30----------
i see that yes sir go ahead um


---------15:33----------
maybe your cat is jealous that we're


---------15:34----------
talking about your brother


---------15:37----------
uh so can you tell me a little bit about


---------15:38----------
your parents


---------15:40----------
yeah um my mom is my rock i love her to


---------15:43----------
death


---------15:43----------
she is absolutely the woman that i've


---------15:45----------
aspired to be


---------15:47----------
um she's just always had like given me


---------15:50----------
that space to be vulnerable and talk


---------15:52----------
about things


---------15:52----------
and really given me the space to express


---------15:55----------
myself in any way that i want


---------15:57----------
like truly wishes for my happiness and i


---------16:00----------
feel that from her my dad


---------16:05----------
my dad is an interesting man um


---------16:08----------
he's rather angry uh we actually


---------16:12----------
you know when you finally like get to


---------16:13----------
talk to your parents about all the


---------16:14----------
things that you've like been meaning to


---------16:16----------
like you you know you make your own


---------16:18----------
paycheck so you don't like hold anything


---------16:20----------
back my dad and i just actually had that


---------16:21----------
conversation


---------16:22----------
um maybe like two weeks ago which was


---------16:25----------
pretty


---------16:26----------
big for me because i think that was


---------16:29----------
weighing


---------16:30----------
on me for a while um


---------16:33----------
but he's a little angry and


---------16:37----------
i definitely see some of him in me and i


---------16:40----------
hate that because i didn't really like


---------16:43----------
him growing up


---------16:44----------
and what um


---------16:48----------
what part of what part of him do you see


---------16:51----------
in yourself that you dislike


---------16:54----------
so i call them my sneezes like behind


---------16:57----------
closed doors


---------16:58----------
um a lot of the times i'll like get


---------17:01----------
angry at stuff


---------17:02----------
and i can't hold it in because it's like


---------17:04----------
what i grew up with


---------17:05----------
like holding and angry emotions were not


---------17:07----------
a thing that


---------17:08----------
happened in my family with my dad uh and


---------17:11----------
so i see that


---------17:12----------
in me and it's mine's definitely not as


---------17:15----------
bad as my dad's but


---------17:16----------
because it's so similar in the sense i


---------17:18----------
like get really angry you can't


---------17:19----------
whatever and then i like sneeze and then


---------17:22----------
it's gone


---------17:23----------
so i don't really like those grudges


---------17:25----------
it's just that because i can get so


---------17:28----------
angry and because i can't really control


---------17:30----------
my


---------17:31----------
emotions it makes me feel really


---------17:35----------
guilty i guess is the word for it


---------17:38----------
okay um can you give me an example


---------17:41----------
i something just happened oh andy


---------17:44----------
milonakis just gifted a shitload of subs


---------17:46----------
to our channel so thanks andy


---------17:48----------
um and he does that from time to time i


---------17:52----------
don't know


---------17:53----------
we love that he shows up and


---------17:57----------
you know bitcoin billionaires asses


---------18:00----------
um but let me just so let me ask you


---------18:03----------
can you tell us like paint us a little


---------18:05----------
bit of a picture or do any memories


---------18:07----------
stand out


---------18:08----------
um and once again you know we want to


---------18:10----------
acknowledge for a moment that this is


---------18:11----------
just


---------18:12----------
an isolated memory it sounds like you're


---------18:14----------
for the most part like you said


---------18:16----------
first and foremost that you were a happy


---------18:17----------
kid and so it sounds like your parents


---------18:19----------
did a wonderful job and they're like


---------18:20----------
actually awesome parents but no one's


---------18:22----------
perfect


---------18:23----------
um the reason i'm gonna ask you a little


---------18:25----------
bit about your dad is more because you


---------18:26----------
see that part inside of you so maybe we


---------18:28----------
can understand a little bit about


---------18:30----------
how to deal with that anger is it okay


---------18:32----------
if i ask you to tell us a little bit


---------18:33----------
about like memories


---------18:34----------
from interactions that you had with your


---------18:36----------
dad okay


---------18:37----------
right as you said memories like i so


---------18:40----------
vividly have this in my mind that's what


---------18:42----------
we want


---------18:43----------
yeah it was around christmas i remember


---------18:45----------
because we were sitting next to the


---------18:46----------
christmas tree


---------18:46----------
and i don't exactly remember what


---------18:49----------
happened or what led to this i actually


---------18:51----------
think it was


---------18:51----------
a pretty big turning point in my life um


---------18:53----------
but my dad


---------18:55----------
i ended up talking back and my dad ended


---------18:56----------
up calling me a [ __ ] and i remember


---------18:58----------
being like


---------19:00----------
my dad just called me a [ __ ] like


---------19:03----------
you can't do that like you should just


---------19:05----------
not do that and i remember


---------19:07----------
like screaming at him and i was like


---------19:10----------
you have no idea how your words affect


---------19:13----------
people and i'm like


---------19:14----------
16 and you're calling me a [ __ ] and i'm


---------19:16----------
like how do you think this is gonna make


---------19:17----------
me feel


---------19:18----------
like do you think i'm gonna forget this


---------19:20----------
and um i remember


---------19:22----------
specifically like what okay sorry


---------19:26----------
can you hear that my cat is rumbling at


---------19:28----------
times i'm so sorry


---------19:30----------
hi honey um


---------19:35----------
just i remember because it was the time


---------19:37----------
that i had talked back


---------19:38----------
like i had finally stood up for myself


---------19:40----------
and he called to be a [ __ ] because of


---------19:41----------
it


---------19:42----------
and so it was really scarring but also


---------19:45----------
like


---------19:45----------
an awakening where i was like no matter


---------19:48----------
what i say


---------19:49----------
he's just not gonna like that i am


---------19:52----------
talking back


---------19:55----------
i think


---------19:58----------
it's interesting because i i think i'm


---------20:00----------
getting a little bit more context of why


---------20:02----------
changing your hair is so empowering


---------20:05----------
right because you kind of say that for a


---------20:06----------
long time you used to like be


---------20:09----------
what people wanted you to be and now


---------20:10----------
you're being a little bit more of


---------20:11----------
yourself


---------20:13----------
and what i'm hearing is that you know


---------20:17----------
you were taught that being yourself is


---------20:19----------
not okay


---------20:22----------
i definitely was taught to


---------20:27----------
behave


---------20:30----------
and yeah like i would definitely


---------20:37----------
i i it's like i would just my it was


---------20:40----------
like walking on


---------20:41----------
around eggshells or whatever that saying


---------20:42----------
is that i'm not familiar with but


---------20:44----------
walking on that trail


---------20:45----------
it was very much that like one thing


---------20:48----------
could blow up an entire situation so it


---------20:51----------
was a lot of


---------20:52----------
um just kind of minding my own business


---------20:55----------
trying to lay low


---------20:56----------
not bring attention to myself kind of


---------20:58----------
thing


---------21:00----------
and what kind of things would set your


---------21:01----------
dad off


---------21:05----------
um not washing a dish um


---------21:09----------
saying something it


---------21:13----------
changing his ipad wallpaper


---------21:17----------
it could be anything and


---------21:20----------
what would he say if you changed his


---------21:21----------
ipad wallpaper oh this happened to my


---------21:23----------
well my brother changed his ipad


---------21:24----------
wallpaper but it was the end of the


---------21:26----------
world


---------21:26----------
um don't touch my [ __ ] and it's


---------21:29----------
disrespectful


---------21:30----------
how would you like it if i touched your


---------21:32----------
[ __ ] uh


---------21:33----------
took all the clothes out of my brother's


---------21:35----------
closet threw him over the banister


---------21:38----------
just kind of ridiculous yeah but


---------21:42----------
i think he knows it's ridiculous uh i


---------21:44----------
like had the conversation with him i'm


---------21:45----------
like you're


---------21:46----------
you're ridiculous you're a ridiculous


---------21:49----------
man and


---------21:50----------
uh he was so i pretty much had the


---------21:52----------
conversation with him that i was like


---------21:53----------
why do you


---------21:54----------
need to like lash out at people when


---------21:57----------
you're angry


---------21:58----------
and we it actually we had a conversation


---------22:01----------
about my brother because


---------22:02----------
i think a lot of why my brother is the


---------22:04----------
way that he is is because of my dad


---------22:06----------
of course and um


---------22:10----------
it was like you hurt people when you're


---------22:14----------
angry


---------22:14----------
and i'm like do you mean to do that and


---------22:16----------
he's like yeah how are any how is


---------22:18----------
anybody gonna know that i'm angry if i


---------22:21----------
don't like


---------22:21----------
say these words like hurtful meaningful


---------22:24----------
words and i was like


---------22:25----------
how i'm so sorry like for the


---------22:28----------
environment that you must have grown up


---------22:29----------
in where you feel like you


---------22:30----------
had to lash out of people for them to


---------22:32----------
even hear you because that's just not


---------22:34----------
normal and i was telling my dad i'm like


---------22:36----------
and any friendship that i have right now


---------22:38----------
if i was to be like hey you stupid [ __ ]


---------22:40----------
i hate when you do that they're gonna be


---------22:41----------
like


---------22:41----------
okay i'm not gonna be friends with you


---------22:43----------
because why do i need that in my life


---------22:46----------
um and he didn't he didn't really i mean


---------22:48----------
we kind of


---------22:49----------
got to a consensus and he was like okay


---------22:51----------
like


---------22:52----------
i get it but uh i don't know if it


---------22:55----------
really like


---------22:56----------
resonated with him i think it was the


---------22:59----------
only time in his life that anyone has


---------23:00----------
ever talked to him about that


---------23:02----------
or said anything along that those lines


---------23:04----------
wow that takes


---------23:05----------
so i you know i'm a little bit of a


---------23:07----------
boomer so sometimes i say things that


---------23:08----------
could be interpreted as misogynistic so


---------23:10----------
i apologize because i


---------23:12----------
you know um so let me know if i offend


---------23:14----------
you


---------23:15----------
okay but you know that takes that's


---------23:16----------
quite a pair of balls you have there


---------23:19----------
why thank you they're rather large


---------23:23----------
you know like i've tried to say ovaries


---------23:24----------
you know to be like


---------23:26----------
you know but it just doesn't it doesn't


---------23:28----------
mean it do


---------23:30----------
you know and then like


---------23:33----------
then you can always use the gender


---------23:34----------
neutral term which is that's quite a


---------23:35----------
pair of gonads


---------23:37----------
yeah i like that that's what definitely


---------23:39----------
reminds me of middle school


---------23:40----------
yeah like it's it's a middle school


---------23:42----------
insult right


---------23:44----------
i'm still trying to navigate this like


---------23:46----------
you know woke


---------23:47----------
culture of it's tough for me so


---------23:50----------
if i say something that's out of line i


---------23:52----------
apologize uh but that's quite a pair of


---------23:54----------
balls you have there


---------23:55----------
yeah i mean seriously like it's it's


---------23:56----------
it's hard to stand up to your parents


---------23:58----------
um especially when they get so angry and


---------24:00----------
throw all your clothes over the banister


---------24:03----------
well i will i shut my mouth for 23 years


---------24:06----------
there's i was definitely not saying


---------24:08----------
anything but i'm financially


---------24:10----------
able to support myself and uh


---------24:14----------
i don't think that he can emotionally


---------24:17----------
damaged me anymore


---------24:19----------
so i felt kind of just like well we


---------24:21----------
ended up on the call and


---------24:23----------
why not i've been meaning to have this


---------24:24----------
talk with you for literally ever


---------24:27----------
so it was actually like really nice


---------24:31----------
so it sounds like he was actually pretty


---------24:32----------
receptive to the conversation and kind


---------24:34----------
of engaged with you


---------24:36----------
yes he had definitely a moment


---------24:40----------
of anger


---------24:45----------
uh and not really yeah he definitely


---------24:48----------
just doesn't listen


---------24:49----------
it's funny he he's always waiting to


---------24:50----------
talk like if


---------24:52----------
you always hear yeah he's always waiting


---------24:54----------
to talk and i can


---------24:55----------
tell because i'm like you're just


---------24:57----------
yelling back at me


---------24:59----------
and it yeah um


---------25:02----------
he's also just a man of logic so a lot


---------25:06----------
of


---------25:06----------
my arguments


---------25:09----------
and how i now carry forth of my


---------25:11----------
arguments is through logic and i kind of


---------25:13----------
hate that


---------25:14----------
because emotions are always in play


---------25:17----------
it's just that i know how to talk to my


---------25:19----------
dad for him to listen to me


---------25:21----------
so i have to like do everything


---------25:23----------
logically i'm like yeah well this is


---------25:25----------
what you said three years ago and if you


---------25:27----------
don't really follow through with that


---------25:28----------
then that just doesn't logically make


---------25:30----------
sense and he's like


---------25:30----------
um i'm like


---------25:33----------
[Laughter]


---------25:35----------
wow that's interesting usually my


---------25:38----------
experience with


---------25:39----------
with people who are super into logic is


---------25:41----------
that if their logic is incorrect they


---------25:43----------
get really really angry


---------25:44----------
and then they just can't see that their


---------25:46----------
logic is wrong


---------25:48----------
that usually okay he at least if you can


---------25:50----------
out logic him


---------25:52----------
then then it he'll finally make okay


---------25:55----------
i'll think about it


---------25:56----------
but yeah so i'm also hearing that


---------26:00----------
you know he sort of it sounds like


---------26:02----------
you've sort of figured this out that


---------26:04----------
like


---------26:05----------
that was just the only way he knew how


---------26:08----------
to make himself


---------26:09----------
heard so i didn't know that until


---------26:12----------
like two weeks ago i genuinely thought


---------26:14----------
that he like knew what he was doing


---------26:16----------
because i'm like how can you be


---------26:17----------
not how do you not have the awareness to


---------26:19----------
know that you are totally messing up


---------26:21----------
people being mean and like um


---------26:24----------
but no he like genuinely didn't


---------26:27----------
understand


---------26:29----------
and i actually think that makes maybe


---------26:30----------
more sense to me yep


---------26:32----------
yeah yeah it sort of makes sense because


---------26:36----------
he didn't really know


---------26:38----------
what he was doing but also it also


---------26:40----------
sounds like that's the way that he


---------26:42----------
learned


---------26:44----------
that feelings are taken seriously when


---------26:47----------
you are mean to someone


---------26:48----------
and that's how you express to someone


---------26:50----------
that you were not


---------26:52----------
okay with what they did yeah um


---------26:56----------
the way that you demonstrate that you


---------26:57----------
have been hurt is by hurting someone


---------26:59----------
else


---------27:02----------
um so that's that's i'm


---------27:05----------
i'm happy for you guys and i think it


---------27:06----------
takes a lot of strength to have that


---------27:08----------
conversation and it sounds like your dad


---------27:09----------
is


---------27:10----------
kind of willing to play ball which is


---------27:13----------
we'll see but yeah cool


---------27:17----------
and um how did you get into streaming


---------27:20----------
oh uh i went to an event called pax with


---------27:24----------
my


---------27:24----------
then ex-boyfriend and there was like


---------27:26----------
this huge purple booth


---------27:28----------
and i was like what's that and he's like


---------27:30----------
oh it's just like this live streaming


---------27:31----------
platform like oh that's weird and then i


---------27:32----------
forgot about it


---------27:33----------
and then um


---------27:36----------
pax west and then he actually built a


---------27:40----------
computer and started streaming


---------27:41----------
and at the same time i was like well i


---------27:43----------
want to build a computer because i had


---------27:44----------
always been a console gamer and like a


---------27:46----------
laptop gamer


---------27:47----------
um and then i ended up uh having some


---------27:50----------
friends who helped me and i built like


---------27:51----------
this


---------27:52----------
really jank like really


---------27:55----------
just bad computer but um


---------27:58----------
welcome to pc master race my friend yes


---------28:02----------
so i would watch his streams and i was


---------28:03----------
like this is really


---------28:05----------
cool like this is all i've ever wanted


---------28:07----------
in the sense that


---------28:08----------
i've always had moments in gaming where


---------28:10----------
i'm like oh my god i wish someone saw


---------28:11----------
that and


---------28:12----------
that is exactly what this is and so um i


---------28:15----------
started streaming


---------28:16----------
and i was also extremely lonely at the


---------28:18----------
time


---------28:19----------
i was in college and was studying as


---------28:21----------
pre-med and so i literally didn't make


---------28:23----------
any friends all i did was study


---------28:24----------
i like didn't have the luxury or the


---------28:26----------
intelligence to


---------28:28----------
study work and have friends i could


---------28:30----------
really only have


---------28:32----------
work and school and do those two things


---------28:35----------
well


---------28:36----------
and then so you worked when you were in


---------28:37----------
college i worked part-time


---------28:40----------
and then yeah and then i just like loved


---------28:42----------
streaming because i was so lonely


---------28:44----------
how did you decide to become pre-med uh


---------28:48----------
interesting actually i was autofilled to


---------28:51----------
business in college


---------28:52----------
my my parents were like you don't have


---------28:54----------
to go to college but


---------28:56----------
if you like you just have to do


---------28:57----------
something productive in the meantime


---------28:58----------
like you can't just sit at home and like


---------29:00----------
play games and do nothing and i was like


---------29:02----------
okay fine like i do see myself pursuing


---------29:05----------
something i just don't know what it is


---------29:07----------
quite yet and went to college autofilled


---------29:10----------
business


---------29:10----------
and halfway through business i was like


---------29:12----------
um questioning


---------29:14----------
i don't really enjoy this like it


---------29:16----------
doesn't


---------29:17----------
like interest me in


---------29:20----------
any way but i was like but what is


---------29:23----------
stopping me


---------29:23----------
like what do i want to do and if nothing


---------29:25----------
was in my way what would i do


---------29:27----------
um and i was like i would love to be


---------29:30----------
some sort of


---------29:31----------
doctor like i would love to be a


---------29:32----------
dermatologist like in a perfect world i


---------29:34----------
would be a dermatologist


---------29:35----------
um like i just grew up with skin issues


---------29:37----------
like completely understand them and


---------29:40----------
hated how everybody treated me and how


---------29:42----------
most dermatologists


---------29:43----------
treated me and i was like yeah i would


---------29:45----------
totally love to do that and then i


---------29:46----------
realized that


---------29:48----------
um my whole life i kind of told myself


---------29:49----------
that i wasn't intelligent and i couldn't


---------29:51----------
do that and then i was like


---------29:52----------
oh like let's just let's just do that


---------29:55----------
let's just at least try


---------29:57----------
um so i switched to biology


---------30:00----------
do you still tell yourself that you're


---------30:01----------
not intelligent enough to do that


---------30:06----------
not often not often


---------30:11----------
i i think that like uh through


---------30:14----------
my degree and like going through that


---------30:16----------
process i know that um i totally can


---------30:19----------
it's just that if i'm willing to drop


---------30:21----------
everything else


---------30:22----------
i can like i said i didn't make any


---------30:25----------
friends from college so


---------30:26----------
at what expense did i was able to like


---------30:29----------
get good grades and maybe be pre-med


---------30:31----------
at the expense of not having friends


---------30:34----------
sounds about right yeah


---------30:39----------
getting good grades as a pre-med is


---------30:40----------
impressive that's not easy to do


---------30:43----------
it it took a lot like literally


---------30:45----------
everything that i had in me


---------30:47----------
to to work towards that


---------30:50----------
you know just my experience was that i


---------30:52----------
got terrible grades and didn't have any


---------30:53----------
friends anyway


---------30:59----------
so at least you got something out of it


---------31:02----------
yeah of course i was both a loser and a


---------31:06----------
failure


---------31:08----------
sounds like you were just a loser so


---------31:12----------
um yeah so then it says sounds like you


---------31:15----------
started


---------31:15----------
so were you like lonely in college oh my


---------31:18----------
god i was so lonely


---------31:20----------
um i thankfully had a really great boss


---------31:22----------
i worked part-time


---------31:24----------
and my boss i like developed such a


---------31:25----------
great relationship with her name is


---------31:27----------
cheryl and i love her


---------31:28----------
like she is the seven-year-old woman she


---------31:31----------
is just feisty she's


---------31:32----------
um i just love her and so i had her


---------31:36----------
thankfully and i would consider her a


---------31:37----------
friend it's just that our age difference


---------31:39----------
was really


---------31:40----------
drastic so we couldn't like go and


---------31:43----------
out and do anything really other than


---------31:45----------
grab dinner


---------31:47----------
and and so what was it can you tell me


---------31:49----------
what what it was like to be lonely


---------31:53----------
i heavily relied on my boyfriend at the


---------31:56----------
time


---------31:56----------
we had we dated for way too long i think


---------31:59----------
because of that


---------32:00----------
um so because i had met him like my


---------32:05----------
like summer going into college but yeah


---------32:08----------
we were with each other for the entirety


---------32:09----------
of college


---------32:10----------
which makes sense uh you know like we


---------32:12----------
were good for each other


---------32:14----------
i think when we while we needed each


---------32:15----------
other kind of thing


---------32:17----------
but yeah i was like didn't have friends


---------32:19----------
to rely on


---------32:21----------
like talk to my mom a lot and would vent


---------32:23----------
to my


---------32:24----------
boss but didn't really have anybody my


---------32:26----------
age to like like anybody any girlfriends


---------32:29----------
that i think are


---------32:30----------
obviously really important um do you


---------32:32----------
have girlfriends


---------32:33----------
i have girlfriends now yeah how did that


---------32:36----------
happen


---------32:37----------
through streaming all my friends are


---------32:39----------
through streaming um and like


---------32:42----------
weird coincidences i think like my best


---------32:44----------
friend is actually from


---------32:46----------
where i'm from she was acquaintances


---------32:48----------
with my ex


---------32:49----------
so we met through my ex but then she


---------32:51----------
ended up streaming and we ended up


---------32:52----------
really bonding over that and now we're


---------32:54----------
roommates


---------32:55----------
oh cool yeah um and so what how did your


---------32:59----------
uh what ended up happening with your ex


---------33:01----------
boyfriend


---------33:03----------
you guys said so it sounds like it was


---------33:04----------
like a what you guys needed at the time


---------33:06----------
and then


---------33:07----------
you kind of grew out of it or what


---------33:08----------
happened


---------33:11----------
we so he started streaming before me


---------33:15----------
which created an interesting dynamic in


---------33:17----------
our relationship


---------33:18----------
because his stream didn't do so well and


---------33:22----------
mine did well enough to be full-time and


---------33:25----------
uh that was really the decline of our


---------33:28----------
relationship


---------33:29----------
i actually found a lot of self-worth


---------33:31----------
through streaming


---------33:32----------
and uh every day


---------33:36----------
and also just some empowerment um i've


---------33:38----------
never really had anything that i've


---------33:40----------
felt good at and i actually think that i


---------33:43----------
feel pretty good at streaming i'm not


---------33:44----------
sure what


---------33:45----------
about it or like i couldn't pinpoint it


---------33:47----------
to you and tell you like what i'm doing


---------33:48----------
right i just


---------33:50----------
feel confident doing so i can tell you


---------33:52----------
what you're doing right


---------33:54----------
oh i think you've ever


---------33:58----------
yeah go ahead go ahead i've never


---------34:00----------
watched the same way yeah


---------34:02----------
you've never seen my stream i haven't


---------34:03----------
seen your stream i don't need to see


---------34:05----------
your stream


---------34:06----------
oh that's interesting yeah


---------34:11----------
i think you're very alive


---------34:15----------
oh i would yeah yes yeah


---------34:19----------
i think it's it's quite compelling


---------34:22----------
well thank you i will i cherish those


---------34:24----------
words


---------34:26----------
cherish away my friend um no seriously i


---------34:29----------
think it's


---------34:30----------
it i can see i i think you have some


---------34:32----------
like a certain


---------34:33----------
like charisma right there's like


---------34:37----------
yeah well a lot of life in there yeah


---------34:41----------
my pink hair shows um but through


---------34:44----------
streaming i


---------34:45----------
i genuinely felt like i was good at


---------34:46----------
something and so that


---------34:49----------
changed the dynamic in our relationship


---------34:51----------
because he used to be the one that was


---------34:52----------
like good at everything


---------34:54----------
more than me or um


---------34:58----------
i don't know we were not like


---------35:02----------
good with each other but we just


---------35:04----------
happened to be with each other i felt


---------35:06----------
like


---------35:07----------
yeah so it sounds like maybe it was hard


---------35:09----------
for him to watch you become more


---------35:11----------
successful


---------35:12----------
yeah and you know when your testicles


---------35:14----------
started to outweigh


---------35:16----------
his he noticed hard yeah


---------35:19----------
yeah it's challenging


---------35:22----------
um my wife wears the pants in the


---------35:25----------
relationship too so that can sometimes


---------35:26----------
be hard for me


---------35:29----------
um okay so and and then


---------35:33----------
so it sounds like so i'm a little bit


---------35:34----------
curious you had mentioned trust and


---------35:36----------
friendships


---------35:38----------
as important um can you help me


---------35:41----------
understand so it sounds like you


---------35:42----------
actually have


---------35:43----------
a fair number of friends now it sounds


---------35:45----------
like


---------35:46----------
um you know things maybe just ran their


---------35:49----------
course with your ex-boyfriend are you


---------35:51----------
seeing someone now if you don't mind me


---------35:52----------
asking you don't have to i am seeing


---------35:53----------
someone now


---------35:54----------
yeah um so then so help me understand


---------35:57----------
why trust or


---------35:58----------
or friendships is kind of like something


---------36:00----------
that you wanted to talk about


---------36:02----------
or so i would say that until recently


---------36:05----------
i have good friends and i would consider


---------36:08----------
like my roommate's really good friends


---------36:09----------
and then some of the people that i've


---------36:11----------
met through streaming


---------36:12----------
um it's just that my whole life


---------36:17----------
friend it's like i have horse stories


---------36:19----------
with friends


---------36:20----------
or just people


---------36:25----------
and it makes me uh


---------36:29----------
try to reflect and be like well why did


---------36:31----------
all these things happen to me and like


---------36:32----------
what am i doing so


---------36:33----------
wrong and it really scares me when


---------36:36----------
approaching new friendships because


---------36:38----------
especially with people that i cherish


---------36:40----------
because i'm like oh when is it that


---------36:42----------
they're going to realize like i'm


---------36:44----------
this that and this and then decide to


---------36:46----------
leave me or like


---------36:48----------
like yeah does that have something to do


---------36:51----------
with the intrusive thoughts


---------36:53----------
yes


---------36:58----------
um absolutely yes


---------37:00----------
[Laughter]


---------37:03----------
yes this sort of looks like a nutrition


---------37:05----------
plan


---------37:07----------
people are wondering that's what an


---------37:08----------
intrusive thought looks like out of all


---------37:10----------
the thoughts that you've had


---------37:12----------
that you've shared over the last 45


---------37:15----------
minutes that is the intrusive one okay


---------37:18----------
all right so tell me what happened with


---------37:19----------
um we can we can we can get to the


---------37:21----------
bottom of this


---------37:22----------
i think okay um so tell


---------37:26----------
go ahead oh so do you want to say


---------37:27----------
something else no


---------37:29----------
okay so tell me what what happened with


---------37:31----------
your uh friends like before this most


---------37:33----------
recent


---------37:34----------
batch


---------37:37----------
drama literally i can look back on


---------37:40----------
the time of my life and i'm like okay


---------37:42----------
yeah yep


---------37:44----------
oh we're finally good and the good is


---------37:45----------
now oh yeah


---------37:48----------
an um middle school my uh


---------37:52----------
elementary bully came to and switched my


---------37:55----------
school


---------37:56----------
good stuff wow they just follow you


---------37:59----------
everywhere it's great


---------38:02----------
yeah that's not funny


---------38:06----------
so just like uh my parents were part of


---------38:09----------
this


---------38:10----------
business and i want to say that it was


---------38:12----------
kind of like a


---------38:14----------
kind of like a cult business probably


---------38:15----------
i'm not sure they didn't really tell me


---------38:17----------
much about it um but pretty much when


---------38:18----------
they switch businesses when they're like


---------38:20----------
oh yeah this is kind of


---------38:21----------
scummy um the other


---------38:25----------
individuals that like oh nice place


---------38:28----------
i went to a school it was a private


---------38:29----------
school and the parents that all went to


---------38:32----------
that all worked at the same place


---------38:33----------
obviously like flock together and they


---------38:35----------
all had kids and so all the kids hung


---------38:36----------
out so like the me


---------38:37----------
and like i think five other girls four


---------38:39----------
other girls we would all hang out


---------38:42----------
um and then as soon as my parents were


---------38:43----------
like oh yeah we're not gonna be part of


---------38:44----------
this business anymore the parents are


---------38:46----------
like oh you can't hang out with jody


---------38:47----------
anymore because we're not hanging out


---------38:48----------
with their parents anymore


---------38:49----------
but as a kid i don't think i really


---------38:51----------
understood that i think i was


---------38:53----------
like i don't know people don't want to


---------38:54----------
hang out with me like


---------38:56----------
and then yeah but they were also like


---------38:58----------
the kids were really


---------39:00----------
mean about it specifically one girl but


---------39:02----------
she was just


---------39:03----------
really yeah not nice to me i would cry


---------39:06----------
every day on the races i would literally


---------39:08----------
bury a hole in the wood chips and dig


---------39:10----------
myself out of the stairs and cry and i


---------39:12----------
remember like calling my mom


---------39:14----------
um third grade


---------39:17----------
you're smiling because it's comedic to


---------39:19----------
me i imagine


---------39:20----------
my small self like


---------39:24----------
burying myself with wood chips because i


---------39:26----------
don't emotionally know how to understand


---------39:27----------
this


---------39:28----------
and i'm over it now in the


---------39:32----------
sense that i understand like


---------39:35----------
i'm aware enough to know that it wasn't


---------39:37----------
a me thing it was definitely like a


---------39:39----------
parent thing but it still affects me


---------39:40----------
emotionally


---------39:41----------
i just understand it a bit more like


---------39:43----------
from bird's eye view


---------39:45----------
what do you understand that it wasn't


---------39:48----------
a me thing like i didn't do anything to


---------39:51----------
make these girls hate me


---------39:53----------
but they did


---------39:56----------
after my parents or after their parents


---------39:58----------
told me i think we can't hang out with


---------39:59----------
you


---------40:05----------
okay can i think for a second


---------40:33----------
what games do you play jody


---------40:37----------
um right now a lot of valerie okay


---------40:41----------
i love minecraft okay


---------40:45----------
rust among us but among us is okay


---------40:49----------
um i love just fps games in general and


---------40:53----------
puzzle games so like zelda


---------40:58----------
favorite zelda game twilight princess


---------41:02----------
try you know it's sleeper sleeper head


---------41:04----------
did you ever play majora's mask


---------41:06----------
uh i didn't like finish majora's masks i


---------41:10----------
think in its entirety i ended up not


---------41:12----------
liking it that much but i was also young


---------41:14----------
and have not given it another try


---------41:16----------
so it kind of scared me it's kind of


---------41:18----------
it's kind of demonic yeah i mean toilet


---------41:20----------
princess also do be kind of


---------41:22----------
a little bit less dark yeah way more


---------41:25----------
happy valley than


---------41:26----------
or sorry what's uh uncanny valley you


---------41:29----------
familiar with yes


---------41:30----------
yeah so it's way creepier but um


---------41:34----------
okay uh thank you for sharing that i


---------41:37----------
know it's kind of a random question but


---------41:39----------
i'm trying to just figure out what kind


---------41:40----------
of analogies do i need to come up with


---------41:42----------
in my head


---------41:43----------
to help us understand uh


---------41:46----------
so we're going to have to go towards


---------41:48----------
zelda because i suck at fpss


---------41:51----------
yeah and i've never really played


---------41:53----------
minecraft


---------41:54----------
i still don't really understand it to be


---------41:56----------
honest it's okay it's


---------41:57----------
it's you won't understand until you dig


---------41:59----------
like 10 hours into it


---------42:01----------
okay so maybe i should do that at some


---------42:02----------
point um


---------42:04----------
okay so let me ask you something


---------42:08----------
have you ever so you've it sounds like


---------42:10----------
you understand


---------42:11----------
that you know those kids were being mean


---------42:14----------
and it wasn't really your fault


---------42:17----------
um and when you think about that girl


---------42:20----------
who buries herself in


---------42:22----------
wood chips have you done anything


---------42:24----------
besides laugh like have you cried about


---------42:26----------
that


---------42:28----------
yes i definitely went through my


---------42:33----------
emotional


---------42:37----------
acceptance of it


---------42:40----------
help me understand what that means


---------42:46----------
like when i allow myself to feel really


---------42:50----------
sad or like bad for myself it will


---------42:53----------
go back to that time but it is not often


---------42:56----------
i oftentimes will just


---------42:58----------
laugh at it okay but you do let yourself


---------43:01----------
is it when you're feeling bad now that


---------43:02----------
your mind kind of returns to that time


---------43:04----------
or do you let your mind go to that time


---------43:06----------
and you feel


---------43:07----------
bad in the present this is so


---------43:10----------
interesting i was just talking on


---------43:12----------
stream about how sometimes time to me


---------43:13----------
feels very like


---------43:15----------
sandwiched because my memories feel


---------43:18----------
like i had lived in them yesterday yep


---------43:21----------
so a lot of the times like let's say


---------43:23----------
that something happens i will


---------43:26----------
remember that feeling like if something


---------43:29----------
similar happens in my life let's say


---------43:30----------
related to friends


---------43:31----------
or like i'm being wrong by a friend so


---------43:34----------
it sounds like the


---------43:35----------
present triggers the past you don't go


---------43:37----------
and sit in the past


---------43:38----------
and yeah okay cool yeah we're going to


---------43:41----------
talk


---------43:41----------
it's going to be good i think you're


---------43:42----------
going to we're going to figure this out


---------43:45----------
all right it sounds like you're halfway


---------43:47----------
there already jody


---------43:48----------
your understanding of time i think is


---------43:50----------
quite sophisticated and a very important


---------43:54----------
revelation


---------43:58----------
okay now let me ask you another question


---------44:00----------
so when you


---------44:01----------
are living in the present and you


---------44:04----------
travel back to the past


---------44:08----------
do intrusive or intrusive thoughts part


---------44:10----------
of that picture


---------44:19----------
not in this so when i'm thinking of


---------44:22----------
myself in the past


---------44:24----------
does my past self have those interested


---------44:26----------
thoughts no


---------44:27----------
no so uh just ask me about the intrusion


---------44:31----------
let me ask you about the intrusive


---------44:32----------
thoughts can you tell me just a little


---------44:33----------
bit about what you mean by intrusive


---------44:34----------
thoughts


---------44:36----------
um when i say intrusive thoughts it's


---------44:38----------
mostly like


---------44:40----------
my interactions with others how i affect


---------44:43----------
others how others perceive


---------44:44----------
me and how that will


---------44:50----------
it relates to you because of how you're


---------44:52----------
perceived


---------44:54----------
yes and it and how


---------44:59----------
i feel like i've been either betrayed


---------45:03----------
or wronged or just like um not just not


---------45:05----------
liked


---------45:06----------
throughout my life and so i


---------45:09----------
feel like there's something wrong with


---------45:11----------
me which creates these intrusive


---------45:12----------
thoughts


---------45:13----------
but that i can't really pinpoint if i'm


---------45:15----------
like lying to myself


---------45:16----------
or if others are lying to me and it just


---------45:22----------
intrusive in the sense that i'm like i


---------45:23----------
must be inherently bad there must be


---------45:25----------
something wrong with me that somebody


---------45:26----------
just won't


---------45:27----------
tell me and yeah


---------45:32----------
okay so tell me what kind of in can you


---------45:34----------
give me an example


---------45:35----------
of intrusive thoughts


---------45:39----------
uh like let's say i'm streaming with


---------45:42----------
someone or like i'm collaborating with


---------45:43----------
another streamer and i


---------45:44----------
say something that's like me being


---------45:47----------
myself


---------45:48----------
uh i'll i'll like have a sudden moment


---------45:50----------
of like should i have


---------45:52----------
said that or because i'm showing a


---------45:55----------
glimpse of myself


---------45:57----------
this is like the last time that we'll be


---------45:58----------
collaborating together because i'm just


---------46:00----------
bad i'm terrible nobody likes me kind of


---------46:03----------
thing


---------46:04----------
um there's that laughter again


---------46:08----------
so funny i deal with everything through


---------46:12----------
humor also especially


---------46:13----------
with streaming uh i like don't mind


---------46:16----------
talking about my feelings and laughing


---------46:17----------
about them because i


---------46:18----------
want people to laugh with me like i


---------46:21----------
don't want people to be sad for me


---------46:23----------
so i laugh so that people mirror me


---------46:26----------
because


---------46:28----------
um i because i don't


---------46:32----------
no uh i think especially with streaming


---------46:36----------
i want people to


---------46:37----------
feel happy on my stream like i want you


---------46:39----------
to click on a quarter jade stream and be


---------46:40----------
like yeah this is like a positive


---------46:42----------
uplifting happy place where we


---------46:43----------
occasionally talk about sadness but i


---------46:45----------
don't leave feeling sad


---------46:46----------
so if i talk about things that happen to


---------46:49----------
me or don't laugh at the things that


---------46:50----------
happen to me then


---------46:51----------
you'll also feel bad you'll be like oh


---------46:54----------
okay


---------46:55----------
does that does that also apply outside


---------46:56----------
of streaming like i can understand


---------46:58----------
trying to create a particular kind of


---------47:00----------
community or vibe on stream but do you


---------47:03----------
feel like people


---------47:05----------
are you okay with people being sad


---------47:07----------
pitying you otherwise


---------47:14----------
see i in


---------47:17----------
yes but i will not often


---------47:21----------
put myself in those situations to be


---------47:24----------
pitied


---------47:25----------
i guess you won't put those self


---------47:29----------
does it feel uncomfortable to you when


---------47:31----------
people feel sad for you or pity you


---------47:38----------
i've never thought about that let me


---------47:40----------
think about that


---------47:42----------
um


---------47:46----------
i don't think it makes me feel


---------47:48----------
uncomfortable


---------47:51----------
i just don't want people to feel that


---------47:54----------
way in our experience


---------47:56----------
like when conversating i guess


---------48:00----------
it is not my main goal sure or like


---------48:05----------
yeah let me ask you do you do you


---------48:08----------
protect other people from feeling that


---------48:10----------
way


---------48:11----------
yeah why


---------48:15----------
where does that come from


---------48:21----------
from lack of protection i think


---------48:25----------
that didn't take long no


---------48:27----------
[Laughter]


---------48:30----------
and what weren't you protected against


---------48:37----------
uh yeah


---------48:42----------
just mean


---------48:46----------
and toxic experiences


---------48:50----------
or people can you tell us about those


---------48:54----------
the experiences in particular or


---------49:00----------
um i remember like


---------49:04----------
oh there's a lot one that stands out in


---------49:07----------
particular


---------49:08----------
is oh my god i was just talking about


---------49:11----------
this on stream which is funny


---------49:12----------
um the said girl who we are going to


---------49:16----------
continue to go back to


---------49:17----------
uh she we actually ended up becoming


---------49:20----------
friends


---------49:20----------
i i remember having this thought and i


---------49:22----------
was like oh god we were so young i'm


---------49:24----------
sure i could be friends with her now


---------49:26----------
and we ended up like kind of getting


---------49:28----------
along we would hang out and i would like


---------49:30----------
go to her house and she


---------49:31----------
is very she lives a very fortunate life


---------49:33----------
she had this beautiful pool and this


---------49:34----------
beautiful house i would go to her house


---------49:36----------
often


---------49:36----------
and i went swimming one day and then she


---------49:38----------
ended up


---------49:39----------
kind of merging with the popular crowd


---------49:41----------
and so i was no longer her friend


---------49:44----------
after that and uh i left my bathing suit


---------49:47----------
on her house and i was like hey like i


---------49:48----------
love bathing sure your house like can i


---------49:49----------
come get it and she's like oh like i


---------49:51----------
don't have it


---------49:52----------
and then i was like oh shoot okay um


---------49:54----------
then this is when instagram was rather


---------49:56----------
new


---------49:56----------
into society but uh


---------50:00----------
her sister posted an instagram photo of


---------50:02----------
her wearing the bathing suit i'm like


---------50:04----------
yeah that's definitely my bathing suit


---------50:06----------
um


---------50:07----------
okay and then i in a message here i'm


---------50:09----------
like hey like can i come grab this she's


---------50:10----------
like


---------50:10----------
no that's my sister's and i'm not even


---------50:12----------
home and then okay this is


---------50:14----------
my dad was probably wrong in allowing


---------50:17----------
this too but my dad was like yeah let's


---------50:18----------
just like go drive her


---------50:19----------
to her house and go get it i'm like yeah


---------50:21----------
okay hindsight i don't think that's a


---------50:23----------
good


---------50:23----------
i definitely should not have done that


---------50:24----------
but um the winter house


---------50:27----------
knocked on the door the dad answered and


---------50:28----------
he's like oh hey jody i'm like hey i'm


---------50:30----------
here to pick up my baby soon


---------50:32----------
and he's like oh yeah go on upstairs and


---------50:34----------
um she had another sister so


---------50:36----------
uh the other sister was like oh like


---------50:37----------
what are you doing here i was like hey


---------50:38----------
i'm here to grab a bathing suit she's


---------50:39----------
like oh cool it's like so


---------50:40----------
it's in her room i grabbed it i left uh


---------50:43----------
her sister obviously told


---------50:45----------
her that i was there and then it ended


---------50:48----------
up being this huge thing she's like i


---------50:49----------
cannot believe that you would trespass


---------50:50----------
into my house and


---------50:52----------
steal my bathing suit i'm like okay but


---------50:54----------
it was definitely


---------50:55----------
mine but it has a


---------50:58----------
like that is like one of those moments


---------51:00----------
where it's really toxic and i know that


---------51:01----------
she


---------51:02----------
went and told a bunch of other people


---------51:03----------
about it and said


---------51:05----------
maybe things that weren't very true or


---------51:07----------
from her point of view might have been


---------51:09----------
and that like had altered the way that


---------51:11----------
people saw me


---------51:13----------
and the friendships from there on out


---------51:18----------
that's [ __ ] up retweet


---------51:23----------
wow


---------51:30----------
man you just really get [ __ ] every


---------51:33----------
time you stand up for yourself don't you


---------51:40----------
what do you think about that okay the


---------51:43----------
first thought to me was like well


---------51:45----------
why and yep


---------51:50----------
yeah but i also think that's why i'm


---------51:54----------
really protective of others


---------51:55----------
like i'm i'm like straight up mama bear


---------51:58----------
for anybody that i


---------52:00----------
care about and a lot of people that you


---------52:02----------
don't care about


---------52:04----------
that too i think it's


---------52:08----------
yeah you're very protective i think it's


---------52:10----------
quite an admirable quality and people


---------52:12----------
even though you sometimes get the short


---------52:14----------
end of the stick i think people benefit


---------52:16----------
from having you in their lives


---------52:17----------
for better or for worse um


---------52:20----------
but why do you think how do you


---------52:22----------
understand that why do you get smacked


---------52:24----------
down every time you


---------52:26----------
you know pop poke your head above ground


---------52:30----------
um i just


---------52:34----------
i don't really know if i have a direct


---------52:37----------
like i don't feel like that's happening


---------52:38----------
to me i guess


---------52:41----------
like you say that i'm like oh yeah that


---------52:42----------
like makes sense


---------52:44----------
but when i do stand up for something


---------52:49----------
it's more because i couldn't no i like


---------52:52----------
can't go to bed at night if i didn't


---------52:54----------
it will eat away at me


---------53:01----------
can i think for a second


---------53:14----------
so i'm going to just think out loud i


---------53:16----------
may need to pause in the middle


---------53:18----------
here but you know it's kind of


---------53:19----------
interesting because when we think about


---------53:21----------
these sorts of stories right where like


---------53:23----------
you leave your bathing suit at a


---------53:24----------
friend's house and she's like nope that


---------53:25----------
was mine


---------53:26----------
and then you know kind of it sounds like


---------53:28----------
sometimes you tried to express yourself


---------53:30----------
maybe with your dad


---------53:31----------
and then that really didn't go well it


---------53:33----------
sounds like there are a lot of times


---------53:34----------
where you've tried to


---------53:36----------
you know show people who you are be


---------53:38----------
yourself and you've been punished for it


---------53:41----------
and generally speaking you know when we


---------53:42----------
think about that we think that the


---------53:44----------
psychological


---------53:45----------
consequences that you're like meek right


---------53:48----------
is that like when someone gets knocked


---------53:50----------
down like a thousand times like they're


---------53:51----------
gonna learn how to stay down and they'll


---------53:53----------
be like feel really bad about themselves


---------53:55----------
and like have low self-esteem and things


---------53:56----------
like that


---------53:58----------
i don't think you have low self-esteem


---------54:03----------
what do you think


---------54:06----------
um until streaming i would say that i


---------54:10----------
for sure had low self-esteem yep and


---------54:13----------
have


---------54:13----------
since grown


---------54:16----------
i am i


---------54:22----------
i have occasional low self-esteem


---------54:26----------
sure of course everyone does but but you


---------54:28----------
know you're not like a downtrodden like


---------54:30----------
you seem to be


---------54:31----------
confident you seem to be vibrant


---------54:38----------
um i would not describe myself as


---------54:41----------
confident


---------54:42----------
but i am definitely how would you


---------54:43----------
describe yourself


---------54:45----------
uh definitely like fake it till you make


---------54:48----------
your confidence


---------54:49----------
i want to be perceived as confident and


---------54:51----------
therefore


---------54:53----------
i kind of like just


---------54:57----------
act accordingly but deep down i don't


---------55:00----------
feel confident


---------55:01----------
and i don't feel confident in the words


---------55:02----------
that i say i've just like conditioned


---------55:04----------
myself to be like okay well now speak


---------55:08----------
how do you feel about the words you say


---------55:13----------
um sometimes really good


---------55:16----------
i'm like happy that i am open


---------55:21----------
and then sometimes i'm like the whole


---------55:24----------
reason


---------55:25----------
why people don't like you is because you


---------55:26----------
talk so just stop talking


---------55:28----------
but then i'm like at a turmoil and i'm


---------55:30----------
like i have to be confident


---------55:32----------
because i don't and i have to stay up


---------55:33----------
for this but at the same time


---------55:44----------
yeah so i'm going to be a little bit


---------55:45----------
judgmental here


---------55:48----------
i think you're confident and i think


---------55:50----------
confidence is so foreign to you that you


---------55:52----------
don't know what it looks like


---------55:59----------
so let me try to parse this out a little


---------56:02----------
bit okay


---------56:03----------
so if there's a part of you that says


---------56:05----------
deep down inside you


---------56:07----------
just hypothesize okay i could be wrong


---------56:10----------
but


---------56:10----------
let's let's take a look at it and then


---------56:11----------
you let me know whether i'm right or i'm


---------56:13----------
wrong because i don't know what's going


---------56:14----------
on inside


---------56:16----------
um so you know there's a part of you


---------56:17----------
that's like i want to speak


---------56:20----------
and then there's another part of you


---------56:21----------
that's like no no don't speak that's


---------56:22----------
stupid when you speak


---------56:24----------
bad things happen is that fair


---------56:27----------
is that the conflict so that's really


---------56:30----------
interesting because i don't detect any


---------56:32----------
con


---------56:32----------
lack of confidence there so i'll give


---------56:34----------
you an example of what lack of


---------56:35----------
confidence is


---------56:37----------
don't speak because you're dumb


---------56:41----------
but i'm not hearing that from you


---------56:44----------
i'm hearing that you've learned that


---------56:45----------
there are consequences to your actions


---------56:47----------
but not


---------56:47----------
when i think about someone who's not


---------56:48----------
confident intrinsically they don't think


---------56:50----------
that their words have merit


---------56:54----------
i'm not hearing that you don't think


---------56:56----------
intrinsically that you


---------56:57----------
lack merit i think you just you know


---------57:01----------
you've been traumatized


---------57:06----------
yeah actually right because if you think


---------57:09----------
about it like i'm sure you've had


---------57:10----------
friends or you've felt in the past like


---------57:12----------
you intrinsically don't have merit right


---------57:14----------
like you're like


---------57:15----------
there's something wrong with me but that


---------57:17----------
inner conflict that i hear now is not


---------57:19----------
like


---------57:20----------
i should i feel like speaking and then


---------57:21----------
the other part of your voice is like no


---------57:23----------
you shouldn't because that's dumb


---------57:24----------
you're dumb sit down and shut up


---------57:27----------
it's like people are gonna get


---------57:29----------
frustrated if you do that


---------57:31----------
and that by the way may be legitimate


---------57:33----------
right so i think that um


---------57:35----------
you know you have a lot of bitter and if


---------57:37----------
you don't know what that is i'll explain


---------57:39----------
it in a second


---------57:40----------
but in ayurveda the iv is traditional


---------57:42----------
indian


---------57:43----------
medicine and pitta is um


---------57:47----------
so like they sort of diagnose


---------57:49----------
personalities based on like elements


---------57:51----------
so you are like sort of like a fire type


---------57:54----------
and there's a really


---------57:55----------
interesting um sign of your bit though


---------57:58----------
which is the insides of the palms of


---------58:00----------
your hands


---------58:01----------
and the color of them right so i know


---------58:04----------
that you have a lot of


---------58:05----------
um i know that i'm assuming you're


---------58:07----------
wearing makeup


---------58:09----------
i can't really tell um but and then i'm


---------58:11----------
assuming that you know your hair is not


---------58:13----------
normally this color so like people with


---------58:15----------
bitters a high amount of bit that that's


---------58:17----------
correlated with


---------58:18----------
redness in their body and so the palms


---------58:22----------
of your hands


---------58:23----------
um you know are quite red right so it's


---------58:26----------
kind of interesting so if you look at


---------58:27----------
the palms of my hands they're like


---------58:29----------
whitish right


---------58:32----------
yeah so you've got a lot of color there


---------58:34----------
um so


---------58:36----------
and bit this also are kind of like angry


---------58:37----------
they're fiery they're logical they don't


---------58:39----------
take things lying down they stand up for


---------58:42----------
themselves


---------58:44----------
um so that's maybe just a conversation


---------58:46----------
for a different day but i think that


---------58:47----------
like


---------58:48----------
yeah i don't think that you lack


---------58:50----------
confidence i think i think you've just


---------58:52----------
you're trying to figure out like why


---------58:54----------
when you express yourself


---------58:55----------
like people like you've learned that


---------58:56----------
when you express yourself like sometimes


---------58:58----------
it doesn't go well and people like


---------59:00----------
mistreat you


---------59:01----------
which i think sort of makes sense i can


---------59:03----------
sort of understand what you mean also if


---------59:04----------
you say you're not confident because


---------59:06----------
um it does sound like you have thoughts


---------59:08----------
floating around in your head that


---------59:09----------
there's something inherently


---------59:10----------
wrong with you that's a lack of


---------59:12----------
confidence


---------59:13----------
right but i think that those thoughts


---------59:16----------
and i guess i'm gonna


---------59:18----------
so here's what i think by the way


---------59:20----------
because i've started to do that and so


---------59:22----------
let me know


---------59:22----------
you know if it i could be completely


---------59:24----------
wrong let me know what resonates with


---------59:26----------
you and what doesn't


---------59:28----------
but the way that i understand it um is


---------59:30----------
that


---------59:31----------
you know jody you were like so these so


---------59:34----------
let's think about intrusive thoughts for


---------59:35----------
a second so intrusive thoughts are


---------59:37----------
thoughts that are unwanted


---------59:38----------
right that's why we call them intrusive


---------59:40----------
and what they kind of do is they sort of


---------59:42----------
like spawn


---------59:42----------
in your mind like you're like going


---------59:44----------
around about your day like duh duh duh


---------59:45----------
duh


---------59:46----------
like i'm gonna eat a taco and then like


---------59:48----------
this thought spawns in your mind and


---------59:49----------
it's like


---------59:51----------
there's something inherently wrong with


---------59:52----------
you you're like [ __ ]


---------59:55----------
like where is that coming from like i


---------59:58----------
was just trying to eat a taco


---------59:59----------
and there you go again mind telling me


---------60:02----------
that there's something inherently wrong


---------60:03----------
with me it's like oh like


---------60:04----------
hey like do you want to hang out


---------60:05----------
sometime and you're like yeah i want to


---------60:06----------
hang out you go hang out with your


---------60:07----------
friend


---------60:08----------
hey do you want to move in together and


---------60:09----------
your roommate's like hey we should live


---------60:10----------
together that'd be totally awesome


---------60:11----------
you're like yeah that'd be totally


---------60:12----------
awesome


---------60:12----------
you're like that dude and it's like hey


---------60:14----------
there's something inherently wrong with


---------60:15----------
you may [ __ ] it up be careful


---------60:16----------
it's like what the [ __ ] like why does


---------60:20----------
that happen like no


---------60:21----------
no like she likes me she wants me to


---------60:23----------
move in with her this is great we're


---------60:24----------
having fun we've hung out a lot


---------60:26----------
like why are you doing this to be mined


---------60:29----------
where is this coming from


---------60:31----------
and so it's intrusive because


---------60:34----------
much like yourself it shows up at your


---------60:36----------
house invites itself in


---------60:38----------
and takes your bathing suit right


---------60:41----------
it just comes in and it's like but


---------60:44----------
here's the really scary thing because it


---------60:46----------
actually has a right to be there just


---------60:47----------
like you had a right to be there


---------60:51----------
right because here's the thing about


---------60:52----------
intrusive thoughts so


---------60:56----------
intrusive thoughts like get spawned


---------60:59----------
right they're like spawning like there's


---------61:01----------
like a portal


---------61:02----------
somewhere in your subconscious that


---------61:04----------
every now and then


---------61:05----------
gets triggered and then like spawns a


---------61:07----------
mob and then you have to like fight


---------61:09----------
against the intrusive thought


---------61:10----------
and sometimes you kill it and sometimes


---------61:12----------
you don't it sounds like you've gotten


---------61:13----------
pretty good at dealing with them but


---------61:14----------
they keep coming back


---------61:15----------
and you're like confused because despite


---------61:17----------
your confidence


---------61:19----------
despite your success despite the fact


---------61:21----------
that you have friendships


---------61:22----------
i'm assuming just based on what we


---------61:24----------
haven't talked about or that it hasn't


---------61:26----------
come up that your relationship with your


---------61:27----------
boyfriend is pretty good


---------61:29----------
seems like a cool dude um you know


---------61:32----------
because like


---------61:33----------
we've talked about anyway so you want to


---------61:35----------
have a lot of fun we can talk about him


---------61:36----------
but um you know so it seems like you


---------61:39----------
actually do trust people


---------61:41----------
it sounds like you are standing up for


---------61:43----------
yourself like if you have a dad who


---------61:45----------
gets angry all the time and throws


---------61:47----------
things like over the banister and you


---------61:49----------
lack confidence


---------61:50----------
it's really hard at the age of 23


---------61:52----------
especially being a woman to like stand


---------61:53----------
up to a father figure and say like hey


---------61:55----------
this is not okay


---------61:57----------
that doesn't compute for me that this


---------61:59----------
person has low confidence


---------62:01----------
right because like you know inside


---------62:04----------
yourself


---------62:06----------
that like this is the right thing to do


---------62:08----------
and like it needs to be said


---------62:10----------
i think the reason that you call


---------62:12----------
yourself not confident is because you


---------62:13----------
have the intrusive thoughts but like


---------62:15----------
what i want you to understand is that


---------62:16----------
there's you and then there's like this


---------62:19----------
machine over here that's like spawning


---------62:21----------
this portal that's just spawning the


---------62:23----------
intrusive thoughts but that's not really


---------62:24----------
you


---------62:25----------
because you're confident it's just


---------62:27----------
there's this like


---------62:30----------
bit of malware running in the background


---------62:32----------
that is like


---------62:33----------
pop-up ad pop-up ad hey


---------62:36----------
people don't like you hey be careful


---------62:39----------
because they're gonna


---------62:40----------
steal your bathing suit hey and you're


---------62:42----------
like how the [ __ ] do i get this to stop


---------62:44----------
okay does that make sense that resonate


---------62:46----------
with you or okay all right so let's


---------62:48----------
try to understand like where do these


---------62:49----------
portals come from like like


---------62:51----------
and so this is where in in my experience


---------62:54----------
um


---------62:54----------
i like the system of like eastern


---------62:57----------
philosophy or like eastern system of


---------62:59----------
mind so this is where


---------63:01----------
um you know you could go to see a


---------63:04----------
therapist for something like this


---------63:06----------
absolutely but i i really like the


---------63:07----------
eastern conception of like what they say


---------63:09----------
about this kind of stuff


---------63:10----------
which is basically that like there's


---------63:11----------
that little girl so like i want you to


---------63:13----------
think about


---------63:14----------
what was going through your head when


---------63:15----------
you would bury yourself in wood chips


---------63:18----------
like do you remember what kind of


---------63:19----------
thoughts you had


---------63:23----------
um it was specifically after


---------63:26----------
the girls had said some not very nice


---------63:28----------
things to me and they're like


---------63:30----------
yeah we think go away and i remember


---------63:33----------
i wanted to not be there but


---------63:36----------
it was recess i had nowhere else to go


---------63:39----------
yeah and do you remember what you


---------63:41----------
thought about yourself


---------63:46----------
i don't remember specifically anything


---------63:49----------
about like


---------63:50----------
myself i just felt


---------63:55----------
sad and


---------64:00----------
confused


---------64:03----------
i guess unwanted it's like the first


---------64:06----------
thing that comes to mind


---------64:08----------
yeah so that's


---------64:11----------
that's important right because if i


---------64:13----------
think about the


---------64:14----------
i've hypothesized what some of your


---------64:16----------
intrusive thoughts are and i think


---------64:17----------
unwanted


---------64:18----------
is a great way to encapsulate


---------64:22----------
like what is the label on that portal


---------64:25----------
right it's like i'm like be careful


---------64:28----------
jody because they may not want you


---------64:33----------
they want you to move in with them but


---------64:34----------
be careful because if they really know


---------64:36----------
who you are


---------64:37----------
they won't want you anymore right


---------64:40----------
and so i can tell by your face that


---------64:42----------
that's hurts a little bit when i say it


---------64:45----------
right so what are you feeling right now


---------64:50----------
how that makes me really sad


---------64:55----------
and


---------65:00----------
like how it's also unfair to others for


---------65:04----------
me to have that


---------65:05----------
judgment of them or like to think


---------65:08----------
that they are go like uh the other


---------65:11----------
struggle that i have is like people are


---------65:12----------
telling me no jody we love you


---------65:14----------
like i'm here for you i'm not gonna


---------65:16----------
randomly leave you


---------65:17----------
and then i'm like well i know but


---------65:20----------
and then like not only am i sad i'm not


---------65:24----------
like


---------65:24----------
disrespecting their words and how does


---------65:27----------
that make you feel about yourself


---------65:30----------
not good yeah right so you blame


---------65:33----------
yourself


---------65:35----------
for fearing and so now like there's been


---------65:38----------
a big change like you've been really


---------65:39----------
vibrant you've been really open now


---------65:41----------
you're sitting back your arms are


---------65:42----------
crossed right so like


---------65:43----------
we're getting there so now what we're


---------65:46----------
doing is like so


---------65:47----------
these feelings are there and um


---------65:52----------
you know so like this is i i think how


---------65:54----------
we're going to have to work through this


---------65:55----------
because i think the the issue here is


---------65:57----------
that you do have that


---------65:58----------
little kernel of like doubt and then


---------66:01----------
like there's a lot of self-blame there


---------66:03----------
too because like if you think about it


---------66:05----------
even now the way that when you get mad


---------66:07----------
at yourself


---------66:09----------
right like you think that you're the one


---------66:11----------
who's at fault


---------66:13----------
so like like you're mature and you can


---------66:15----------
understand that you didn't really do


---------66:16----------
anything wrong back then but even now


---------66:18----------
there's actually a second portal which


---------66:21----------
is like


---------66:22----------
it's your fault


---------66:25----------
do you see how that's like but that's


---------66:27----------
just as wrong as the first one


---------66:32----------
um i don't like see you say that and i


---------66:36----------
can logically agree


---------66:39----------
and then i think back on myself in these


---------66:42----------
moments and i'm like


---------66:44----------
there's just no way that every single


---------66:47----------
person that has wronged me is


---------66:49----------
like one way straight okay this girl saw


---------66:51----------
me bathing bathing suit well


---------66:52----------
then i'm like it was so long ago that


---------66:55----------
i'm and i


---------66:56----------
feel this way and she was so vehemently


---------66:58----------
like affected by it as


---------67:00----------
well and like you know that i'm like


---------67:01----------
well what if it wasn't


---------67:03----------
her bathing or like what if it was her


---------67:05----------
bathing suit and that


---------67:06----------
can relate to any other situation too


---------67:08----------
i'm like well what if it


---------67:10----------
wasn't my parents switching work like


---------67:12----------
what if they just didn't like me this


---------67:13----------
whole


---------67:13----------
time and they finally got the chance to


---------67:16----------
not be friends with me anymore


---------67:19----------
and that was why they were so mean on


---------67:21----------
top of


---------67:22----------
just like having to distance himself


---------67:24----------
from me


---------67:30----------
okay give me a give me a moment


---------67:33----------
i was very helpful that you said that


---------67:35----------
jody


---------67:41----------
yeah that's all the same thing okay so


---------67:43----------
let me so so what we've got to do is


---------67:45----------
we've got to understand what are the


---------67:46----------
different processes that


---------67:47----------
are running in your mind and where do


---------67:49----------
they come from so i'm going to lay out


---------67:51----------
like


---------67:52----------
a little bit of a like system okay


---------67:55----------
so your mind has a conscious layer and


---------67:57----------
it has an unconscious layer


---------68:00----------
right and so what happens is anytime we


---------68:02----------
feel a lot of emotional pain


---------68:05----------
that that that hurt


---------68:09----------
goes dormant and sort of becomes malware


---------68:11----------
and then sends pop-ups


---------68:13----------
so like you know if we think about like


---------68:15----------
a phobia for example like if i


---------68:17----------
you know get attacked by a dog and then


---------68:20----------
like


---------68:21----------
the next day i'm like gaming and playing


---------68:22----------
halo it's like no big deal my conscious


---------68:24----------
mind is completely fine


---------68:26----------
and then i hear a dog bark inside my


---------68:28----------
house and i'm like oh [ __ ]


---------68:31----------
and then that dormant fear of the dog


---------68:33----------
that came from the trauma


---------68:35----------
surfaces in my mind and starts


---------68:37----------
generating all these thoughts


---------68:39----------
even though there may be like maybe like


---------68:41----------
the tv or something like that i may not


---------68:42----------
actually be in any logical danger but my


---------68:44----------
mind doesn't give a [ __ ]


---------68:46----------
because that emotion is there and it


---------68:49----------
like spawns thoughts


---------68:50----------
so just now you said i think a really


---------68:53----------
telling


---------68:54----------
use a telling sentence


---------68:58----------
that makes me think that this is


---------68:59----------
actually an echo from the past


---------69:02----------
which is when you say oh they finally


---------69:05----------
had the excuse


---------69:06----------
to get rid of me right so


---------69:09----------
that is a thought from a non-confident


---------69:11----------
person


---------69:13----------
that's why you're kind of saying so like


---------69:15----------
if you think about the


---------69:17----------
thinker who generates that thought that


---------69:19----------
thinker believes that they are


---------69:22----------
not intrinsically valuable


---------69:25----------
and so if we think about it like that's


---------69:27----------
kind of confusing because you're


---------69:28----------
confident in yourself but then you have


---------69:30----------
this like


---------69:30----------
portal that's like spawning that has


---------69:34----------
these lingering


---------69:35----------
beliefs and just like me hearing a dog


---------69:37----------
what actually happens is your mind has


---------69:39----------
this function


---------69:41----------
where i know it sounds so simple but


---------69:43----------
what your mind does is look at the


---------69:44----------
environment and then figure out


---------69:46----------
which unconscious programs to turn on


---------69:50----------
right so if i hear my child crying my


---------69:52----------
subconscious mind


---------69:54----------
is going to activate like go into dad


---------69:56----------
mode


---------69:57----------
and then if i'm like you know if q pops


---------70:00----------
when i'm playing a game of dota


---------70:02----------
my mind is like forget about that mode


---------70:05----------
go into wrecking shitties mode right so


---------70:07----------
like your mind is like constantly


---------70:09----------
opening up programs that are appropriate


---------70:11----------
and so what i think is happening with


---------70:12----------
you is that you've you as you encounter


---------70:15----------
situations with new friendships that


---------70:18----------
seem to be going in the right direction


---------70:20----------
your mind is like hold on a second we've


---------70:22----------
been here before


---------70:24----------
and be careful because when this person


---------70:27----------
bullied you and this is so


---------70:28----------
this is why it's so [ __ ] traumatized


---------70:30----------
it's so interesting because like she


---------70:31----------
bullied you once


---------70:33----------
but what really hurts is that y'all


---------70:34----------
became friends and then she did it again


---------70:40----------
right like that's so much worse like she


---------70:43----------
was


---------70:44----------
she had grown up and y'all were supposed


---------70:48----------
to be friends


---------70:50----------
and y'all sort of were friends and so


---------70:52----------
then your mind learns


---------70:56----------
that friends are gonna steal my bathing


---------70:58----------
suits


---------71:00----------
and so then you're going along and then


---------71:01----------
your your roommate and best friend is


---------71:02----------
like hey let's be roommates and then


---------71:04----------
there's this part of your mind that's


---------71:05----------
like hold on a second


---------71:06----------
we've been here before she's gonna take


---------71:09----------
your bathing suit


---------71:10----------
and then she's gonna talk [ __ ] about you


---------71:12----------
to everyone that you know


---------71:14----------
and then they're gonna realize


---------71:16----------
everyone's gonna realize that i'm a bad


---------71:18----------
person


---------71:23----------
right but the the i know it's weird


---------71:26----------
so what are you penny for your thoughts


---------71:28----------
because i don't know where you are right


---------71:29----------
now


---------71:30----------
right as you said that i it's not


---------71:32----------
actually


---------71:34----------
that i uh so


---------71:37----------
it's more of so i specifically think of


---------71:39----------
my roommate right now who i think really


---------71:41----------
highly of i actually like


---------71:44----------
is when i think about what would happen


---------71:46----------
i'm like


---------71:47----------
she's just this great well-rounded woman


---------71:51----------
that i view herself highly that she's


---------71:54----------
gonna look at me and be like


---------71:56----------
and then it's not so much talk [ __ ] it's


---------71:58----------
just that she's gonna realize that


---------72:01----------
she can have just better friends than me


---------72:05----------
yeah okay so so the talk [ __ ] was off


---------72:08----------
but that


---------72:09----------
you will be revealed right to be worth


---------72:12----------
less than what you're faking it


---------72:16----------
like everyone is is you know oh she like


---------72:19----------
did her hair like oh that's so great but


---------72:20----------
she doesn't realize that i'm not really


---------72:22----------
worth a whole lot


---------72:23----------
and so i can understand why you feel


---------72:25----------
sort of like like obviously that's not


---------72:26----------
confidence but


---------72:27----------
what i think this is is a some scar


---------72:29----------
which is the sort of buried emotion


---------72:31----------
and somewhere along the way your mind


---------72:33----------
kind of learned


---------72:34----------
that you are not worth very much and so


---------72:37----------
what happens is as long as that core


---------72:39----------
belief is sitting in your subconscious


---------72:41----------
it's going to continue spawning these


---------72:43----------
thoughts because that's kind of what it


---------72:45----------
does it's sort of like you know it's


---------72:46----------
like a generator


---------72:47----------
it's like a thought generator and there


---------72:50----------
are some situations that are going to


---------72:52----------
trigger them


---------72:53----------
the interesting thing is that you can


---------72:55----------
get rid of that so i think if you


---------72:56----------
haven't seen a therapist like a


---------72:58----------
therapist sounds like it would be like a


---------72:59----------
good move for you and like work through


---------73:01----------
some of these things


---------73:03----------
it's not the only way to get rid of it


---------73:04----------
but it's something that i'd highly


---------73:05----------
recommend that you try


---------73:08----------
um what do you think about that by the


---------73:09----------
way


---------73:11----------
i've always wanted a therapist um it was


---------73:14----------
just like


---------73:16----------
the means of finding one and


---------73:19----------
also just delegating the time for one


---------73:23----------
okay so um you know just as an aside so


---------73:27----------
so therapy is really designed to treat


---------73:29----------
diagnose and treat


---------73:31----------
mental illnesses right so it can be used


---------73:35----------
for a lot more than that


---------73:36----------
but what i really think about is like


---------73:38----------
therapy is about bringing people


---------73:39----------
up to baseline like if they're below


---------73:42----------
baseline


---------73:43----------
the other thing you could always try


---------73:44----------
because it's quite accessible and and


---------73:46----------
easy is you could try our coaching


---------73:48----------
program i think there's now


---------73:50----------
a specific deal that we have with twitch


---------73:52----------
where they're


---------73:53----------
supporting that kind of thing um and a


---------73:56----------
lot of creators seem to be like getting


---------73:58----------
help from it


---------74:00----------
so um you know i can send you more


---------74:01----------
information about either


---------74:03----------
we will send you information about how


---------74:04----------
to find a therapist if you're interested


---------74:06----------
or how to sign up for the coaching


---------74:07----------
program and i'd be curious um you know


---------74:09----------
whether you would find that helpful or


---------74:10----------
not but our coaches are sort of trained


---------74:12----------
in this methodology of like trying to


---------74:13----------
understand


---------74:14----------
like you know where does this stuff come


---------74:15----------
from um


---------74:18----------
where was i going yeah so i think that


---------74:21----------
uh jody the other thing to kind of just


---------74:22----------
think about is that like


---------74:24----------
when i say some of these words and you


---------74:27----------
feel hurt now this is going to get weird


---------74:31----------
okay because


---------74:32----------
that is bringing the past into the


---------74:35----------
present


---------74:37----------
so you were saying that you usually go


---------74:39----------
from the present into the past


---------74:43----------
right so the way that you digest the way


---------74:45----------
that you close control all delete


---------74:48----------
and and task that thing because i want


---------74:50----------
you to think about it like an emotional


---------74:52----------
echo


---------74:53----------
it's like you had all that hurt like


---------74:54----------
there's just so much hurt back then


---------74:56----------
and you've learned how to wall it off


---------74:58----------
with humor


---------74:59----------
so like you've learned how to minimize


---------75:01----------
the pop-up so it's like just sitting


---------75:02----------
there at the bottom of your taskbar but


---------75:04----------
it's still taking up ram


---------75:06----------
you don't see it anymore and you kind of


---------75:07----------
laugh like any every time you like


---------75:09----------
instead of hitting the x


---------75:10----------
you learn how to minimize and that's


---------75:12----------
what humor is


---------75:13----------
and you have a lot of humor and so like


---------75:16----------
the more


---------75:17----------
you laugh like the more there's


---------75:19----------
something there


---------75:21----------
you know and so the way that you close


---------75:24----------
it is by bringing that past


---------75:26----------
into the present and see like already


---------75:28----------
now you're like a little bit more


---------75:29----------
relaxed your arms are uncrossed like i'd


---------75:31----------
imagine you're feeling less emotion


---------75:33----------
because we're processing it


---------75:35----------
right you were like then like now it's


---------75:38----------
like


---------75:39----------
okay so like it kind of gets lighter and


---------75:41----------
over time like that emotional energy


---------75:43----------
will like start to dwindle as you like


---------75:45----------
sit with it now


---------75:47----------
and um uh what i would kind of say is


---------75:49----------
that like


---------75:50----------
i understand that 23 year old jody has


---------75:53----------
understood all these things and you're


---------75:55----------
like a grown and strong


---------75:56----------
and capable woman who's moved out and is


---------75:59----------
financially independent and like you're


---------76:00----------
confident right


---------76:01----------
it's so confusing because there's like


---------76:03----------
also the like seven-year-old jody


---------76:05----------
is floating around in your unconscious


---------76:07----------
and you carry her with you because she


---------76:09----------
never like


---------76:09----------
processed because kids don't


---------76:13----------
questions


---------76:16----------
i'm absorbing okay


---------76:24----------
i'm just trying to think about whether i


---------76:26----------
have other things to say


---------76:29----------
yeah so let's just sit with that for a


---------76:31----------
second and then like let me know


---------76:34----------
process and then let me know if you have


---------76:36----------
thoughts or questions


---------76:45----------
it's an interesting thought to me to


---------76:48----------
consider


---------76:49----------
my 23 year old self as this and my seven


---------76:53----------
year old self is this rather than this


---------76:56----------
yep yeah


---------77:00----------
that's what's really confusing for


---------77:02----------
people right as we think of


---------77:03----------
our our mind as monolithic


---------77:07----------
but like you're clearly a confident


---------77:09----------
person jody


---------77:11----------
and you're also clearly not confident at


---------77:14----------
times


---------77:15----------
so how can those two contrary things


---------77:17----------
exist


---------77:18----------
and what the yogis figured out is that


---------77:20----------
the mind is not a thing


---------77:22----------
it is a fluctuation so fluctuations at a


---------77:26----------
particular wavelength


---------77:28----------
produce a particular sound and


---------77:30----------
fluctuations at a different wavelength


---------77:31----------
produce a different sound


---------77:33----------
so in the right circumstance hopefully


---------77:35----------
when you're with your boyfriend or


---------77:37----------
hanging out with your mom


---------77:38----------
you produce a particular wavelength


---------77:40----------
where you feel confident and good in


---------77:41----------
yourself


---------77:42----------
and there's certain circumstances that


---------77:45----------
will


---------77:46----------
hit a certain twang on your guitar


---------77:48----------
string it'll hit a different guitar


---------77:50----------
string it'll create a different


---------77:51----------
fluctuation in your mind and then you'll


---------77:53----------
feel less confident


---------77:57----------
and so people are confused but like


---------78:00----------
that's how it works and so is it


---------78:01----------
essentially what we can do by like


---------78:04----------
bringing the past into the present i


---------78:05----------
if you want to i can we can do more of


---------78:07----------
that i'll basically say things that are


---------78:09----------
going to make you feel


---------78:10----------
more of the hurt come up right because i


---------78:13----------
know how to tune your guitar strings and


---------78:16----------
so i can you know say things to you that


---------78:17----------
are going to be like empathic


---------78:19----------
and i will pity you and then it's going


---------78:20----------
to like bring up this emotion


---------78:23----------
right if i start to feel sad for you


---------78:25----------
it's gonna like it's gonna be weird


---------78:26----------
you're gonna try to laugh it off for a


---------78:28----------
little while


---------78:28----------
and then like you know but if i persist


---------78:31----------
and i don't let you squirrel away


---------78:33----------
and like make me smile and if i persist


---------78:36----------
in being sad for you


---------78:38----------
then like something weird is gonna


---------78:40----------
happen


---------78:42----------
i just don't know that we want to go


---------78:44----------
there today does that make sense


---------78:46----------
it is so interesting to me


---------78:50----------
that i have subconsciously been doing


---------78:54----------
that


---------78:56----------
like i really really ha i don't want


---------78:59----------
people to feel bad for me


---------79:10----------
yeah i'm like really intrigued by that


---------79:14----------
i didn't really notice that i


---------79:20----------
as much as i want to talk and tell


---------79:22----------
people my story at the same time i don't


---------79:24----------
want that exact story


---------79:26----------
to make people sad or like


---------79:29----------
feel bad for me


---------79:33----------
you want to go there or enough for today


---------79:37----------
seriously what's wrong with making


---------79:40----------
people feel sad


---------79:47----------
[Music]


---------79:48----------
um


---------79:51----------
i don't i guess i don't think to myself


---------79:55----------
it's wrong to make people feel sad yeah


---------79:57----------
i know i just think that i approach


---------80:00----------
conversations or just whatever in


---------80:02----------
general


---------80:04----------
as i want to make people laugh


---------80:08----------
why is that important to you


---------80:14----------
it brings me joy like it makes me feel


---------80:18----------
fulfilled


---------80:21----------
yeah okay


---------80:24----------
so it's definitely like also a selfish


---------80:26----------
thing like i'm


---------80:28----------
approaching this conversation to make


---------80:31----------
you laugh which in turn makes me feel


---------80:32----------
fulfilled which is like


---------80:34----------
streaming like i want to farm little w's


---------80:37----------
not like decolons


---------80:40----------
i i don't know what that means they're


---------80:43----------
just emotes


---------80:45----------
okay pretty much i just don't


---------80:48----------
call in a penis


---------80:51----------
no okay


---------80:59----------
cuz you know what penis is a part of the


---------81:01----------
d the d is the


---------81:03----------
so is so many other things part of the d


---------81:05----------
um


---------81:07----------
it's one of the three it's a bunch of


---------81:09----------
colons followed by a d


---------81:11----------
is that not the same


---------81:19----------
yeah anyways it's like the sadness


---------81:23----------
shock e-boat okay okay oh yeah these are


---------81:26----------
like the cheat codes where if you type


---------81:28----------
in something it shows an emote yeah


---------81:30----------
i recently discovered that i was


---------81:31----------
figuring out how to make a fish


---------81:34----------
i figured out the fish is four o's


---------81:40----------
okay do you feel fulfilled now


---------81:45----------
yeah interesting right so we can make


---------81:48----------
you laugh and then


---------81:49----------
feel fulfilled so what's it like if we


---------81:53----------
don't laugh how do you feel


---------81:57----------
um


---------82:01----------
i may have just screwed it up by the way


---------82:03----------
if we were gonna try to go there i may


---------82:04----------
have just destroyed the emotional


---------82:05----------
wavelength but whatever


---------82:07----------
i maybe for another day


---------82:11----------
i can't just i don't maybe like it's not


---------82:14----------
uncomfortable


---------82:16----------
unsettled maybe or like


---------82:19----------
it can't end there like if we end the


---------82:22----------
conversation


---------82:23----------
sad i like cannot


---------82:27----------
okay right so so what i'm hearing is


---------82:29----------
that you can't sit with the sadness


---------82:33----------
yeah right so like that's so


---------82:36----------
until you can sit with the sadness the


---------82:38----------
intrusive thoughts will continue


---------82:42----------
right so what we've got to do is like


---------82:45----------
let seven-year-old jody like come and


---------82:47----------
sit in our lap and we've got to let her


---------82:49----------
cry and we just have to like kind of be


---------82:50----------
there with her and let her cry


---------82:52----------
and like pat her on the back you know we


---------82:54----------
don't need to distract her with jokes


---------82:56----------
and tell her everything's okay like we


---------82:58----------
have to sit with her and tell her like


---------82:59----------
hey


---------83:00----------
what happened to you is not okay and


---------83:02----------
it's not


---------83:03----------
fair that you feel like you're a bad


---------83:05----------
person because you're not a bad person


---------83:09----------
and it's really really sad that they


---------83:10----------
have done something to you to


---------83:12----------
make you feel and believe that you are


---------83:15----------
not a good person


---------83:16----------
and that you are not worth being friends


---------83:18----------
with


---------83:20----------
and you don't deserve that and you


---------83:23----------
didn't do anything wrong


---------83:46----------
foreign


---------84:00----------
foreign


---------84:11----------
what was that like for you well the


---------84:14----------
whole time i'm like


---------84:15----------
see no jokes no no cracking up


---------84:19----------
but i also like


---------84:26----------
i it's like so a part of me


---------84:30----------
wants to hear those words and allow that


---------84:32----------
and allow me to feel those raw emotions


---------84:34----------
and then the other part of me is like


---------84:36----------
he cannot


---------84:40----------
yeah what would happen if i did


---------84:59----------
i just feel like


---------85:03----------
a motion that i show that is not


---------85:05----------
calculated is wrong


---------85:08----------
okay so i can take that i think we're at


---------85:11----------
a good stopping point for today


---------85:14----------
if you have more thoughts and questions


---------85:15----------
i think that's totally fine but


---------85:17----------
what i mean to say is that i think we've


---------85:19----------
reached a good spot and we shouldn't


---------85:21----------
push any further i think we've reached


---------85:23----------
the limit of


---------85:25----------
how far i understand that you're willing


---------85:28----------
and enthusiastic consciously i think


---------85:29----------
subconsciously this is like


---------85:32----------
this was hard for you and so i i think


---------85:35----------
you did a great job but i don't think we


---------85:36----------
should push anymore


---------85:38----------
so a couple of things one is you got to


---------85:40----------
give this time right because for


---------85:44----------
years if not decades um


---------85:50----------
you haven't like you know that he


---------85:53----------
cannot is like that's a strong like you


---------85:56----------
that


---------85:57----------
there's a lot of strength behind that


---------85:58----------
does that make sense


---------86:00----------
it's like a minotaur it's like not


---------86:03----------
no is what it's saying and so that we


---------86:07----------
have to


---------86:08----------
we don't want to force it it's going to


---------86:10----------
have the opposite


---------86:11----------
result right so like what we're doing is


---------86:13----------
like when you're under the bridge


---------86:15----------
or under the stairs and in a pile of


---------86:17----------
wood chips


---------86:18----------
what we don't want to do is like i'm not


---------86:20----------
going to reach my hand and like yank you


---------86:22----------
out and i'm like you don't have to be


---------86:23----------
down there


---------86:24----------
i'm going to no no no what we're going


---------86:25----------
to do is we're going to sit outside


---------86:26----------
we're going to sit right by the stairs


---------86:28----------
and we're going to be like jody whenever


---------86:31----------
you're ready


---------86:32----------
i'm here if you want to come out


---------86:36----------
and we can talk about it and then jody's


---------86:38----------
like


---------86:39----------
no i'm not no go away and so we're just


---------86:42----------
going to sit


---------86:45----------
and we're going to be patient so you


---------86:46----------
need to give yourself some time


---------86:48----------
another thing to think about because you


---------86:50----------
are a streamer


---------86:51----------
is that um you know when we talk about


---------86:54----------
boundaries so we should really think


---------86:56----------
about whether this is the kind of thing


---------86:57----------
that


---------86:59----------
are we making it hard for you harder


---------87:01----------
than it needs to be or that it deserves


---------87:03----------
to be because you're talking about it on


---------87:04----------
stream


---------87:05----------
so we want to create an environment


---------87:07----------
where maybe privacy would help you come


---------87:09----------
out more


---------87:10----------
definitely something to think about


---------87:13----------
right because you do say i don't want


---------87:14----------
people to feel this way so like that's


---------87:15----------
fine


---------87:16----------
leave your streamer persona how it is


---------87:18----------
but you get to have a space maybe


---------87:20----------
privately like you can kind of think


---------87:21----------
through that


---------87:22----------
um but i really encourage you to like


---------87:25----------
learn how to sit with it


---------87:27----------
because i i think like she's been down


---------87:28----------
there for a while and like she doesn't


---------87:30----------
you know


---------87:34----------
and she's like under the stairs and then


---------87:36----------
like you're going about your business


---------87:37----------
and then occasionally she'll sob and


---------87:39----------
send a thought your way


---------87:42----------
right so thoughts about that questions


---------87:45----------
does that sound okay to you


---------87:47----------
yes okay


---------87:50----------
i am really welcoming the


---------87:54----------
idea of


---------87:57----------
seeing myself underneath the stairs


---------88:00----------
covered in wood chips and seeing that as


---------88:03----------
myself


---------88:04----------
but also seeing that as like just a


---------88:06----------
little girl that i would


---------88:09----------
comfort and treat a little differently


---------88:12----------
yeah you gotta treat her like your cat


---------88:15----------
yeah


---------88:16----------
that's that's what the girl under the


---------88:18----------
stairs needs right like she just


---------88:21----------
you know and and i think that like by


---------88:24----------
the way this is what we call like i know


---------88:25----------
there are a bunch of instagram posts


---------88:26----------
about


---------88:27----------
self-compassion that's what that is by


---------88:29----------
the way


---------88:31----------
right so i think you're really good at


---------88:33----------
protecting other people you're really


---------88:35----------
good at making them laugh but i don't


---------88:36----------
know that you're actually compassionate


---------88:38----------
towards yourself


---------88:40----------
i can tell that you're kind of a treat


---------88:41----------
yo self kind of person like i get that i


---------88:43----------
get that you're like about


---------88:44----------
living which is it but that's 23 year


---------88:46----------
old you


---------88:48----------
mm-hmm and i get that i get that vibe


---------88:51----------
um but i you know that's self-compassion


---------88:54----------
and it's


---------88:54----------
something that's hard to learn cool


---------88:59----------
cool um


---------89:02----------
so i also often times will teach people


---------89:04----------
how to meditate


---------89:06----------
i'm sort of drawing a blank there but


---------89:08----------
i'm curious are you interested in


---------89:09----------
meditation


---------89:11----------
yes okay [ __ ] i have to come up with


---------89:14----------
something


---------89:18----------
okay i'm gonna need a minute is that


---------89:20----------
okay that's fine


---------89:23----------
what are we gonna what kind of


---------89:24----------
meditation helps for being buried in


---------89:26----------
wood chips


---------89:46----------
i want to teach you something fun but


---------89:49----------
what do i know that's fun


---------89:52----------
what's gonna help you


---------90:00----------
have you tried meditation before


---------90:23----------
okay so i also try to teach a little bit


---------90:26----------
of variety but it's occurring to me that


---------90:27----------
maybe what we need to do is just because


---------90:29----------
we've never had done meditation we still


---------90:30----------
got to start with the basics we can't


---------90:32----------
jump straight to advanced techniques


---------90:34----------
so i'm gonna tell you you've got two


---------90:35----------
options you've got one that's


---------90:38----------
energetic and one that's common


---------90:42----------
which one do you want


---------90:49----------
okay so i'm gonna teach you how to chant


---------90:51----------
okay we're gonna do ohm chanting


---------90:55----------
this is gonna sound weird all right so i


---------90:57----------
gotta i can't i've learned how to not


---------90:59----------
leak things so i gotta move to push to


---------91:00----------
talk and this gets really confusing for


---------91:03----------
everyone because


---------91:05----------
i forget to push push to talk so you


---------91:08----------
probably can't hear me anymore


---------91:09----------
yeah yeah so i'm gonna forget to push


---------91:12----------
push to talk a lot so


---------91:13----------
it's gonna be rough on you okay


---------91:17----------
so um this this we have to do just


---------91:19----------
because of the way that discord voice


---------91:20----------
activity picks up


---------91:21----------
the chant oh so i'm gonna chant om


---------91:25----------
um so om is composed of three syllables


---------91:28----------
ah


---------91:31----------
and the reason that we sort of do that


---------91:33----------
is because


---------91:34----------
om starts with a fully open mouth so


---------91:37----------
open your mouth as loud as you can or


---------91:39----------
wow wide as you can and then make a


---------91:42----------
sound


---------91:44----------
right now yeah yeah try as wide as i can


---------91:47----------
yeah and then make sound ah


---------91:51----------
there you go see there's ah right okay


---------91:53----------
and then close your mouth entirely and


---------91:54----------
then make a sound


---------91:57----------
there we go right so that's the ah and


---------91:59----------
the um and in the middle of those is


---------92:01----------
going to be the ooh


---------92:02----------
so um


---------92:06----------
got got me so that's actually where so


---------92:08----------
like this looks


---------92:09----------
pretty confusing because people is like


---------92:11----------
oh om is like the fundamental sound of


---------92:13----------
the universe man


---------92:15----------
it's not it's really not i mean sure


---------92:18----------
it's the fundamental sound of the


---------92:20----------
universe you know if you're a yoga


---------92:22----------
calendar


---------92:23----------
but what it really is it's just like uh


---------92:29----------
okay so that's ohm so we're gonna do is


---------92:31----------
chant it


---------92:32----------
five times i want you to really use your


---------92:35----------
testicles to their maximum


---------92:37----------
when you're chanting okay and so i'm


---------92:40----------
going to demonstrate once


---------92:42----------
and then we'll do it once together


---------92:45----------
we'll check in for a second just make


---------92:48----------
sure that you feel comfortable doing it


---------92:49----------
and then we'll do like five rounds


---------92:51----------
okay so i'm gonna sit up straight so


---------92:54----------
it's important when you meditate that


---------92:55----------
your back be straight


---------92:57----------
so since you're pre-med i'm gonna ask


---------92:59----------
you


---------93:00----------
questions that will test your ability to


---------93:04----------
you know be a surgeon so what are the


---------93:06----------
different positions that your back can


---------93:07----------
be straight


---------93:10----------
lying down yes yep


---------93:13----------
and standing up right so those are the


---------93:15----------
three beautiful


---------93:16----------
right so like it perfect so that's why


---------93:18----------
those are the three positions that we


---------93:20----------
can do when we meditate


---------93:21----------
another little tip um how tall are you


---------93:24----------
five


---------93:24----------
three and do your feet touch the floor


---------93:26----------
when you're in your chair


---------93:28----------
no are your feet down right now i have a


---------93:32----------
yoga block


---------93:34----------
you have a yoga block where oh beneath


---------93:36----------
your feet my feet


---------93:37----------
okay so so this is what i want you to do


---------93:39----------
can you sit cross-legged


---------93:41----------
uh yes okay so but this is gonna be


---------93:44----------
tricky you're gonna have to put


---------93:45----------
the cat down because what i want you to


---------93:46----------
do is sit on the yoga block


---------93:49----------
put your butt on the yoga block and then


---------93:51----------
sit cross-legged so that


---------93:52----------
how big is yoga block is small right yes


---------93:55----------

---------93:59----------

---------94:03----------
and so that you're but i want you to


---------94:06----------

---------94:20----------
okay okay


---------94:20----------
okay cross-legged first just sit


---------94:22----------
cross-legged


---------94:24----------
indian style if you want to culturally


---------94:25----------
appropriate something


---------94:27----------
okay so notice what your back is doing


---------94:30----------
what's your back doing


---------94:32----------
uh yeah perky uh nobody can see jody


---------94:36----------

---------94:39----------

---------94:44----------
bit maybe you feel that


---------94:48----------

---------94:51----------
the yoga block but like not don't have


---------94:53----------
your feet on the yoga block like sit


---------94:55----------

---------95:29----------
taller now yeah yeah i think you're five


---------95:33----------
five


---------95:35----------
definitely okay so now i'm gonna


---------95:37----------
demonstrate so we're gonna sit up


---------95:38----------
straight


---------95:38----------
okay okay and then i'll demonstrate one


---------95:54----------
round


---------96:10----------
[Music]


---------96:14----------
got it yes okay


---------96:17----------
like i said use your testicles yeah i'm


---------96:20----------
impressed by how long you were able to


---------96:22----------
hold that


---------96:22----------
yeah it doesn't need to be that long


---------96:24----------
okay okay


---------96:26----------
um so deep breath in and let's begin


---------96:46----------
great job couple things to do one is


---------96:48----------
eyes need to be closed


---------96:50----------
secondly is if you bob your head around


---------96:52----------
your back is not straight


---------96:53----------
spine needs to stay straight okay nope


---------96:56----------
none of this


---------96:57----------
bobbing of the heads that's too much


---------97:00----------
cultural appropriation you only get to


---------97:02----------
do that if you're indian


---------97:03----------
okay so back straight we're gonna do it


---------97:05----------
again okay and then so eyes closed it's


---------97:07----------
a big deep breath


---------97:09----------
ah ooh and um


---------97:22----------
[Music]


---------97:22----------
[Laughter]


---------97:31----------
[Music]


---------97:32----------
good i definitely cannot hold it as long


---------97:35----------
as you


---------97:36----------
that's okay so just just just do it


---------97:37----------
we'll shorten it okay so i want you to


---------97:39----------
do whatever you're comfortable with in


---------97:41----------
terms of the length


---------97:42----------
and i want you did great you may feel a


---------97:45----------
little bit silly or self-conscious


---------97:47----------
i want you to just chant through it so


---------97:49----------
we're going to do five rounds in a row


---------97:52----------
um let me just think about whether do


---------97:55----------
you feel comfortable leading and all


---------97:57----------
kind of follow your lead or do you want


---------97:58----------
me to lead


---------97:59----------
okay you lead okay so


---------98:03----------
i'll follow you so you go forward eyes


---------98:04----------
closed five rounds


---------98:06----------
and then after we're done i want you to


---------98:07----------
just stay silent


---------98:10----------
with your eyes closed i know this is


---------98:12----------
gonna sound weird


---------98:13----------
sit in the post post-meditation space


---------98:16----------
you can continue to breathe and stuff i


---------98:18----------
know it sounds weird you'll understand


---------98:19----------
when we get there


---------98:20----------
just hang out after we're done with the


---------98:22----------
practice and when you're ready to


---------98:24----------
open your eyes do you want to sit on a


---------98:26----------
pillow instead of the block would that


---------98:27----------
be easier


---------98:28----------
i'm struggling on the block


---------98:32----------
all right but thankfully i have a


---------98:33----------
plethora of pillows here


---------98:39----------
all right there we go okay back straight


---------98:44----------
take it away jody okay


---------98:58----------
[Music]


---------99:10----------
beautiful


---------99:15----------
[Music]


---------99:19----------
great again


---------99:26----------
[Music]


---------99:33----------
three more


---------99:41----------
[Music]


---------99:47----------
[Music]


---------99:52----------
oh


---------100:02----------
last one big deep breath


---------100:06----------
oh


---------100:11----------
[Music]


---------100:35----------
you


---------101:03----------
if you're ready you can go ahead and


---------101:05----------
come on back okay it came back a little


---------101:07----------
bit earlier to be honest but you you're


---------101:09----------
nice and then i


---------101:10----------
can tell i could tell i could tell you


---------101:12----------
just have a lot of trouble just sitting


---------101:14----------
[ __ ] still


---------101:15----------
so we'll teach you that yeah so this is


---------101:18----------
why i like to combine


---------101:19----------
meditation so if you want to see a


---------101:21----------
therapist i think we're going to send


---------101:22----------
you some information everyone who comes


---------101:24----------
on stream will send you like a guide of


---------101:25----------
how to find a therapist and stuff like


---------101:26----------
that


---------101:27----------
um you know if you want to sign up for


---------101:29----------
the coaching program whatever but here's


---------101:30----------
the cool thing


---------101:31----------
so i think meditation works very


---------101:33----------
synergistically with therapy if you


---------101:34----------
decide to go that route


---------101:35----------
because what we're going to literally


---------101:37----------
teach you how to do is


---------101:38----------
sit and just sit with what you feel


---------101:42----------
without reacting to it


---------101:44----------
right because right now jody what you


---------101:47----------
really the biggest thing that i'd say


---------101:48----------
you need to grow


---------101:49----------
is like you need to be able to sit with


---------101:51----------
things without reacting to them


---------101:53----------
very reactive i mean don't get me wrong


---------101:55----------
it's a beautiful reaction but it's still


---------101:56----------
like


---------101:57----------
reactive you can't tolerate so many


---------102:00----------
things


---------102:01----------
and so just sit


---------102:04----------
you're fine you're perfect just the way


---------102:06----------
you are you don't need people to think


---------102:07----------
differently


---------102:08----------
you don't need to be different you don't


---------102:10----------
need to have a different color hair you


---------102:11----------
don't need to do this you don't need to


---------102:12----------
do that


---------102:13----------
you're great just the way you are your


---------102:16----------
cat


---------102:16----------
understands this cat doesn't want you to


---------102:19----------
be different


---------102:20----------
you're just be you


---------102:24----------

---------102:27----------
