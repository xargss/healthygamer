---------00:00----------
welcoming it up is it okay if I call you


---------00:02----------
Anita mm-hmm certainly


---------00:05----------
and so when you so tell us a little bit


---------00:08----------
about so what do you want to talk about


---------00:11----------

---------00:13----------
helping us or what's going on whatever


---------00:15----------
you'd like I mean you're welcome to ask


---------00:17----------
me anything you want a lot of people


---------00:19----------
tend to ask about my condition and


---------00:21----------
you're totally free to you if you'd like


---------00:23----------
I hear that you have particular


---------00:26----------
expertise with burnout um yeah also like


---------00:30----------
we can talk we can touch on a little bit


---------00:31----------
about like the pressure of being online


---------00:35----------
and you know receiving a lot of abuse


---------00:37----------
and kind of like prejudices against


---------00:39----------
people with disabilities if you like as


---------00:41----------
well because that's a very loud aspect


---------00:43----------
of my existence that's right if I have


---------00:45----------
to kind of try and ignore on a daily


---------00:47----------
basis yeah so I mean absolutely I mean


---------00:51----------
if there's some way that I can be


---------00:52----------
helpful with you about burnout and that


---------00:53----------
is sort of my I mean I guess I'm


---------00:56----------
developing a different professional


---------00:57----------
expertise nowadays but that was sort of


---------00:59----------
my traditional area of expertise so can


---------01:02----------
you tell us a little bit about can you


---------01:05----------
just tell us a little bit about yourself


---------01:06----------
and then we can talk about burnout or


---------01:09----------
sure I'm Suniya I've been a streamer for


---------01:12----------
about two years now and I went I went


---------01:16----------
viral pretty much as soon as I hit the


---------01:17----------
ground on twitch so I was completely


---------01:20----------
lost and I've been playing catch-up ever


---------01:22----------
since with a crazy amount of growth my


---------01:26----------
stream is mainly variety streaming


---------01:29----------
mostly just chatting and yeah I've been


---------01:33----------
working on you know a mental health


---------01:35----------
topic since I started really because


---------01:37----------
then I'm forgetting that yeah I mean I


---------01:40----------
kind of feel like the platform really


---------01:41----------
needs it this is this whole platform


---------01:43----------
feels like a symptom of loneliness like


---------01:45----------
people want company um so a lot of the


---------01:47----------
people who come here at people yeah a


---------01:51----------
symptom of loneliness I love that yeah


---------01:56----------
so so you're you're whistling mmm oh


---------02:02----------
that's a tick okay I can't help it and


---------02:07----------
and does your the the right eye blinking


---------02:11----------
that's a tick as well okay


---------02:13----------
so you're not just does it have any


---------02:16----------
amount of winking or it's just a tick


---------02:19----------
it's just a tick okay trouble a lot leap


---------02:22----------
because okay if I go to nightclubs where


---------02:24----------
I can't really explain myself right


---------02:26----------
easily across the room a lot of people


---------02:28----------
think I'm hitting on them when I'm


---------02:30----------
really really not yeah


---------02:32----------
so can you tell us a little bit about


---------02:33----------
ticks and what's up with that so I have


---------02:37----------
a condition called Tourette's syndrome


---------02:39----------
a lot of people get symptoms in that


---------02:41----------
early childhood but my family can


---------02:44----------
remember symptoms coming from about the


---------02:46----------
at least the age of one


---------02:48----------
I have involuntary movements and speech


---------02:52----------
so I'll quite often say things that are


---------02:54----------
inappropriate if that happens during the


---------02:56----------
stream I'm very sorry it's not a


---------02:58----------
reflection of what I'm thinking and


---------02:59----------
that's a common misconception about


---------03:00----------
Tourette's syndrome is that it's what


---------03:02----------
was secretly thinking I wish we could


---------03:04----------
say but if it's mostly worth salad you


---------03:06----------
don't know what's gonna get tossed up if


---------03:08----------
it's relevant to the situation at all


---------03:10----------
and sometimes it is it's usually because


---------03:12----------
I'm worried about saying it rather than


---------03:13----------
because it's actually what I'm thinking


---------03:15----------
or feeling because worrying about being


---------03:17----------
inappropriate quite often forces you to


---------03:19----------
be inappropriate as someone with


---------03:21----------
Tourette's but it can be very


---------03:22----------
unfortunate and dangerous in public but


---------03:25----------
luckily slightly less dangerous if you


---------03:26----------
you know have an internet-based job


---------03:28----------
where people get crossed with you they


---------03:30----------
can't do anything about it


---------03:34----------
and and so tell me do you have you


---------03:37----------
noticed that some things make your tics


---------03:39----------
better or worse oh yeah definitely I


---------03:42----------
think that's the case for a lot of


---------03:44----------
people with Tourette's syndrome making


---------03:45----------
music definitely definitely a lot of


---------03:48----------
people with even severe Tourette's


---------03:50----------
syndrome have consumed without tics or


---------03:55----------
perhaps play an instrument without


---------03:57----------
having any ticks at all and there are


---------03:59----------
lots of things a lot of people ask if I


---------04:02----------
tick during sex and I've this is a


---------04:04----------
question I ask a lot of people who also


---------04:06----------
have Tourette's syndrome across the


---------04:07----------
board if if the sex is good no


---------04:11----------
kiss focus and if you're enjoying


---------04:15----------
something and it requires a lot of focus


---------04:16----------
and you're very much engaged with what


---------04:18----------
you're doing


---------04:19----------
it definitely reduces the tics there's


---------04:21----------
lots of where there's lots of things


---------04:23----------
that do reduce the tics exercise things


---------04:26----------
like


---------04:26----------
I don't took as much around my personal


---------04:28----------
trainer um so he's quite shocked what he


---------04:30----------
sees videos of me yeah so yeah


---------04:34----------
definitely and there are things


---------04:35----------
exacerbate it too like high stress


---------04:37----------
situations high emotion feelings of


---------04:38----------
awkwardness my biggest trigger is


---------04:40----------
awkwardness


---------04:41----------
so I can't watch mr. bean quietly that's


---------04:43----------
for sure mr. bean is amazing yes so


---------04:49----------
stress and and what about burnout so I


---------04:53----------
have always I used to be a cafe Bicks


---------04:57----------
and my life was really still for a while


---------04:58----------
and I think that was the worst thing I


---------05:00----------
ever experienced honestly so I have


---------05:03----------
always been chasing things to do and I


---------05:07----------
can never say no and even before I start


---------05:10----------
streaming it was a bit of a problem


---------05:11----------
because I used to run a business I used


---------05:13----------
to care for my mom used to care for


---------05:14----------
rescue animals and I used to do rescue


---------05:16----------
volunteering and the four of them put


---------05:18----------
together sometimes I'd come home for an


---------05:19----------
hour and then go straight back out again


---------05:21----------
and I would do that for days on end and


---------05:23----------
you know and I would like fall asleep at


---------05:27----------
work and then I'd fall asleep in the car


---------05:28----------
on the way to rescue work and I would


---------05:30----------
just never stop and when I started doing


---------05:32----------
what's that I thought that is I don't


---------05:38----------
know I mean I definitely have an


---------05:41----------
aversion to sing still I definitely have


---------05:43----------
an aversion to to stopping for anything


---------05:49----------
and I'm not very good at its handing to


---------05:51----------
my needs so I quite often forget to make


---------05:54----------
myself food or get to sleep or take time


---------05:56----------
for me I feel guilty when I do those


---------05:59----------
things so I feel much better when I'm


---------06:01----------
getting on with stuff actually doing


---------06:03----------
something productive and worthwhile hmm


---------06:06----------
you feel guilty for attending to your


---------06:08----------
needs


---------06:10----------
yeah definitely like playing games or


---------06:13----------
just you know just taking a minute to


---------06:15----------
just sit in the garden whatever I feel


---------06:17----------
this like encroaching sense of dick


---------06:20----------
Christ encroaching sense of um like I'm


---------06:25----------
wasting my time there's things that need


---------06:28----------
to be done I'm letting everything slip


---------06:30----------
out of my hands and I've got to get back


---------06:31----------
to it now sort of thing how long have


---------06:34----------
you been feeling that way


---------06:36----------
I don't know I think he I think it


---------06:47----------
probably started when I stopped being


---------06:49----------
able to go outside back when I got too


---------06:51----------
scared to go outside and I was fully


---------06:53----------
agoraphobic I stayed away from everyone


---------06:55----------
didn't really speak to anyone for years


---------06:57----------
and during that time Easter look out the


---------06:59----------
window and see the Sun was rolling by


---------07:00----------
and know that this was a summers night


---------07:03----------
summer is yeah Saint years yes Wow Angie


---------07:08----------
I used to I used to feel terrible like I


---------07:11----------
was wasting the best time of my life and


---------07:15----------
do you so can you tell us a little bit


---------07:19----------
about when you became as you put it


---------07:20----------
fully agoraphobic I I went I I tried I


---------07:29----------
was up I was really young pestering my


---------07:34----------
mom to go let me go back to school


---------07:35----------
because I starting to feel a bit lonely


---------07:36----------
and I wanted to reach out to other kids


---------07:38----------
why weren't you in school uh we moved


---------07:43----------
around a lot and even when we were still


---------07:46----------
I wasn't I we all went we didn't always


---------07:49----------
have a home sometimes we were homeless


---------07:51----------
and things were just challenging my mom


---------07:54----------
needed looking after and so did our


---------07:57----------
rescue animals and so there wasn't


---------07:58----------
really much space for me to get a formal


---------08:00----------
a formal education but so I started to


---------08:04----------
get a bit lonely and I started to want


---------08:06----------
to go to school but then I did go to


---------08:07----------
school and even though I was doing well


---------08:09----------
academically right off the bat I wasn't


---------08:11----------
doing so well trying to integrate I had


---------08:14----------
these symptoms but no explanation for


---------08:15----------
them so I was coming across as a bit


---------08:17----------
weird and it's not always easy to fit in


---------08:19----------
when you're a bit weird and yeah some


---------08:22----------
some pretty some pretty bad stuff


---------08:24----------
happened so I kind of put you again


---------08:27----------
but the aggression didn't stop and you


---------08:30----------
know what do you mean the aggression so


---------08:34----------
my uh my my last day of school I was 13


---------08:41----------
and my 4 I think it was for six formers


---------08:49----------
I don't know how old they


---------08:50----------
the oldest kids our school basically


---------08:53----------
beat me until I was unconscious


---------08:56----------
oh [ __ ] wasn't much I could do about it


---------08:59----------
so I woke up in the in the in there I


---------09:02----------
woke up in the in the in the in the


---------09:11----------
health bit I forgot the name for it the


---------09:12----------
met first aid there we go first aid


---------09:15----------
place with their like on-site doctor


---------09:17----------
person and that's my last day I was like


---------09:19----------
I can't do this anymore I mean it's not


---------09:21----------
safe for me to learn here it's not gonna


---------09:23----------
stop so I left but I had a paper route


---------09:26----------
and the kids from that same school would


---------09:29----------
continue to ask me throw stones at me


---------09:30----------
had come home bleeding and they died my


---------09:33----------
house and that constantly ridiculed me


---------09:35----------
so there wasn't really anything I could


---------09:38----------
do to escape it it just followed me


---------09:39----------
everywhere and my world just shrank and


---------09:41----------
shrank I gave up my background I gave up


---------09:44----------
going outside and just even opening the


---------09:46----------
front door started to give me a bit of a


---------09:48----------
heart attack


---------09:48----------
so people didn't take my tics well


---------09:51----------
people didn't you know there was there


---------09:54----------
was a lot of stuff going on that just I


---------09:55----------
couldn't really change or contend with


---------09:57----------
right so but so I just withdrew wow that


---------10:04----------
sounds awful those just sounds honest it


---------10:08----------
kind of insane like I've never heard of


---------10:10----------
a 13 year old being beaten into


---------10:13----------
unconsciousness nor have I heard of


---------10:15----------
someone who like has a paper route who


---------10:17----------
gets like throw stones thrown at them I


---------10:20----------
mean it sounds like you were hunted yeah


---------10:25----------
well it's not always easy to explain


---------10:29----------
yourself if you don't have a diagnosis


---------10:32----------
I used to wonder myself I'd do all these


---------10:34----------
inappropriate things and then go why am


---------10:36----------
I such a terrible person


---------10:37----------
because I didn't have I would pinch


---------10:39----------
people on the back of the arm or punch


---------10:40----------
them on the arm and not want to and not


---------10:42----------
understand why and they might get kicked


---------10:44----------
off buses and things like that and it


---------10:46----------
just became very difficult to get out


---------10:48----------
and you might would do anything because


---------10:49----------
when people asked wiles I don't know I


---------10:52----------
don't know so yeah my world shrank and I


---------10:57----------
stayed in all day and the nights and


---------10:59----------
days bled into one ah I didn't uh I


---------11:02----------
didn't go outside I think


---------11:03----------
have anything news so I was playing the


---------11:05----------
same games over and over again and my


---------11:08----------
yeah I didn't really speak to my mom a


---------11:11----------
lot she was very very ill she spend most


---------11:12----------
of her time in bed the house was always


---------11:14----------
quiet so there wasn't really mm much


---------11:18----------
going on I need I'm gonna say something


---------11:20----------
that may be a little bit inflammatory


---------11:21----------
but like it's honestly the the thought


---------11:23----------
that pops into my head now on earth are


---------11:26----------
you not way more [ __ ] up uh you know


---------11:30----------
the first therapist to ask me that


---------11:31----------
actually but just um I've had four in my


---------11:33----------
life and yeah all of them have asked me


---------11:36----------
that I mean serious I'm not like I mean


---------11:40----------
you you come across as is you know


---------11:43----------
introspective patient intelligent I mean


---------11:46----------
these are all the things that I'm


---------11:48----------
feeling from you compassionate you know


---------11:52----------
aware of your internal state to a


---------11:55----------
certain degree acceptance which is a lot


---------11:57----------
of what we talked about today and and


---------11:58----------
like I'm telling you I've seen people


---------12:00----------
who are way more [ __ ] up than you who


---------12:03----------
have had way easier lives and like


---------12:06----------
consistently right I mean usually it


---------12:08----------
doesn't it doesn't take a whole lot to


---------12:10----------
[ __ ] up patrasche and that's really sad


---------12:12----------
like it doesn't take a whole lot to


---------12:14----------
really mess up a kid and and what I'm


---------12:17----------
hearing from you like I'm just really


---------12:19----------
really stunned to be honest like so you


---------12:22----------
know there's one part of it is like you


---------12:24----------
know all the frankly abuse that you went


---------12:26----------
to but then you're also talking about a


---------12:27----------
mom who's kind of disabled from a young


---------12:32----------
age and and kind of doing left to your


---------12:34----------
own devices mm-hmm and so I yeah yeah


---------12:39----------
how are you how are you capable of just


---------12:42----------
functioning at all at this point well I


---------12:45----------
think one of the big things and this is


---------12:48----------
why I'll always recommend it to parents


---------12:49----------
is I was surrounded by animals and that


---------12:52----------
was partly my own doing if I'm honest so


---------12:56----------
uh when I was really little uh uh the


---------13:00----------
front kind of started with rabbits we


---------13:04----------
lived near a castle market there were


---------13:07----------
rabbits they were being a headed skinned


---------13:10----------
cleaned hung up by this by this giant


---------13:14----------
lady with a meat cleaver there were


---------13:15----------
these fluffy little things in cage


---------13:17----------
right next to the store where it


---------13:18----------
happened and I was just like what and I


---------13:23----------
was like really really young like a


---------13:24----------
toddler's age you know less than four at


---------13:26----------
some point and I love dies with this


---------13:29----------
little white one I was at the st.


---------13:30----------
happening to you and we got out into the


---------13:32----------
car park and my mom was like why is your


---------13:36----------
coat wiggling we ended up with minty and


---------13:40----------
eventually licorice and dandelion and


---------13:43----------
honey and you know they were the


---------13:48----------
foundations for me empathy my patience


---------13:51----------
and my introspect I definitely think


---------13:54----------
that animals were the root of that


---------13:55----------
because you learned to care for somebody


---------13:57----------
else's needs with no expectations of


---------13:59----------
your own they can't give you anything


---------14:00----------
except attention and they can they just


---------14:05----------
think about know jump in for a second so


---------14:07----------
you say you learned to care for someone


---------14:08----------
else without any expectation of your own


---------14:12----------
needs sorry that you learn to care for


---------14:16----------
someone else without any expectation and


---------14:19----------
kind of putting their needs above your


---------14:21----------
own I don't think you need to put a


---------14:24----------
rabbit's needs above your own in order


---------14:26----------
to care for them but sure definitely I


---------14:29----------
cared about them before I learned to


---------14:31----------
care about myself but the the thing was


---------14:35----------
you know I was a toddler you don't


---------14:37----------
really learn a lot about self-care when


---------14:38----------
you're little yeah I knew it immediately


---------14:40----------
I cuz II already I've been through some


---------14:43----------
stuff at that age I was like I already


---------14:45----------
knew what it was to be vulnerable and at


---------14:46----------
the big peoples mercy and I just saw all


---------14:49----------
of these little things that the big


---------14:50----------
people's mercy and I related to that I


---------14:52----------
connected to that in an instant I was


---------14:54----------
like but what I really go ahead say hmm


---------14:59----------
I really just wanted them to be safe


---------15:01----------
that was the first thing I ever felt


---------15:03----------
about any animal was I just I wanted to


---------15:06----------
be one of the big people that was a good


---------15:08----------
thing and you know a good a good


---------15:10----------
presence in their life I wanted to have


---------15:12----------
the power to make things better for them


---------15:15----------
do you mind if I ask what what happened


---------15:17----------
to you at a young age where you had come


---------15:19----------
to fear the big people so much so so


---------15:24----------
much I had a violent relative relative I


---------15:29----------
had relatives


---------15:31----------
word punish me for my tics and which


---------15:33----------
would make them worse what do you mean


---------15:34----------
that I was quite often ostracized from


---------15:37----------
my family and a point of shame I my fat


---------15:40----------
my family broke apart quite early but


---------15:43----------
whenever I would go and be with them


---------15:45----------
they didn't understand me and they would


---------15:47----------
feel embarrassed when I was at the


---------15:48----------
dinner table that constantly apologizing


---------15:50----------
for my behavior they're constantly


---------15:51----------
making me stay at home alone what they


---------15:54----------
went and did activities as a family


---------15:56----------
because they didn't want to have to deal


---------15:57----------
with the trouble I bring and I was left


---------16:00----------
to not I wasn't allowed to eat with


---------16:03----------
everyone like they punished me thinking


---------16:05----------
he would correct my behavior and it


---------16:06----------
wouldn't it would just make it worse


---------16:08----------
because the emotional side of things


---------16:10----------
would make the tics worse and so like


---------16:12----------
whilst I was well behaved I'd have these


---------16:15----------
stats of seemingly just out of nowhere


---------16:16----------
being terrible pushing things over or


---------16:18----------
making loud noises or swearing and they


---------16:22----------
just didn't understand it and thought


---------16:23----------
but I would just act out out of nowhere


---------16:25----------
so yeah I I just had I didn't have much


---------16:29----------
that was fun


---------16:30----------
most the time I was just scared of what


---------16:32----------
they do next because I didn't predict


---------16:34----------
when I'd upset them hmm


---------16:36----------
you actually kind of answered I was


---------16:38----------
about to ask like you know you're


---------16:40----------
talking a lot about other people's


---------16:41----------
feelings and and how they reacted I was


---------16:43----------
really curious about how you felt in


---------16:45----------
those situations like what did you


---------16:47----------
understand about why you did these


---------16:49----------
things I understand any of it I just I


---------16:54----------
knew that I wanted to get on with


---------16:56----------
everyone I knew that I wanted to engage


---------16:58----------
and have fun I knew that I wanted to be


---------17:01----------
accepted I just didn't know how because


---------17:04----------
I couldn't stop the thing that they were


---------17:06----------
asking me to stop and I didn't know why


---------17:08----------
I couldn't stop it was it felt like it


---------17:10----------
would happen and then I'd realised after


---------17:12----------
what Helena nothing my heart would sink


---------17:15----------
how would you feel about yourself


---------17:24----------
place and always having to excuse or


---------17:29----------
apologize for my presence there like


---------17:31----------
everyone else was getting on with things


---------17:32----------
but not me I was trying to be a part of


---------17:36----------
it but always having to excuse my


---------17:38----------
presence and always an inconvenience


---------17:40----------
just felt like I was constantly having


---------17:41----------
to apologize for existing I mean it's


---------17:53----------
interesting because I even wonder about


---------17:54----------
some of the things that you said earlier


---------17:56----------
about burnout and sort of how you tend


---------17:58----------
to ignore your needs and and it's I'm


---------18:01----------
almost wondering if you know when you


---------18:03----------
feel a hunger thirst whether there's


---------18:05----------
some part of your mind that sort of use


---------18:07----------
that as an inconvenience and and kind of


---------18:11----------
views yourself as sort of an


---------18:13----------
inconvenience that needs to be attended


---------18:15----------
to I never thought about it right


---------18:22----------
because like here's here's what I hear


---------18:24----------
Anita I hear someone who's very caring


---------18:27----------
but caring to the point of neglecting


---------18:29----------
themselves right


---------18:32----------
I think that's common among people who


---------18:34----------
are care as though if the first level of


---------18:36----------
engagement you ever know is a one-sided


---------18:38----------
relationship you end up in emulating


---------18:41----------
that later in life often our parents are


---------18:43----------
the templates we use to engage with


---------18:46----------
others and my relationship with one of


---------18:48----------
mine was definitely all giving and


---------18:51----------
without any kind of reciprocating for


---------18:56----------
long periods of time yeah so that's


---------19:00----------
interesting so first of all really viola


---------19:03----------
this is awesome I don't know if you're


---------19:05----------
just brilliant or you've been through a


---------19:06----------
bunch of therapy or you're well-read or


---------19:08----------
whatever but it's it's really fantastic


---------19:10----------
to talk to someone who is so


---------19:13----------
introspective and and able to really


---------19:16----------
look at themselves so let's let's let's


---------19:18----------
think about that for a second right so


---------19:20----------
you're saying that our parents are a


---------19:21----------
template the template that we follow but


---------19:24----------
what what did your parents model for you


---------19:31----------
mmm well my mom was sick so I I learned


---------19:37----------
a lot just because I had to learn how to


---------19:41----------
cook when I was really really young like


---------19:43----------
under the age of ten sure I had to learn


---------19:46----------
to deal with bailiffs and landlords and


---------19:48----------
bills and I had to deal with calling in


---------19:52----------
about repairs and you know my safety as


---------19:55----------
well I had to I was very cognizant with


---------19:58----------
my safety because no one was gonna keep


---------20:01----------
me safe except me so I learnt to be very


---------20:04----------
responsible very young and I'm angry and


---------20:07----------
when my mom was well she was a really


---------20:10----------
great example she the scientist she was


---------20:13----------
really great at dancing she was an


---------20:15----------
accomplished artist um she was a


---------20:17----------
photographer she you know she got silly


---------20:19----------
qualifications and she was just


---------20:21----------
brilliant in many ways and that was very


---------20:23----------
inspiring so she wasn't all bad but I


---------20:27----------
think I definitely learned to be most


---------20:29----------
comfortable when I'm giving but not very


---------20:31----------
very very comfortable or secure when I'm


---------20:33----------
receiving anything well yeah I mean so


---------20:36----------
you say that and and that makes that we


---------20:38----------
can clearly see the thing that I'm kind


---------20:40----------
of confused about is that doesn't seem


---------20:42----------
like the template that your mom gave you


---------20:44----------
right the template that your mom gave


---------20:46----------
you was to be the receiver of care not


---------20:48----------
the giver of care you actually became


---------20:53----------
the opposite of your true


---------20:58----------
yeah I can see that right so that's


---------21:01----------
weird like because I agree with you


---------21:03----------
generally speaking children become some


---------21:07----------
version of their parents because that's


---------21:08----------
what's modeled to us so we just you know


---------21:10----------
we learned through observation


---------21:12----------
monkey-see monkey-do and that's not what


---------21:15----------
I meant


---------21:16----------
as in like quite often I feel that we


---------21:20----------
our parents give us the template with


---------21:22----------
our engagement so if you have a parent


---------21:25----------
who is quite aggressive towards you then


---------21:28----------
your your template is when you grow up


---------21:31----------
is that you conflate love with


---------21:34----------
aggression and you allow people to be


---------21:36----------
aggressive towards you because your


---------21:38----------
parents always told you I love you yet


---------21:40----------
hit you and so you can accept that kind


---------21:42----------
of dye cotton dichotomy I don't know


---------21:45----------
what the right word is when you're older


---------21:48----------
because it's very familiar I don't know


---------21:50----------
that I copy my parents but I certainly


---------21:52----------
copy or relive some of the ways that I


---------21:56----------
engage with them with other people and I


---------21:58----------
think that's what I mean by that


---------21:59----------
template yeah so beautifully put right


---------22:02----------
so that's actually exactly what we see


---------22:04----------
we don't see you copying your parents


---------22:06----------
behavior we see you your behaviors as


---------22:09----------
responses the way that you learn to


---------22:11----------
relate to other people is based on the


---------22:14----------
model of the way that you related to


---------22:16----------
your mom which is one side and caring


---------22:19----------
yeah what do you think about that it's


---------22:25----------
hard to break out of because it's a very


---------22:28----------
expected role of women so like people


---------22:31----------
other people are very comfortable


---------22:32----------
receiving from me other people are very


---------22:35----------
comfortable with me making food for them


---------22:38----------
or giving them see or bringing them


---------22:39----------
gifts or tending to their needs or


---------22:41----------
listening to their feelings um I think


---------22:43----------
that it's very very difficult to step


---------22:45----------
out of that role when people are very


---------22:47----------
comfortable with you being that and


---------22:49----------
things like having good self-esteem and


---------22:51----------
being proud of yourself or being open


---------22:54----------
about your sexuality in things that


---------22:55----------
there are quite often frowned upon


---------22:57----------
and you know given women who do that are


---------23:00----------
giving pretty nasty labels quite often


---------23:02----------
so I think growing up people very much


---------23:04----------
accepted the way that I've been shape


---------23:05----------
and I was never really incentivized to


---------23:08----------
change it


---------23:11----------
I think for a second so let's take your


---------23:22----------
so beautiful example earlier by the way


---------23:24----------
about sort of people who grow up with


---------23:27----------
let's say aggressive or angry parents


---------23:30----------
and who conflate love and anger because


---------23:34----------
it feels normal to them and then


---------23:35----------
oftentimes children who are abused will


---------23:37----------
wind up in relationships as adults with


---------23:39----------
people who are abusive and I think I


---------23:41----------
think you you offered a wonderful and


---------23:43----------
insightful explanation of how you know


---------23:47----------
it feels normal to them that like you


---------23:49----------
can you can be the victim of aggression


---------23:52----------
and also the recipient of love from the


---------23:55----------
same person it fits and then this person


---------23:59----------
ends up in an abusive relationship after


---------24:01----------
abusive relationship after abusive


---------24:03----------
relationship and then one day they come


---------24:05----------
and they say exactly what you just said


---------24:07----------
people are comfortable with receiving


---------24:09----------
what I have to give they're comfortable


---------24:12----------
with me making them soup and and


---------24:13----------
listening to their feelings and I could


---------24:16----------
imagine the same person or not like the


---------24:18----------
person in our hypothetical sentence


---------24:20----------
inators saying yeah I'm a tab uncha


---------24:22----------
dudes or women who are very comfortable


---------24:26----------
beating the [ __ ] out of me and then


---------24:27----------
telling me that they love me the next


---------24:28----------
day people are just like that what would


---------24:32----------
you say to them I think it's very easy


---------24:37----------
to I think it's very easy for violence


---------24:42----------
to become invisible if it's all you've


---------24:43----------
ever known in the same way that if you


---------24:45----------
have a teapot in the room and it might


---------24:48----------
be the most ugly teapot in the world and


---------24:50----------
everyone who comes in might see it it


---------24:51----------
might be the first thing they notice in


---------24:53----------
the house because they're not used to


---------24:54----------
the teapot but if you grew up with that


---------24:56----------
teapot in that room you might not even


---------24:58----------
see it anymore you might walk past it


---------25:00----------
every single day and it won't be there


---------25:02----------
to you sure unless the one cake calls


---------25:05----------
attention to it and so with violence it


---------25:07----------
might seem very garish the others like


---------25:10----------
very garish the obvious from the outside


---------25:14----------
that an abusive relationship is what it


---------25:16----------
is but from the inside if it's all


---------25:19----------
you've ever known since childhood that


---------25:20----------
part becomes invisible especially if


---------25:22----------
you're very desperate for love and


---------25:24----------
attention


---------25:24----------
and that was also something you didn't


---------25:26----------
get very much of as a child enough


---------25:28----------
different for 11 attention I don't know


---------25:31----------
I feel uncomfortable with love and


---------25:34----------
attention


---------25:34----------
so definitely twitch was an adjustment


---------25:36----------
in that respect I feel worried when that


---------25:39----------
happens more than anything yeah so Anita


---------25:42----------
let me ask you a question why does the I


---------25:44----------
agree with you that everything about you


---------25:46----------
said about the teapot is is once again


---------25:48----------
very eloquently put but let me ask you


---------25:52----------
like when that person says yeah I end up


---------25:54----------
dating abusive person after abusive


---------25:56----------
person after abusive person that's just


---------25:58----------
the way let's say men are or women are


---------26:01----------
because men get abused too how would you


---------26:05----------
respond to that person like sure you're


---------26:07----------
saying that it feels normal to you but


---------26:10----------
like why do you think they keep on


---------26:11----------
winding up in abusive relationships is


---------26:13----------
it because everyone is fundamentally


---------26:15----------
abusive I think that people who tend to


---------26:19----------
I wouldn't know how to put this to


---------26:21----------
someone in that situation because I


---------26:23----------
think hearing it in and of itself


---------26:24----------
doesn't destroy that worldview but I


---------26:26----------
think that people who are passive in the


---------26:31----------
face of violence attract violent people


---------26:33----------
because violent people don't hang around


---------26:36----------
people who won't put up with their [ __ ]


---------26:37----------
so the only people they're going to


---------26:39----------
connect with our people Q are passive


---------26:41----------
and will continue to engage with them


---------26:43----------
even when their boundaries is not


---------26:45----------
respected and those people are harder to


---------26:48----------
find but they will always find the


---------26:50----------
people who will allow them to do it so


---------26:52----------
in in a certain way these people who are


---------26:56----------
subject to abuse and people who are


---------26:58----------
abusers tend to attract each other but


---------27:00----------
they're kind of separate from the rest


---------27:01----------
of the world in that a lot of other


---------27:02----------
people can engage with each other


---------27:03----------
without hurting each other or being


---------27:05----------
harmed it's just that this particular


---------27:07----------
life trap tends to magnetize towards the


---------27:11----------
opposite and that can definitely lead to


---------27:13----------
a cycle so Anita who are you magnetized


---------27:15----------
towards and who is magnetized towards


---------27:18----------
you I don't know when I before I started


---------27:22----------
streaming there were a lot of dark


---------27:25----------
people in my life because even now my


---------27:27----------
friends will say it I'm very patient my


---------27:30----------
first reaction when someone messes up


---------27:32----------
the first time is we all make mistakes


---------27:34----------
or mix mal make mistakes someday and I


---------27:36----------
hope I'm forgiven for it


---------27:38----------
we're all human and I try to like help


---------27:40----------
them through it and go here's how we


---------27:42----------
don't do this next time don't worry


---------27:43----------
buddy and I try to maintain the


---------27:46----------
connection I repair it even if I'm not


---------27:49----------
the person who's broken it so my friends


---------27:51----------
will probably tell you that I put up


---------27:53----------
with a lot more than I should and that I


---------27:57----------
probably do attract quite a lot of dark


---------27:58----------
people but since I started streaming


---------28:01----------
twitch is full of givers people who want


---------28:04----------
to give you their time and attention


---------28:04----------
with no expectation and I'm not used to


---------28:07----------
that and that was scary when I first


---------28:08----------
heard right um and now I'm surrounded by


---------28:11----------
people who are definitely very much the


---------28:13----------
opposite that are very lucky to the


---------28:15----------
phone into place because it's giving me


---------28:17----------
a whole new scope of life and friends


---------28:19----------
that are really amazing and safe sounds


---------28:22----------
wonderful and it sounds like it was


---------28:24----------
really a growth a point of growth for


---------28:26----------
you to kind of essentially feel very


---------28:31----------
uncomfortable with other people's giving


---------28:34----------
because that didn't feel right to you


---------28:38----------
yeah I found a way to overcome that


---------28:40----------
though how'd you do that


---------28:43----------
well I thought about the it was actually


---------28:46----------
something a therapist said ages ago she


---------28:48----------
was like but it didn't really click


---------28:49----------
until I fell here and it was how do you


---------28:53----------
feel when you're giving and I went good


---------28:54----------
it's a way to connect with people it's a


---------28:56----------
way to indulge the best part of myself I


---------28:58----------
feel good about these interaction I feel


---------29:00----------
good when I see people happy and she was


---------29:02----------
like well why what do you think other


---------29:04----------
people are feeling when they're giving


---------29:05----------
to you I was like yes exactly that so


---------29:08----------
how do you think they feel if you refuse


---------29:10----------
and you pull away was it okay no I get


---------29:13----------
it


---------29:13----------
yeah yeah can I share a story that


---------29:19----------
reminded me of something from my old


---------29:21----------
life that I kind of learned that my wife


---------29:23----------
taught me can I share that yes so so my


---------29:27----------
mom and grandmother so I'm I might I


---------29:30----------
have one brother so growing up and


---------29:33----------
coming from an Indian culture like


---------29:35----------
gender norms are very regimented so like


---------29:38----------
men do certain things and don't do other


---------29:41----------
things and growing up you know my


---------29:45----------
brother and I were actually pretty chill


---------29:47----------
and so you know my mom and grandmother


---------29:50----------
would sometimes come this


---------29:51----------
and then they'd ask us like what do we


---------29:53----------
want to eat for dinner and we viewing


---------29:55----------
ourselves as chill we would kind of or


---------29:57----------
you know actually being chilled


---------29:59----------
depending on it we'd say like you know


---------30:00----------
you can make whatever you want to or


---------30:02----------
like we can eat whatever you want like I


---------30:03----------
don't really care like whatever you want


---------30:04----------
to do is fine and then what do you think


---------30:07----------
that did to them when we would say


---------30:09----------
whatever any idea I have no idea what


---------30:16----------
I'm surprised were they uncomfortable


---------30:18----------
with that yeah sort of so like like then


---------30:20----------
would have would they would ask us like


---------30:22----------
do you want to eat this or do you wanna


---------30:23----------
eat this because my mom and grandmother


---------30:24----------
would really derive especially my


---------30:25----------
grandmother because she basically I mean


---------30:27----------
she spent a lot of her life in in the


---------30:29----------
kitchen and so she derived a lot of


---------30:31----------
enjoyment and pleasure out of like


---------30:33----------
demonstrating her love through food and


---------30:37----------
that was kind of what she did and and so


---------30:39----------
we would say whatever and then she would


---------30:41----------
ask us like okay do you want to eat this


---------30:42----------
and we'd be like yeah that's fine and


---------30:43----------
then she's like do you want to eat this


---------30:44----------
and we'd be like yeah that's fine too


---------30:46----------
do you eat this and she would be like


---------30:47----------
yeah but that's fine and and then my


---------30:50----------
wife one day pointed out to me that


---------30:51----------
you're driving him absolutely [ __ ]


---------30:53----------
crazy like if you like what you should


---------30:54----------
do is just tell them you want to eat


---------30:56----------
something because they want they want


---------30:57----------
you to say something and then they want


---------31:00----------
to do eat feed you whatever you want to


---------31:03----------
eat and they want to watch you enjoy it


---------31:05----------
but unless you actually express a


---------31:06----------
preference you're actually doing them a


---------31:08----------
disservice because they're here to care


---------31:10----------
for you so like let them care for you


---------31:11----------
and just tell them what you want to eat


---------31:12----------
or just pick something you don't


---------31:14----------
actually care just pick any anything and


---------31:15----------
then pretend you really want to eat it


---------31:17----------
and then let them make it and whether


---------31:19----------
you like it or don't like it just say


---------31:20----------
it's awesome and express your gratitude


---------31:22----------
and eat and stuff yourself and it kind


---------31:25----------
of made me realize that like sometimes


---------31:26----------
the best thing that we can do for people


---------31:28----------
is for us to like if for us to help them


---------31:32----------
is not to actually be neutral towards


---------31:35----------
them but for us to actually be helped by


---------31:37----------
them right is for us to actually like


---------31:40----------
let them yeah sorry


---------31:46----------
that wasn't what I meant but yeah


---------31:51----------
breakfast I I can agree that you know


---------31:54----------
being able to state your needs is an


---------31:56----------
opportunity for others indulge the best


---------31:58----------
in themselves and to rise up Tia and


---------32:00----------
sometimes it can feel awkward and


---------32:02----------
uncomfortable for many reasons some


---------32:04----------
people have low self


---------32:05----------
and feel like others don't like


---------32:07----------
attention and feel uncomfortable


---------32:08----------
some people feel demanding and feel like


---------32:11----------
it's too much to ask there are so many


---------32:13----------
reasons why many people I bet in chat


---------32:15----------
feel a bit weird asking for anything and


---------32:18----------
I'm not the only person and I still have


---------32:21----------
to fight on an emotional level even


---------32:22----------
though I feel like I've I understand it


---------32:24----------
on her what is the emotional level what


---------32:27----------
do you mean by that


---------32:28----------
well I think sometimes instinctively the


---------32:33----------
way that we've grown the way that we


---------32:36----------
felt for most of our lives lingers even


---------32:38----------
if we reason our way out of it we still


---------32:41----------
have to contend with the emotional side


---------32:42----------
of things even if we understand how the


---------32:45----------
trick is done the magic trick can still


---------32:46----------
affect you


---------32:48----------
that's a bad analogy because you yeah


---------32:50----------
what is the emotion what is the theme oh


---------32:53----------
what is the emotion that you're


---------32:54----------
contending with mmm I think it's a


---------33:01----------
mixture of fear and shame yeah


---------33:03----------
definitely


---------33:04----------
okay I definitely understand you Sara


---------33:07----------
that hmm what are you afraid of her what


---------33:11----------
are you ashamed


---------33:19----------
I don't know I guess another way to


---------33:27----------
explain it would be like what someone's


---------33:29----------
nice to me it's always felt like I've


---------33:31----------
taken out a loan of like two billion


---------33:33----------
pounds or something I'll never be able


---------33:35----------
to pay it back I'm not in a position


---------33:36----------
like because when I was younger if


---------33:38----------
people were nice to me like there's


---------33:39----------
nothing to do I can't make this good


---------33:42----------
I'm just taking and everyone around me


---------33:44----------
was always saying all you do is take


---------33:46----------
take take you you know you're you never


---------33:48----------
give back and it's like I don't know how


---------33:50----------
you haven't shown me how and I didn't I


---------33:54----------
didn't really know what to do about it


---------33:55----------
I just felt indebted and it and it felt


---------33:59----------
really concerning and worrying but also


---------34:01----------
people used to be nice to me in order to


---------34:04----------
you then later be cruel


---------34:06----------
it was manipulative there were adults


---------34:09----------
around me that weren't didn't have the


---------34:11----------
best intentions growing up and I didn't


---------34:13----------
have as much protection because my


---------34:15----------
parents weren't there so in that sense


---------34:18----------
it became intimidating it was almost a


---------34:21----------
threat to see things and I might be


---------34:23----------
blamed or people might get angry at me


---------34:26----------
later for having them so I guess I was


---------34:28----------
just concerned in general like that all


---------34:30----------
of that would just hit me in a wave and


---------34:32----------
sometimes it still doesn't have to catch


---------34:34----------
it and go nope everything's good now and


---------34:36----------
you know I can bake the neighbor a cake


---------34:37----------
next time you know and everything's okay


---------34:40----------
so it sounds like you were afraid of the


---------34:44----------
other shoe dropping that people were


---------34:47----------
nice to you and then there would be pain


---------34:49----------
afterward hmm yeah so that's fear what


---------34:54----------
is shame I heard a wonderful exploration


---------34:59----------
of fear but I didn't understand too much


---------35:01----------
about why you felt ashamed I don't know


---------35:05----------
I guess


---------35:16----------
I think it was instilled from a young


---------35:18----------
age that I wasn't supposed to take


---------35:19----------
anything once I asked for a chocolate


---------35:21----------
and one of my member of my family went


---------35:24----------
no you can't ask for things that's rude


---------35:26----------
and really really ashamed to be in front


---------35:28----------
of everyone like really loudly


---------35:29----------
everything went quiet and they kind of


---------35:31----------
exploded at me for asking if I could


---------35:33----------
have a job to you and there was a


---------35:35----------
situation where I went to a friend's


---------35:37----------
house and I made them toast they asked


---------35:39----------
me to go down and make the toast for


---------35:41----------
them and I went down I made toast and


---------35:42----------
their grandparents caught me I'm like


---------35:44----------
all you do is take take take like oh


---------35:46----------
that's all you ever do and I was like I


---------35:49----------
haven't taken anything from you this


---------35:51----------
isn't you it for me but like I


---------35:53----------
immediately feel ashamed because I feel


---------35:55----------
like if I receive anything it's I'm not


---------35:57----------
supposed to have that this isn't meant


---------35:58----------
for me like that there's this idea ever


---------36:00----------
since I was younger that I'm not


---------36:01----------
supposed to take it I'm not supposed to


---------36:03----------
have anything that yeah that it's I


---------36:05----------
don't even know how to explain it


---------36:07----------
but yeah so I feel guilty whenever I do


---------36:10----------
okay can I think for a second


---------36:37----------
he wants breakfast send it now press em


---------36:43----------
first I like that voice it sounds like


---------36:50----------
like it's like a serie or something it


---------36:53----------
sounds like a I don't know how to


---------36:56----------
describe it it sounds like a voice that


---------36:57----------
you hear on like a phone or yeah thank


---------37:03----------
you it's it's a voice I often have tics


---------37:06----------
and for some reason or another I my tics


---------37:09----------
take they have a totally different vocal


---------37:11----------
range than I do


---------37:12----------
generally for some reason some of them


---------37:14----------
are high-pitched some of them have a


---------37:15----------
list some of them sound like a sat-nav


---------37:17----------
you know yeah yes I know that's what it


---------37:19----------
is yeah yeah and it also I need it's


---------37:25----------
it's cool to talk to someone and you


---------37:27----------
sort of mentioned that sometimes


---------37:28----------
emotions make your tics more active and


---------37:32----------
it's been fun to watch and I hope this


---------37:35----------
doesn't come across as mean it's just I


---------37:37----------
find it very so a lot of times when I


---------37:39----------
talk to people I struggle to know what


---------37:42----------
they're feeling or how they could be


---------37:44----------
feeling and it's been neat to sort of


---------37:46----------
have a little bit of a barometer for


---------37:48----------
what you could be feeling based on how


---------37:50----------
active your tics are and that there are


---------37:52----------
certain times where you know it's clear


---------37:54----------
that you're focused and paying attention


---------37:56----------
and you're speaking and sharing and then


---------37:57----------
your tics kind of go down and if there's


---------37:59----------
a period of silence and then your mind


---------38:01----------
is left some energy but some leftover


---------38:04----------
energy it sort of manifests outward as


---------38:06----------
it is a tic and that's neat to kind of


---------38:09----------
think a little bit about I've never been


---------38:11----------
able to quite get a thermometer or


---------38:14----------
barometer of someone's like mental


---------38:16----------
energy emotion and focus in the way that


---------38:19----------
I have been talking with you so I'm


---------38:20----------
learning a lot it's actually kind of


---------38:21----------
cool that's cool yeah I get a lot of


---------38:24----------
abuse for it in chat because people go


---------38:27----------
ah she forgot to tick see I knew it was


---------38:29----------
fake every time she talks or focuses she


---------38:32----------
forgets she drops her acts and I'm just


---------38:34----------
like no that's not how it works please


---------38:36----------
don't pressure me like that no no it's


---------38:38----------
really not how it works I mean the way


---------38:40----------
that I would envision takes for you is


---------38:42----------
an excess of mental energy so if your


---------38:44----------
mental energy is spent


---------38:46----------
in a particular way and if we think


---------38:48----------
about what does emotion do to your mind


---------38:49----------
it creates energy in your mind right so


---------38:52----------
what emotion leads to increased activity


---------38:55----------
so the more increased activity that you


---------38:57----------
have that you cannot focus so if we


---------38:59----------
think about energy of the mind is having


---------39:03----------
inflows and outflows when it rises above


---------39:06----------
a certain level I think it take


---------39:07----------
manifests and so the more inflow you


---------39:10----------
have through emotion and stress the


---------39:11----------
greater your chances of tics are the


---------39:13----------
more outflow that you have through let's


---------39:15----------
say focus practice flow music engaged in


---------39:19----------
conversation that decreases the energy


---------39:21----------
and decreases the manifestation of tics


---------39:23----------
I think it's really just about energy in


---------39:24----------
the mind that's such a good way of


---------39:27----------
explaining it thank you


---------39:29----------
I might steal that next time someone


---------39:30----------
asks me on my street I steal away it's


---------39:34----------
been really fun to see because even when


---------39:35----------
I when I start talking more I think your


---------39:37----------
tics manifest more because it doesn't


---------39:40----------
require a little of your attention to


---------39:42----------
listen so I have a couple of questions


---------39:45----------
for you if that's okay yeah so the first


---------39:48----------
is and so let me actually start off by


---------39:52----------
saying this so you know it's clear to me


---------39:53----------
I think either you've done a lot of


---------39:55----------
really well probably both but you've


---------39:56----------
done a lot of wonderful introspective


---------39:58----------
work what are you really studying


---------39:59----------
yourself and figuring out how the [ __ ]


---------40:00----------
you work which is awesome and it sounds


---------40:03----------
to me like you've had a couple of really


---------40:05----------
good therapists I mean you said you had


---------40:07----------
four and I'd guess that at least a


---------40:09----------
couple of them were like really good and


---------40:10----------
helped you a lot what do you think I'd


---------40:13----------
say one was a life changer yeah the rest


---------40:15----------
were kind of met um but yeah since


---------40:19----------
meeting her she changed her life so I've


---------40:21----------
been raising funds and giving them to


---------40:22----------
her to pay for other people to see her


---------40:24----------
because I really believe in what she


---------40:25----------
does so this dream has helped me to you


---------40:27----------
get other people to get help through her


---------40:29----------
which it's been amazing


---------40:30----------
that's awesome wait now I also read but


---------40:33----------
I think the Agra phobia allowed me to


---------40:35----------
really stop and think and process Who I


---------40:37----------
am


---------40:37----------
what I want to be my ethics my


---------40:39----------
understanding of the world and not


---------40:41----------
fitting in allowed me to observe from an


---------40:44----------
outsider's role because I couldn't quite


---------40:45----------
click and so these things have kind of


---------40:48----------
come together as me I'm just trying to


---------40:50----------
make sense of the world as much as I


---------40:52----------
possibly can yeah that's awesome I'm and


---------40:55----------
I think you've really come a long way


---------40:56----------
which kind of makes I mean I view that I


---------40:59----------
have a


---------41:00----------
Judy to people who come on stream which


---------41:01----------
is to help them understand something or


---------41:03----------
grow in some way I feel like that's what


---------41:05----------
people come on here for not to say that


---------41:08----------
that's why you came on but that's what I


---------41:10----------
personally feel so I believe that it is


---------41:13----------
part of my karma my Karma that I've been


---------41:15----------
given certain advantages and unique


---------41:18----------
opportunities to learn and that it's


---------41:20----------
part of my job to pass those on to


---------41:23----------
people who may benefit from them and I


---------41:24----------
never know who that person is and so I'm


---------41:28----------
gonna ask you a couple of questions if


---------41:30----------
that's okay or a frame a couple of


---------41:32----------
things and then my hope is that you know


---------41:35----------
when we think about burnout that there's


---------41:37----------
still a some part of you that doesn't


---------41:39----------
let you take care of yourself in the way


---------41:41----------
that you deserve to be taken care of and


---------41:43----------
if we think about this like you know


---------41:46----------
there was a anita 1.0 which was sort of


---------41:51----------
like the caregiver and wouldn't receive


---------41:53----------
anything and then there was a Nita 2.0


---------41:55----------
which is able of giving and receiving


---------41:58----------
and then I'm kind of seeing I need a 3.0


---------42:01----------
who is someone who is is able to


---------42:05----------
actually give to herself right and and


---------42:09----------
so I think you can now receive from


---------42:11----------
other people but I don't know and I'm


---------42:13----------
sure you can to certainly receive from


---------42:14----------
yourself because I think I mean there's


---------42:16----------
no way that you can become the person


---------42:17----------
that you have without having compassion


---------42:20----------
towards yourself and at the same time I


---------42:22----------
see a little bit of a pattern left over


---------42:24----------
where you have difficulty like giving


---------42:27----------
yourself things from yourself what do


---------42:31----------
you think about that yeah I think if I


---------42:34----------
took you in a house tool you'd see that


---------42:36----------
a lot how do you mean what does a house


---------42:39----------
tour have to do with that I don't buy


---------42:41----------
things for myself I all of the people


---------42:45----------
that visited my house say my walls are


---------42:46----------
bare I have barely any furniture I have


---------42:48----------
very few things most of the things in my


---------42:50----------
house a rabbit related and for them or


---------42:53----------
you know it's like yeah there's not


---------42:55----------
really much that I do or invest time in


---------42:58----------
that's for me I don't know in this house


---------43:02----------
so so I mean in a broad sense and this


---------43:06----------
may be a little bit unfair but I just


---------43:08----------
don't know how else to describe it like


---------43:09----------
I'm trying to get a sense of why can't


---------43:11----------
you love yourself


---------43:13----------
hmm Anais is a good question so and I've


---------43:19----------
got a little bit of a hypothesis so what


---------43:21----------
do you think about your mom I think


---------43:24----------
she's amazing I think she's a very


---------43:26----------
strong person thank you um she she gets


---------43:29----------
very fixated on a task and she she's


---------43:32----------
changed laws and she's changed the world


---------43:34----------
in beautiful ways and you know I think


---------43:36----------
yeah I definitely see a lot of good in


---------43:39----------
her and I hope I can match up to it


---------43:41----------
someday yeah so I'm wondering that all


---------43:48----------
sounds really positive I'm wondering if


---------43:49----------
you have any negative feelings towards


---------43:51----------
your mom no I mean the rest of my family


---------43:57----------
has a lot of Chris's criticisms because


---------43:59----------
they think maybe she let me down but


---------44:02----------
from a first-person like from an in the


---------44:04----------
family perspective I'm not gonna hate on


---------44:07----------
her for being sick not so uh and I'm


---------44:11----------
really impressed with how much she did


---------44:13----------
manage during that time you know yeah


---------44:21----------
did she let you down no I think she


---------44:26----------
really tried and I think that's really


---------44:29----------
very very evident in that when she did


---------44:31----------
have periods where she had more energy


---------44:33----------
you know she would always you know go


---------44:35----------
and get treats for me and things like


---------44:36----------
that and you know she'd show her


---------44:38----------
affection in some ways no I've never


---------44:40----------
hugged my mum I've she doesn't show


---------44:43----------
affection in conventional ways so we


---------44:45----------
have a strange relationship but I


---------44:47----------
definitely do you appreciate the times


---------44:49----------
where you know she would she would do


---------44:51----------
the most she could with what you know


---------44:53----------
what little energy she had yeah so I


---------44:55----------
just think about that so Anita I'm gonna


---------44:57----------
challenge you a little bit there and I


---------44:59----------
know this is gonna sound I'm not trying


---------45:00----------
to it sounds like your mom really is a


---------45:02----------
wonderful person and that she really is


---------45:04----------
inspirational but I think that there's


---------45:06----------
something very very subtle because


---------45:08----------
you've come like 90% of the way and it's


---------45:10----------
clear to me like you've done immense


---------45:12----------
stuff and I think oftentimes that last


---------45:14----------
10% is very counterintuitive so let me


---------45:19----------
let me just toss out some of the


---------45:20----------
language that you're saying right so she


---------45:21----------
tried she did the best that she could


---------45:24----------
I'm not gonna


---------45:26----------
not gonna blame someone who's ill all


---------45:29----------
positive things right makes sense is


---------45:30----------
fair but let me ask you something


---------45:33----------
is there a difference between doing a


---------45:35----------
good job and doing the best that you can


---------45:39----------
yeah definitely so when we think about


---------45:43----------
your mom when you say she did the best


---------45:46----------
that he can the funny thing is that


---------45:48----------
that's she did the best that she could


---------45:50----------
the funny thing is that statement has an


---------45:54----------
underside to it which is sort of an


---------45:58----------
acknowledgment that she didn't do a


---------46:00----------
great job right it's not that you blame


---------46:03----------
her for not doing a great job there's a


---------46:06----------
difference between blaming someone for


---------46:07----------
not doing a great job and like admitting


---------46:10----------
that someone didn't do a great job hmm


---------46:13----------
what do you think about is that is that


---------46:16----------
fair I mean my mom had a disability I


---------46:20----------
wouldn't blame half being in bed a lot


---------46:24----------
in the same way that I wouldn't blame


---------46:25----------
someone in a wheelchair for not walking


---------46:27----------
like this this isn't a parental failing


---------46:31----------
this is illness you know yeah so this is


---------46:34----------
this is where things get really weird


---------46:36----------
Anita because when we look at your


---------46:38----------
upbringing so there's a difference


---------46:40----------
between blaming someone for something


---------46:42----------
and acknowledging that they actually


---------46:45----------
like that there were problems right


---------46:48----------
because if we look at if we look at it


---------46:50----------
from the outside and I know this it


---------46:51----------
sounds really weird I'm really not


---------46:52----------
trying to beat up on your mom it's just


---------46:54----------
I've worked with people who have been so


---------46:57----------
let me can I tell you a story so I was


---------47:01----------
working with a patient who you know came


---------47:05----------
in and and also had huge respect for his


---------47:07----------
dad and his when he was young his mom


---------47:11----------
when he was about nine his mom got no


---------47:14----------
when he was seven his mom got diagnosed


---------47:16----------
with cancer and then passed away when he


---------47:19----------
was nine and his it was hard on everyone


---------47:22----------
in the family it was hard on him it was


---------47:23----------
hard on his younger sister it was hard


---------47:25----------
on his dad and you know his dad was


---------47:28----------
really in grief and and what would


---------47:31----------
happen is he would finish working around


---------47:33----------
5:00 or 6:00 p.m. he would go to a bar


---------47:36----------
every day after work and then he'd have


---------47:38----------
a few beers and he'd come


---------47:39----------
around eight or nine and his his you


---------47:43----------
know ten-year-old son in his


---------47:45----------
seven-year-old daughter would be with a


---------47:47----------
babysitter


---------47:48----------
like they'd come home from school


---------47:49----------
babysitter would pick him up and the


---------47:51----------
babysitter would be them from like with


---------47:53----------
them from like three day okay so and he


---------47:57----------
recognizes so his dad worked really hard


---------47:58----------
tried to give him lots of opportunities


---------48:00----------
did a lot of good stuff like you know


---------48:02----------
tried to teach him things and and was a


---------48:04----------
good dad in a lot of ways and and then


---------48:07----------
when I kind of asked him I was like you


---------48:09----------
know how did you feel when when your dad


---------48:10----------
would like go drinking every day he was


---------48:12----------
like well my dad was like you know he'd


---------48:13----------
lost my mom too and he loved her a lot


---------48:15----------
and I don't blame him for going to the


---------48:16----------
bar because he was in a period of grief


---------48:19----------
and and then he kept on saying the same


---------48:21----------
thing which is like he did the best that


---------48:23----------
he could right like he doesn't blame him


---------48:26----------
for doing that thing but the weird thing


---------48:28----------
is if you really stop and think about it


---------48:29----------
just because his dad even if we accept


---------48:31----------
for a moment that his dad did the best


---------48:32----------
that he could it doesn't mean that he


---------48:35----------
did a great job right like it doesn't


---------48:38----------
mean that he didn't let his son down in


---------48:40----------
some ways we're not blaming him for


---------48:42----------
letting his son letting his son down


---------48:44----------
right we're saying that he's got a good


---------48:46----------
reason he's a human being he's hurt he


---------48:49----------
has grief and so we're not gonna blame


---------48:51----------
him for that but at the same time we


---------48:54----------
should be honest with the fact that like


---------48:55----------
his dad whether he has good reason or


---------48:58----------
bad reason wasn't able to provide for


---------49:01----------
his son what his son deserved does that


---------49:06----------
make sense yeah and so when I think


---------49:09----------
about your upbringing I think about an


---------49:12----------
upbringing that really was not good in a


---------49:15----------
lot of ways what do you think yeah I I


---------49:19----------
would say that there were definitely


---------49:20----------
times where I wasn't safe there were


---------49:22----------
things that happened to me there were


---------49:24----------
times where I needed to learn how to


---------49:26----------
process things and I never got any kind


---------49:30----------
of I don't know emotional toolset sure


---------49:35----------
you kind of handle the things around me


---------49:37----------
I was definitely feeling out the world


---------49:41----------
alone in many circumstances and I get


---------49:45----------
that and that's that's something that I


---------49:48----------
don't look at as something like it's


---------49:51----------
really hard to say that the sentence


---------49:53----------
I deserved anything I don't feel


---------49:54----------
deserving of anything I have no


---------49:57----------
expectations of life life is chaos you


---------50:01----------
you aren't defined by your challenges


---------50:03----------
your defined by how you handle them and


---------50:05----------
I my parents they were young my dad was


---------50:08----------
like young Indian teens I'm not sure


---------50:11----------
when and my my mom was in a young one in


---------50:14----------
her teens I'm not exactly sure how old


---------50:16----------
they were but they're in their teens


---------50:17----------
anyway and they they didn't really know


---------50:21----------
how to be parents when I was born so


---------50:25----------
they were thrown in at the deep end and


---------50:27----------
I didn't expect them I wouldn't expect


---------50:29----------
any teenager any kid is essentially to


---------50:32----------
know how to be a perfect parent so I


---------50:35----------
just feel lucky that I managed rather


---------50:38----------
than angry that I didn't get anything


---------50:40----------
I'm sure I don't really know how to see


---------50:42----------
it any other way


---------50:43----------
yeah and that's why I think you can't


---------50:45----------
love yourself so I know this is gonna


---------50:49----------
sound really bizarre but just run so


---------50:50----------
like first of all let's let's start by


---------50:52----------
there's a 90% chance I'm wrong and 10%


---------50:54----------
chance I'm right can we start with those


---------50:56----------
odds but I've got this really


---------50:58----------
bass-ackwards way of looking at this so


---------51:01----------
in a weird way I think that you grew up


---------51:04----------
with givers and takers right and your


---------51:06----------
mom was a taker and you were a giver


---------51:08----------
right and you decided then and there


---------51:12----------
that it was good to be a giver and bad


---------51:14----------
to be a taker


---------51:15----------
what do you think yeah I came pretty


---------51:19----------
much okay so if we stop and we think


---------51:21----------
about that if you say that being a giver


---------51:23----------
is good and being a taker is bad what


---------51:25----------
does that say about your mom yeah points


---------51:31----------
what does it say that logic would say


---------51:35----------
that she was bad right so and I think


---------51:37----------
this is the problem with givers is that


---------51:40----------
givers sometimes don't acknowledge that


---------51:43----------
like they shouldn't be giving that the


---------51:45----------
person who's taking from them is doing


---------51:48----------
like a bad thing right like that's like


---------51:50----------
when we think about the abusive


---------51:51----------
relationship and stuff like that because


---------51:53----------
you're comfortable in giving hmm and


---------51:56----------
there's some people who are comfortable


---------51:57----------
in taking but and it can be hard because


---------52:01----------
I'm not saying that you shouldn't love


---------52:02----------
and respect your mom and I'm not saying


---------52:03----------
that you should blame her


---------52:05----------
but at the same time I think you should


---------52:07----------
acknowledge that there is like a giver


---------52:09----------
and a taker in this relationship


---------52:10----------
and that I find it as much as that you


---------52:13----------
cover everything with like positivity


---------52:15----------
which i think is resilient and good I


---------52:17----------
think you have to acknowledge right I


---------52:19----------
think that the way to really love


---------52:21----------
yourself and I'll talk about how is to


---------52:24----------
first of all acknowledge that like your


---------52:26----------
mom could have done a better job right


---------52:27----------
so even if she was ill or whatever maybe


---------52:29----------
she couldn't have done a better job you


---------52:31----------
can forgive so here's the here's what it


---------52:33----------
is I don't know that you've forgiven


---------52:35----------
your mom for raising you the way that


---------52:37----------
she did because you don't blame her


---------52:40----------
right and so in a weird way like you


---------52:43----------
can't forgive someone for something that


---------52:45----------
you don't blame them for like if you


---------52:49----------
smack me across the face


---------52:51----------
and I think that oh that wasn't your


---------52:52----------
fault and there's like no forgiveness


---------52:54----------
from my end because it wasn't your fault


---------52:55----------
like what point is there and forgiving


---------52:57----------
something if the no one is at fault and


---------53:00----------
when I think about what what are you not


---------53:03----------
able to do for yourself what are you not


---------53:05----------
able to you're not able to love yourself


---------53:08----------
and I think part of that is like what we


---------53:10----------
mean by love is when you indulge you're


---------53:12----------
not able to cut yourself some slack


---------53:14----------
you're not able to forgive yourself for


---------53:16----------
buying a painting for your wall because


---------53:19----------
it feels indulgent for you because in


---------53:21----------
that moment you're a taker in your honor


---------53:22----------
given in that moment I think you become


---------53:25----------
a little bit more like your mom which is


---------53:27----------
not someone that you want to be yeah


---------53:42----------
you don't see that I don't know that's a


---------53:46----------
lot to process


---------53:47----------
and I do I do notice that sometimes when


---------53:51----------
I try to process things they're


---------53:52----------
uncomfortable my brain just bounces off


---------53:54----------
them yes so it's very it's a very it's a


---------53:57----------
very difficult thing to penetrate good I


---------54:00----------
mean I think it's very good that you're


---------54:03----------
noticing that I could be wrong but my


---------54:05----------
point here is that you know when you


---------54:07----------
were talking about dichotomies earlier


---------54:08----------
right that someone can be aggressive


---------54:10----------
towards you and love you I think that


---------54:12----------
there's a dichotomy here which is that


---------54:14----------
you can love and respect your mom and


---------54:17----------
not blame her for her disability which I


---------54:20----------
don't think you should do and you can


---------54:24----------
also acknowledge that just because it's


---------54:26----------
not her fault doesn't mean that you


---------54:28----------
didn't get a bad break mm-hmm right and


---------54:33----------
and I think that there's a part of you


---------54:35----------
that like because if we think about it


---------54:36----------
it's bizarre it's like like you don't


---------54:38----------
want to be a taker like that's the


---------54:40----------
problem is that you're not willing to be


---------54:41----------
a taker you want to be a giver and


---------54:43----------
you've learned through a lot of


---------54:46----------
introspection and growth and and frankly


---------54:49----------
discomfort how to take things from


---------54:51----------
people or receive things from people


---------54:53----------
gifts and support on Twitch but even


---------54:56----------
then like it's like you won't even


---------54:57----------
you'll take their risk they're their


---------54:59----------
gifts and you'll pass them on right like


---------55:02----------
you're like oh it's like hot potato like


---------55:03----------
they can give you positivity and you're


---------55:05----------
just gonna hot potato it right out to


---------55:07----------
your therapist so that she can help


---------55:08----------
other people like I haven't forbid that


---------55:11----------
I take anything but don't give anything


---------55:12----------
to me like let me just let me do let me


---------55:14----------
be a good person and go help other


---------55:16----------
people and that sounds wonderful but


---------55:18----------
there's actually something really [ __ ]


---------55:20----------
up there which is like why can't you


---------55:22----------
just accept people's gifts like why


---------55:24----------
can't the potato land with you why can't


---------55:27----------
people just do something for you and why


---------55:29----------
can't you take it why can't you be on


---------55:30----------
the receiving end of other people's like


---------55:32----------
care and affection and positivity like


---------55:36----------
what within you rebels so much against


---------55:38----------
that because that's why you're beat the


---------55:39----------
[ __ ] out like you might beat the [ __ ]


---------55:40----------
but like that's why you neglect yourself


---------55:42----------
so hard like why do you live in a room


---------55:44----------
I'm not I think it's fine to live in a


---------55:47----------
Spartan room like I lived in the Spartan


---------55:48----------
room for years of my life as well but


---------55:51----------
like I just literally didn't care and I


---------55:54----------
don't know if it's the


---------55:54----------
you don't care or that when the thought


---------55:58----------
of buying something for yourself is like


---------56:00----------
revolting to you yes the latter one so


---------56:05----------
that's [ __ ] up right and then the


---------56:08----------
question is like why is it revolting to


---------56:10----------
you and I think it's because it's


---------56:12----------
because Nick sorry


---------56:14----------
I think it's that's okay I'm confused


---------56:17----------
about when you're doing that should I


---------56:18----------
stop talking and let you get it out or


---------56:20----------
should I keep going do have you


---------56:22----------
comfortable with I don't mind


---------56:23----------
you I'm just wondering whatever


---------56:24----------
facilitates a discussion I'm comfortable


---------56:27----------
either way but I think it kind of comes


---------56:29----------
back to the central idea of that like I


---------56:31----------
think that you actually have some amount


---------56:33----------
of resentment towards your mom and I


---------56:36----------
think that that resentment is valid it


---------56:38----------
doesn't make her a bad person it doesn't


---------56:39----------
make you a bad person and I think what


---------56:41----------
you need to do is like learn how to


---------56:43----------
forgive because you don't forgive you


---------56:44----------
make excuses for people you're


---------56:46----------
understanding right so like actually


---------56:49----------
like it through all of your positivity


---------56:52----------
like this is the really really subtle


---------56:53----------
thing is you've come across as and you


---------56:54----------
are we're really like caring and loving


---------56:57----------
and forgiving person but you don't


---------56:59----------
really forgive what you do is you allow


---------57:03----------
people to behave badly and you're so


---------57:06----------
understanding that you let them get away


---------57:08----------
with it just like just like you said


---------57:11----------
when someone when you said that friends


---------57:13----------
notice that like you cut people slack


---------57:15----------
like we think about that as a positive


---------57:17----------
thing and I think this is a prime


---------57:18----------
example of it absolutely is a positive


---------57:20----------
thing and 90% of the way it's positive


---------57:22----------
but that last 10% is when it starts to


---------57:25----------
become a little bit toxic that last 10%


---------57:28----------
is when you should blame people for


---------57:30----------
being mean to you you can forgive them


---------57:32----------
but you should absolutely blame them if


---------57:35----------
they're letting you down yeah and so I


---------57:39----------
think this issue of blame and


---------57:40----------
forgiveness is what you need to learn


---------57:42----------
which is like actually holding people


---------57:44----------
accountable if they let you down and


---------57:46----------
there's this weird kind of like I mean


---------57:49----------
sure your mom was sick and I don't know


---------57:50----------
what kind of illness she has and it's


---------57:51----------
not my place to be judgmental but I'm


---------57:53----------
gonna go ahead and do it anyway like I


---------57:55----------
mean just just the raw amount of Lourdes


---------58:01----------
if you read the Lord of the Freid


---------58:02----------
flights note Lord of Liza's I haven't


---------58:05----------
read it yet I still need to so it's a


---------58:07----------
story about like a group


---------58:08----------
kids who wind up on an island and they


---------58:10----------
like sort of like become primitive and


---------58:12----------
brutal it's like when I hear about your


---------58:15----------
upbringing it sounds like Lord of the


---------58:17----------
[ __ ] flies to me it's like people are


---------58:19----------
attacking you like adults are yelling at


---------58:21----------
you people are doing nice things to you


---------58:23----------
and then being mean to you


---------58:24----------
people are being violent people are


---------58:26----------
hunting you down with rocks when you're


---------58:29----------
on a paper out like what the [ __ ]


---------58:31----------
and if you don't blame anyone for that


---------58:34----------
like that's not good I know it sounds


---------58:38----------
[ __ ] weird like I think instead of


---------58:41----------
giving people excuses what I would


---------58:43----------
really think encourage you to do is


---------58:45----------
think a little bit about blaming them if


---------58:47----------
you really do feel that way dig down and


---------58:49----------
see if you feel something like that and


---------58:51----------
then forgive them and then in learning


---------58:55----------
how to forgive if you can forgive your


---------58:57----------
mom I think you'll be able to love


---------58:58----------
yourself yeah that's what I got that's


---------59:09----------
something to work on that's some


---------59:10----------
homework yeah I mean if it doesn't sit


---------59:12----------
with you that's ok too i mean i'm


---------59:14----------
oftentimes wrong because i don't know


---------59:15----------
what [ __ ] i'm talking about so sounds


---------59:18----------
like you do to me yeah i might want to


---------59:21----------
ask some questions


---------59:22----------
absolutely uh what decided what made you


---------59:26----------
decide to move what you do want to


---------59:28----------
twitch just the realization that i could


---------59:35----------
work in my office for ten hours a day


---------59:37----------
six days a week for the rest of my life


---------59:39----------
and i would never make a dent in


---------59:41----------
anyone's liking the problem or what I've


---------59:44----------
used the problem yeah that that coupled


---------59:48----------
with the the realization that most of


---------59:51----------
what I do in my office is repeated right


---------59:54----------
so case in point like when I'm talking


---------59:56----------
to you the reason I have this hypothesis


---------59:58----------
is because I've run through this with


---------60:00----------
another person who is also wonderful and


---------60:03----------
positive and resilient and just a great


---------60:06----------
guy that everyone loves and he's just so


---------60:09----------
positive in like like he's also a


---------60:11----------
caregiver


---------60:12----------
he's like a giver he like supports his


---------60:14----------
family he supports his in-laws he


---------60:16----------
supports everyone and and that like in


---------60:21----------
there's a very like when we


---------60:22----------
good people we start to not want to


---------60:25----------
admit that we have like dark sides right


---------60:29----------
like like your but that's just not how


---------60:31----------
human beings are weird I mean we have


---------60:33----------
love and compassion and we also have


---------60:36----------
hatred and shame and fear and you sound


---------60:38----------
like you've done a great job you can cap


---------60:40----------
you can find your fear and you can find


---------60:42----------
your shame so easily which you really


---------60:44----------
deserve credit for because it's hard to


---------60:45----------
do that what I don't hear from you at


---------60:48----------
all is an ounce of anger or hatred and I


---------60:51----------
just don't think I kind of save it up


---------60:54----------
for things I think are okay to be mad at


---------60:57----------
the thing is I see a anger is like a


---------60:58----------
hopeful emotion like it's when you don't


---------61:01----------
stand for how things are so you have


---------61:03----------
this motivation to change them and


---------61:04----------
challenge them and so I don't let myself


---------61:06----------
be angry at trivial [ __ ] like drama on


---------61:10----------
bloody Facebook but I do let myself be


---------61:13----------
angry and justice is and let that be a


---------61:15----------
motivation to change things yeah but but


---------61:17----------
but you see that like you see how like I


---------61:19----------
mean it sounds so wonderful right but


---------61:21----------
you see how [ __ ] judgmental that is


---------61:24----------
you see how like you don't let yourself


---------61:27----------
feel away about a petty thing because


---------61:29----------
you don't like you're not letting


---------61:30----------
yourself be you you're judging yourself


---------61:33----------
for being like I think it makes sense


---------61:35----------
that you should be angry within justices


---------61:36----------
and fuel that anger and like make the


---------61:38----------
world a better place and like let's


---------61:39----------
protect rabbits absolutely but at the


---------61:42----------
same time you're also not letting


---------61:44----------
yourself be a taker in that moment sure


---------61:47----------
but I I kind of feel like there are


---------61:49----------
certain things that define you and I


---------61:51----------
don't want to be defined by how I feel


---------61:55----------
about trivial things when I catch myself


---------61:58----------
reading something that genuinely doesn't


---------62:00----------
matter or getting annoyed it's something


---------62:01----------
that genuinely doesn't matter in line


---------62:03----------
I'm like am I gotta waste hate on this I


---------62:05----------
can just move on like this this [ __ ] hey


---------62:07----------
hurts me so why just just let it go is


---------62:11----------
it hurting anyone then I don't care sure


---------62:14----------
I'd rather direct my attention to


---------62:15----------
constructive things absolutely so so I


---------62:18----------
think that that makes sense and I think


---------62:20----------
there's a middle ground because I think


---------62:23----------
you say I'd rather I'd rather spend my


---------62:25----------
energy on constructive things which


---------62:26----------
makes sense which is exactly why you


---------62:28----------
don't have Archon walls right because


---------62:30----------
you don't allow yourself the indulgence


---------62:32----------
of doing things that are unconstructive


---------62:34----------
in that I actually


---------62:36----------
it is not fair I don't think you deserve


---------62:38----------
to only be doing things that are


---------62:40----------
constructive I did I think you deserve a


---------62:42----------
break from time to time I think you


---------62:43----------
deserve to be indulgent I think you


---------62:45----------
deserve to be taken care of I think you


---------62:47----------
endure deserve a day off I think you


---------62:50----------
deserve to [ __ ] up I think you deserve


---------62:53----------
to put yourself first


---------62:54----------
and that not everything in like it's so


---------62:57----------
subtle because it's so [ __ ] positive


---------63:00----------
but it's like you deserve to be a little


---------63:03----------
bit petty like you're allowed to be a


---------63:05----------
little bit petty you don't have to be a


---------63:06----------
saint and I'm with you that I don't


---------63:08----------
think you should you know spend time


---------63:10----------
getting wrapped up and with drama on


---------63:12----------
Facebook like I think it's just a waste


---------63:13----------
of everyone's time well what I'm saying


---------63:15----------
is that you're actually at one end of


---------63:17----------
the extreme and I think you're way


---------63:19----------
forward because if we think about like


---------63:20----------
you don't value yourself right like you


---------63:23----------
know you're a good person and you value


---------63:24----------
yourself in a very like a big way but


---------63:26----------
you don't value yourself in like a


---------63:28----------
little way mmm like are two things that


---------63:32----------
I really relevant to that discussion and


---------63:33----------
one of them is that you don't get to


---------63:35----------
[ __ ] up on Twitch like you don't get to


---------63:38----------
miss B you don't get to have a past you


---------63:40----------
don't get to you know mess up in your


---------63:42----------
relationships and things like that


---------63:43----------
because those things you'll be punished


---------63:45----------
for those things depending on your size


---------63:48----------
there are people who've taken like 2


---------63:49----------
million pound pay cuts because they


---------63:52----------
[ __ ] up in a private moment with their


---------63:54----------
partner something no one would ever have


---------63:57----------
millions of people angry at them for no


---------64:00----------
one judging them for no one you know


---------64:02----------
giving them hate mail sending death


---------64:04----------
threats for not affecting their job in


---------64:06----------
any way losing sponsors for like this is


---------64:09----------
a this is a place where there is no room


---------64:13----------
for fuck-ups where there's no room for


---------64:14----------
Humanity who are always perfect or you


---------64:17----------
are in danger you have there's this


---------64:20----------
place people dehumanize you here and


---------64:22----------
that's something I think you're less at


---------64:24----------
risk of the most but something that


---------64:26----------
those of us who offer mostly just


---------64:29----------
ourselves feel every day because one day


---------64:33----------
everyone hates you in the next day


---------64:34----------
people love you and it turns on a dime


---------64:35----------
like constant and so the other thing is


---------64:38----------
I agree with you with the not self-care


---------64:41----------
because I used to make arts I have a


---------64:43----------
drawer full of artwork right there I


---------64:45----------
don't draw i I've done one drawing in


---------64:47----------
four years I specialized in animation


---------64:49----------
and I haven't drawn since I left uni and


---------64:52----------
it's because I feel that guilt


---------64:54----------
I don't self indulge and I feel like I'm


---------64:56----------
not a constructive thing to draw it's a


---------64:58----------
self-indulgent thing so I think if I


---------65:01----------
take your advice I probably would too


---------65:03----------
and I think you should because I don't


---------65:06----------
think you have to fix the world right


---------65:08----------
like you like the whole point here I


---------65:09----------
need is that you you undervalue yourself


---------65:12----------
in the hierarchy of what deserves


---------65:15----------
attention you are way too far down hmm


---------65:19----------
and and and that I really wonder if like


---------65:22----------
it's because you resent your mom for


---------65:24----------
taking so much from you and you never


---------65:27----------
want to be like her like oftentimes like


---------65:29----------
you said we you know we like you're not


---------65:31----------
you're not actually like you're so


---------65:33----------
afraid like you kind of say you even


---------65:35----------
said when we talked about modeling and


---------65:36----------
how parents model behavior but you're


---------65:38----------
like no no I'm the opposite of my mom


---------65:39----------
absolutely it's weird because a lot of


---------65:42----------
times we're not the opposites of our


---------65:43----------
parents but you point out that you've


---------65:45----------
worked very very so if we think about it


---------65:47----------
if the automatic idea is that if I have


---------65:50----------
an abusive parent the chances that they


---------65:52----------
have an abusive child is very high and


---------65:54----------
if they don't have an abusive chili if


---------65:57----------
their child doesn't become abusive that


---------65:59----------
is accomplished through a lot of effort


---------66:01----------
on the child's parts it's because they


---------66:03----------
overcome and fight against what they


---------66:05----------
were taught right yeah do you think is


---------66:11----------
with your position as a therapist that


---------66:13----------
you have a lot of confirming evidence


---------66:15----------
for that theory that may not be relevant


---------66:18----------
to the world because the truth of the


---------66:20----------
matter is that parent the children if


---------66:22----------
you don't end up [ __ ] up don't come to


---------66:24----------
you I worry that we tarnish people who


---------66:27----------
have heard about abusive parents as


---------66:30----------
likely to become abusive themselves when


---------66:32----------
around two-thirds of them statistically


---------66:34----------
don't yes I think that yeah and that a


---------66:37----------
lot of therapists think that a lot of


---------66:39----------
people become abusive because they've


---------66:41----------
been abused but most people can triumph


---------66:43----------
over that it's it and we I hope that


---------66:46----------
people who've been through a lot [ __ ]


---------66:47----------
don't get stereotyped because of it


---------66:49----------
because the people who come to treat


---------66:50----------
those who fell through the net didn't


---------66:52----------
get the support they needed and ended up


---------66:53----------
abusing because they don't know how to


---------66:55----------
connect those people need help but they


---------66:57----------
can also paint a picture to therapists


---------67:01----------
and the people who help them this is


---------67:02----------
never too


---------67:03----------
you become if you have a piece of


---------67:04----------
parents and I don't know that's true and


---------67:06----------
I want to be one of the people that


---------67:07----------
prove that isn't true I wanna be one of


---------67:09----------
the people says you know we don't always


---------67:11----------
turn out that way and many of us can get


---------67:13----------
over it no so I agree with you a hundred


---------67:15----------
percent so I I'm glad you brought that


---------67:17----------
up so I do so I so the statistics just


---------67:20----------
say that people who are abused are more


---------67:23----------
likely to be abusive in your right that


---------67:24----------
it's about a 30 percent chance right so


---------67:26----------
the statistics are low the second thing


---------67:29----------
is that I completely agree with you that


---------67:30----------
your future is not determined by the way


---------67:33----------
that you were raised in fact what I've


---------67:35----------
seen time and time and time again in my


---------67:37----------
job is that you can overcome those


---------67:39----------
things and I think what we see from you


---------67:41----------
is that you have overcome those things


---------67:43----------
my point is that that overcoming is I do


---------67:47----------
think that the people who are abused


---------67:48----------
growing up have a harder game to play


---------67:51----------
they're playing the game on hard mode


---------67:53----------
this is the way that I'd put it that


---------67:55----------
people who have loving parents are


---------67:57----------
playing the game on easy mode people who


---------67:59----------
have something between loving and


---------68:01----------
abusive are playing the game on normal


---------68:03----------
and then people who have abusive parents


---------68:05----------
are playing the game on hard mode now


---------68:06----------
all three of those people can beat the


---------68:09----------
level at the end of the day it's just


---------68:11----------
the deck is stacked against them and


---------68:12----------
sometimes the people who end up becoming


---------68:15----------
abusive once again I don't blame them


---------68:17----------
because I think that they were playing a


---------68:19----------
tougher game yeah so and I'm with you


---------68:22----------
that they can overcome things if I


---------68:23----------
didn't think that they could overcome


---------68:24----------
things I couldn't do my job like my


---------68:25----------
whole point is that you can overcome


---------68:27----------
that the second thing that I want to


---------68:29----------
address is is there a confirmation bias


---------68:31----------
because I'm a therapist


---------68:32----------
very possibly it's something that I


---------68:34----------
struggle with a lot but I really don't


---------68:35----------
think so because I think that you're


---------68:38----------
assuming that the people that I see are


---------68:41----------
broken in some way and I don't see them


---------68:42----------
that way I don't see the people that I


---------68:45----------
see as being less than the people that I


---------68:47----------
don't see right so I think in a subtle


---------68:51----------
subtle way like that in and of itself is


---------68:52----------
a very dangerous thinking I see normal


---------68:55----------
people everyone I see is completely


---------68:57----------
normal and that's where I start with it


---------68:59----------
this is just a normal person and sure


---------69:01----------
can they be labeled with some kind of


---------69:03----------
mental health disorder absolutely but I


---------69:05----------
don't think of mental health disorders


---------69:07----------
as like disorders of people I think of


---------69:10----------
them is actually symptoms to deeper


---------69:12----------
problems that we all face yeah I've seen


---------69:15----------
multimillionaires that are suus


---------69:16----------
idle because they're not doing enough


---------69:18----------
for their family and I've seen people in


---------69:20----------
jail who were 16 years old when they


---------69:22----------
started dealing drugs because they're


---------69:24----------
supposed to provide for the three older


---------69:25----------
sisters because that's what a man


---------69:27----------
[ __ ] does who's also suicidal because


---------69:30----------
he can't see enough for his family if


---------69:32----------
there's one thing that my clinical


---------69:33----------
practice has taught me it's that the


---------69:35----------
person in jail and the person who's the


---------69:36----------
multi-millionaire at the core is self I


---------69:39----------
know this sounds completely crazy


---------69:40----------
but are far more similar than they're


---------69:42----------
different because our society has taught


---------69:44----------
us that these two human beings are


---------69:46----------
fundamentally different but my work has


---------69:48----------
taught me that this is why I stream on


---------69:50----------
Twitch because I don't think that the


---------69:52----------
people on Twitch are rejects I see


---------69:56----------
myself in them and I see inside sorry


---------69:58----------
that's okay


---------70:02----------
anyway so I don't think that there's a


---------70:05----------
confirmation bias but there very well


---------70:07----------
could be it's something that I struggle


---------70:08----------
right but I think statistically I also


---------70:11----------
don't see I mean I a fair number of


---------70:13----------
people in my practice or don't have even


---------70:15----------
don't fit criteria for a mental illness


---------70:17----------
I I work with people who suffer and I


---------70:21----------
try to help people with suffering which


---------70:22----------
would this says is like a universal


---------70:23----------
human condition but it's still possible


---------70:27----------
that I have a cognitive bias right it's


---------70:29----------
possible that there's a selection bias


---------70:31----------
it's possible that all of what I've


---------70:32----------
learned is like not fair or widely


---------70:34----------
applicable but I still think when it


---------70:37----------
comes back to you like you what what I


---------70:40----------
really think is that like I really


---------70:42----------
wonder if there's a part of you that


---------70:43----------
doesn't want to become your mom yeah and


---------70:48----------
you know you're I'm grateful for that


---------70:50----------
too because I think every parent aspires


---------70:54----------
to have a child that outdoes them and I


---------70:57----------
have the benefit of learning from some


---------70:59----------
of my mom's mistakes from getting not


---------71:02----------
having to live them myself to know the


---------71:03----------
pain of them and that's good too and I


---------71:06----------
think it's good to some degree to want


---------71:08----------
to be different from my parents when I


---------71:09----------
improve on the model that they set for


---------71:12----------
us I think that's a beautiful thing so I


---------71:14----------
am uncomfortable believing that yeah


---------71:18----------
that I would like to be different I


---------71:19----------
would like that I can see things that I


---------71:21----------
wouldn't want to do we'll be yeah that


---------71:25----------
makes a lot of sense let me ask you


---------71:26----------
something are you I mean really


---------71:28----------
what about your personal life but is it


---------71:30----------
okay if I ask you about your thoughts


---------71:32----------
about having kids or whether you have


---------71:33----------
kids I am NOT gonna have kids I'm not I


---------71:39----------
I think if I do start to feel broody I


---------71:43----------
will adopt because I don't think the


---------71:45----------
answer to the world's problems is


---------71:46----------
another DNA copy of me and by the time


---------71:50----------
they have kids that DNA isn't passed on


---------71:52----------
anymore it's gets mixed and mixed again


---------71:53----------
until it's completely different its DNA


---------71:55----------
is not it's a transient thing it doesn't


---------71:57----------
matter but there are people out there


---------71:59----------
who've been through a lot of similar


---------72:00----------
things to me you were waiting for


---------72:01----------
somebody to love them and they go and


---------72:04----------
sit out there and loved while I create


---------72:06----------
yet another human being in a very well


---------72:09----------
populated earth so I think if I did have


---------72:11----------
kids I would go and find someone that my


---------72:14----------
tools would be particularly relevant and


---------72:15----------
use so exactly yeah there it is right so


---------72:19----------
I asked you about kids and what's your


---------72:22----------
answer that I'm not gonna do something


---------72:26----------
I'm gonna do something I'm like I don't


---------72:28----------
know it's unclear to me what your needs


---------72:30----------
exactly are but I hear the same axis of


---------72:33----------
there are people out there who need my


---------72:34----------
help so who the [ __ ] am i to create


---------72:37----------
another genetic copy what right do I


---------72:39----------
have to bring in someone else into the


---------72:40----------
world because there's so many kids out


---------72:42----------
there who are suffering you see how


---------72:43----------
thick it is [ __ ] me and what I want it's


---------72:47----------
not even clearly that you want kids but


---------72:49----------
I don't think you've even entertained


---------72:50----------
the idea automatically it's so [ __ ]


---------72:54----------
automatic that actually upsets me


---------72:57----------
because I think you're you're actually


---------72:59----------
not valuing yourself there there's a


---------73:02----------
difference between saying I actually


---------73:04----------
want kids and I'm gonna give them up but


---------73:06----------
I don't think you'd do that see this is


---------73:07----------
the thing you don't even like admit to


---------73:09----------
yourself that something is wrong and


---------73:11----------
then give that up you just slide right


---------73:13----------
past it and you use greater in justices


---------73:16----------
to justify giving things up for yourself


---------73:20----------
it's so positive and yet like there's a


---------73:23----------
part of me that screams that you are


---------73:25----------
doing something to you that has been


---------73:27----------
done to your entire life which is that


---------73:30----------
you are devaluing yourself and you were


---------73:32----------
saying that if there are things that are


---------73:34----------
more important than me that bothers me


---------73:38----------
it bothers me really deep down because I


---------73:42----------
do


---------73:42----------
think that that kid out there who needs


---------73:45----------
a loving parent is more important than


---------73:47----------
you are right we all deserve to be


---------73:51----------
important yeah and you do it so quickly


---------73:55----------
and it's like clouded with so much


---------73:57----------
positivity and that it's so easy to get


---------73:59----------
away with and yet I feel hurt when I


---------74:05----------
hear you say that which is [ __ ] weird


---------74:07----------
because you're talking about something


---------74:09----------
that's so good anyway can I just say to


---------74:19----------
those in chat that I still think it's


---------74:21----------
worth adopting regardless strategies


---------74:23----------
aside and that there is a certain amount


---------74:26----------
to be gained from adopting someone and


---------74:27----------
connecting with someone beyond a genetic


---------74:30----------
level but rather passing on what's truly


---------74:31----------
important about you the thing that you


---------74:33----------
decided which is your identity your


---------74:35----------
values and your you know your tools for


---------74:38----------
navigating the world and those things


---------74:40----------
are the things you decided about itself


---------74:42----------
those are the things you can take credit


---------74:43----------
for those are the things I think really


---------74:45----------
matter about us we don't choose what eye


---------74:46----------
color we have but we do choose who we


---------74:48----------
are and passing on a little bit of that


---------74:50----------
in a positive way and helping someone


---------74:52----------
else with that is beautiful and I think


---------74:54----------
that is still Parenthood and I still I


---------74:55----------
think it's an undervalued form of


---------74:57----------
parenthood and I'd encourage anyone in


---------74:59----------
chat to adopt regardless of my reasoning


---------75:01----------
even if it might seem a little bit


---------75:03----------
dysfunctional in this content no I mean


---------75:05----------
but like Anita so thank you for sharing


---------75:07----------
that I think it's I really do think your


---------75:09----------
your goals are noble and I support them


---------75:11----------
a hundred percent I think you're a


---------75:12----------
wonderful person it's just there's


---------75:14----------
something that's just so subtle about


---------75:16----------
you putting the rest of the world first


---------75:18----------
like it's a weird thing right but that's


---------75:21----------
what I hear from you time and time and


---------75:23----------
time again is that like I put other


---------75:25----------
people first


---------75:26----------
and I just don't agree with that mmm-hmm


---------75:30----------
and in that because I think you deserve


---------75:32----------
you deserve being put first - hmm it's


---------75:36----------
one thing to hear that but how do you


---------75:38----------
put it in practice because the feeling


---------75:40----------
doesn't go away and sometimes I push


---------75:42----------
back the tide and I start doing things


---------75:44----------
for myself I can never keep it up yeah I


---------75:47----------
had this issue for a long time and even


---------75:49----------
when I did rescue work years back I used


---------75:51----------
to go out there I used to do anything


---------75:54----------
and everything


---------75:55----------
some of it was like dangerous as well


---------75:57----------
and I'd come home and I'd be really


---------76:00----------
really exhausted and I'd go back after


---------76:02----------
an hour and do it again like I spent an


---------76:04----------
hour at home a day for like a month and


---------76:06----------
she's completely burnt out and the thing


---------76:09----------
with all of that is like I would notice


---------76:12----------
the problem trying to fix it get started


---------76:14----------
and then just fall back into again and I


---------76:17----------
just fell back into it with it's


---------76:18----------
dreaming yeah so so I need a great


---------76:20----------
question so I think which the problem


---------76:22----------
here is that you're overcoming something


---------76:24----------
and that's not a sustainable way to live


---------76:27----------
your life so like when you when you


---------76:30----------
think about like you know your desire to


---------76:32----------
make the world a better place is to move


---------76:35----------
away from something within yourself does


---------76:39----------
that make sense


---------76:41----------
mmm like I I think like a lot of your


---------76:44----------
desire for goodness in the world is like


---------76:46----------
because of some badness in you like it's


---------76:51----------
just moving away and then when you


---------76:52----------
indulge is something from yourself it's


---------76:55----------
like that badness within you comes up


---------76:57----------
front and center and then you don't want


---------76:58----------
that feeling so you go out and you help


---------77:01----------
someone else


---------77:02----------
hmm which the world the world loves a


---------77:05----------
relationship with you because you're you


---------77:08----------
do for the world what all these people


---------77:10----------
do and they take advantage of your


---------77:11----------
kindness the world takes advantage of


---------77:13----------
your kindness


---------77:13----------
the world is gonna take as much as you


---------77:15----------
have to give and it'll let you chew


---------77:17----------
yourself out in the process and it won't


---------77:19----------
give two shits when you burn out and


---------77:21----------
when you're exhausted the thousands of


---------77:23----------
people out there who benefit from your


---------77:26----------
you know your sacrifices will appreciate


---------77:28----------
it and no one will be left to care for


---------77:31----------
you


---------77:32----------
and that's completely fine now the


---------77:36----------
question is how do you overcome that I


---------77:37----------
think you have to figure out where that


---------77:39----------
sense that other people are


---------77:41----------
fundamentally more important than I am


---------77:43----------
comes from and you have to explore like


---------77:46----------
where you got that idea and and I know I


---------77:49----------
keep on harping on this this may not be


---------77:50----------
right but like I I really do wonder if


---------77:53----------
you Harbor some kind of resentment from


---------77:55----------
your mom or towards your mom and if you


---------77:57----------
do harbor resentment towards your mom if


---------77:59----------
you can acknowledge that it may not be


---------78:01----------
rational and it may not be fair but you


---------78:03----------
just have to like notice it right and


---------78:05----------
and for you to hold that your mom


---------78:07----------
because you talk about your mom like an


---------78:08----------
ideal


---------78:09----------
figure right like you talk about her


---------78:12----------
like she's one-dimensional like you talk


---------78:15----------
about her his is intelligent in support


---------78:17----------
of and wonderful and he'll and it's


---------78:19----------
tragic that she like but parents are not


---------78:23----------
one-dimensional right all of us like I


---------78:26----------
mean I hope I'm a good dad but I'm a


---------78:28----------
[ __ ] psychiatrist so I'm sure my kids


---------78:30----------
are gonna be [ __ ] up one day because


---------78:31----------
that's what happens


---------78:33----------
statistically right and so so I mean the


---------78:37----------
truth is that there's no such thing as a


---------78:39----------
perfect parent but what I hear you


---------78:40----------
describe is a perfect parent and I think


---------78:42----------
that's a problem yeah and as you start


---------78:45----------
to explore in what ways like where does


---------78:47----------
that feeling come from like why is it


---------78:49----------
like when I asked you this question


---------78:50----------
about kids like you've launched into


---------78:52----------
this whole philosophical explanation and


---------78:55----------
I think great you guys should adopt


---------78:57----------
because there are a lot of kids out


---------78:58----------
there that need love but the question is


---------79:00----------
as you as as I asked that question and


---------79:03----------
you start explaining stuff what is the


---------79:05----------
feeling that you're moving away from if


---------79:08----------
I were to ask you Anita I think you


---------79:10----------
should have kids how do you feel if I


---------79:14----------
say that right right so why do we feel


---------79:23----------
defensive it's because something hurts


---------79:24----------
we have to protect something time to


---------79:27----------
tank up so what is it that hurts with


---------79:30----------
the prospect of you having kids like


---------79:31----------
forget about whether you actually should


---------79:33----------
or shouldn't that's your choice if you


---------79:34----------
want to adopt by all means go do it but


---------79:36----------
what I'm saying is like what what is it


---------79:38----------
within you that you are feeling


---------79:40----------
defensive about


---------79:48----------
you


---------79:55----------
what's wrong with you having kids


---------80:03----------
you


---------80:13----------
I think I think it's a I think it's a


---------80:18----------
couple of things I think I wanted them


---------80:25----------
is uh is I don't really picture myself


---------80:29----------
in a relationship I don't picture myself


---------80:33----------
like I worry as well like it immediately


---------80:36----------
brings up the idea of like almost


---------80:39----------
relationships and and then I'm it's


---------80:41----------
handily connected to another person who


---------80:43----------
probably [ __ ] me over at some point


---------80:45----------
and you know looking at all of the


---------80:47----------
awkward single parents you have to see


---------80:50----------
the other parent and a list of stuff and


---------80:52----------
I see painful connections there whereas


---------80:55----------
I see a connection that's based on


---------80:57----------
someone needing you and it's not


---------81:00----------
incumbent on whether you'll sleep with


---------81:01----------
them with the approve of you or whether


---------81:03----------
they can handle your condition it's just


---------81:05----------
a need and that seems pure from Earth


---------81:07----------
you're talking about the potential


---------81:10----------
father of a child that you have or


---------81:12----------
you're talking about the child


---------81:13----------
themselves the potential father like I


---------81:16----------
think if a child needs you that very


---------81:19----------
that's a very clear and very easy thing


---------81:22----------
to maintain and a very safe thing to you


---------81:25----------
for me it seems like that's not


---------81:28----------
incumbent on anything whereas a


---------81:30----------
relationship is and they fluctuate and


---------81:32----------
they don't statistically last I think


---------81:35----------
that a child with someone carrot the


---------81:37----------
idea if it carries a lot of pain


---------81:39----------
compared to the idea of just helping


---------81:41----------
someone who needs honestly yes that's


---------81:49----------
thank you for sharing that and also like


---------81:52----------
whoa like I feel like this is a whole


---------81:56----------
different conversation right so because


---------81:59----------
it's interesting so I'm gonna toss your


---------82:01----------
words right back at you about you know


---------82:02----------
children of abusers becoming abusers


---------82:05----------
like why do you think you have to fall


---------82:07----------
victim to that statistic right we're


---------82:10----------
willing if you can overcome your


---------82:15----------
upbringing because that was a long shot


---------82:17----------
right let's be honest like most people


---------82:19----------
who grew up in your situation where


---------82:21----------
they're physically abusive the child of


---------82:23----------
teenage parents it sounds like


---------82:27----------
and you know left to fend for themselves


---------82:29----------
like most of them end up like you know


---------82:32----------
in like I mean I've worked with a lot of


---------82:34----------
people with substance use and it's now


---------82:35----------
and honestly I'll tell you I mean so I


---------82:37----------
we sometimes not really joke about this


---------82:40----------
but if I can share one other thing so I


---------82:42----------
need I used to work in an emergency room


---------82:45----------
I don't really do that kind of work


---------82:47----------
anymore but for many years I worked in


---------82:48----------
an emergency room and sometimes we've


---------82:50----------
got a kid who comes in and the kid has


---------82:52----------
all these different diagnoses they've


---------82:54----------
gotten like bipolar disorder marijuana


---------82:56----------
use cocaine use depression ADHD and and


---------83:02----------
really like with the diagnosis for the


---------83:03----------
kid was it was something that there was


---------83:05----------
an older woman as a psychiatric DD who


---------83:08----------
was brilliant


---------83:08----------
she was a nurse practitioner and she


---------83:11----------
would say yeah the kid has [ __ ] life


---------83:13----------
syndrome it's not that they have


---------83:15----------
depression and bipolar and ADHD it's


---------83:17----------
just like they've got just like a [ __ ]


---------83:18----------
life like they don't have stability in


---------83:21----------
their house they don't have parents who


---------83:22----------
are like stable they just you know the


---------83:26----------
child services people are involved and


---------83:28----------
the thing is it sounds like you had [ __ ]


---------83:30----------
life syndrome like it sounds like you


---------83:31----------
have grew up in a place where you don't


---------83:33----------
really have stability or care or support


---------83:35----------
and you overcame the odds and so it


---------83:38----------
blows my mind that like you're afraid of


---------83:41----------
the odds right because if you've


---------83:44----------
overcome such long-ass odds to become


---------83:47----------
the person that you are who's caring and


---------83:49----------
compassionate and resilient like why on


---------83:51----------
earth would you think that if you chose


---------83:53----------
to spend the rest of your life with


---------83:55----------
someone and this gets into monogamy or


---------83:56----------
whatever so like I mean let's not even


---------83:58----------
presume that saying this is probably a


---------83:59----------
different conversation but like you have


---------84:01----------
so many fears around so your relation


---------84:03----------
your fear of having a child of your own


---------84:04----------
has nothing sounds like it has nothing


---------84:06----------
to do the child has everything to do


---------84:07----------
with the partner yeah and so like I


---------84:11----------
think if I mean so that's got to be


---------84:13----------
dealt with that has nothing to do with


---------84:14----------
adoption that's just like what you know


---------84:16----------
like where do you get the idea that you


---------84:20----------
know this is gonna like be doomed to


---------84:22----------
disaster because that also hurts me to


---------84:24----------
hear because I I think that it's


---------84:27----------
possible and and you know I think it's


---------84:30----------
possible for people to meet each other


---------84:32----------
to be invested in each other and to


---------84:34----------
build a life with each other and the


---------84:37----------
fact that you've taken that off of the


---------84:39----------
table I think makes


---------84:40----------
we feel sad I think they have some


---------84:44----------
healing to do I I spent several years in


---------84:47----------
a DV situation what is that domestic


---------84:51----------
violence ah so I had to flee someone I


---------84:55----------
had to give up my life I was midway


---------84:57----------
through studying I got my degree I was


---------84:59----------
studying for higher education and I had


---------85:02----------
to just abandon it all move


---------85:04----------
leave all my friends to get away from it


---------85:06----------
he tried to end my life it's [ __ ]


---------85:10----------
scary yeah yeah that explains woman


---------85:15----------
yeah and yeah it's been hard to connect


---------85:19----------
with people since I have succeeded


---------85:21----------
I had another six year relationship


---------85:22----------
after that but I that wasn't the best


---------85:27----------
relationship either but for other


---------85:29----------
reasons he he never harmed me but yeah I


---------85:32----------
kind of feel I yes still getting past


---------85:39----------
that one yeah um and obviously that's


---------85:42----------
how I get that window into how our


---------85:44----------
relationship with our parents become so


---------85:46----------
familiar that we end up reliving them


---------85:48----------
with our friendships and relationships


---------85:50----------
there are I'm very aware of that and


---------85:53----------
still figuring my way through it I'm


---------85:55----------
still figuring out how to draw people of


---------85:58----------
a different kind and to be in a safer


---------86:01----------
more stable place because sadly and


---------86:05----------
here's the thing people get crossed with


---------86:07----------
women who keep ending up in with a piece


---------86:08----------
of relationship there's so many jealous


---------86:10----------
men who like she only gets with


---------86:11----------
[ __ ] more women like bird boys and


---------86:14----------
all those generalizations but the truth


---------86:16----------
is I didn't end up with bad people


---------86:18----------
because I love bad boys I was hopeful


---------86:20----------
and naive every time and every bad


---------86:22----------
person will tell you they're good at the


---------86:23----------
start and if you're hopeful you believe


---------86:26----------
them yeah and so I I end up convincing


---------86:32----------
myself never again I'm gonna go for


---------86:33----------
someone nice someone kind animated so


---------86:36----------
can I tell you to go for something else


---------86:38----------
yeah I don't want you to go for someone


---------86:41----------
who's nice I want you to go for yourself


---------86:45----------
do you mean so like the undercurrent for


---------86:50----------
everything that I'm hearing from you and


---------86:51----------
Nita is that you put other people first


---------86:53----------
I want you to be in a relationship where


---------86:55----------
you come first I don't even know what


---------87:02----------
that looks like


---------87:03----------
absolutely and that's the [ __ ]


---------87:05----------
problem that is the [ __ ] problem is


---------87:11----------
that you have no idea what it's like to


---------87:14----------
put yourself first you have no idea what


---------87:18----------
it's like to be in a relationship where


---------87:20----------
you get put first and that I think


---------87:24----------
someone in your [ __ ] upbringing


---------87:25----------
deserve some blame for and so I think it


---------87:36----------
starts with baby snacks yeah get


---------87:40----------
yourself some artwork spend some time


---------87:44----------
painting and see what comes up you're


---------87:45----------
working with a therapist now no I don't


---------87:48----------
have okay well okay but then I would say


---------87:52----------
like and then like explore that right


---------87:54----------
like what is that guiltiness like that


---------87:55----------
guiltiness is you putting yourself first


---------87:57----------
like [ __ ] put yourself first you


---------87:59----------
deserve it and you've already made a


---------88:03----------
world like you've done enough like


---------88:04----------
you're already in that positive right


---------88:06----------
how many people did you send to your


---------88:08----------
amazing therapist to is life-changing I


---------88:10----------
don't know yeah I'm gonna have to ask


---------88:12----------
her who's like I mean if you if if you


---------88:15----------
sent more than one then you're not


---------88:18----------
positive for life fine so you deserve a


---------88:21----------
break and like do something for yourself


---------88:23----------
and put yourself first and you've done


---------88:26----------
amazing I mean I neither you've just


---------88:28----------
done such an amazing job but like your


---------88:29----------
positivity is infuriating because it


---------88:31----------
comes in and you're 90% there but that


---------88:37----------
last 10% has to come from like loving


---------88:40----------
yourself and choosing yourself and


---------88:41----------
putting yourself first we're here on


---------88:43----------
Twitch where everyone is so [ __ ]


---------88:45----------
selfish and I don't think they are by


---------88:46----------
the way I have a better opinion in which


---------88:48----------
I sometimes wonder I mean I realize when


---------88:50----------
you're saying earlier about you know


---------88:51----------
twitch and failure and all that you


---------88:53----------
losing my income and all that kind of


---------88:54----------
crap I I think I mean you must be right


---------88:56----------
and I can see that and at the same time


---------88:58----------
there's a part of me that wonders about


---------89:00----------
like how much of that is because of the


---------89:02----------
way that you view the world that if


---------89:04----------
there's love there's gonna be taking


---------89:07----------
away of love eventually hmm right like I


---------89:10----------
see that same dynamic of like when you


---------89:12----------
look at Twitter like this is gonna be


---------89:14----------
temporary the gravy train is gonna stop


---------89:16----------
at some point and they're gonna abandon


---------89:17----------
me yeah yeah you you don't know how hot


---------89:21----------
in the head you are with that my


---------89:22----------
community will tell you as well because


---------89:23----------
when I first arrived I went from in


---------89:26----------
three months I ended up with like 300


---------89:28----------
thousand followers um the first three


---------89:31----------
months like I went viral and it was


---------89:33----------
scary but I didn't get used to it


---------89:35----------
everyone's like you're a big thing now


---------89:36----------
is like no I'm not I'm viral everyone's


---------89:38----------
gonna go on to the next thing in a few


---------89:40----------
days and everything will go back to 20


---------89:41----------
viewers again and I just did not believe


---------89:43----------
it and I kept saying that any minute now


---------89:45----------
any minute now for like a year I was


---------89:47----------
like any minute now they're all gonna go


---------89:48----------
and they stayed and I've been like what


---------89:52----------
like this has been like brain scram so


---------89:54----------
I've not I've I'd never understood it


---------89:56----------
yes and this is this is gonna sound


---------89:59----------
crazy but like I think twitch like this


---------90:01----------
is gonna sound [ __ ] weird I think


---------90:02----------
twitch is teaching you how to love


---------90:04----------
yourself right because like this is


---------90:06----------
exactly what happens to someone who's


---------90:07----------
been in an abusive relationship after


---------90:09----------
abusive relationship after abuse is a


---------90:10----------
relationship after abusive relationship


---------90:12----------
is they meet someone who's actually nice


---------90:14----------
and they're like what the [ __ ] is going


---------90:15----------
on yeah yeah it's like why haven't they


---------90:19----------
abandoned me like what is this I didn't


---------90:21----------
I don't this is not how things work


---------90:23----------
people get interested me in me for a


---------90:26----------
time and then they start throwing rocks


---------90:28----------
like we're and then the longer they stay


---------90:31----------
the more confusing it gets yeah and it's


---------90:35----------
just bewildering because you weren't


---------90:36----------
taught how this works you weren't taught


---------90:39----------
that you can have intrinsic value and


---------90:41----------
that people can come around and hang


---------90:43----------
around because they like you for you are


---------90:45----------
that's it yeah yeah and that that is


---------90:52----------
something but I I've been genuinely


---------90:54----------
confused by and sometimes people have


---------90:56----------
like donated thousands of pounds or they


---------90:58----------
have you know they've they've been


---------91:00----------
following me for like ninety months and


---------91:02----------
I'm like why are you still here like and


---------91:05----------
I'm confused and I will openly express


---------91:07----------
it I haven't quite learnt how to come to


---------91:09----------
terms with it yet because it is it


---------91:11----------
direct


---------91:11----------
see it confronts something I don't know


---------91:14----------
how to process yeah


---------91:16----------
so let me I'll leave you with this to


---------91:19----------
think about and then we'll see I mean if


---------91:20----------
you have other questions and stuff but I


---------91:22----------
want you to entertain a crazy idea okay


---------91:25----------
I want you to entertain that people can


---------91:28----------
see value and you without you giving


---------91:30----------
anything to them I want you to entertain


---------91:36----------
the idea that sometimes you're a rabbit


---------91:37----------
but you don't have to give anything in


---------91:39----------
return and that people will just


---------91:41----------
appreciate you for being you and that


---------91:46----------
you don't have to adopt or save animals


---------91:48----------
or other things to be like valued in


---------91:51----------
life that you can have and it sounds


---------91:52----------
crazy


---------91:53----------
just intrinsic value not extrinsic value


---------91:56----------
but just intrinsic value that just by


---------91:58----------
virtue of who you are you have earth and


---------92:01----------
that you don't need to do anything to be


---------92:03----------
worth something yeah that makes so much


---------92:09----------
sense if I picture applying to somebody


---------92:11----------
else


---------92:11----------
that's the weird thing like that's


---------92:14----------
that's immediately when you're


---------92:15----------
describing that it's easier to remember


---------92:17----------
and understand those words if I'm


---------92:19----------
picturing us describing someone other


---------92:21----------
than me which kind of emphasizes yes I


---------92:25----------
think you're very much on to something


---------92:26----------
yeah right and so I think you've got to


---------92:30----------
explore that and I think it's it


---------92:32----------
literally Anita it starts with little


---------92:33----------
things like it starts like I mean when


---------92:35----------
you say people don't say nothing on your


---------92:38----------
walls like so get yourself something for


---------92:39----------
yourself yeah like do you have a bathtub


---------92:42----------
I do do you have bubble baths no do you


---------92:48----------
have things do you ever use the bathtub


---------92:51----------
and enjoy being in a bathtub with like


---------92:53----------
bubble baths or other kinds of bath


---------92:55----------
bombs or whatnot no I don't do that yeah


---------93:02----------
so I think you should try like I think


---------93:04----------
you should start start with Patty and


---------93:05----------
worthless indulgences because you're


---------93:10----------
worth it


---------93:14----------
thank you any last thoughts or questions


---------93:20----------
no I just wanted to say thank you for


---------93:22----------
everything that you do I think that


---------93:24----------
honestly I've watched a bit of your work


---------93:26----------
before here on the channel and I think


---------93:28----------
the beauty of it is that a lot of what's


---------93:31----------
being described as very normal human


---------93:33----------
problems and a lot of people in chat can


---------93:34----------
definitely relate to it you're helping


---------93:36----------
people process themselves and the people


---------93:38----------
around them and contextualize behaviour


---------93:39----------
that they've seen or experiencing that


---------93:41----------
they don't really understand yet and I


---------93:45----------
see that fitting for place fitting into


---------93:46----------
place for people in chat people who've


---------93:49----------
seen your work I've heard them talk


---------93:50----------
about just in the brief periods that


---------93:52----------
they've dipped in it just transforming


---------93:53----------
things for them and I think what you're


---------93:56----------
doing is beautiful I thank you ever so


---------93:58----------
much for bringing this to the platform


---------94:00----------
because it's definitely what's needed


---------94:01----------
and yeah I know that this is gonna keep


---------94:05----------
growing and it's beautiful well I am


---------94:07----------
you're very welcome and I greatly


---------94:10----------
appreciate your positive sentiment it's


---------94:12----------
part of what keeps us growing and I


---------94:13----------
could say that I'm gonna say the same


---------94:15----------
thing right back at you because I think


---------94:17----------
you to bring a lot of positivity and


---------94:19----------
we'll submiss like I'm not too familiar


---------94:20----------
with too many twitch streamers but I


---------94:22----------
think it's awesome how you engage in


---------94:24----------
conversations or on mental health I


---------94:25----------
think it's awesome how you try to be a


---------94:27----------
positive person I mean I know we've been


---------94:29----------
trying to get you to not be a positive


---------94:30----------
person for less


---------94:32----------
I really do think it's great that you


---------94:33----------
you do try to make the world a better


---------94:35----------
place and and the world really does


---------94:38----------
benefit from people like you I mean if


---------94:40----------
we had a you know 100 people like you


---------94:42----------
10,000 people would be better off I


---------94:45----------
think the only thing that I'll return to


---------94:47----------
is that this goes for everyone else out


---------94:49----------
there too is that you don't you should


---------94:53----------
absolutely make the world a better place


---------94:55----------
but I don't believe it has to come at


---------94:57----------
the cost of yourself I don't think


---------94:59----------
that's fair but I you know I think what


---------95:03----------
you do is awesome and I think that


---------95:05----------
you're educating people around


---------95:06----------
Tourette's and mental health and like


---------95:07----------
teaching acceptance and and all that


---------95:10----------
kind of stuff we're completely behind


---------95:12----------
you Anita do you do you want to meditate


---------95:16----------
sure I teach people how to meditate let


---------95:19----------
me just think about what oh man I do you


---------95:21----------
have anything you must indulge in some


---------95:24----------
ways right


---------95:28----------
do you have junk food at home I buy


---------95:32----------

---------95:34----------

---------95:40----------

---------96:17----------

---------96:23----------

---------96:31----------

---------96:33----------

---------96:38----------

---------96:49----------
seconds to go get their own food okay


---------96:53----------
what did you get I got some white


---------96:57----------
chocolate awesome it's unopened mm-hmm


---------97:01----------
see that's the crime yeah I've had it


---------97:07----------
for ages is it expired are you gonna get


---------97:09----------
sick no no it's not expired it's fine


---------97:15----------
okay so let's get started so I want you


---------97:18----------
to start and eat it by sitting up


---------97:20----------
straight closing your eyes and I'm gonna


---------97:24----------
ask you to think out loud a little bit


---------97:26----------
okay so when you think about eating the


---------97:28----------
chocolate what comes up in your mind


---------97:32----------
mm-hmm I can already taste it okay mmm


---------97:37----------
and does any kind of emotion come up


---------97:41----------
uh kind of like relief I guess okay okay


---------97:49----------
so what keeps you from eating it if you


---------97:53----------
can taste it and eating it brings you


---------97:56----------
relief what keeps you from me to eating


---------97:58----------
it what do you think I feel like I


---------98:02----------
should be doing other things


---------98:04----------
mm-hmm okay do you feel like you should


---------98:07----------
be doing two other things now no no


---------98:11----------
after I check okay so the first okay so


---------98:15----------
now well so let's just zero in on that


---------98:18----------
right so let's zero in on the


---------98:19----------
acknowledgement that the reason it has


---------98:22----------
been left it it is left uneaten so far


---------98:26----------
is because you feel like you should have


---------98:28----------
been doing other things and let's also


---------98:30----------
notice that for some reason and let's


---------98:32----------
not be jump to conclusions that feeling


---------98:35----------
doesn't appear to exist within you right


---------98:37----------
now hmm right so now I want you to open


---------98:42----------
the chocolate okay and then take off a


---------98:53----------
piece is it like a big it looks like I'm


---------98:56----------
just looking at it it seems yeah perfect


---------98:58----------
okay so close your eyes okay think about


---------99:01----------
eating it for a second does any kind of


---------99:03----------
lessons to come up taste like your


---------99:06----------
mother sorry it does it wait but this is


---------99:09----------
it bread does it does anything come up


---------99:11----------
for you no okay so let's just notice for


---------99:16----------
a moment that as her mind becomes less


---------99:17----------
occupied that takes in grease


---------99:20----------
so that's movable so now go ahead and


---------99:22----------
take a bite of your chocolate


---------99:28----------
just notice how it tastes and tell us


---------99:38----------
how you feed pretty damn good but


---------99:44----------
shouldn't you be doing something else


---------99:50----------
like this ok now the feelings coming


---------99:55----------
back how do I push it away again what is


---------99:56----------
the feeling don't push it away um gilts


---------100:01----------
ok so shame eyes opened guilt and shame


---------100:06----------
came close the eyes


---------100:10----------
notice the guilt and shame give them


---------100:12----------
don't try to run away from them give


---------100:14----------
them your fullest attention what do you


---------100:18----------
feel


---------100:25----------
like I shouldn't be doing this okay


---------100:29----------
so where is that sensation that I


---------100:32----------
shouldn't be doing this hmm I feel it


---------100:36----------
like a squeeze Wow


---------100:39----------
I squeezed them my chest or okay I feel


---------100:43----------
like I should okay so you feel squeezed


---------100:46----------
and the pressure in your chest so I want


---------100:48----------
you to do is take a deep breath in feel


---------100:52----------
that squeeze expand and then relax and


---------100:55----------
let it squeeze you let it squeeze let it


---------100:57----------
contract your chest down and now breathe


---------100:59----------
into it and then let it squeeze and then


---------101:08----------
a third time


---------101:10----------
feel it expand that squeeze enos and


---------101:13----------
then let the squeeze contract back down


---------101:16----------
let it deflate and now continue your


---------101:22----------
normal breathing and notice what's


---------101:24----------
happening in the sensation within you I


---------101:28----------
feel like it is receding okay I feel I


---------101:32----------
feel like I feel like I feel like even


---------101:36----------
just acknowledging that it helps me


---------101:39----------
mm-hmm to kind of shut it down like it


---------101:44----------
feels less powerful when I actually


---------101:45----------
facing it good yeah so we're gonna go to


---------101:50----------
level 2 take another bite and anticipate


---------101:54----------
let yourself recognize that that guilt


---------101:57----------
eyes closed it's gonna get stronger with


---------102:00----------
your eyes open


---------102:03----------
let yourself let it come in right


---------102:07----------
recognize that there's a part of you


---------102:09----------
that is guilty and ashamed and that that


---------102:12----------
part of you that negative part of you


---------102:14----------
deserves a seat at the table you don't


---------102:17----------
all have to be a wonderful person you're


---------102:19----------
allowed to be a negative person - you're


---------102:21----------
allowed to have negative feelings we


---------102:23----------
don't want them we don't want you to run


---------102:26----------
away from them that thing is not hideous


---------102:30----------
right there they're your whole life


---------102:33----------
you've been taught that there are parts


---------102:34----------
of you that are hideous that needs to


---------102:36----------
change


---------102:39----------
what's happening to it


---------102:48----------
so I'm just letting it be there it kind


---------102:56----------
of feels like an edge like I'm like okay


---------102:57----------
now you're done put it away now like


---------102:59----------
drop off the chocolate put it away


---------103:00----------
they're like that's my media edge good


---------103:03----------
good so notice that part of you right


---------103:05----------
and then tell that part of you that


---------103:07----------
you're gonna take a third piece of


---------103:08----------
chocolate and what you're going to do is


---------103:11----------
this third piece of chocolate


---------103:12----------
you're not gonna necessarily push the


---------103:14----------
negativity away but you're also going to


---------103:17----------
let yourself taste that third piece of


---------103:20----------
chocolate and just enjoy it as much as


---------103:22----------
you can okay it gets to bark but you


---------103:27----------
don't have to respond to it right you're


---------103:29----------
not telling it to be quiet but you're


---------103:31----------
also not giving into it so the third


---------103:34----------
piece I want you to try to really enjoy


---------103:36----------
like really taste it pay attention to


---------103:38----------
your mouth pay attention to the


---------103:39----------
sensation of it pay attention to the way


---------103:41----------
that it melts pay attention to the


---------103:43----------
flavor the sweetness the enjoyment we


---------103:54----------
don't want to push away the thus


---------103:56----------
queasiness you can breathe into it if


---------103:58----------
you want to but really try to just enjoy


---------104:00----------
the chocolate like so it looks like it's


---------104:01----------
a good [ __ ] chocolate white chocolate


---------104:03----------
delicious mm-hmm and just be like yeah


---------104:06----------
this is great the last question I'm


---------104:13----------
going to ask you you don't have to


---------104:14----------
answer this the right way you can answer


---------104:15----------
it the wrong way is is it okay for you


---------104:18----------
to do this is it okay for you to enjoy


---------104:20----------
is it okay for you to not donate that


---------104:23----------
chocolate to a homeless person stop


---------104:29----------
reading my mind is it


---------104:40----------
is it okay to feel both answers yes


---------104:44----------
that's the right answer actually right


---------104:53----------
because I have a Wow I have Wow


---------104:58----------
I have well I have well I have the


---------105:01----------
mental answer and I guess the emotional


---------105:05----------
answer and they're both yep good so so


---------105:09----------
now now we're gonna come to a close with


---------105:12----------
this practice so just sit with both of


---------105:14----------
those answers and see if you can find


---------105:17----------
any emotional answer that resonates with


---------105:20----------
your rational answer right can do you


---------105:23----------
find any enjoyment within yourself yeah


---------105:27----------
so so notice that too right we don't


---------105:30----------
necessarily want logic versus emotion we


---------105:32----------
want emotion versus emotion we want you


---------105:35----------
to recognize that there's a part of you


---------105:36----------
that enjoys this experience and there's


---------105:39----------
a part of you that doesn't enjoy this


---------105:40----------
experience yeah that actually the


---------105:45----------
emotion that you feel is a judgment for


---------105:48----------
the enjoyment so that's actually more of


---------105:50----------
a rational process than I think you give


---------105:52----------
it credit for yeah so there's emotion


---------105:57----------
versus an emotion and then there's


---------105:59----------
rational thought versus rational thought


---------106:00----------
judgment versus yeah of course it's okay


---------106:03----------
for you to enjoy something and then down


---------106:05----------
here there's a sense of tightness and


---------106:07----------
there's also a sense of like enjoyment


---------106:08----------
or pleasure yeah and and either you must


---------106:13----------
do this okay so you pick whatever it is


---------106:16----------
whether it's buying something for


---------106:17----------
yourself and and understand that one day


---------106:20----------
you may adopt a child or maybe you'll


---------106:22----------
adopt half a dozen because why adopt one


---------106:24----------
when you can save six people like yeah


---------106:27----------
and then understand that one of the most


---------106:29----------
important things that you can teach


---------106:31----------
those children is how to appreciate who


---------106:33----------
they are and how to derive enjoyment


---------106:35----------
from life yeah right and how are you


---------106:38----------
going to teach them that unless you know


---------106:41----------
it


---------106:45----------
it's very so do something for yourself


---------106:48----------
and do like you're gonna notice it's


---------106:49----------
like I don't know if you go to the


---------106:51----------
grocery store because of covet or


---------106:52----------
whatever but you're gonna have a chance


---------106:53----------
to indulge yourself and then you're


---------106:55----------
gonna rebel against it but but support


---------106:58----------
that part of you that bought the


---------107:00----------
chocolate that's the one that we want


---------107:03----------
right because in that moment a you know


---------107:04----------
it's like yeah I'm gonna get me some


---------107:05----------
chocolate it's a support that part of


---------107:10----------
you cuz that that part of you deserves a


---------107:11----------
seat at the table too and and spend some


---------107:14----------
time painting and notice how you feel


---------107:15----------
about yourself and even if you can't


---------107:18----------
delude yourself or trick yourself into


---------107:20----------
doing it for yourself you can trick


---------107:22----------
yourself into doing it by telling you


---------107:24----------
that you're actually doing it for the


---------107:26----------
child that you're gonna adopt one day


---------107:28----------
yeah right but do this and for people


---------107:33----------
who are at home if you guys are way too


---------107:34----------
indulgent you can do the same exercise


---------107:37----------
with something that is not good I mean


---------107:39----------
that is good for you that you don't


---------107:40----------
enjoy and just pay attention to what


---------107:42----------
happens in yourself but anyway thoughts


---------107:47----------
or questions before we wrap up and eat


---------107:48----------
it know this has been really great thank


---------107:51----------
you for everything yeah it's been an


---------107:53----------
absolute pleasure to talk to someone who


---------107:56----------
is just so aware of their internal


---------107:58----------
environment and and it's been awesome


---------108:02----------
and I think you're just an amazing


---------108:04----------
person it's been a blast talking to you


---------108:08----------
if you want to talk again we can dig


---------108:11----------
into why the [ __ ] this whole


---------108:12----------
relationship thing and what you're


---------108:14----------
afraid of there that's a whole other can


---------108:19----------
of worms but I mean I'd love to help you


---------108:25----------
understand that you deserve to be loved


---------108:27----------
and committed to by a particular person


---------108:29----------
you know like you deserve that too like


---------108:32----------
you deserve to be put first by someone I


---------108:34----------
yeah thank you yeah anyway so it was


---------108:39----------
awesome thank you very much and stay


---------108:42----------
safe you too have a great evening


---------108:45----------
adios oh yeah okay we did meditation


---------108:52----------
okay our


---------108:55----------
so let's think about okay so guys a


---------109:01----------
couple of week app so first of all so I


---------109:05----------
need is amazing and let's remember I


---------109:08----------
want you guys to be careful right


---------109:09----------
because Anita is so positive but like


---------109:11----------
that comes at the cost of herself and


---------109:14----------
that's not something that we want right


---------109:16----------
like we want her to like you know it's


---------109:18----------
just not fair it's not fair that she


---------109:20----------
should sacrifice her own happiness or


---------109:23----------
own wants for the sake of other people


---------109:24----------
is it noble absolutely is it good


---------109:27----------
absolutely is it fair No right so like


---------109:31----------
let's remember that the way the world


---------109:32----------
works is we sacrifice for others and


---------109:38----------
others sacrifice for us that's how the


---------109:40----------
Ottoman Turks so I think that it's


---------109:42----------
amazing what she wants to do but then


---------109:45----------
like we should and she's doing a good


---------109:48----------
job and I think apparently twitch at and


---------109:49----------
has taught her this is taught her how to


---------109:52----------
receive right which is amazing like


---------109:55----------
let's just let's not forget that that's


---------109:57----------
that's awesome that you guys like think


---------109:59----------
about this everyone thinks tweet chat is


---------110:01----------
toxic but y'all aren't toxic right you


---------110:04----------
can be toxic and this comes back to


---------110:06----------
Anita saying can I feel both of them at


---------110:08----------
the same time absolutely there's a toxic


---------110:11----------
[ __ ] in you and there is a wonderful


---------110:13----------
wholesome person in you there's AoE


---------110:16----------
healing and there's AoE damage right


---------110:19----------
that we are both things that she can


---------110:22----------
love her mom and respect her mom and be


---------110:23----------
grateful for her mom and also resent her


---------110:26----------
mom for being incapable right that's


---------110:29----------
what kids do kids blame adults for all


---------110:32----------
kinds of irrational [ __ ] that's how kids


---------110:35----------
operate that's why they're kids they're


---------110:38----------
like we're daddy like why does the Sun


---------110:40----------
have to go down I don't want to go to


---------110:42----------
sleep why can't the Sun stay up forever


---------110:45----------
[ __ ] you dad like that's what kids do


---------110:49----------
but I don't get any of that from her and


---------110:52----------
it's okay to be it's it's there's a


---------110:55----------
difference between being rationally


---------110:57----------
upset with someone and being


---------110:58----------
irrationally upset with someone and like


---------111:01----------
it's okay to be irrationally upset with


---------111:03----------
someone that's what most of being upset


---------111:05----------
is it's irrational it's not logical


---------111:07----------
right so it does


---------111:09----------
have to make sense and you don't have to


---------111:11----------
dismiss it you're allowed to feel the


---------111:13----------
way that you you do even if it's


---------111:15----------
completely incompetent now should you


---------111:18----------
let it dictate all of your actions no


---------111:20----------
but I think this is where I needa gets


---------111:22----------
into trouble is she does let it dictate


---------111:24----------
her actions right she lets the


---------111:26----------
relentless positivity dictator actions


---------111:29----------
she lets the fundamental premise that


---------111:31----------
she is worth worth less than other


---------111:34----------
people dictate her actions and it looks


---------111:37----------
so beautiful on the outside but it's not


---------111:39----------
fair to her right and what's awesome is


---------111:42----------
that twitch at his his talker this like


---------111:44----------
you guys get this you guys got her hat


---------111:46----------
like you guys got her there probably a


---------111:48----------
therapist to his life changing has


---------111:49----------
something to do with it let's be fair


---------111:51----------
but when it comes to people who


---------111:53----------
subscribe to her stuck around or you


---------111:55----------
know sub for like 21 months or whatever


---------111:57----------
like you guys sent her signals that were


---------112:00----------
contrary to her worldview which is that


---------112:02----------
people leave and that people don't have


---------112:05----------
value order that she doesn't have value


---------112:06----------
and and that's amazing so I believe in


---------112:09----------
the the healing power of twitch at and


---------112:11----------
also the absolute toxicity of twitch


---------112:13----------
chat' I know you guys are capable of


---------112:14----------
both that's why I make it makes it fun


---------112:18----------
so listen this has been fantastic I you


---------112:21----------
know it was so interesting because when


---------112:23----------
I when I talked to people who are so


---------112:25----------
capable and so awesome I always struggle


---------112:28----------
with the sense of like whether I can


---------112:30----------
help them in some way not that I need to


---------112:31----------
right but like Anita has come so far but


---------112:34----------
I want her to see that take that next


---------112:36----------
step right I really want her to and and


---------112:39----------
oh wow I needed a thousand dollars Wow


---------112:43----------
thank you very much Anita and yeah I


---------112:48----------
mean I think like this is what we've got


---------112:50----------
to do so this is what we want to do


---------112:51----------
right so this is what we're doing right


---------112:52----------
now is we are we are doing Mental Health


---------112:59----------
Awareness Month and we're gonna help


---------113:01----------
people in the way that we're gonna help


---------113:03----------
people is through our recovery coaching


---------113:04----------
program and what I'm trying to do is


---------113:06----------
teach people to like talk to you guys


---------113:11----------
and help you like figure out what is


---------113:13----------
holding you back because this is crazy


---------113:15----------
and just think about this for a second


---------113:16----------
right I need is such an amazing person


---------113:18----------
and yet she is still holding herself


---------113:20----------
back


---------113:22----------
the way that she's holding herself back


---------113:23----------
is like oh do you guys hear that when I


---------113:25----------
asked her like have you thought about


---------113:26----------
having kids and she has this whole like


---------113:28----------
rational justified response that is in


---------113:31----------
response to something that she feels


---------113:33----------
like I can't have children like there


---------113:35----------
are thousand questions that I want to


---------113:37----------
ask her and at the top of the list is


---------113:39----------
one that I think is incredibly hurtful


---------113:41----------
but I think she's got to explore which


---------113:43----------
is was she'll an unwanted child like


---------113:46----------
what's going on with like her being an


---------113:48----------
unwanted like where does the worst come


---------113:50----------
from it infuriates me that she has to


---------113:52----------
feel that way that she feels that way


---------113:54----------
about herself


---------113:54----------
it's not fair she shouldn't need to feel


---------113:57----------
that way you know I don't know that we


---------113:59----------
can do this but we're gonna try so we're


---------114:00----------
gonna try to train coaches or we have


---------114:02----------
trained coaches and we are actually


---------114:04----------
pretty good I'm understating things so


---------114:06----------
we collected data for eight weeks and we


---------114:09----------
saw that the coaches can actually help


---------114:10----------
people so we're gonna do this right


---------114:12----------
because here's the problem here's what


---------114:13----------
healthy gamer is about she asked me why


---------114:15----------
did I start streaming so I'll tell you


---------114:17----------
guys and this is why we're trying to


---------114:18----------
raise money so if you guys subscribe or


---------114:20----------
donate or whatever like thank you very


---------114:21----------
much this is this is what we're about so


---------114:23----------
two years ago I posted on reddit I said


---------114:26----------
I'm a psychiatrist who's interested in


---------114:29----------
video game addiction ask me anything


---------114:31----------
post hit the front page a lot of great


---------114:33----------
responses and then people started


---------114:35----------
reaching out to me and I was like oh


---------114:36----------
[ __ ] people think like oh this isn't


---------114:38----------
that wonderful that oh like oh you a


---------114:40----------
famous full heart oh my goodness front


---------114:42----------
page oh it's so wonderful I was actually


---------114:44----------
terrified my response was abject terror


---------114:47----------
because what I heard from people over


---------114:50----------
and over and over again is like help me


---------114:51----------
and then I said I can't and then the


---------114:56----------
next person said help me and I said I


---------114:57----------
can't and the next person said help me


---------114:59----------
and I said I can't and that happened


---------115:00----------
like literally a couple of thousand


---------115:02----------
times and then I was like oh [ __ ] there


---------115:05----------
is a huge problem out there and like no


---------115:07----------
one knows amidst ovid going on I want


---------115:09----------
you guys to think about this for a


---------115:10----------
second okay


---------115:11----------
when Kove it happened we tweeted out we


---------115:14----------
said how are you guys dealing with kovat


---------115:16----------
and the response that we got is that


---------115:18----------
it's actually not that bad it's not very


---------115:20----------
different from my regular life and so my


---------115:23----------
first thought was oh that's pretty cool


---------115:24----------
like people are more adaptive towards


---------115:28----------
you know Kovan because they're gamers


---------115:30----------
but then another part of me like jumped


---------115:32----------
up and thought something really horrible


---------115:35----------
the rest of the world is falling apart


---------115:37----------
because they're quarantined and we live


---------115:39----------
like this every single day that Kovac


---------115:43----------
quarantine is a way of life for our


---------115:45----------
generation that is [ __ ] up just think


---------115:48----------
about that for a second it's not that


---------115:50----------
we're more like the fact that we're


---------115:51----------
adapted to Cove it is [ __ ] terrifying


---------115:56----------
right that there's a growing population


---------115:58----------
of people who lives like this day in a


---------116:01----------
day out the rest of the world is [ __ ]


---------116:02----------
falling apart and we're like what the


---------116:04----------
[ __ ] is wrong with you guys just stay at


---------116:06----------
home oh you can't get your nails did


---------116:08----------
like who the [ __ ] cares right but


---------116:12----------
there's a generation of people who lives


---------116:14----------
in quarantine their whole life we heard


---------116:16----------
it from Anita she was a agoraphobic for


---------116:19----------
years right the world is a dangerous


---------116:22----------
place we don't want to live out there


---------116:23----------
and what I heard from people was even


---------116:26----------
more disturbing was that I I went out


---------116:28----------
and I saw a psychiatrist


---------116:29----------
I saw a therapist because that's what


---------116:31----------
everyone says like oh you're you're


---------116:32----------
[ __ ] up go see you psychotics


---------116:35----------
you're ill you have depression it's an


---------116:38----------
illness right it's an illness it's not


---------116:41----------
your fault man it's an illness it's just


---------116:43----------
something's wrong with you like your


---------116:44----------
neuro chemistry's [ __ ] up man it's not


---------116:46----------
your fault


---------116:47----------
you're just something's broken in your


---------116:49----------
brain go and get that fixed and then


---------116:51----------
you'll be fine and they do that they go


---------116:54----------
and they see a psychiatrist psychiatrist


---------116:56----------
talks to them for 45 minutes


---------116:58----------
says yeah you have depression because


---------117:00----------
they check their DSM checklist right we


---------117:02----------
have a checklist of things that okay if


---------117:03----------
you meet five out of nine criteria you


---------117:06----------
have depression sleep change an interest


---------117:09----------
guilt lower energy level concentration


---------117:13----------
appetite sluggish and suicidality if you


---------117:19----------
have five out of nine of those you're


---------117:20----------
depressed and then they give them a pill


---------117:22----------
and they gamer reject lifelong


---------117:27----------
quarantine er goes home and he takes his


---------117:30----------
pill and he says huh I'm fixed I'm cured


---------117:33----------
and then they log on and they play video


---------117:36----------
games and then the next day I'm cured


---------117:39----------
I'm gonna take my pill take their pill


---------117:41----------
every single day and they continue


---------117:42----------
playing their games in


---------117:43----------
changes in their life and then these


---------117:45----------
[ __ ] reach out to me they're like can


---------117:46----------
you help me because you seem to


---------117:48----------
understand something that these other


---------117:50----------
people are saying I'm like oh [ __ ]


---------117:52----------
why did I start streaming on Twitch it's


---------117:54----------
because of oh [ __ ] it's because when


---------117:56----------
Anita was at the meat market as a child


---------117:58----------
she saw a rabbit that was in a cage that


---------118:02----------
was gonna get butchered so she tried to


---------118:04----------
do something about it


---------118:06----------
y'all are my rabbit right I see the rest


---------118:11----------
of the world not doing for us what we


---------118:14----------
need I see a mental health system that


---------118:17----------
is too old the average age of a


---------118:19----------
psychiatrist in America is like 55 too


---------118:23----------
old too slow how long does it take to


---------118:25----------
get an appointment Oh three months do


---------118:27----------
you have three months to waste in a


---------118:29----------
sense yes because you guys aren't [ __ ]


---------118:30----------
doing anything but in a sense no because


---------118:32----------
if you're like a sophomore in college


---------118:33----------
and you get FS for three months your


---------118:35----------
academic career is ruined and it's too


---------118:38----------
expensive right


---------118:42----------
how much does I mean my hourly rate is


---------118:44----------
astronomical and I see a lot of people


---------118:45----------
for free and that's why I urge an


---------118:47----------
astronomical rate but it's expensive


---------118:50----------
health insurance is expensive depending


---------118:52----------
on where you live wait times are super


---------118:53----------
long they'll see you for 12 sessions


---------118:55----------
we've heard horror stories who was it


---------118:57----------
Ingrid a couple of weeks ago for like


---------119:00----------
one week ago told us the story of how


---------119:02----------
she went to see a psychiatrist


---------119:03----------
she was waiting for 45 minutes into her


---------119:06----------
appointment the guy talks to her for


---------119:08----------
five minutes says I can't help you and


---------119:09----------
sends her out the door like what the


---------119:11----------
[ __ ] the mental health system is not


---------119:14----------
meeting our needs right now and it's so


---------119:16----------
much more than just mental illness right


---------119:18----------
there are like so many problems like we


---------119:20----------
don't have forward momentum we we rack


---------119:23----------
up tens of thousands of dollars of debt


---------119:25----------
for jobs that pay us twenty five


---------119:27----------
thousand dollars a year like something


---------119:29----------
is [ __ ] up and and you know I don't I


---------119:33----------
don't necessarily think it's our fault


---------119:35----------
and so what am I gonna do about it what


---------119:39----------
am I gonna do about it right that's the


---------119:41----------
question like what am I gonna do this is


---------119:46----------
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna start


---------119:47----------
streaming on Twitch and then the number


---------119:49----------
of people that ask me for help


---------119:51----------
increased now we get thousands per month


---------119:53----------
asking for help so what the [ __ ] like


---------119:56----------
what am I going to do about that


---------119:57----------
I'm just gonna say like oh I'm sorry I


---------119:58----------
can't help you I only have 24 hours in


---------120:00----------
today that's what I did for a while then


---------120:02----------
I felt bad about myself I was like I


---------120:04----------
have to do something like I can't just


---------120:06----------
say no I'm sorry I can't help you I've


---------120:09----------
got to do something so it's like okay so


---------120:11----------
we're gonna start training people and


---------120:12----------
like can I teach people to help other


---------120:13----------
people that's where our coaching program


---------120:15----------
was born because I don't think that


---------120:18----------
streaming is enough like I know that AoE


---------120:21----------
healing is awesome


---------120:22----------
and I believe that people get healed but


---------120:24----------
it's not enough right we got to do


---------120:26----------
something about it and so this is where


---------120:28----------
our coaching program is born this is why


---------120:30----------
we have a discord this is why we have a


---------120:32----------
community I found out recently this is


---------120:34----------
amazing so I didn't do any of this or


---------120:35----------
mods on discord they deserve a lot of


---------120:38----------
props too so there's like a cleaning


---------120:40----------
hour where people log on to our discord


---------120:43----------
and they cleaned together for an hour we


---------120:45----------
talked about our emotions we talked


---------120:47----------
about our feelings we talked about all


---------120:48----------
this kind of stuff there's a coding


---------120:50----------
workshop there's a book club because


---------120:53----------
here's the thing the world is not gonna


---------120:54----------
help us right we've learned that like


---------120:57----------
it's not gonna help us like the world is


---------121:00----------
not filled with people like Anita if the


---------121:01----------
world was filled with people I can


---------121:02----------
either you guys one need to do [ __ ]


---------121:04----------
because you could sit around and do give


---------121:06----------
life the 10% that you give it right now


---------121:08----------
and Anita will step in and give you guys


---------121:10----------
90% and y'all will be fine but the truth


---------121:13----------
is that they're not going to give you


---------121:14----------
90% I can't give you 90% I can give you


---------121:18----------
20% I can give you 30% it's not fair


---------121:20----------
it's fair it's not fair that it's 50/50


---------121:22----------
it's sad but we're gonna do it and


---------121:25----------
you've got to do it too so you've got to


---------121:27----------
step up you've got to take the time to


---------121:29----------
get help right so that's why we're doing


---------121:31----------
the coaching program and we have way


---------121:33----------
more people that want to be coached then


---------121:35----------
we have capacity right now so we're


---------121:37----------
gonna train more people we've we've had


---------121:40----------
thousands of people who want coaching


---------121:41----------
and not all of them can pay so we're


---------121:43----------
gonna try to make it affordable and


---------121:44----------
that's why we're doing the stream


---------121:46----------
because some of y'all are broke which is


---------121:48----------
fine and we don't want to be an


---------121:50----------
organization that turns people away due


---------121:52----------
to a new probably will because we'd go


---------121:54----------
under in a moment but you know what


---------121:56----------
that's why we're trying to do stuff like


---------121:57----------
this that you know I try to I mean our


---------122:01----------
retreat in 2019 was free I don't know


---------122:04----------
that we can do that again because the


---------122:05----------
retreat may be way bigger this time I


---------122:07----------
don't know when we're gonna do a retreat


---------122:09----------
but it's one of our stretch goals I have


---------122:10----------
you want to do when my whole [ __ ]


---------122:12----------
team is like you can't do this dr. K you


---------122:14----------
can't open your doors to the internet


---------122:15----------
because you don't know who's gonna show


---------122:17----------
up but there's a part of me the troll


---------122:19----------
inside of me is like yes you can yes you


---------122:22----------
can you can do something absolutely


---------122:24----------
crazy because that's what streaming on


---------122:25----------
Twitch is all of my colleagues who are


---------122:28----------
psychiatrist said oh you can't do this


---------122:29----------
you're gonna get sued so I hired some


---------122:33----------
very expensive lawyers and they wrote me


---------122:34----------
a lot of disclaimers and then we'll see


---------122:38----------
so that's what we're doing it's mental


---------122:41----------
health awareness month so become aware


---------122:42----------
of your mental health show up here we're


---------122:45----------
gonna be doing some fun stuff we're


---------122:46----------

---------122:48----------

---------122:50----------

---------122:54----------
