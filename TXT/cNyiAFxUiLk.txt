---------00:00----------
so i suspect that a lot of this person's


---------00:02----------
problems are not due to


---------00:04----------
the low iq this is not what's dooming


---------00:06----------
them


---------00:07----------
they are doomed but


---------00:09----------
what


---------00:10----------
what they're doomed by is their belief


---------00:12----------
of their own success or their inability


---------00:14----------
to become successful


---------00:17----------
my iq is below average


---------00:19----------
what are some of the ways i can live a


---------00:20----------
successful and meaningful life


---------00:23----------
hello dr k i'm a young adult male and


---------00:25----------
i'm currently going through an


---------00:26----------
existential crisis where i believe that


---------00:28----------
i am not going to make it in life


---------00:30----------
i don't have any skills or talents that


---------00:32----------
makes me unique in


---------00:34----------
in the direction of my life is going to


---------00:36----------
a complete disaster the direction of my


---------00:38----------
life is going to a complete disaster and


---------00:40----------
nothing can be done


---------00:42----------
i'm in college studying business that


---------00:44----------
can't get me anywhere


---------00:47----------
uh i'm still living with my parents


---------00:48----------
because i don't have stable income to


---------00:50----------
survive on i can't do basic tasks


---------00:52----------
such as using the cash register at work


---------00:54----------
folding clothes sweeping and cleaning my


---------00:56----------
house


---------00:57----------
there's so many tasks that i can't do


---------00:59----------
right


---------01:00----------
i can't pay attention in my college


---------01:01----------
classes i take longer to understand


---------01:03----------
things more than others and i struggle


---------01:06----------
to think fast


---------01:08----------
it's horrible because my parents


---------01:09----------
constantly put me down and compare me to


---------01:11----------
my peers who are doctors lawyers and


---------01:12----------
software engineers making far more than


---------01:15----------
i do


---------01:16----------
the huge issue that's affecting me is my


---------01:18----------
low iq i took an iq test when i was in


---------01:21----------
school by the psychologist and i scored


---------01:23----------
around 80 which is exactly below average


---------01:26----------
after this the psychologist even felt


---------01:28----------
pity for me and told me to my face that


---------01:30----------
i won't amount to anything in life


---------01:32----------
i swear to god that i am probably the


---------01:34----------
dumbest to walk this earth


---------01:37----------
i am extremely unsure of how i will


---------01:38----------
survive in this world


---------01:40----------
as


---------01:41----------
that if your iq is below 87 you can't


---------01:44----------
work any type of job to survive


---------01:47----------
this seems embarrassing because it's


---------01:48----------
difficult when i want to move out


---------01:51----------
when i want to move out my parents house


---------01:53----------
i'm not financially stable to do it i


---------01:55----------
get depressed every day knowing that i


---------01:57----------
can't prove myself to others my dreams


---------02:00----------
of being a physicist or an investment


---------02:01----------
banker please don't laugh are not going


---------02:03----------
to happen because because of this curse


---------02:06----------
i was thinking about jumping off a


---------02:07----------
building one day because i can't take


---------02:09----------
this anymore


---------02:11----------
so


---------02:11----------
the first point


---------02:13----------
right is if you're really considering if


---------02:15----------
you're having thoughts of hurting


---------02:16----------
yourself or jumping off of a building


---------02:18----------
you may want to actually seek


---------02:20----------
professional help right so like this is


---------02:22----------
something and we'll talk about why that


---------02:23----------
may be particularly important for this


---------02:25----------
person


---------02:27----------
um so what we're gonna actually do is


---------02:29----------
take a step back and and look at


---------02:32----------
let's talk about a couple things okay so


---------02:33----------
we're gonna talk about iq we're going to


---------02:35----------
talk about this person's situation and


---------02:37----------
we're going to talk a little bit about


---------02:39----------
if your iq is below average can you have


---------02:42----------
a successful and meaningful life


---------02:44----------
spoiler alert my answer is going to be


---------02:46----------
yes


---------02:47----------
but it is my job to convince you of that


---------02:50----------
right i'm not necessarily correct


---------02:52----------
it may not be possible so let's just try


---------02:54----------
to be


---------02:55----------
as objective as we can and kind of think


---------02:57----------
through it


---------02:58----------
okay


---------02:59----------
so let's start with this


---------03:02----------
what is a successful and meaningful life


---------03:05----------
how do we define that


---------03:09----------
right so


---------03:10----------
that's the first question is like what


---------03:12----------
is a successful and meaningful life


---------03:16----------
can anyone give me an answer


---------03:18----------
what do you all think


---------03:21----------
how do you determine what a success


---------03:24----------
i i don't know


---------03:27----------
right so okay so like people are sort of


---------03:29----------
saying like let's just think through


---------03:30----------
this right


---------03:32----------
so


---------03:32----------
if your goal is to have a successful and


---------03:34----------
meaningful life which i have i have no


---------03:36----------
you know i think that's wonderful that


---------03:38----------
you want that


---------03:39----------
let's first start by like understanding


---------03:41----------
what it is that you're shooting towards


---------03:44----------
okay so


---------03:47----------
let's think about it okay what


---------03:58----------
is right so like i don't know so people


---------04:01----------
are saying income


---------04:05----------
okay being productive


---------04:08----------
being happy


---------04:11----------
and so this is kind of interesting but


---------04:13----------
like having your needs met


---------04:15----------
excellent


---------04:17----------
right so this all like is good


---------04:18----------
fulfillment


---------04:23----------
but what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna say


---------04:25----------
i'm gonna go ahead and


---------04:27----------
call an audible here and i'm going to


---------04:28----------
move this one up here because then like


---------04:30----------
the next question is like what is


---------04:31----------
fulfillment right


---------04:33----------
chat it's like what does that even mean


---------04:35----------
so now the next question is so if if you


---------04:37----------
want to determine whether you can have a


---------04:38----------
successful or meaningful life the next


---------04:40----------
thing that we need to do is sort of try


---------04:42----------
to figure out


---------04:44----------
what are the things that correlate with


---------04:47----------
uh


---------04:49----------
with this right so then the next


---------04:50----------
question is does iq


---------04:55----------
somehow correlate with these things


---------04:57----------
okay


---------04:58----------
so like i i think we can clearly say


---------05:00----------
that probably like iq and income is


---------05:02----------
going to be like correlated


---------05:05----------
but i don't know that iq and


---------05:07----------
productivity happy or getting your needs


---------05:09----------
met is necessarily correlated maybe


---------05:12----------
because of this we can also say that


---------05:13----------
needs met in terms of financial


---------05:16----------
so maybe your financial needs can be met


---------05:18----------
this way


---------05:20----------
but once again i say this as a


---------05:21----------
psychiatrist who's worked with many many


---------05:23----------
people who are like very narcissistic


---------05:25----------
and very successful ie investment


---------05:27----------
bankers


---------05:28----------
i can pretty much tell you that like you


---------05:30----------
know


---------05:32----------
sure they have the income and they may


---------05:34----------
be sort of productive but they certainly


---------05:36----------
don't feel that way oftentimes they work


---------05:38----------
a lot but they don't really feel


---------05:40----------
productive because all they're doing is


---------05:41----------
editing powerpoints i kid you not like


---------05:44----------
their job is like okay they get a


---------05:46----------
powerpoint at midnight and their you


---------05:48----------
know their


---------05:50----------
partner says hey i need this by 6 a.m


---------05:52----------
make these changes


---------05:53----------
so they spend 6 hours running models


---------05:56----------
making these changes to a 35


---------05:59----------
slide deck


---------06:00----------
and they make the changes and they send


---------06:01----------
it out to the whole team the other


---------06:02----------
partner on the team is says hey


---------06:05----------
these changes are bad i need you to make


---------06:07----------
these changes i needed you to revert


---------06:08----------
back to what we had before


---------06:10----------
and so like it's just like constantly


---------06:12----------
adding editing slide decks to meet the


---------06:15----------
preferences and whims of a particular


---------06:17----------
person


---------06:19----------
so i i certainly will attest to the fact


---------06:21----------
that many of them are not happy they


---------06:23----------
don't feel fulfilled they don't have


---------06:24----------
meaning they certainly have income


---------06:26----------
but they they pay the price of


---------06:28----------
fulfillment success meaning and


---------06:29----------
happiness


---------06:32----------
that's what they pay for money right so


---------06:34----------
that's what they like they get money and


---------06:35----------
then they have


---------06:37----------
they don't have those other things so


---------06:38----------
i'm not really sure that you know aside


---------06:40----------
from income


---------06:41----------
iq is necessarily correlated with like


---------06:44----------
other things


---------06:45----------
so that's the first thing so you may not


---------06:46----------
be screwed in life just because you have


---------06:48----------
a low iq now let's let's kind of also


---------06:51----------
kind of look at things a little bit more


---------06:52----------
objectively and sort of try to


---------06:53----------
understand okay like what's up with iq


---------06:56----------
so here's what what we need to


---------06:58----------
understand about iq


---------06:59----------
so the the mean no sorry


---------07:03----------
mean median iq is about a hundred and


---------07:06----------
one standard deviation which is about 70


---------07:08----------
of people


---------07:09----------
are between 85 and 115 so one standard


---------07:12----------
deviation is about 15. so this is where


---------07:14----------
most people live below 85 we start to


---------07:17----------
get to you know there's about 15 percent


---------07:21----------
that are less than this


---------07:24----------
and 15 over here


---------07:27----------
that are greater than this right


---------07:29----------
and so 80 is like


---------07:31----------
right over here and so even if you're


---------07:32----------
below average on iq


---------07:34----------
it doesn't mean that you're like


---------07:36----------
devastatingly screwed


---------07:38----------
so that you know the number at which we


---------07:40----------
really kind of think about intellectual


---------07:41----------
disability is actually like below 70. so


---------07:44----------
once you cross 70 because remember one


---------07:46----------
standard deviation is 15


---------07:49----------
right so a second standard deviation is


---------07:52----------
70. so this is where you start to get it


---------07:55----------
into the mild intellectual disability


---------07:57----------
range


---------07:58----------
and this is where you may not really be


---------08:00----------
able to


---------08:01----------
uh


---------08:02----------
for example be a physicist i don't know


---------08:04----------
if someone with a iq of less than 70 can


---------08:07----------
be a physicist i just don't know i'm not


---------08:08----------
saying that they can't


---------08:10----------
but in this 70 to 85 range i personally


---------08:14----------
don't think that this person is quite as


---------08:15----------
screwed as they think they are


---------08:18----------
um so you can still like hold a normal


---------08:20----------
job it may take you longer to learn


---------08:22----------
particular things there are lots of


---------08:24----------
different jobs where you don't


---------08:25----------
necessarily need to have a high iq to be


---------08:27----------
successful


---------08:29----------
and so let's kind of flip back to the


---------08:30----------
post for a second and take a look at


---------08:33----------
you know what's going on here so i


---------08:35----------
suspect that a lot of this person's


---------08:36----------
problems are not due to


---------08:39----------
the low iq this is not what's dooming


---------08:41----------
them


---------08:42----------
they are doomed but


---------08:44----------
what what they're doomed by is their


---------08:46----------
belief of their own success or their


---------08:48----------
inability to become successful


---------08:51----------
okay so now we're going to talk a little


---------08:52----------
bit about this so like this person has a


---------08:55----------
problem of


---------08:56----------
if you read this post


---------08:58----------
it can be summarized with this statement


---------09:00----------
i will fail


---------09:01----------
okay so let's just kind of look through


---------09:02----------
this for a second


---------09:04----------
um


---------09:06----------
so i'm currently going through an


---------09:07----------
existential crisis where i believe i am


---------09:09----------
not going to make it in life


---------09:11----------
okay


---------09:12----------
that's the first thing they say not


---------09:14----------
gonna make it


---------09:16----------
okay and then


---------09:18----------
um


---------09:20----------
uh


---------09:21----------
i don't have any skills


---------09:24----------
or talents no skills or talents


---------09:29----------
so they believe this right the direction


---------09:31----------
of my life is complete disaster


---------09:37----------
and um


---------09:38----------
i'm in college studying business that


---------09:40----------
can't get me anywhere not going anywhere


---------09:46----------
right and then i want to fast forward so


---------09:48----------
they're you know they talk about all the


---------09:50----------
things that they have difficulty doing


---------09:52----------
okay so can't perform basic tasks can't


---------09:54----------
do basics


---------09:57----------
um


---------09:58----------
parents constantly put me down


---------10:06----------
okay


---------10:09----------
and then uh


---------10:11----------
can't prove myself so we're gonna jump


---------10:13----------
there's the iq paragraph and then can't


---------10:15----------
prove myself


---------10:19----------
so we're gonna analyze


---------10:21----------
what this person is saying okay and then


---------10:24----------
we're gonna talk about dreams so these


---------10:26----------
are the things that i want you all to


---------10:27----------
take away okay so they're not gonna make


---------10:29----------
it they have no skills or talents their


---------10:31----------
life is a complete disaster they're not


---------10:33----------
going anywhere they can't do basic tasks


---------10:35----------
their parents constantly put them down


---------10:37----------
they can't you can't prove yourself and


---------10:39----------
you have particular dreams


---------10:41----------
so you may say like wow that sounds kind


---------10:43----------
of rough


---------10:44----------
so here here are the points right so


---------10:46----------
this is what is in the post


---------10:48----------
and now we're going to kind of examine


---------10:50----------
it so our examination is going to be


---------10:52----------
here


---------10:56----------
so it starts with this idea that i will


---------10:58----------
fail


---------10:59----------
okay now this is really important


---------11:01----------
because the i will fail idea affects us


---------11:04----------
in two ways


---------11:05----------
so one is it creates something called a


---------11:07----------
nocebo effect so we're going to talk a


---------11:09----------
little bit about psychology and


---------11:13----------
so science


---------11:13----------
is something called the placebo effect


---------11:15----------
which is that if someone believes that a


---------11:17----------
medication will work it is more likely


---------11:19----------
to work so you can even give someone


---------11:21----------
who's got like diabetes let's say a


---------11:23----------
sugar pill the irony and the irony is


---------11:26----------
that if they believe that the medication


---------11:28----------
will lower their blood sugar even though


---------11:30----------
it's a sugar pill if they believe it'll


---------11:32----------
lower their blood sugar it actually


---------11:33----------
lowers their blood sugar some that's


---------11:35----------
called the placebo effect now the


---------11:37----------
opposite end of the placebo effect is


---------11:38----------
called the nocebo effect and i see this


---------11:40----------
a lot in psychiatry


---------11:42----------
so sometimes i'll get people who come


---------11:43----------
into my office and they'll say


---------11:45----------
medication has never worked for me


---------11:47----------
medication does not work


---------11:50----------
so they they're coming into my office


---------11:51----------
with a nocebo effect and even the


---------11:53----------
thought that medication never works for


---------11:56----------
me is going to actually affect


---------11:59----------
the efficacy of medication


---------12:02----------
so if you go through your life thinking


---------12:04----------
you will fail there's actually


---------12:06----------
scientific data to back this up


---------12:09----------
it's not just like a psychological thing


---------12:11----------
it's like it's even like a


---------12:12----------
neuroscientific thing right so this is


---------12:14----------
important to understand that this works


---------12:16----------
for physical medicines so forget about


---------12:18----------
psychology for a second we're talking


---------12:19----------
about diabetes levels cholesterol levels


---------12:22----------
response to chemotherapy and cancer


---------12:24----------
treatment that the nocebo effect is


---------12:26----------
actually active in all divisions of


---------12:28----------
medicine so it's not just psychological


---------12:31----------
it's physiological


---------12:35----------
so what this sort of means is that you


---------12:37----------
actually if you believe you're going to


---------12:39----------
fail you are actually more likely to


---------12:41----------
fail and i don't just mean


---------12:42----------
psychologically it's not like oh i


---------12:44----------
believe i'm going to fail therefore i'm


---------12:45----------
not going to try as hard etc etc i'm not


---------12:47----------
talking about psychological stuff i mean


---------12:48----------
like physiologically your body is


---------12:50----------
prepped to try to create failure


---------12:53----------
so second thing this is going to be a


---------12:54----------
little bit more psychological or


---------12:56----------
neuroscientific has to do with our


---------12:58----------
success calculation


---------13:01----------
so


---------13:02----------
our brain


---------13:03----------
has this circuit that that performs


---------13:06----------
success calculations so it basically


---------13:08----------
performs this calculation that sort of


---------13:11----------
determines motivation and behavior


---------13:14----------
okay so let me give you guys an example


---------13:17----------
so this morning i did not wake up go out


---------13:19----------
to my garage grab a shovel and start


---------13:21----------
digging for buried treasure


---------13:23----------
why did i not do that because my brain


---------13:26----------
performed a calculation that was like


---------13:28----------
hey by the way if you dig for buried


---------13:30----------
treasure you're probably not going to


---------13:32----------
find it so there's no point in trying


---------13:34----------
okay now we also see this kind of


---------13:36----------
motivational stuff happen with people


---------13:38----------
who have difficulty with dating


---------13:40----------
so people who believe that they're going


---------13:42----------
to be alone forever will be not


---------13:44----------
motivated to date or it'll be very


---------13:46----------
difficult for them to date because their


---------13:48----------
brain is literally making a calculation


---------13:50----------
that is like likelihood of success is


---------13:52----------
like a big part of the calculation


---------13:55----------
and so if your likelihood of success is


---------13:57----------
very very low because you you believe


---------13:59----------
you will fail then your motivation is


---------14:01----------
going to like be very very low okay


---------14:04----------
so now


---------14:05----------
what we sort of get is is like


---------14:08----------
a sort of a vicious cycle okay where i


---------14:11----------
will fail we've got the nocibo effect


---------14:13----------
success calculation is low decreased


---------14:14----------
motivation therefore


---------14:17----------
these two things are going to kind of


---------14:19----------
combine


---------14:20----------
and result in a higher percent


---------14:25----------
it's a


---------14:26----------
it's a percent sign just poorly drawn


---------14:28----------
let me try to draw it again


---------14:29----------
an increased percentage of failure


---------14:34----------
right


---------14:34----------
and so the more the more we fail the


---------14:37----------
more we get


---------14:38----------
evidence


---------14:40----------
that


---------14:42----------
i will


---------14:43----------
fail


---------14:44----------
and the stronger this gets this forms a


---------14:46----------
feedback loop


---------14:48----------
goes over here


---------14:52----------
this becomes stronger this becomes


---------14:55----------
stronger this becomes stronger


---------14:57----------
motivation


---------14:59----------
motivation actually goes down so let's


---------15:00----------
actually


---------15:03----------
do this


---------15:04----------
right motivation decreases and then


---------15:07----------
these things in turn are going to


---------15:11----------
increase our chance of failure which


---------15:13----------
will in turn increase the evidence that


---------15:15----------
i will fail which will then go back


---------15:17----------
around and feed into this


---------15:20----------
okay and this is how we see now i want


---------15:23----------
you guys to look at all these statements


---------15:25----------
how do where do you think these


---------15:26----------
statements came from


---------15:27----------
well actually let's stop here for a


---------15:29----------
second


---------15:33----------
okay


---------15:34----------
where did these statements come from


---------15:36----------
these statements come from going through


---------15:38----------
the cycle over and over and over again


---------15:41----------
has nothing to do with iq


---------15:43----------
so like iq may actually result in a


---------15:45----------
greater chance a lot having lower iq may


---------15:47----------
have something to do with a greater


---------15:48----------
chance of failure but this degree of


---------15:51----------
certainty about failure right so if you


---------15:53----------
had a confident person with loc iq and


---------15:56----------
i've met with those people i i mean i i


---------15:58----------
know people like that like i have


---------15:59----------
friends like that


---------16:01----------
you know they just sort of like


---------16:02----------
understand the limits of their ability


---------16:03----------
but they are actually like sort of


---------16:04----------
chilling in life right they're kind of


---------16:06----------
chilling they're like they have their


---------16:07----------
job they're not going to be


---------16:09----------
they're not actually super ambitious or


---------16:11----------
sometimes they actually are super


---------16:12----------
ambitious and can be very very good at


---------16:14----------
stuff


---------16:15----------
um so for example i have a friend who's


---------16:17----------
a chef who probably has like a below


---------16:19----------
average iq they've been tested as well


---------16:21----------
we're going to talk about testing in a


---------16:23----------
second


---------16:24----------
um but


---------16:25----------
you know so they they're they tested


---------16:26----------
below average and they just went to


---------16:27----------
culinary school and they're like they're


---------16:28----------
doing fine in life they're actually like


---------16:30----------
pretty ambitious they're pretty


---------16:31----------
productive they're


---------16:33----------
not happy but for reasons that i think


---------16:35----------
are unrelated to their iq or their


---------16:37----------
professional success so a lot of


---------16:39----------
professions out there that don't require


---------16:40----------
a high iq that you can also still be


---------16:43----------
like very reliable very successful um i


---------16:46----------
think that there are a lot of positions


---------16:47----------
that people with higher iq may find


---------16:49----------
boring


---------16:50----------
that people with lower iq may be better


---------16:52----------
suited for so there may be a certain


---------16:54----------
amount of like you know day in and day


---------16:56----------
out kind of stuff that like organizing


---------16:58----------
stuff like those kinds of things jobs


---------17:00----------
like being a personal assistant there's


---------17:02----------
a lot of stuff out there where people


---------17:03----------
with low iq may be better suited towards


---------17:05----------
now let's remember that this person


---------17:06----------
wants to be a physicist or an investment


---------17:08----------
banker so we don't want to alter their


---------17:10----------
dreams based on hey you can't be a


---------17:11----------
physicist or an investment banker


---------17:14----------
you need to be a personal assistant or a


---------17:16----------
chef like we don't want to say that to


---------17:17----------
this person that's not what i'm saying


---------17:18----------
although i suspect that based on their


---------17:21----------
attitude


---------17:23----------
they are interpreting things that way so


---------17:25----------
like let's look at this


---------17:28----------
after this the psychologist even felt


---------17:30----------
pity for me and told me to my face that


---------17:32----------
i won't amount to anything in life


---------17:34----------
i highly highly highly doubt this


---------17:37----------
statement


---------17:39----------
the psychologist would have to be the


---------17:40----------
worst psychologist on the planet to tell


---------17:43----------
you to your face that i won't amount to


---------17:45----------
anything hey you're not going to amount


---------17:46----------
to anything in life


---------17:48----------
they may have said hey it may be hard


---------17:50----------
for you to become an investment banker


---------17:52----------
or physicist


---------17:53----------
they may have said something like that


---------17:56----------
but


---------17:57----------
given this


---------17:59----------
what the psychologist said may be


---------18:02----------
interpreted in this way


---------18:04----------
given your attitude you may be even


---------18:06----------
interpreted what i said as hey you can


---------18:09----------
never become a physicist or an


---------18:10----------
investment banker which i didn't say


---------18:11----------
that


---------18:13----------
right we may be a great physicist or


---------18:15----------
investment picker i don't know


---------18:17----------
let's finish kind of analyzing this okay


---------18:18----------
so that's where all so these statements


---------18:20----------
come from this cycle


---------18:23----------
and the question is okay so like if this


---------18:24----------
is a cycle where does it


---------18:26----------
start here's where it starts


---------18:30----------
right so if your parents because this is


---------18:33----------
the thing i don't think they just


---------18:34----------
started comparing you to people who are


---------18:36----------
doctors and lawyers like just over the


---------18:39----------
last year


---------18:40----------
chances are as you were growing up your


---------18:42----------
parents started by putting you down a


---------18:45----------
lot they made lots of comparisons they


---------18:47----------
sort of didn't accept you for who you


---------18:49----------
are and wanted you to be something else


---------18:52----------
so as parents


---------18:55----------
parental comparison


---------18:59----------
is where the cycle starts


---------19:01----------
hate to blame the parents so this is


---------19:03----------
just a hypothesis maybe maybe your


---------19:04----------
parents were wonderful who knows i'm not


---------19:07----------
saying they aren't wonderful but if they


---------19:08----------
compare you a lot this is where the kind


---------19:10----------
of cycle starts right because what


---------19:12----------
they're always doing no matter how hard


---------19:14----------
you succeed with parental comparison


---------19:18----------
let's look at it this way okay


---------19:21----------
so they say


---------19:22----------
why can't you okay so they'll say


---------19:26----------
here's you


---------19:29----------
here's someone else


---------19:33----------
so


---------19:34----------
why did you get a c


---------19:36----------
someone else got a b


---------19:38----------
right


---------19:40----------
why can't you be like this person this


---------19:41----------
person gets b's


---------19:43----------
if you get a b


---------19:44----------
what


---------19:45----------
why don't you get an a


---------19:49----------
right


---------19:52----------
why are you studying business


---------19:55----------
this person is pretty med


---------20:02----------
you're a doctor


---------20:03----------
why don't you go to harvard


---------20:07----------
right


---------20:09----------
if you go to harvard


---------20:11----------
why the are you becoming a


---------20:12----------
psychiatrist


---------20:18----------
right it's such a waste of your talents


---------20:22----------
you're too smart to be a psychiatrist


---------20:24----------
you should do something that's more


---------20:25----------
competitive like cardiology


---------20:29----------
my point is that iq


---------20:32----------
doesn't really determine this


---------20:35----------
it's the parental comparison


---------20:39----------
right so the parental comparison is


---------20:41----------
where this starts and no matter


---------20:43----------
what you accomplish


---------20:45----------
they're always comparing you to someone


---------20:47----------
better


---------20:50----------
it doesn't really matter


---------20:52----------
how good you are


---------20:54----------
right


---------20:55----------
like it doesn't matter if parents are


---------20:57----------
going to compare if they're not going to


---------20:59----------
accept you for who you are like they're


---------21:00----------
going to compare you and then the the


---------21:02----------
conclusion from all of this


---------21:04----------
is you're


---------21:06----------
not


---------21:08----------
good enough


---------21:11----------
and then it's a it's a very short hop


---------21:13----------
skip and a jump


---------21:14----------
to


---------21:16----------
you


---------21:18----------
will


---------21:19----------
fail


---------21:20----------
and thus the cycle begins


---------21:23----------
okay


---------21:25----------
so this is the kind of thing where i


---------21:26----------
think that what's holding this person


---------21:27----------
back is not actually their iq although


---------21:30----------
i'm not disputing that you know i don't


---------21:32----------
know that like


---------21:34----------
someone within 80 iq i don't know


---------21:37----------
their ability to become a physicist i i


---------21:39----------
just don't know


---------21:40----------
but what i do think may be very very


---------21:42----------
possible is for example if you love


---------21:45----------
physics and like you understand physics


---------21:47----------
like let's say that


---------21:49----------
how can i say this


---------21:51----------
sometimes the worst students make the


---------21:53----------
best teachers


---------21:55----------
so like i


---------21:57----------
if it's hard for you to understand


---------21:58----------
things and you can get to that place of


---------22:00----------
understanding


---------22:03----------
you may actually be a far better teacher


---------22:05----------
than someone with a very high iq and the


---------22:07----------
reason for that is because people with


---------22:09----------
the high iq can just they can skip all


---------22:12----------
the middle steps but if you've got a low


---------22:15----------
iq you may learn things slower but you


---------22:17----------
learn things you learn all the middle


---------22:18----------
steps and you may actually be a better


---------22:21----------
teacher


---------22:22----------
so i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------22:24----------
like the reason that i'm really good at


---------22:25----------
teaching motivation


---------22:27----------
and understanding motivation is because


---------22:28----------
i suck at it


---------22:30----------
like my internal motivational drive is


---------22:32----------
very very low and oddly enough that's


---------22:35----------
actually like an advantage in a bizarre


---------22:36----------
situation


---------22:38----------
right because like now i understand like


---------22:40----------
i couldn't take motivation for granted


---------22:42----------
it wasn't easy for me it was so hard all


---------22:44----------
the time


---------22:45----------
and so that's what actually makes me


---------22:47----------
like an effective teacher on motivation


---------22:48----------
because i can't take any of it for


---------22:50----------
granted i'm just assuming for a moment


---------22:52----------
that i'm an effective teacher on


---------22:53----------
meditation motivation which i may not be


---------22:57----------
so the last thing that i want to point


---------22:59----------
out is the statement of can't prove


---------23:00----------
myself so if you want to understand


---------23:04----------
what leads you to being fulfilled


---------23:08----------
and meaning


---------23:09----------
if you're trying to prove yourself


---------23:14----------
to other people


---------23:17----------
this is never going to happen


---------23:20----------
so if you want to understand like okay


---------23:22----------
how do you become successful


---------23:24----------
here's what it is you start by


---------23:26----------
understanding okay like here's my iq


---------23:29----------
totally fine


---------23:30----------
you understand what are the things


---------23:32----------
outside of my iq that are holding me


---------23:33----------
back because it's not just iq right it's


---------23:36----------
this belief that you're going to fail to


---------23:38----------
understand okay this belief came from


---------23:40----------
somewhere so this is something that you


---------23:41----------
may want to work with a therapist right


---------23:43----------
not only for the suicidality but also


---------23:45----------
like for this kind of stuff like i'm not


---------23:46----------
saying go to a therapist just so you


---------23:48----------
don't kill yourself i'm saying go to a


---------23:50----------
therapist because first of all suicide


---------23:52----------
is scary and you shouldn't kill yourself


---------23:54----------
and the reason you shouldn't kill


---------23:55----------
yourself is because i don't agree with


---------23:56----------
this premise and a therapist can help


---------23:59----------
you


---------24:00----------
change this


---------24:03----------
they can help you


---------24:07----------
do this


---------24:09----------
and then suddenly all of this changes


---------24:12----------
right then you're


---------24:13----------
harnessing


---------24:14----------
placebo


---------24:17----------
instead of nocebo


---------24:19----------
and then suddenly like things that even


---------24:21----------
have no biological effect


---------24:23----------
are starting to work for you


---------24:25----------
so you can absolutely do that


---------24:27----------
the other thing that i just want to


---------24:28----------
point out is iq tests i don't know


---------24:30----------
exactly what the reliability of the iq


---------24:32----------
test is but if you're at 80 and you got


---------24:35----------
tested once you know you need to be a


---------24:37----------
little bit careful because i do believe


---------24:38----------
that iq tests are affected or confounded


---------24:42----------
by different things like mood


---------24:44----------
or you know stuff like depression


---------24:47----------
so depending on when you took it there


---------24:49----------
may be like things that negatively


---------24:50----------
impact the reliability of the iq test


---------24:53----------
so i also don't know like what the


---------24:55----------
reliability between two tests is


---------24:57----------
so for example like you know tests just


---------25:00----------
have different light reliability so if i


---------25:02----------
if you get tested twice


---------25:04----------
you may


---------25:05----------
discover that you're actually like


---------25:07----------
90 the second time right there's


---------25:09----------
probably some amount of like


---------25:11----------
movement in terms of reliability now


---------25:13----------
generally speaking iq tests should


---------25:15----------
control for things like age


---------25:17----------
or um


---------25:19----------
or like


---------25:21----------
level of education i think they try to


---------25:22----------
control for those things but there may


---------25:24----------
be confounding variables so i don't you


---------25:26----------
know i don't know how to say this but


---------25:27----------
like an iq test is not like a biopsy


---------25:29----------
right it's a test that tries to


---------25:31----------
approximate your intelligence


---------25:33----------
the last thing is that iq tests don't


---------25:35----------
really look at eq


---------25:37----------
so there are some people that i know for


---------25:38----------
example that are like average or even


---------25:40----------
below average iq but are actually super


---------25:43----------
high in the eq


---------25:45----------
domain and this could be you you never


---------25:47----------
know and if you're high in the eq domain


---------25:49----------
you can actually be very very successful


---------25:51----------
and offer a lot of value to


---------25:53----------
places so a good example of this is kind


---------25:55----------
of interesting but if you look at


---------25:56----------
investment banking


---------25:59----------
the people who are actually at the top i


---------26:02----------
think have an eq greater than iq


---------26:05----------
situation so the people who are have the


---------26:07----------
highest iq or the ones that are best


---------26:10----------
at running models creating models doing


---------26:12----------
a lot of like the technical work


---------26:14----------
but actually if you want to really


---------26:16----------
succeed at the highest levels of


---------26:17----------
investment banking it's about


---------26:19----------
relationships and relationship building


---------26:21----------
it's about bringing the business in the


---------26:22----------
door so iq is necessary for executing


---------26:25----------
the business eq is necessary for


---------26:28----------
bringing the business in the door


---------26:33----------
okay so you may not be screwed


---------26:39----------
last thing is that you know i'd say that


---------26:41----------
if you're thinking about


---------26:42----------
the dreams right so this person dreams


---------26:44----------
of being a physicist or an investment


---------26:45----------
banker which is totally fine you're


---------26:47----------
allowed to have your dreams but i would


---------26:48----------
be really


---------26:50----------
curious


---------26:51----------
like i'm asking i'm telling you to be


---------26:53----------
curious


---------26:54----------
about where that dream comes from what


---------26:56----------
is it like because like what do you know


---------26:58----------
about investment banking or being a


---------26:59----------
physicist why does that appeal to you


---------27:01----------
why is that your dream and chances are


---------27:03----------
you have a particular vision of what


---------27:06----------
that looks like which may not actually


---------27:08----------
be a physicist or investment banker but


---------27:10----------
once you understand what appeals to you


---------27:12----------
about the investment banker or being a


---------27:14----------
physicist


---------27:15----------
you may be able to duplicate or satisfy


---------27:18----------
those needs in an alternate profession


---------27:20----------
so a lot of people will have fantasies


---------27:22----------
of like oh i want to be this because if


---------27:24----------
i am this then i will be happy but what


---------27:27----------
they're really chasing is what they


---------27:29----------
think that thing is


---------27:31----------
so we see this a lot in terms of like


---------27:33----------
relationships too where sometimes you'll


---------27:35----------
have like a vision of a person and


---------27:36----------
you'll be like oh i really want to love


---------27:38----------
that i want to be dating that person but


---------27:40----------
you don't really know who that person is


---------27:42----------
and reality is very different from what


---------27:45----------
fantasy you create in your mind so it's


---------27:46----------
okay to have dreams i'm not saying


---------27:48----------
abandon your dreams because you tested


---------27:51----------
low on your iq by all means go for it


---------27:54----------
like if you want to study business like


---------27:55----------
study business and then apply for a job


---------27:57----------
in an investment bank by all means go


---------27:58----------
for it but i'd also like encourage you


---------28:00----------
to be curious about what does it mean to


---------28:02----------
you to be in investment banking what is


---------28:04----------
it what is the kind of how would that


---------28:05----------
fulfill you and once you understand what


---------28:07----------
that need is you may be able to fulfill


---------28:10----------
it outside of investment banking which


---------28:11----------
is how you get meaning and fulfillment


---------28:24----------
you
