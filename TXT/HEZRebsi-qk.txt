---------00:00----------
seriously it's a very hard line to walk


---------00:02----------
as a as a mental health professional in


---------00:04----------
terms of like what do you hold people


---------00:05----------
accountable for and what do you like


---------00:07----------
give people a pass on welcome to day


---------00:09----------
three


---------00:10----------
of the goal setting and motivation


---------00:13----------
curriculum for healthy gamer coaches so


---------00:16----------
let's start by


---------00:18----------
kind of recapping what we covered so far


---------00:20----------
so day one was an introduction and we


---------00:22----------
sort of talked a little bit about our


---------00:24----------
model of um how we approach goal setting


---------00:27----------
and motivation and the crux of it is


---------00:29----------
that so the key points of like goal


---------00:31----------
setting and motivation is that generally


---------00:33----------
speaking


---------00:34----------
there's an abundance of information


---------00:36----------
about like how to become motivated


---------00:38----------
available to people but that access to


---------00:41----------
that information does not actually like


---------00:43----------
catalyze behavioral change right there


---------00:45----------
are so many youtube videos about


---------00:46----------
motivation and yet everyone is not out


---------00:49----------
there you know crushing it day after day


---------00:52----------
after day after day and so why is that


---------00:54----------
there are many reasons for that we


---------00:56----------
explored a couple of different things


---------00:57----------
but you know the biggest reason that


---------00:59----------
i've sort of discovered is that


---------01:01----------
motivation is not like a monolithic


---------01:03----------
thing it's not like a binary thing where


---------01:05----------
you have motivation or you don't have


---------01:06----------
motivation that that if you look at


---------01:08----------
human beings engaging in behavior there


---------01:10----------
are three discrete


---------01:12----------
parts of that the first is the intent


---------01:16----------
and so like why they want to do the


---------01:18----------
thing the second is the resistance so


---------01:20----------
when i try to do something like


---------01:22----------
something is going to get in the way


---------01:24----------
right so if i need to study and i don't


---------01:26----------
feel like it like i don't feel like it


---------01:29----------
is actually like a sign of something


---------01:31----------
going on in my mind


---------01:33----------
so there's intent there's resistance and


---------01:35----------
there's the actual action


---------01:37----------
and so we sort of shared this model with


---------01:39----------
you because


---------01:40----------
it's our belief at healthygamer that


---------01:42----------
good diagnosis precedes good treatment


---------01:43----------
we're not really diagnosing anything


---------01:45----------
medical here but i think that's just a


---------01:47----------
way of sort of sharing this principle


---------01:48----------
that you have to understand a problem


---------01:50----------
before you can fix it and so a big


---------01:52----------
problem that i notice when you look at


---------01:54----------
things like the internet is everyone


---------01:56----------
talks about how to fix motivation right


---------01:59----------
they everyone offers solutions but what


---------02:01----------
they don't do is like tailor those


---------02:04----------
solutions to your specific problems


---------02:06----------
so as a coach the real value add in your


---------02:09----------
mission your dharma


---------02:11----------
is to help clients figure out like why


---------02:14----------
aren't they motivated like where's the


---------02:16----------
actual problem so that you can leverage


---------02:18----------
some degree of like understanding and


---------02:19----------
fixing


---------02:20----------
it second day we talked about intent


---------02:23----------
right so intent


---------02:25----------
is a really really important piece that


---------02:28----------
people will set goals for themselves and


---------02:30----------
the reason that they don't meet those


---------02:31----------
goals is because internally like who


---------02:33----------
they are doesn't really align with the


---------02:35----------
goal that they set so we sort of


---------02:37----------
discovered that when i you know when i


---------02:39----------
say to myself i want to do something or


---------02:41----------
this is a goal that i have to set for


---------02:43----------
myself that that goal can come from any


---------02:46----------
number of or four different places


---------02:49----------
within myself


---------02:50----------
it can be a desire and desires are born


---------02:53----------
of the indriyas or the sense organs so


---------02:55----------
what i mean by this is like if i want to


---------02:57----------
play a video game like you know i don't


---------02:59----------
know that people in 1200


---------03:02----------
ce like 800 years ago really cared about


---------03:07----------
the launch of wow classic


---------03:09----------
i don't think that they had any desire


---------03:12----------
to play wow classic and i know it sounds


---------03:14----------
kind of silly like duh so then if you


---------03:16----------
think about it where does the desire to


---------03:17----------
play wow classic comes from it comes


---------03:20----------
from a sensory experience that gives you


---------03:22----------
the idea oh look there's wow classic so


---------03:25----------
a desire comes from a sensory experience


---------03:28----------
or the memory of a sensory experience


---------03:30----------
another good example of this is when i'm


---------03:32----------
walking down the street and i smell like


---------03:34----------
you know someone cooking something it


---------03:35----------
can be like oh wow that smells amazing


---------03:37----------
now i want to eat it


---------03:39----------
so that's a desire


---------03:40----------
so a lot of times what will happen is


---------03:42----------
our our clients will have goals based on


---------03:44----------
seeing what other people are doing


---------03:46----------
they're like oh look at that person on


---------03:47----------
instagram they are so happy i wish i had


---------03:50----------
that as well they'll read about things


---------03:52----------
on the internet oh like look at this


---------03:53----------
person is like so happy i wish i had


---------03:56----------
that as well so those are desires the


---------03:58----------
next thing that tends to drive a lot of


---------04:00----------
people is the idea of should so they


---------04:02----------
have this like preconceived notion based


---------04:04----------
on once again observation of the


---------04:06----------
external world or different kinds of


---------04:08----------
pressures or societal constraints


---------04:10----------
um that will sort of tell them what they


---------04:12----------
should be and they they strive to be


---------04:14----------
that thing it's not what they want to be


---------04:16----------
and i'm not talking about desire


---------04:18----------
um it's not actually something that they


---------04:20----------
care about or value it's something that


---------04:21----------
society or their environment is telling


---------04:24----------
them that they should do and that can


---------04:26----------
actually work for driving behavior


---------04:27----------
sometimes right so


---------04:29----------
as the desperation of


---------04:31----------
not failing out of college i shouldn't


---------04:33----------
fail out of college and as that kind of


---------04:35----------
emotional energy builds up and i hit


---------04:37----------
that last minute panic i can actually


---------04:39----------
study because i should be studying right


---------04:41----------
now and so there are ways that shoulds


---------04:43----------
can drive behaviors but what we really


---------04:45----------
discover is that sustained progress


---------04:48----------
towards your goals


---------04:49----------
tends to happen when people align their


---------04:52----------
goals with like internally what feels


---------04:55----------
good to them


---------04:56----------
and those are their values and their


---------04:58----------
duties


---------04:59----------
so these are the things that you owe


---------05:00----------
people that you feel obliged to do like


---------05:02----------
in service of your duty and the cool


---------05:05----------
thing about duty is that generally


---------05:06----------
speaking


---------05:08----------
negative things


---------05:10----------
will prevent us from engaging in a


---------05:12----------
behavior unless it's aligned with duty


---------05:15----------
so when something is hard and i want it


---------05:18----------
i won't actually do it but when


---------05:20----------
something is hard and it's my duty to do


---------05:22----------
it i will do it so this is a really


---------05:25----------
fundamental thing about human behavior


---------05:27----------
that generally speaking negative things


---------05:29----------
will will prevent us from engaging in a


---------05:32----------
behavior unless it's aligned with a duty


---------05:35----------
and then somehow something weird and


---------05:36----------
magical happens and this is sort of the


---------05:38----------
paradoxical uh raising awareness of the


---------05:41----------
negative this is how this kind of plays


---------05:42----------
in that when you kind of acknowledge the


---------05:44----------
negative if it's kind of aligned with


---------05:46----------
your duty it can actually drive people


---------05:48----------
to do it and you'll kind of recognize


---------05:50----------
this we see like negative manifestations


---------05:52----------
of this in the world


---------05:54----------
when we sort of like think about people


---------05:56----------
who have martyr complexes right so these


---------05:58----------
are people who like because of the


---------06:00----------
martyr complex like they're willing to


---------06:03----------
they view themselves as a martyr and


---------06:04----------
that really drives their behavior right


---------06:06----------
i'm willing to take one for the team i'm


---------06:08----------
willing to be a martyr and and even the


---------06:10----------
idea of martyr is someone who like dies


---------06:12----------
for a cause right so something really


---------06:15----------
really powerful there that has existed


---------06:17----------
within like humanity for thousands of


---------06:20----------
years that something about like i was


---------06:23----------
reading about a monk for example who


---------06:25----------
like apparently like did some kind of


---------06:26----------
self-immolation is political activism


---------06:29----------
and if you kind of think about that like


---------06:31----------
that's absolutely insane right what


---------06:33----------
would drive someone to put themselves


---------06:35----------
through so much public


---------06:37----------
suffering and like so much intense


---------06:38----------
suffering


---------06:39----------
and and it's like it's because they did


---------06:41----------
it for a reason


---------06:43----------
so you know we would definitely don't


---------06:45----------
self-immolate yourself you know like


---------06:47----------
that's a terrible idea but as coaches


---------06:49----------
what we can actually help people do


---------06:51----------
is align their goals with their duties


---------06:54----------
and their values and the cool thing


---------06:56----------
about that is once you help people move


---------06:58----------
from like one of those quadrants to the


---------07:01----------
the next quadrant


---------07:02----------
what you'll see is like an increase in


---------07:05----------
motivation and people actually being


---------07:07----------
able to not be held back by negative


---------07:10----------
things


---------07:11----------
so we talked about the four you know the


---------07:13----------
the model of four different intents we


---------07:15----------
talked about conflict between these


---------07:17----------
different boxes and this is what


---------07:19----------
ambivalence is right so ambivalence is


---------07:21----------
like yeah i don't want to play this


---------07:24----------
video game today but i do


---------07:26----------
so anytime people are stuck in clients


---------07:28----------
are stuck they're not stuck


---------07:31----------
for no reason they're stuck because they


---------07:33----------
have a goal that has a positive you know


---------07:35----------
thing it's like yeah like i absolutely


---------07:37----------
want a yacht that would be awesome if i


---------07:39----------
had a yacht like that would be great


---------07:41----------
it's all upside the reason i don't go


---------07:43----------
out and get a yacht is because there's


---------07:45----------
actually a downside and generally


---------07:46----------
speaking for our clients this downside


---------07:48----------
is a little bit of a blind spot so as a


---------07:51----------
coach what our goal is going to be is to


---------07:52----------
like elevate this conflict to their


---------07:54----------
conscious mind help them work through it


---------07:57----------
use evidence-based techniques like


---------07:58----------
motivational interviewing to help them


---------08:00----------
get past some of their hurdles and then


---------08:02----------
ideally like help them move in the right


---------08:04----------
be


---------08:05----------
right direction by clarifying their


---------08:06----------
intent


---------08:08----------
any questions about that


---------08:13----------
okay


---------08:14----------
so now what we're gonna do is talk about


---------08:17----------
resistance so remember that um


---------08:20----------
when we kind of think a little bit about


---------08:22----------
our equation of motivation and how to


---------08:24----------
motivate people it starts


---------08:29----------
make sure that this is fixed


---------08:31----------
this over here and i got a


---------08:34----------
screen share with y'all


---------08:38----------
okay


---------08:39----------
then i gotta switch to this we good can


---------08:41----------
everybody see now


---------08:44----------
okay


---------08:45----------
so this is intent


---------08:48----------
this is resistance


---------08:52----------
and then this is action


---------08:55----------
so this is the first thing the first


---------08:58----------
reason why resistance is important


---------09:00----------
so clients will come to us and we'll say


---------09:02----------
i know what i need to do i just can't do


---------09:04----------
it like i'm i'm too lazy like they'll


---------09:06----------
look at the action over here and then


---------09:08----------
they'll use terms like lazy


---------09:10----------
or undisciplined


---------09:14----------
or unmotivated


---------09:16----------
but these are all umbrella terms they're


---------09:17----------
not like precise things that are


---------09:20----------
happening within us right so like even


---------09:24----------
if i'm lazy i may study for a test on


---------09:26----------
one day and i won't study for a test


---------09:29----------
on a different day


---------09:31----------
so it's kind of interesting because


---------09:32----------
behavior isn't consistent and so what


---------09:34----------
happens is like people come up with


---------09:36----------
these terms because they


---------09:38----------
look at their insides and they struggle


---------09:40----------
to do something and they look at someone


---------09:42----------
else's outsides they observe someone


---------09:44----------
else's external behavior without


---------09:46----------
understanding their internal conflict


---------09:48----------
and then they compare their insights to


---------09:50----------
other people's outsides and they they


---------09:52----------
end up with these terms lazy


---------09:54----------
undisciplined unmotivated


---------09:55----------
since these are umbrella terms and not


---------09:57----------
real things


---------09:59----------
what what that sort of means is that


---------10:01----------
they're they're defining their problem


---------10:03----------
in a way that is unactionable right


---------10:05----------
because like what do you do if you're


---------10:07----------
born with the lazy trait you just suck


---------10:09----------
so there are you know there is evidence


---------10:11----------
for example that based on the five


---------10:13----------
factor personality model that some


---------10:14----------
people are more conscientious than other


---------10:16----------
people so we're not saying that this is


---------10:18----------
um that there is


---------10:20----------
there's no such thing as lazy but i


---------10:23----------
would say that for ninety percent of the


---------10:24----------
clients that i've worked with who


---------10:26----------
describe themselves as lazy maybe even


---------10:28----------
more than that


---------10:29----------
it's not that they're lazy or


---------10:30----------
unmotivated it's that their motivation


---------10:32----------
is in a different direction from where


---------10:34----------
they want it to be and there's a process


---------10:37----------
that like you know you can use to sort


---------10:39----------
of uncover someone's motivation uncover


---------10:42----------
someone's discipline and like help them


---------10:44----------
be less lazy


---------10:46----------
so what really gets in the way is


---------10:48----------
resistance okay so what's y'all's


---------10:51----------
experience of like resistance with a


---------10:53----------
client do you guys like know what that


---------10:55----------
means


---------10:58----------
like how would you know if a client is


---------11:00----------
resistant what kind of stuff would you


---------11:02----------
hear them say


---------11:07----------
very good so let's start with the signs


---------11:10----------
of resistance how do we detect


---------11:12----------
resistance i want to


---------11:16----------
comma but dot dot dot


---------11:21----------
what else


---------11:25----------
how do you detect resistance in a client


---------11:29----------
it's hard


---------11:31----------
excellent what else


---------11:35----------
i can't


---------11:36----------
very good


---------11:38----------
i can't


---------11:39----------
what else


---------11:42----------
very good i'm not that


---------11:48----------
what else


---------11:51----------
oh it's not possible


---------11:53----------
very good


---------11:57----------
what else


---------12:00----------
i don't know how very good


---------12:07----------
what else


---------12:12----------
i don't know if this like it's but


---------12:14----------
sometimes you can see it on my face it's


---------12:16----------
like


---------12:17----------
i don't know


---------12:19----------
great great


---------12:20----------
okay


---------12:21----------
yeah so let's that's excellent so


---------12:25----------
let's think about so then you kind of


---------12:27----------
ask like what's that a right so what do


---------12:29----------
you think what else y'all are doing


---------12:30----------
fantastic by the way


---------12:31----------
hello


---------12:33----------
hello


---------12:34----------
um


---------12:39----------
oh no sorry streamlabs was muted


---------12:43----------
okay


---------12:45----------
it's unmuted now


---------12:49----------
let me uh coaches can you have a call oh


---------12:51----------
i understand what's going on now


---------12:54----------
no they're fine it's because


---------12:56----------
they're picking up stream labs is


---------12:58----------
picking up my speakers


---------13:01----------
oh like they're just like not


---------13:03----------
okay


---------13:04----------
i i think i figured it out should be


---------13:06----------
fine now


---------13:09----------
can i say something test okay one two


---------13:12----------
three it's not possible


---------13:16----------
great we good


---------13:18----------
okay


---------13:21----------
okay so i'll give you all a couple


---------13:23----------
others okay there's no point


---------13:28----------
and then we get to some subtle ones


---------13:30----------
it won't be enough


---------13:35----------
okay


---------13:37----------
it'll be a waste of time


---------13:44----------
if it doesn't work


---------13:50----------
how do i know


---------13:53----------
it'll work


---------13:59----------
you all see this


---------14:03----------
uh another one so you said i


---------14:05----------
i can't but i think another kind of


---------14:07----------
manifestation of this is like


---------14:10----------
i'm different


---------14:14----------
from other people


---------14:17----------
with this problem


---------14:20----------
you all heard that one


---------14:23----------
like other people may be able to fix


---------14:24----------
this but i can't


---------14:26----------
because i'm different


---------14:28----------
so let's kind of think about


---------14:31----------
so let's actually start by kind of


---------14:32----------
outlining today so here's you know our


---------14:34----------
first thing is to remind us of our


---------14:36----------
general model the second thing we're


---------14:38----------
going to talk about is signs of


---------14:39----------
resistance which we've just done


---------14:41----------
so like you know there's something


---------14:42----------
that's driving this statement the third


---------14:44----------
thing that we're going to do is try to


---------14:45----------
figure out where does this resistance


---------14:47----------
come from so what's the origin of


---------14:49----------
resistance


---------14:50----------
um and then as we sort of highlight the


---------14:52----------
different origins of resistance so it's


---------14:54----------
going to be manas


---------14:56----------
ahamkar


---------15:01----------
okay


---------15:02----------
then we're gonna sort of teach y'all a


---------15:04----------
little bit about how to manage


---------15:07----------
these different things so how do we fix


---------15:09----------
these problems in people


---------15:11----------
okay so coach interventions


---------15:14----------
and remember that the the key goal of


---------15:16----------
this this kind of curriculum and this


---------15:18----------
teaching is not necessarily to give you


---------15:20----------
all techniques you'll always certainly


---------15:22----------
see those in the manuals and stuff i


---------15:24----------
think this kind of explicit knowledge


---------15:25----------
can certainly be useful right so once


---------15:28----------
you all know what resistance looks like


---------15:30----------
explicitly it'll help you pick it up


---------15:31----------
more easily


---------15:33----------
but to help you develop a good


---------15:35----------
theoretical framework so that when


---------15:36----------
someone comes in with a unique problem


---------15:38----------
that we haven't prepped you for you


---------15:40----------
understand the principles of the game


---------15:43----------
okay


---------15:44----------
and so the other key thing to remember


---------15:47----------
here is that i would say that


---------15:49----------
resistance is the most important


---------15:52----------
contribution that you can make


---------15:54----------
like clients are pretty good i think


---------15:56----------
clients can be good at figuring out


---------15:58----------
their own intents you can use uh


---------16:00----------
processes like journaling and stuff like


---------16:02----------
that to figure out your own intent


---------16:04----------
you can even use like tips like action


---------16:06----------
planning and like tips for you know how


---------16:08----------
to set appropriate goals i think those


---------16:10----------
are pretty um you know accessible for


---------16:12----------
self work


---------16:14----------
part of the reason that we emphasize


---------16:16----------
resistance so much for coaches is


---------16:18----------
because this is the thing that it's the


---------16:19----------
hardest for clients to do on their own


---------16:22----------
and the reason for that is this is what


---------16:24----------
their thought process manifests as


---------16:27----------
but this is not the problem right this


---------16:29----------
is the manifestation of the resistance


---------16:31----------
which is actually coming from these


---------16:33----------
three things


---------16:34----------
so i'd say resistance is the biggest


---------16:36----------
blind spot for our clients and therefore


---------16:39----------
you are the best at sort of fixing it


---------16:41----------
so let me ask you all something have you


---------16:43----------
all ever tried to play chess against


---------16:45----------
yourself


---------16:50----------
yes


---------16:51----------
yeah how does that work super difficult


---------16:54----------
what's hard about playing chess against


---------16:56----------
yourself


---------16:57----------
because you know the other players moves


---------16:59----------
exactly right so like how much can you


---------17:01----------
learn how much can you discover new


---------17:03----------
things about playing chess through


---------17:05----------
playing chess against yourself versus


---------17:07----------
playing against a different person


---------17:12----------
you're limited by your own perspective


---------17:15----------
so it's really hard to discover anything


---------17:17----------
new


---------17:18----------
and this is why


---------17:20----------
coaching like so this is why the main


---------17:22----------
value ad you have is in resistance


---------17:25----------
because you can sort of figure out


---------17:27----------
intent on your own you can figure out


---------17:29----------
actions and goal setting on your own


---------17:31----------
but


---------17:32----------
discovering your own resistance is like


---------17:35----------
playing a game of chess against yourself


---------17:37----------
because it's the same mind that's in


---------17:38----------
conflict you guys get that there's like


---------17:40----------
if we look at the resistance i want this


---------17:42----------
right that's me being white in terms of


---------17:44----------
the chess pieces right so that's me


---------17:45----------
playing on the white side of the board


---------17:47----------
and then there's the black side of the


---------17:48----------
board but the second i spin that that


---------17:50----------
chess board around and start playing


---------17:52----------
from the opposing viewpoint it's


---------17:53----------
actually one mind that's like generating


---------17:56----------
both of the move sets so discovery


---------17:58----------
becomes very very hard and like tricking


---------18:00----------
yourself


---------18:01----------
in chess is like really hard because you


---------18:03----------
know exactly what the other person's


---------18:04----------
thinking all of the thoughts are coming


---------18:06----------
from the same place so it's very hard to


---------18:08----------
make a discovery


---------18:10----------
so if y'all take nothing else away from


---------18:12----------
the training really try to focus on


---------18:14----------
today


---------18:15----------
in the importance of today because as


---------18:17----------
coaches the whole point is that you are


---------18:19----------
able to recognize your clients blind


---------18:22----------
spots you're able to decipher these


---------18:24----------
things which they're not going to be


---------18:25----------
able to decipher within themselves and


---------18:28----------
part of this is you know there's good


---------18:29----------
science behind this as well so these


---------18:31----------
also include things like cognitive


---------18:32----------
biases


---------18:34----------
right so this also includes things like


---------18:37----------
schemas from cognitive behavioral


---------18:39----------
therapy


---------18:40----------
um so like i'm different from other


---------18:43----------
people is a cognitive bias


---------18:45----------
i can't is a cognitive bias there's no


---------18:48----------
point is a cognitive bias and it's


---------18:50----------
really hard for human beings to see


---------18:52----------
their own cognitive biases they may be


---------18:54----------
able to see them after a fashion but


---------18:56----------
it's not really like


---------18:59----------
it's not a true sight i don't know how


---------19:01----------
else to put this like you know when


---------19:02----------
you're when you're playing chess against


---------19:04----------
yourself and you do something sneaky


---------19:06----------
you can even tell yourself in your mind


---------19:08----------
i'm gonna pretend like i don't know what


---------19:10----------
the other half of me is doing have you


---------19:12----------
all ever done that when you play chess


---------19:13----------
against yourselves like you're gonna


---------19:15----------
pretend


---------19:16----------
right you're gonna be like okay like i'm


---------19:18----------
not gonna detect that right away because


---------19:20----------
if i was playing white in this situation


---------19:22----------
i wouldn't see what black was trying to


---------19:24----------
do


---------19:25----------
so i'm going to like let black i'm going


---------19:27----------
to kind of bait myself into it i'm going


---------19:29----------
to let myself fall into the trap so


---------19:31----------
people can kind of recognize their


---------19:32----------
cognitive biases in the same way on some


---------19:34----------
intellectual level they can recognize it


---------19:37----------
they can recognize it from an explicit


---------19:39----------
memory standpoint


---------19:41----------
right


---------19:42----------
they can sort of understand it


---------19:43----------
informationally but they can't


---------19:45----------
understand it implicitly they can't get


---------19:47----------
neon of it


---------19:49----------
because it's all coming from the same


---------19:50----------
mind


---------19:51----------
okay


---------19:52----------
so now


---------19:53----------
are there any questions about that


---------19:58----------
okay so y'all are pretty familiar you


---------20:00----------
all feel pretty good about like


---------20:01----------
recognizing signs of resistance or do


---------20:03----------
you think we need to talk more about


---------20:04----------
that


---------20:10----------
i'm pretty comfortable okay great so now


---------20:13----------
let's try to think a little bit about


---------20:15----------
where does this resistance come from


---------20:18----------
um there's a question in chat so


---------20:21----------
self-coaching is impossible even with


---------20:23----------
awareness you all see like this is a


---------20:25----------
classic example so i'm not saying it's


---------20:27----------
impossible


---------20:28----------
i'm just saying it's


---------20:30----------
way harder


---------20:31----------
and the second thing is just the fact


---------20:32----------
that this person so this is what happens


---------20:34----------
right so


---------20:35----------
people will amplify


---------20:39----------
certain things and like ask the question


---------20:41----------
about whether it's impossible like do


---------20:43----------
you guys see that there's like there's


---------20:44----------
like even in that question there's like


---------20:46----------
a drive i don't know how else to put


---------20:48----------
that do you all see what i'm saying


---------20:50----------
like do you guys get those kinds of


---------20:51----------
questions so who can explain what's


---------20:53----------
going on behind that question


---------20:56----------
there's like a hopelessness like it


---------20:57----------
won't work for me


---------20:59----------
like do you mean that like this won't


---------21:00----------
work for me


---------21:01----------
yeah so it can be that way but what i'd


---------21:03----------
sort of guess from that that person's


---------21:05----------
perspective is that they're resistant to


---------21:06----------
engage in coaching and they're like


---------21:08----------
asking for a yes or no question that


---------21:11----------
will give them license to not try


---------21:12----------
coaching you all see that


---------21:16----------
right because like i'm not going to say


---------21:17----------
it's impossible they're like okay great


---------21:18----------
so i can do it like i don't need


---------21:20----------
coaching easy i can do it on my own


---------21:23----------
right so it's so interesting how


---------21:25----------
people's


---------21:26----------
questions like can even be a sign of


---------21:28----------
resistance


---------21:30----------
um anyway so let's i'm gonna try to


---------21:32----------
ignore chat so let's kind of move on so


---------21:33----------
where do you guys think this


---------21:35----------
resistance comes from let's move on to


---------21:37----------
step three


---------21:39----------
origins of resistance


---------21:44----------
and i know i've sort of given you all


---------21:45----------
the answer but let's kind of walk


---------21:47----------
through it


---------21:55----------
so where do you all think these


---------21:56----------
statements come from


---------22:00----------
some scars


---------22:01----------
okay what's the sum scar


---------22:04----------
undigested emotion


---------22:05----------
okay so like


---------22:07----------
yeah


---------22:09----------
okay maybe from like a past experience


---------22:11----------
okay past experience


---------22:13----------
so help me understand how past


---------22:15----------
experience leads to one of these


---------22:16----------
statements


---------22:18----------
well if it happens before then your mind


---------22:20----------
will predict that it'll happen again um


---------22:23----------
and then you feel less likely to succeed


---------22:26----------
maybe


---------22:27----------
okay so which one of these statements


---------22:29----------
eli what do you think would come from a


---------22:31----------
past experience or some stock


---------22:36----------
um i think maybe like it'll be a waste


---------22:38----------
of time or how do i know if it'll work


---------22:40----------
perfect right it'll be a waste of time


---------22:43----------
because they've had a past experience


---------22:46----------
where they tried something


---------22:48----------
and it didn't work and therefore their


---------22:50----------
brain logically concludes


---------22:52----------
right because like our brain is pretty


---------22:53----------
smart if i try to reset my sleep


---------22:55----------
schedule


---------22:56----------
three times and i fail after 24 hours


---------23:00----------
all three times what is my brain gonna


---------23:02----------
tell me i can't reset my sleep schedule


---------23:05----------
i'm different from other people other


---------23:06----------
people can reset their sleep schedule


---------23:09----------
but it'll be a waste of time for me


---------23:11----------
and therefore they stop trying that's


---------23:13----------
the resistance and they never act


---------23:16----------
excellent


---------23:17----------
so and remember that undigested emotions


---------23:20----------
so i think some scars and past


---------23:21----------
experiences go hand in hand right so


---------23:23----------
what tends to happen with the some scar


---------23:26----------
how does it what's the relationship


---------23:27----------
between a past experience and a some


---------23:28----------
scar who can explain it


---------23:38----------
it builds an identity


---------23:41----------
okay so we'll get to identity in a


---------23:43----------
second


---------23:47----------
so what's the relationship between past


---------23:49----------
experience and some scar


---------23:52----------
so some scar would be the emotion


---------23:54----------
associated with the experience compared


---------23:56----------
to the past experience like it could


---------23:58----------
also just be a pattern that the brain


---------23:59----------
has picked up on


---------24:01----------
excellent right so this is what happens


---------24:02----------
we have past experience


---------24:05----------
i got dumped


---------24:08----------
and that comes with emotion


---------24:10----------
and then what happens is after i get


---------24:12----------
dumped i distract myself


---------24:14----------
i'ma play a game i'm getting hammered


---------24:16----------
and then that emotion goes dormant


---------24:21----------
and then what happens


---------24:23----------
is our brain our buddhi


---------24:27----------
scans the


---------24:30----------
present and the next time i get into a


---------24:33----------
relationship it's like hey we've done


---------24:35----------
this before you remember what happened


---------24:37----------
last time and then i engage in the


---------24:38----------
relationship


---------24:42----------
some scar activates


---------24:50----------
and then the emotion returns


---------24:54----------
and then even though i'm dating someone


---------24:55----------
new


---------24:57----------
i feel


---------24:58----------
like i'm gonna get dumped


---------25:01----------
and then since i feel like i'm gonna get


---------25:03----------
dumped


---------25:05----------
i'm gonna say


---------25:09----------
um let's think about how that would


---------25:10----------
manifest


---------25:13----------
i don't know if this relationship is


---------25:14----------
going to work even though i want it to


---------25:16----------
work and i like the person i'm dating


---------25:19----------
right


---------25:20----------
and what's driving that is this emotion


---------25:22----------
that returns we good there


---------25:24----------
and so then what happens is each


---------25:26----------
experience so we can have experience


---------25:27----------
number one experience number two and


---------25:29----------
experience number three and each of


---------25:31----------
those will elevate the negative emotion


---------25:35----------
and over time the sum scar will become


---------25:37----------
very strong and then i'll never date


---------25:39----------
again


---------25:41----------
okay and so that emotion kind of returns


---------25:43----------
very good


---------25:45----------
so let's talk um so y'all can kind of


---------25:48----------
see that like


---------25:51----------
you know what do you think are the


---------25:52----------
emotions that relate what do you think


---------25:55----------
are like let's list out the emotions


---------25:57----------
that relate to these statements so what


---------26:00----------
do you think that our clients feel


---------26:02----------
that cause them to be resistant to


---------26:04----------
taking action


---------26:11----------
here


---------26:12----------
excellent what else


---------26:14----------
hurt


---------26:15----------
yep


---------26:23----------
shame


---------26:24----------
excellent


---------26:28----------
what else


---------26:32----------
pressure embarrassment


---------26:34----------
pressure yeah embarrassment what else or


---------26:38----------
doing great


---------26:42----------
there's more come on


---------26:44----------
guilt yep


---------26:48----------
alienated


---------26:49----------
yep


---------26:50----------
good appreciation


---------26:53----------
yeah now we're getting there


---------26:56----------
there's a valence of emotion that y'all


---------26:57----------
just scratching the surface of


---------27:01----------
what else


---------27:02----------
what's in the frustration bucket


---------27:05----------
powerless yeah


---------27:08----------
what else


---------27:09----------
hopelessness good


---------27:12----------
what else


---------27:13----------
defeated


---------27:15----------
sure


---------27:22----------
resentment


---------27:23----------
what would you say


---------27:25----------
lonely


---------27:26----------
lonely absolutely


---------27:28----------
resentment


---------27:30----------
anger


---------27:32----------
right there's a lot of that stuff in


---------27:34----------
there


---------27:35----------
and so here's the thing


---------27:37----------
especially for our population that's


---------27:38----------
relatively lexa-thymic they're not going


---------27:41----------
to be aware of this


---------27:43----------
like when they think about let's say i


---------27:45----------
want to become financially independent


---------27:47----------
move out of my parents house


---------27:49----------
this is not what they associate that


---------27:52----------
goal with


---------27:54----------
but if i want to move out of my parents


---------27:56----------
house


---------27:56----------
that means that i'm living where


---------28:03----------
and if i'm living with my parents at my


---------28:05----------
age what emotions come with that


---------28:07----------
shame


---------28:09----------
absolutely right all of the above


---------28:12----------
and so the challenge is that you know


---------28:14----------
they look at the goal right and they're


---------28:15----------
like oh yeah like i want to move out


---------28:17----------
i'ma be independent like it's going to


---------28:18----------
be so great


---------28:20----------
but


---------28:21----------
there's no point


---------28:23----------
i've tried it


---------28:28----------
before okay other signs of resistance


---------28:33----------
i just need to figure out


---------28:37----------
this is a big one


---------28:40----------
right i just need to figure out i'll be


---------28:42----------
ready when


---------28:48----------
when oh i'll ask this person out after i


---------28:51----------
lose 20 pounds


---------28:53----------
i'll apply for a job when i've had


---------28:56----------
something


---------28:57----------
reasonable to put on my resume


---------28:59----------
you know i want to take this course


---------29:01----------
before i do this


---------29:03----------
right these are all signs


---------29:05----------
sorry where would we put the idea of


---------29:09----------
like


---------29:10----------
not willing to start until there's a


---------29:12----------
guarantee of success


---------29:14----------
beautiful we'll get there


---------29:16----------
okay right so did we not get there at


---------29:18----------
all


---------29:19----------
okay


---------29:21----------
yeah i'll i'll be ready i'll stick it


---------29:23----------
with i'll be righty when


---------29:25----------
okay so and let's just talk about that


---------29:27----------
for now so i you know i'll i'll i'll


---------29:29----------
apply when i'm sure that my application


---------29:32----------
is perfect


---------29:33----------
so what are we trying what is that


---------29:35----------
person like


---------29:37----------
where what's the emotional valence like


---------29:39----------
how does that work why does someone say


---------29:41----------
that to themselves and what's going on


---------29:42----------
emotionally in that person


---------29:48----------
i would imagine that they predict like a


---------29:51----------
there'd be a really strong negative


---------29:53----------
experience if it didn't work out so they


---------29:55----------
want to make sure that it does work out


---------29:56----------
to avoid that


---------29:58----------
exactly


---------29:59----------
well said right in a nutshell


---------30:02----------
so i cannot afford to feel the negative


---------30:05----------
consequence of the rejection


---------30:08----------
therefore i'm gonna stack the deck in my


---------30:10----------
favor to make sure that i don't get hurt


---------30:13----------
it is avoidance of emotion


---------30:20----------
motivates


---------30:23----------
our clients


---------30:26----------
to


---------30:27----------
stay


---------30:28----------
stuck


---------30:30----------
okay this is a key concept which i think


---------30:33----------
you'll all already understand y'all get


---------30:34----------
that


---------30:37----------
so like it's kind of interesting so now


---------30:39----------
we understand like the origin of


---------30:40----------
resistance is absolutely this negative


---------30:42----------
emotion


---------30:44----------
but like


---------30:45----------
they're highly motivated to do nothing


---------30:49----------
right so we have to understand that as


---------30:50----------
coaches


---------30:51----------
that this is not someone who's lazy


---------30:54----------
they're actually quite dedicated


---------30:57----------
you know like you have to you have to


---------30:59----------
work really hard and you have to you


---------31:00----------
have to emotionally suppress


---------31:02----------
a lot of shame to keep playing video


---------31:04----------
games all day long when you're like 26


---------31:07----------
and going nowhere in life


---------31:09----------
i had an interesting so i run a group


---------31:10----------
for esports professionals


---------31:13----------
and one day we had this kind of random


---------31:15----------
tangent


---------31:16----------
but like we were talking about like


---------31:17----------
toxicity in pub games


---------31:20----------
and like i don't know if you guys are


---------31:21----------
kind of familiar with this but like you


---------31:23----------
know if you watch like streaming and


---------31:24----------
stuff and you watch like pro gamers who


---------31:26----------
stream


---------31:27----------
they're like you know let's say like the


---------31:29----------
top tier pros or like maybe the 100 best


---------31:32----------
players in the world


---------31:33----------
but then there are people who will play


---------31:35----------
who will be like rank like 200 to 600


---------31:38----------
and just imagine what it feels like to


---------31:40----------
be like a rank 200 person


---------31:43----------
right you've dedicated 10 years of your


---------31:45----------
life you're one of the best 200 people


---------31:47----------
in the world


---------31:48----------
and you never go to even a tier 2


---------31:50----------
tournament


---------31:52----------
and like what does it feel like to be


---------31:54----------
that person


---------31:56----------
and so it's kind of interesting because


---------31:59----------
you know when when we're trying to


---------32:00----------
understand like the toxicity of those


---------32:02----------
players like understanding what their


---------32:05----------
internal emotional state is like makes


---------32:07----------
so much more sense


---------32:10----------
because like you know what what's their


---------32:11----------
prospects for the future like they don't


---------32:13----------
really have much right if i've spent if


---------32:15----------
i'm i've had i'm i've if i've been


---------32:18----------
playing dota for about 10 years


---------32:20----------
and i'm trying to go pro and i haven't


---------32:22----------
made it yet like what is gonna happen


---------32:26----------
you know so i think that a lot of times


---------32:28----------
if you think about people like our


---------32:30----------
clients who feel really stuck and by the


---------32:32----------
way stock doesn't necessarily have to


---------32:33----------
mean living in your mom's basement right


---------32:35----------
so stock can mean like


---------32:37----------
being in a relationship that you don't


---------32:39----------
think is the right one for you but


---------32:41----------
you're afraid to leave because you're


---------32:43----------
afraid that this is the best it's gonna


---------32:44----------
get


---------32:45----------
so you try really really really hard to


---------32:48----------
make this relationship work even though


---------32:50----------
all the signals are saying you should


---------32:52----------
gtfo


---------32:53----------
but you're not sure if you can find


---------32:55----------
someone else that can be resistance


---------32:57----------
resistance can be like successfully


---------32:59----------
having like a good job where you make


---------33:01----------
six figures a year


---------33:03----------
but


---------33:04----------
you're not really happy on a day-to-day


---------33:06----------
basis and you feel burnt out and you're


---------33:08----------
not really sure like how to make a


---------33:10----------
change in your life


---------33:12----------
you know and you kind of spend your days


---------33:14----------
looking at instagrams of people who have


---------33:15----------
quit their job and traveling the world


---------33:17----------
but you don't have the balls to do it


---------33:20----------
you know because that would be stupid it


---------33:22----------
would be throwing away everything that i


---------33:24----------
built


---------33:26----------
sometimes in our content creator program


---------33:28----------
we'll get streamers who need to take a


---------33:30----------
break and can't take a break


---------33:32----------
have you all anyone here from content


---------33:34----------
creator program


---------33:36----------
yeah so steve have you encountered that


---------33:41----------
yeah i've had a couple creators who


---------33:44----------
very much fall into that basket of like


---------33:47----------
i'm not allowed to have


---------33:49----------
bad feelings because i'm a successful


---------33:50----------
streamer right i'm not allowed to take a


---------33:52----------
break because


---------33:54----------
i made it and if i leave i'll never be


---------33:57----------
heard from again


---------33:58----------
right so if they're not allowed to have


---------34:01----------
bad feelings where do those feelings go


---------34:03----------
steve


---------34:04----------
when they have bad feelings


---------34:07----------
uh


---------34:08----------
they they get turned into some scars


---------34:10----------
absolutely and then some scars do what


---------34:13----------
in terms of their life how does it


---------34:14----------
affect their life


---------34:17----------
uh it recurs and grows over time and


---------34:19----------
makes everything harder so what


---------34:22----------
absolutely so that's that's the key


---------34:23----------
thing so like this crap is there you've


---------34:26----------
purchased this crap by your actions and


---------34:28----------
your circumstances


---------34:30----------
and then the more that we suppress it it


---------34:32----------
goes dormant and then manifests as


---------34:34----------
resistance


---------34:36----------
shows up looking like this


---------34:38----------
and the interesting thing is that if you


---------34:40----------
look at these statements there's no


---------34:41----------
emotion in these statements


---------34:44----------
right


---------34:46----------
i want to but uh it's hard i can't


---------34:49----------
it's logical here are all of the reasons


---------34:51----------
why i can't let me use logic


---------34:53----------
i'm a different kind of person that


---------34:55----------
applies to other people but not to me


---------34:57----------
once again logic it's not possible logic


---------35:00----------
logic logic logic logic logic


---------35:04----------
but buried beneath it is emotion and


---------35:05----------
these people stay stuck because these


---------35:08----------
beliefs the the energy that drives these


---------35:10----------
beliefs is purely emotional


---------35:12----------
okay


---------35:14----------
so it could be some scars emotions


---------35:17----------
you know so this is one of the key


---------35:18----------
origins of resistance now let's talk


---------35:20----------
about a hum god


---------35:23----------
so what is a hamkar


---------35:32----------
the sense of i right


---------35:36----------
oh [ __ ]


---------35:39----------
so


---------35:41----------
what happens over time


---------35:43----------
is as we develop negative experiences


---------35:46----------
and among us


---------35:47----------
we develop an ego that actually protects


---------35:49----------
us from our negative emotions so


---------35:52----------
remember that the ego is the bouncer of


---------35:54----------
the mind so when we feel an insecurity


---------35:57----------
what does the ego do


---------35:59----------
what are the signs that the ego is


---------36:01----------
active


---------36:05----------
comparison put other people up


---------36:08----------
very good


---------36:09----------
comparison


---------36:11----------
what else


---------36:15----------
maybe like logic or over explaining


---------36:18----------
yep


---------36:19----------
uh so i'm gonna call it bullying buddhi


---------36:22----------
so we'll explain that in a second


---------36:26----------
um


---------36:28----------
gets bullied


---------36:30----------
what else


---------36:31----------
or let's just i guess let's talk about


---------36:33----------
that now so remember that when someone


---------36:35----------
is egotistical


---------36:37----------
they will take their intellect or their


---------36:39----------
logic and they'll bully it into crafting


---------36:41----------
a logical story that supports their


---------36:43----------
viewpoint


---------36:44----------
so we see this all the time in politics


---------36:47----------
we see this all the time in terms of


---------36:49----------
like psychological defense mechanisms


---------36:51----------
right like people will jud like


---------36:53----------
justifications and rationalizations are


---------36:55----------
good examples of this in like western


---------36:56----------
psychology so oh yeah it's not my fault


---------36:59----------
that i cheated on my partner my partner


---------37:01----------
wasn't emotionally available to me so


---------37:03----------
what choice did i have


---------37:05----------
right it's a rationalization i didn't do


---------37:07----------
anything wrong they drove me to do it i


---------37:08----------
had no choice


---------37:10----------
and if you try to logically argue with


---------37:11----------
that person you won't get anywhere so


---------37:14----------
the tricky thing about the home guard


---------37:15----------
you can also see this all over the


---------37:16----------
internet like you look at any argument


---------37:18----------
on the internet my favorite is like


---------37:20----------
looking at when you have these like


---------37:21----------
people arguing about like strategies and


---------37:23----------
games and like they'll say like oh this


---------37:25----------
is a dumb idea


---------37:26----------
and they'll just like argue against each


---------37:28----------
other for until the end of time


---------37:32----------
and usually like one of them's an idiot


---------37:34----------
they'll never recognize it and then you


---------37:36----------
could tell by the down votes because


---------37:38----------
like one person has like a bunch of


---------37:39----------
upvotes and one person has a bunch of


---------37:41----------
down votes


---------37:42----------
right so you could see this this


---------37:43----------
attitude all the time where everyone


---------37:45----------
believes they're logical but it's


---------37:46----------
actually their ahamkada that's bullying


---------37:48----------
their intellect


---------37:49----------
into


---------37:50----------
you know presenting something that they


---------37:52----------
believe is logical


---------37:55----------
what else does the


---------37:57----------
uh hum guard do


---------37:59----------
there's one more thing


---------38:12----------
what do noobs on the internet do when


---------38:13----------
their logic is refuted


---------38:17----------
put themselves up put others down


---------38:19----------
absolutely right


---------38:21----------
so pump


---------38:22----------
themselves up


---------38:27----------
when i say something stupid on the


---------38:28----------
internet


---------38:30----------
and someone and i don't have a logical


---------38:32----------
leg to stand on


---------38:34----------
i'll be like 1v1 mid let's go noob


---------38:38----------
what are you one kmmr i'm 2k mmr i'm 1.1


---------38:41----------
kmr who the hell are you like shut the


---------38:43----------
hell up


---------38:45----------
i'm so much better


---------38:46----------
right put other people down


---------38:51----------
so we also see this in esports in a very


---------38:53----------
interesting way so sometimes we'll have


---------38:56----------
a team who's an underdog


---------38:58----------
and the underdog knows that they're an


---------38:59----------
underdog so what do they do


---------39:02----------
they start ramping themselves up in


---------39:04----------
their mind and like


---------39:06----------
crapping mentally on the team that


---------39:08----------
they're about to play against


---------39:10----------
it's kind of interesting so they'll be


---------39:12----------
like oh like they're not that great he's


---------39:14----------
not all that we're better they're worse


---------39:17----------
and instead actually what leads to the


---------39:19----------
best outcomes is not doing that


---------39:21----------
self-psychological like psyching up


---------39:23----------
process but acknowledging hey this team


---------39:25----------
is better than we are


---------39:26----------
we're not favored in this matchup but if


---------39:28----------
we play our best game we can actually


---------39:29----------
win


---------39:31----------
it's going to be an uphill battle


---------39:33----------
and generally speaking we see the best


---------39:34----------
performance when teams adopt that


---------39:36----------
attitude and remove a hum card from the


---------39:38----------
equation


---------39:40----------
okay


---------39:41----------
so


---------39:42----------
we can also see this


---------39:44----------
um


---------39:45----------
so which of these statements comes from


---------39:47----------
ahamkar


---------39:56----------
i've tried


---------39:58----------
okay i've tried this before


---------40:02----------
i'm not that


---------40:03----------
yeah this is the big one right what else


---------40:09----------
not possible


---------40:12----------
uh okay


---------40:13----------
sure


---------40:15----------
so here's what i'd say if you just look


---------40:17----------
at the subject


---------40:20----------
right so like some of these


---------40:24----------
like some of these include i


---------40:27----------
i'm different from other people i'm not


---------40:29----------
that


---------40:30----------
and some of these are like externally


---------40:32----------
pointed


---------40:33----------
right there's no point now this may be a


---------40:35----------
hum car too because if i view myself as


---------40:38----------
a failure


---------40:39----------
then there's no point


---------40:41----------
you'll see that so this is good i mean


---------40:43----------
the truth is that any of these


---------40:45----------
statements can be coming from manus or


---------40:46----------
ahmgar and remember that the two


---------40:48----------
intertwine right it's not like manus or


---------40:50----------
hamkar time you have negative emotion in


---------40:52----------
the monastery is going to activate so


---------40:54----------
the two play hand in hand


---------40:56----------
but in short sometimes what's going to


---------40:58----------
happen is our clients will have a sense


---------40:59----------
of identity that prevents them from


---------41:01----------
acting


---------41:04----------
and what do i mean by that um


---------41:07----------
or do you all understand what i mean by


---------41:09----------
that what do you all think


---------41:16----------
like they've maybe built a construct of


---------41:19----------
themselves that doesn't align with them


---------41:21----------
succeeding


---------41:22----------
absolutely that's beautifully put right


---------41:24----------
so this is the kind of thing where like


---------41:26----------
oh disciplined people could do this


---------41:29----------
but i can't do it because i'm not


---------41:31----------
disciplined and as long as they have


---------41:34----------
that belief there


---------41:36----------
their likelihood of success is going to


---------41:37----------
be very very low right so this is why


---------41:39----------
like you'll have these like you know


---------41:42----------
feel good success blogs that's like have


---------41:44----------
faith in yourself


---------41:45----------
you know develop confidence in yourself


---------41:47----------
like if you look at like you know pick


---------41:49----------
up or or red pill kind of stuff right


---------41:51----------
they're like you got to present


---------41:52----------
confidence because like women are


---------41:54----------
attracted to confidence just be


---------41:56----------
confident bro here's how you become


---------41:58----------
confident


---------41:59----------
you know so it's sort of this idea that


---------42:00----------
like the who we are factors into our


---------42:04----------
perception of success and so we have a


---------42:06----------
part of our brain that basically does


---------42:08----------
this calculation which is like you know


---------42:11----------
gain


---------42:12----------
minus loss


---------42:16----------
times


---------42:18----------
percent


---------42:19----------
of success


---------42:22----------
so this is a an equation that our brain


---------42:24----------
is running all the time


---------42:26----------
and so like what happens is if i have an


---------42:28----------
identity that views me as a failure and


---------42:30----------
this number goes down


---------42:32----------
my motivation is going to be very very


---------42:34----------
low


---------42:38----------
right


---------42:40----------
so


---------42:41----------
these are the two major sources or three


---------42:43----------
major sources of resistance so now the


---------42:46----------
question becomes how do we help clients


---------42:48----------
with manas and a hum god


---------42:51----------
or some scott and ahm god


---------42:53----------
what's our plan just a quick question


---------42:56----------
for the gain minus loss equation does


---------42:58----------
that equal motivation or resistance


---------43:01----------
um


---------43:03----------
that's a good question let me think


---------43:04----------
about that


---------43:06----------
i would say like this is this


---------43:08----------
calculation results in action or


---------43:10----------
inaction


---------43:11----------
is what's on the right side of the equal


---------43:12----------
sign


---------43:14----------
uh i'd say it's like percent likelihood


---------43:16----------
of action


---------43:22----------
i may need to


---------43:24----------
um redeem myself tomorrow once i think


---------43:28----------
about it


---------43:30----------
but i think that's what we're talking


---------43:32----------
about


---------43:34----------
i think it should be fair


---------43:36----------
does that make sense to y'all


---------43:38----------
was that a mistake


---------43:41----------
the likelihood of action i think is what


---------43:42----------
we're talking about here


---------43:47----------
okay


---------43:49----------
so


---------43:50----------
what do we do


---------43:51----------
with mana samskara


---------43:54----------
how do we


---------43:56----------
how do we manage these as coaches


---------44:12----------
i'm thinking maybe with the modest you


---------44:15----------
can change their


---------44:16----------
perceptions of like each of those


---------44:18----------
variables


---------44:19----------
okay very good right so the first thing


---------44:21----------
that we can do is when you say change


---------44:23----------
their perception i'm going to divide


---------44:25----------
that into two pieces one is we can


---------44:26----------
uncover emotion


---------44:30----------
right so their perception


---------44:32----------
is like this statement


---------44:34----------
so in order to change their perception


---------44:35----------
what we have to do is uncover the


---------44:37----------
emotion and once you've uncovered the


---------44:39----------
emotion then you can start to metabolize


---------44:41----------
it


---------44:42----------
right so this is what we call emotional


---------44:44----------
catharsis


---------44:48----------
it's what we call the aha moment


---------44:50----------
as well that's maybe more neon but the


---------44:52----------
two go hand in hand


---------44:54----------
so like and this is also where things


---------44:56----------
become implicit memory


---------44:59----------
from a scientific perspective


---------45:01----------
and when they become nyan from a


---------45:04----------
spiritual perspective


---------45:08----------
okay


---------45:10----------
so uncovering emotion is the first step


---------45:13----------
the second thing that we can do is


---------45:14----------
redirect their neuronal pathway


---------45:20----------
so what i mean by that


---------45:22----------
is our neurons tend to


---------45:25----------
form grooves almost like game trails so


---------45:27----------
there's a there's a saying in in


---------45:29----------
neuroscience that neurons that fire


---------45:30----------
together wire together


---------45:32----------
so generally speaking human beings will


---------45:35----------
have like scripts running in their mind


---------45:37----------
right so when i like play a game of dota


---------45:39----------
for example


---------45:40----------
i will like automatically do particular


---------45:42----------
things and that's because my brain is


---------45:44----------
like it's run this script before


---------45:46----------
and even when it comes to motivation and


---------45:48----------
goal setting and taking action our brain


---------45:50----------
is running these scripts


---------45:52----------
oh i'll do it when i'm ready


---------45:54----------
how do i know it'll work


---------45:56----------
it'll like run into this auto script


---------45:59----------
and as we uncover awareness of the


---------46:01----------
emotion and start to metabolize it


---------46:04----------
we can red redirect their thinking in a


---------46:06----------
more positive way so instead of like


---------46:08----------
every day they wake up and they think oh


---------46:10----------
i should study today i should study a


---------46:11----------
day and those neurons become like well


---------46:14----------
grooved and will start to like become


---------46:16----------
easier and easier to access those


---------46:18----------
thoughts and so the analogy that i like


---------46:20----------
to use is a game trail so imagine that i


---------46:22----------
have a field of like wheat like


---------46:25----------
high grass okay


---------46:26----------
so once a deer walks down that high


---------46:29----------
grass and then it starts to like form


---------46:31----------
like a very small pathway the next day a


---------46:35----------
different deer walks by and it looks at


---------46:36----------
all the tall grass and it says oh there


---------46:38----------
seems to be one spot that's a little bit


---------46:40----------
trampled so it walks down that way as


---------46:42----------
well


---------46:43----------
third day a third deer comes by tramples


---------46:45----------
the grass a little bit more and now


---------46:46----------
suddenly the grass has been trampled so


---------46:48----------
much that a rabbit can even walk down it


---------46:50----------
you don't have to be a deer and then a


---------46:52----------
field mouse and then lots of animals


---------46:54----------
start to use the game trail and so over


---------46:56----------
time


---------46:57----------
the way that we start thinking becomes


---------47:00----------
more and more solidified


---------47:01----------
so by using questions and reflections


---------47:06----------
we can take a stuck client and get them


---------47:08----------
to think about things in a new way oh


---------47:10----------
maybe the reason that you're not able to


---------47:12----------
do it isn't because you're incompetent


---------47:15----------
it actually has to do with like you have


---------47:17----------
an immense amount of shame that is


---------47:18----------
holding you back it's almost like your


---------47:20----------
brain is trying to protect you from


---------47:22----------
being hurt because every time you've


---------47:24----------
done this before you've gotten


---------47:25----------
absolutely destroyed


---------47:27----------
so i could totally see why you wouldn't


---------47:29----------
want to do it again


---------47:31----------
and oddly enough that interpretation and


---------47:33----------
sort of helping people like reinterpret


---------47:36----------
their understanding


---------47:39----------
will actually redirect their neuronal


---------47:41----------
pathways and start to catalyze change


---------47:43----------
and y'all may have seen that in terms of


---------47:45----------
clients you've worked with where like


---------47:46----------
you know they come in with a certain


---------47:47----------
conception and this is the real


---------47:49----------
challenge with goal setting because like


---------47:51----------
they come in with a particular goal but


---------47:53----------
their goal is based off of this


---------47:55----------
statement


---------47:56----------
right it's based on this understanding


---------47:58----------
it's not based on this


---------48:01----------
and so oftentimes the goals that they'll


---------48:02----------
come in with this is tricky


---------48:04----------
need to be reworked to things that are


---------48:06----------
actually more appropriate and address


---------48:08----------
the obstacles that they face instead of


---------48:10----------
where they want to go and that's the


---------48:11----------
biggest problem with goals is that our


---------48:13----------
clients are here


---------48:15----------
they want to go here so they say


---------48:17----------
let's get here but what they ignore is


---------48:21----------
like what's the wall in the way because


---------48:22----------
the real goal is removing this


---------48:26----------
this is what's keeping you from getting


---------48:28----------
to you to where you want to go


---------48:30----------
so in terms of decompressing them on us


---------48:32----------
it starts by raising awareness


---------48:35----------
and uncovering the emotion metabolizing


---------48:38----------
the emotion so that that emotional


---------48:40----------
energy is not as strong and therefore


---------48:42----------
will decrease that resistance hump right


---------48:45----------
if this is the resistance hump once you


---------48:46----------
metabolize emotion


---------48:48----------
it goes from here to here and then it's


---------48:51----------
easier for them to do and when you fully


---------48:52----------
metabolize the some scar this is what it


---------48:54----------
looks like and then action is actually


---------48:57----------
very easy to obtain


---------48:58----------
and once people get to this state


---------49:01----------
this is why if you ask someone who's


---------49:02----------
highly motivated


---------49:04----------
they're not actually like super fired up


---------49:06----------
they just do it easily it's easy for


---------49:08----------
them


---------49:10----------
it becomes easy and this is what we see


---------49:12----------
with our clients when we metabolize


---------49:14----------
emotions as they come in one week and


---------49:15----------
they're like yeah i did it and it's like


---------49:17----------
what


---------49:18----------
how did you do it it was so hard for you


---------49:20----------
a month ago how did it become easy and


---------49:22----------
they're like i don't know


---------49:23----------
i just did it


---------49:25----------
i just realized so we see this in in


---------49:28----------
addiction recovery as well where you


---------49:30----------
know reasons to quit and there's a lot


---------49:32----------
of resistance


---------49:33----------
and then once we get the emotions down


---------49:35----------
here


---------49:36----------
what people will say is i just realized


---------49:42----------
i have to quit


---------49:46----------
one day i woke up and i knew enough was


---------49:48----------
enough


---------49:49----------
and so that process actually has like a


---------49:51----------
very real


---------49:53----------
neuroscientific psychological


---------49:56----------
spirit not really spiritual but really


---------49:57----------
neuroscientific and psychological


---------49:59----------
underpinning to it and this is


---------50:01----------
basically how it works questions about


---------50:03----------
that


---------50:06----------
yeah i have a question about the


---------50:08----------
redirecting neural pathways is that


---------50:10----------
something that kind of just happens


---------50:12----------
naturally over like reflective listening


---------50:14----------
and like do they just kind of like


---------50:16----------
naturally start to question their own


---------50:18----------
like belief system or like


---------50:20----------
yeah so it doesn't happen naturally


---------50:23----------
so if you just randomly like


---------50:25----------
reflectively listen


---------50:26----------
it's not going to be sufficient so this


---------50:28----------
is where asking


---------50:29----------
open-ended questions is important


---------50:32----------
so i want you all to understand this for


---------50:34----------
a second so here's our client


---------50:37----------
here's what they know


---------50:40----------
and kind of hears what they


---------50:43----------
and based on what they know


---------50:45----------
they're not able to achieve their goals


---------50:47----------
in order to achieve their goal this is


---------50:49----------
what they need to know


---------50:54----------
so our work as coaches is on this


---------50:56----------
barrier right here


---------50:58----------
so you ask like they're like oh yeah


---------50:59----------
like they come in you say okay why are


---------51:01----------
you stuck and they're going to give you


---------51:02----------
a bunch of answers


---------51:04----------
and then you're going to ask them an


---------51:05----------
open-ended question right you're going


---------51:06----------
to notice something you're going to


---------51:07----------
notice some kind of discrepancy we'll


---------51:08----------
get to that into that in a second then


---------51:11----------
you're going to ask them a question and


---------51:12----------
you're going to like extend them over


---------51:14----------
here and then this is going to be the


---------51:15----------
new barrier of their knowledge


---------51:17----------
and then you're going to ask another


---------51:19----------
important question and it's going to get


---------51:20----------
over here


---------51:23----------
right and you're going to ask another


---------51:24----------
important question and it's going to get


---------51:25----------
over here


---------51:27----------
and remember that reflective listening


---------51:29----------
can move you in this direction too


---------51:31----------
right so what's the like what's the goal


---------51:33----------
of reflective listening why do we


---------51:34----------
reflect if we listen


---------51:37----------
what does a client do after you do


---------51:38----------
effective reflective listening


---------51:49----------
maybe like whatever emotion they had


---------51:51----------
kind of gets amplified a little bit


---------51:53----------
absolutely right it uncovers stuff


---------51:57----------
right so


---------51:58----------
this barrier gets advanced through


---------52:00----------
open-ended questions and reflective


---------52:02----------
listening


---------52:03----------
and this is also why we sometimes ask


---------52:04----------
you you know like what will like


---------52:06----------
this kind of read my mind question but


---------52:08----------
when you have a client who's on the


---------52:10----------
brink of leaving and quitting coaching


---------52:11----------
what should you do


---------52:16----------
validate work like


---------52:18----------
sort of


---------52:22----------
that's not actually what i advocate most


---------52:23----------
of the time when you all feel that way


---------52:27----------
because you all have been doing that


---------52:31----------
don't isn't it don't we um throw what we


---------52:33----------
call like a hail mary absolutely so help


---------52:36----------
me understand why that's important brian


---------52:40----------
um well it's


---------52:42----------
kind of important because it's


---------52:44----------
we kind of like step out what we would


---------52:45----------
normally do as a coach and we kind of


---------52:47----------
like put everything like on the table


---------52:50----------
like and more or less we kind of like


---------52:53----------
step


---------52:54----------
not like review what we say but like hey


---------52:56----------
this is what i'm seeing and like here's


---------52:57----------
the situation and like we just like lay


---------52:59----------
it on them


---------53:00----------
absolutely right so what what what a


---------53:02----------
hail mary is


---------53:04----------
is they're right here and they're stuck


---------53:06----------
and coaching is not working for them and


---------53:08----------
what we're gonna do is like point this


---------53:10----------
out to them and it's almost like a


---------53:12----------
traumatic shift


---------53:14----------
and it's like hey so in the past i


---------53:16----------
understand that coaching is not working


---------53:18----------
for you


---------53:19----------
and that you want to quit


---------53:21----------
so in the past


---------53:23----------
when things aren't working for you


---------53:25----------
is your usual response to quit


---------53:28----------
this is precisely why you can't quit


---------53:31----------
because every time when things don't


---------53:32----------
work out you don't persevere and you're


---------53:35----------
just doing it again


---------53:37----------
right their interpersonal pathology


---------53:39----------
they'll bring into coaching


---------53:41----------
and so that's your opportunity to say


---------53:42----------
that like look i know this hasn't been


---------53:45----------
working i'd like to work on it i'd like


---------53:47----------
to figure this out and if you're with me


---------53:49----------
i'm confident that we can do it


---------53:52----------
and i can see why you're concerned like


---------53:54----------
i can see why you're complaining because


---------53:56----------
i haven't done the best job maybe i


---------53:58----------
should have been doing this maybe i


---------53:59----------
should have been doing this and at the


---------54:00----------
same time like you're asking me for


---------54:02----------
suggestions and i'm giving them to you


---------54:04----------
and then you don't actually try them and


---------54:06----------
then you conclude that it isn't working


---------54:09----------
so like what do you want to do at this


---------54:10----------
point if you want to quit you're more


---------54:11----------
than welcome to like i'm seriously like


---------54:13----------
maybe it's not a good fit


---------54:16----------
but i really like here's what i'm seeing


---------54:18----------
in terms of your patterns and what you


---------54:21----------
tend to do and so you kind of like lay


---------54:23----------
it all out there you kind of toss out a


---------54:24----------
hail mary and usually so then it sort of


---------54:26----------
happens it's like the testing moment


---------54:28----------
either either you catch the pass and you


---------54:30----------
score a touchdown or it fumbles and


---------54:32----------
they're gg'ed out


---------54:35----------
but remember that our job as coaches is


---------54:37----------
to help them


---------54:38----------
not keep them there and so sometimes


---------54:40----------
desperate times call for desperate


---------54:42----------
measures and if you need to throw a hail


---------54:43----------
mary you need to throw a hail mary


---------54:46----------
okay but generally speaking our goal is


---------54:48----------
to you know use these techniques to help


---------54:51----------
them understand


---------54:52----------
you know how emotions are actually


---------54:54----------
controlling them


---------54:55----------
and then once they understand how


---------54:56----------
emotions are controlling them they then


---------54:58----------
they can start to work on it and then


---------55:00----------
their chance of like engaging in action


---------55:02----------
goes up


---------55:03----------
does that make sense jake


---------55:06----------
okay


---------55:07----------
so um i recognize that we started late


---------55:09----------
today it's 12 15. so if you all need to


---------55:11----------
step out you're all welcome to otherwise


---------55:13----------
i'll try to wrap up in 15 minutes is


---------55:15----------
that cool


---------55:16----------
okay


---------55:17----------
so now let's talk about a hump car so


---------55:20----------
i'll kind of speed run this a little bit


---------55:22----------
so as you all have already said as


---------55:24----------
people pile up with emotions what they


---------55:27----------
end up doing is forming identities of


---------55:29----------
themselves


---------55:31----------
and oftentimes this identity destroys


---------55:34----------
their motivation


---------55:39----------
right so like in cells are a good


---------55:41----------
example of this


---------55:43----------
where if you think about the in-cell


---------55:44----------
identity there are all kinds of things


---------55:46----------
about the identity that like


---------55:48----------
protects people like do we form this


---------55:50----------
identity for a reason


---------55:52----------
okay so like other examples are like


---------55:54----------
people with a victim complex


---------55:58----------
right so this is another protective


---------55:59----------
identity


---------56:00----------
because if i'm always the victim and the


---------56:03----------
world is a mean place and i'm dealing


---------56:05----------
with tons of you know like everyone's


---------56:07----------
being unfair to me


---------56:09----------
what does that protect me from


---------56:14----------
the emotions which ones let's be more


---------56:17----------
specific okay


---------56:21----------
the shame of i'm wrong


---------56:23----------
absolutely not even the shame


---------56:25----------
it protects you from i'm wrong


---------56:28----------
because if you're a victim who's at


---------56:30----------
fault


---------56:34----------
absolutely anyone but me


---------56:38----------
right so we can see like why people form


---------56:40----------
victim complexes


---------56:42----------
because they're incredibly protective


---------56:44----------
they're protect like you never have to


---------56:45----------
take responsibility as long as you're


---------56:46----------
the victim


---------56:48----------
you know i'm not saying that victim


---------56:49----------
victims don't exist like absolutely


---------56:51----------
people are victims


---------56:53----------
and this is the real challenge is that


---------56:54----------
even as a psychiatrist right like when


---------56:56----------
you're dealing with someone with trauma


---------56:59----------
it's really trickier if you're dealing


---------57:00----------
with someone with mental illness for


---------57:01----------
example so let's say like someone with


---------57:02----------
bipolar disorder


---------57:05----------
there's a very fine line


---------57:07----------
you have an illness do you deserve


---------57:09----------
compassion absolutely


---------57:11----------
do you deserve support absolutely do you


---------57:13----------
sometimes get a free pass from time to


---------57:15----------
time absolutely


---------57:17----------
but


---------57:19----------
do you get to blame


---------57:23----------
everything on being bipolar


---------57:28----------
no


---------57:30----------
and this can be very hard for people to


---------57:32----------
understand


---------57:33----------
do you get a free pass from time to time


---------57:35----------
absolutely oh it wasn't my fault i was


---------57:38----------
manic


---------57:39----------
and so i did a bunch of stuff like sure


---------57:41----------
like i can get that right people


---------57:42----------
literally can't control their actions


---------57:44----------
with their manic question is how did you


---------57:46----------
become manic in the first place


---------57:48----------
did you stop taking your medication did


---------57:50----------
you start using drugs did you stop


---------57:51----------
coming to therapy


---------57:53----------
so anytime there's kind of a victim


---------57:55----------
complex


---------57:56----------
you know we have to be kind of careful


---------57:58----------
because


---------57:59----------
if the victim is sort of saying i'm


---------58:01----------
wrong and it's uh i've been wronged and


---------58:03----------
it's not my fault what it also means is


---------58:06----------
that they're giving up their agency


---------58:08----------
they're giving up their control


---------58:10----------
so as a coach like for a lot of people


---------58:12----------
with a hum car you know we have to be


---------58:14----------
really really careful about


---------58:16----------
what they're giving up by adopting their


---------58:18----------
identity


---------58:20----------
and by pointing out to them that if you


---------58:22----------
are are doomed to be single you're


---------58:25----------
giving up any kind of power that you


---------58:27----------
have to like enter into a relationship


---------58:31----------
right so like in it's it's a seriously


---------58:33----------
it's a very hard line to walk as a


---------58:35----------
mental health professional in terms of


---------58:37----------
like what do you hold people accountable


---------58:38----------
for and what do you like give people a


---------58:40----------
pass on


---------58:42----------
you know a good another good example of


---------58:43----------
this is like people who lose their adhd


---------58:45----------
stimulant medication


---------58:47----------
it's like they're more likely to lose


---------58:48----------
their medication because they have adhd


---------58:50----------
and they're like impulsive and forgetful


---------58:52----------
and at the same time like sometimes


---------58:53----------
people are selling it because one bottle


---------58:55----------
can sell for like a thousand dollars


---------58:57----------
and so how do you know it's tough


---------59:00----------
the point is that they're going to form


---------59:02----------
some kind of identity based on their


---------59:04----------
experiences and as long as that identity


---------59:06----------
is where they're operating from it's


---------59:08----------
gonna color everything that they can try


---------59:10----------
it's gonna color their like calculations


---------59:13----------
about what's gonna happen


---------59:15----------
okay


---------59:16----------
so how do we


---------59:18----------
deal with a hum car any ideas


---------59:30----------
like what are some techniques that you


---------59:31----------
all have used to help people understand


---------59:33----------
like and overcome their omkar


---------59:38----------
meeting them where they are with


---------59:39----------
compassion okay good so meeting them


---------59:41----------
where they're at


---------59:43----------
right


---------59:44----------
what else


---------59:47----------
noticing when it's active or not very


---------59:49----------
good


---------59:52----------
noticing the activity what else


---------60:05----------
um understanding where it came from


---------60:08----------
excellent


---------60:09----------
understanding the origin


---------60:11----------
okay


---------60:12----------
so


---------60:14----------
reflecting it back


---------60:16----------
yep


---------60:18----------
excellent


---------60:21----------
okay so now we get to like


---------60:24----------
you know kind of practical questions so


---------60:26----------
like


---------60:28----------
who does this make you


---------60:31----------
so if you're trying to get


---------60:34----------
to the aham god in a very explicit


---------60:37----------
sense and show them this a hum god


---------60:40----------
how did you get to be like this


---------60:49----------
right so this is a really important


---------60:50----------
question that gets to understanding the


---------60:52----------
origin


---------60:53----------
point out the double standard


---------61:00----------
so


---------61:01----------
once again from our content creator


---------61:02----------
program


---------61:03----------
you all have content creators that never


---------61:05----------
want to take a break and can't afford to


---------61:06----------
take a break


---------61:08----------
and then you ask them hey so-and-so is


---------61:09----------
taking a break right now what do you


---------61:10----------
think about that i think it's awesome


---------61:12----------
they should do it


---------61:13----------
it's really important for their mental


---------61:15----------
health what do you think about you


---------61:16----------
taking a break oh no i can't afford that


---------61:19----------
right so you want to point out to them


---------61:21----------
like oh like there's a discrepancy going


---------61:24----------
on here


---------61:25----------
and so this is the key this is a key


---------61:27----------
technique in terms of like goal setting


---------61:29----------
is point out the discrepancy


---------61:35----------
right so you'll get that these are


---------61:37----------
open-ended questions which you all


---------61:38----------
already know how to ask


---------61:40----------
but as a coach when you're targeting a


---------61:42----------
particular thing and you understand what


---------61:44----------
you're targeting it should shape your


---------61:46----------
open-ended question it's not a random


---------61:48----------
reflective listening or a random


---------61:51----------
open-ended question you don't want to


---------61:52----------
ask an open-ended question over here and


---------61:55----------
then one over here you want to ask this


---------61:57----------
one then this one and then this one


---------61:59----------
and get them in the direction that you


---------62:01----------
need to go so in terms of meeting them


---------62:03----------
where they're at you don't ask this one


---------62:05----------
first you meet them here


---------62:07----------
you find the barrier of their


---------62:09----------
understanding


---------62:10----------
and you extend the barrier of their


---------62:12----------
understanding through like key questions


---------62:15----------
and like statements


---------62:17----------
and then you kind of focus on the


---------62:18----------
discrepancy right like


---------62:20----------
this could be important for goal setting


---------62:22----------
as well as like emotions in a humgar and


---------62:24----------
things like that you can ask questions


---------62:25----------
like how would your life be different if


---------62:28----------
what would be the advantage of dot dot


---------62:30----------
dot


---------62:31----------
what would it make you feel like if you


---------62:33----------
could


---------62:35----------
right the second thing that we're going


---------62:36----------
to do


---------62:38----------
is point out their reluctance


---------62:43----------
so i use the word reluctance here


---------62:46----------
slightly different from resistance so i


---------62:48----------
think resistance is something that we


---------62:49----------
understand


---------62:51----------
but reluctance is a better way to frame


---------62:54----------
things for your clients


---------62:56----------
because reluctance implies who's in


---------62:58----------
control


---------63:04----------
we are the coach


---------63:07----------
i was hoping the opposite so if you kind


---------63:08----------
of like think about


---------63:12----------
50 50. well done jake so i when i think


---------63:14----------
about reluctance right so like when i


---------63:16----------
ask the question what makes you


---------63:17----------
reluctant to go to the gym


---------63:20----------
in my mind maybe i'm wrong here right


---------63:21----------
because i screwed up ohm's law so it's


---------63:23----------
not like i'm right


---------63:25----------
so this could be some weird frame that


---------63:26----------
i've developed that doesn't actually


---------63:28----------
translate makes sense for other human


---------63:29----------
beings happens from time to time


---------63:32----------
but when i think about what makes you


---------63:33----------
reluctant to go to the gym it sort of


---------63:35----------
implies that the control is within the


---------63:37----------
client's hand


---------63:40----------
does that make sense


---------63:43----------
if not jake i'd love to hear your


---------63:45----------
perspective because chances are you're


---------63:46----------
right


---------63:48----------
i felt like


---------63:50----------
you're reluctant because like it's like


---------63:52----------
a dog that's like reluctant to move and


---------63:54----------
you're like pulling it like i'm leading


---------63:56----------
that's right


---------63:57----------
i see i see so i think that makes sense


---------63:59----------
so i think once again i think it's my


---------64:01----------
fault for not setting the stage properly


---------64:04----------
um


---------64:05----------
yeah that's why i'm sort of using a


---------64:06----------
different word because i think what


---------64:08----------
you're describing is resistance


---------64:10----------
so like if you're trying to take the


---------64:12----------
client somewhere and they don't want to


---------64:13----------
go there that's resistance


---------64:15----------
hence the whole point so i totally get


---------64:17----------
where you're coming from i think it's


---------64:18----------
basically you know the model that we use


---------64:21----------
is what you sort of said so what that's


---------64:23----------
why i'm sort of suggesting that y'all


---------64:26----------
change the word when you're talking to


---------64:28----------
the client


---------64:30----------
and you kind of use like what makes you


---------64:32----------
reluctant to go to the gym


---------64:34----------
because what you're sort of saying is


---------64:35----------
that ultimately it's within their


---------64:37----------
control


---------64:38----------
um it's the whole reason i'm introducing


---------64:41----------
a new term because i think it's slightly


---------64:42----------
different


---------64:44----------
so um


---------64:46----------
and so this is where you know as you


---------64:48----------
start to explore their resistance like


---------64:50----------
what makes you reluctant what would it


---------64:52----------
be like if you went to the gym


---------64:54----------
what would it feel like if you could go


---------64:56----------
to the gym how would you feel about


---------64:57----------
yourself


---------64:59----------
and then what does it feel like to not


---------65:01----------
be able to go to the gym


---------65:04----------
you know or do you really think


---------65:05----------
genuinely that you can't go to the gym


---------65:07----------
or you think that you could go to the


---------65:09----------
gym but something's getting in the way


---------65:11----------
so start to ask some of these questions


---------65:13----------
and then you know eventually you can get


---------65:15----------
to specific questions like you try to


---------65:16----------
figure out is this an issue of a hum god


---------65:18----------
or is this issue of some scott like i


---------65:20----------
want to go to the gym but the second i


---------65:22----------
step in the doors i get an overwhelming


---------65:24----------
sense of anxiety and i want to turn


---------65:26----------
around and run away that sounds more


---------65:28----------
like some scar


---------65:30----------
whereas because remember that the some


---------65:31----------
scar is the activity of an emotion that


---------65:33----------
arises in your mind like suddenly and


---------65:36----------
with a hum guard it's sort of a sense of


---------65:37----------
identity and then you can try to figure


---------65:39----------
out because each of those is going to


---------65:40----------
have a different approach if that sort


---------65:42----------
of makes sense one is going to be


---------65:43----------
combating the subscribe in the present


---------65:45----------
the second is sort of like if i believe


---------65:47----------
i'm someone who can never get healthy


---------65:49----------
you have to sort of


---------65:50----------
address that from an a hum car


---------65:52----------
standpoint


---------65:54----------
okay


---------65:55----------
um the other important thing here when


---------65:57----------
dealing with resistance


---------65:59----------
is


---------66:01----------
you need to be really focused on like


---------66:04----------
actions versus outcomes


---------66:09----------
okay so our clients will sometimes have


---------66:11----------
perfectionistic mindsets


---------66:16----------
and the perfectionistic mindset comes


---------66:18----------
from resistance


---------66:20----------
so what's going to happen if they like


---------66:22----------
have this perfectionistic mindset and


---------66:24----------
they try to do something


---------66:26----------
is that they're going to fail


---------66:28----------
and then it's going to destroy their


---------66:29----------
motivation


---------66:30----------
right decreases motivation


---------66:33----------
so what you want to try to frame things


---------66:35----------
as is like what i'd call the price of


---------66:37----------
tuition


---------66:38----------
right like emphasize that what we're


---------66:39----------
doing here working towards your goal is


---------66:42----------
like a long-term thing it's not a


---------66:43----------
success or a failure it's not even


---------66:45----------
binary


---------66:46----------
we'll we'll talk about this a little bit


---------66:47----------
more tomorrow but in terms of how to


---------66:49----------
frame goals


---------66:50----------
but that it's a long-term engagement


---------66:52----------
because it takes time to figure these


---------66:54----------
things out and this is where your


---------66:56----------
attitude as a coach is going to be


---------66:58----------
really important because this is one of


---------67:00----------
the things that we do as coaches that


---------67:02----------
you will not recognize that you are


---------67:03----------
doing and your client will not recognize


---------67:05----------
that you are doing but you are


---------67:06----------
absolutely doing which is modeling


---------67:07----------
behavior


---------67:10----------
so remember that just like we learned


---------67:12----------
slang your client is going to be picking


---------67:16----------
up things from you


---------67:18----------
so when your client sets a goal for


---------67:20----------
themselves and they fail and they come


---------67:23----------
in


---------67:24----------
and they feel like a failure and you


---------67:26----------
don't treat them like a failure


---------67:28----------
that's gonna start to rewire their


---------67:30----------
neurons


---------67:31----------
right so sometimes clients will get this


---------67:33----------
question how do i change my self-talk


---------67:35----------
and the answer is by listening to


---------67:37----------
someone else who like talks to you in a


---------67:39----------
different way so if we look at why why


---------67:41----------
do some people have negative self-talk


---------67:42----------
it's not like random


---------67:44----------
they have negative self-talk because


---------67:46----------
they were conditioned to have negative


---------67:47----------
self-talk they had emotionally abusive


---------67:49----------
parents who always blame them for


---------67:50----------
everything and so then they learned how


---------67:52----------
to talk to themselves like in a blaming


---------67:54----------
kind of way and so as a coach as you


---------67:57----------
model


---------67:58----------
a certain approach to failure they will


---------68:01----------
start to like pick up on that


---------68:04----------
and eventually what will happen remember


---------68:05----------
the goal of coaching is to have your


---------68:07----------
client no longer need to come and why is


---------68:09----------
that how does that work it's because the


---------68:11----------
process that you do with them they're


---------68:13----------
able to like do on their own


---------68:15----------
right so when you kind of when they come


---------68:17----------
in and they fail and you're like wow man


---------68:19----------
that sucks you're expressing empathy


---------68:21----------
you're expressing compassion hey by the


---------68:22----------
way you don't have to beat yourself up


---------68:25----------
i'm noticing that you beat yourself up


---------68:27----------
what's up with that where does that come


---------68:29----------
from


---------68:30----------
i'm noticing that i'm kind of wondering


---------68:33----------
because i've heard you kind of say


---------68:34----------
certain things you know do you sometimes


---------68:36----------
like are you surprised at all that you


---------68:38----------
failed


---------68:39----------
because i've heard you say some things


---------68:41----------
that would make me think that like you


---------68:42----------
were actually expecting to fail


---------68:44----------
that on some deep level like you thought


---------68:46----------
that you were gonna fail because you are


---------68:48----------
a failure what do you think about that


---------68:50----------
they're like oh [ __ ] i never quite like


---------68:53----------
yeah it's absolutely true but i never


---------68:54----------
realized that then you asked the next


---------68:56----------
question


---------68:57----------
if you actually believe you're a failure


---------68:59----------
and you expect to fail what do you think


---------69:01----------
that does to your chances of success


---------69:03----------
they're like oh my god


---------69:05----------
and then you've done something really


---------69:06----------
magical there


---------69:07----------
because what you've managed to do is you


---------69:10----------
managed to say that it's not you that's


---------69:12----------
being a failure it's your belief


---------69:15----------
that you're a failure that causes you to


---------69:17----------
fail


---------69:18----------
so i want y'all to answer this question


---------69:21----------
okay please get it right i am a failure


---------69:25----------
i believe


---------69:27----------
i


---------69:28----------
am a failure


---------69:32----------
which causes


---------69:35----------
me


---------69:36----------
to fail


---------69:37----------
what's the difference between these two


---------69:39----------
statements


---------69:44----------
one is a fact


---------69:46----------
absolutely what's the other one


---------69:49----------
there's like distance feeling like a


---------69:50----------
belief yeah


---------69:52----------
distance


---------69:54----------
emotion


---------69:56----------
right


---------69:58----------
this is it


---------70:00----------
when when your clients get distance


---------70:03----------
when the facts that control their life


---------70:06----------
become emotions


---------70:08----------
their life can change


---------70:10----------
huge huge impact


---------70:12----------
happens subtly happens slowly happens


---------70:15----------
because you model it


---------70:17----------
okay


---------70:18----------
so the next thing to kind of emphasize


---------70:20----------
is that when you're dealing with


---------70:22----------
failures


---------70:23----------
when you're dealing with clients who set


---------70:24----------
goals we want to focus as coaches on


---------70:28----------
patterns


---------70:30----------
not outcomes


---------70:34----------
okay so this is going to be one of the


---------70:35----------
ways that we kind of become action


---------70:37----------
oriented


---------70:38----------
but like asking your clients like what's


---------70:40----------
the pattern here


---------70:43----------
so i'll give you guys like a good


---------70:44----------
example of this right so someone says


---------70:46----------
okay i want to start eating healthy i'm


---------70:48----------
going to adopt a diet i did it for four


---------70:49----------
days and then i screwed up i couldn't


---------70:51----------
even last a week i failed gg i suck i


---------70:55----------
can't diet i'm undisciplined i'm lazy


---------70:59----------
right so what we want to notice is like


---------71:00----------
what's the pattern like what why were


---------71:02----------
you able to succeed for four days and


---------71:04----------
then what happened on day five what


---------71:06----------
happened on day four


---------71:08----------
so i am a failure


---------71:11----------
as you look at the pattern


---------71:13----------
oh like


---------71:16----------
um you know my mom called me and like


---------71:18----------
yelled at me because


---------71:20----------
you know she thought i was a terrible


---------71:21----------
person and on day five i ate whatever i


---------71:24----------
broke my diet or i stayed up late too


---------71:27----------
late playing video games


---------71:29----------
and i was like three in the morning and


---------71:31----------
i got the munchies


---------71:32----------
or my friends came over and we all got


---------71:34----------
high


---------71:35----------
and then i got the munchies


---------71:38----------
right so like as you point out the


---------71:40----------
patterns and things


---------71:43----------
this is important because the


---------71:44----------
responsibility of the success or the


---------71:47----------
failure no longer is in the person


---------71:50----------
it has to do with the actions or the


---------71:51----------
environment


---------71:54----------
and then what happens is as you guys


---------71:55----------
like point out these patterns instead of


---------71:57----------
oh you're just you're lazy and you suck


---------71:59----------
at life oh like that's interesting so it


---------72:01----------
seems like


---------72:02----------
you're able to diet fine unless you're


---------72:05----------
smoking pot


---------72:06----------
what do you think about that


---------72:08----------
and then what we kind of get to is like


---------72:10----------
then we're going to kind of enter the


---------72:11----------
realm of motivational interviewing


---------72:13----------
what's more important


---------72:19----------
dieting


---------72:20----------
or getting high


---------72:23----------
and then what you'll uncover is actually


---------72:25----------
getting highs more important because i


---------72:26----------
have anxiety


---------72:28----------
and so then what they're actually


---------72:29----------
choosing they don't realize this right


---------72:31----------
they're like oh i just suck


---------72:32----------
but what they're actually choosing is


---------72:34----------
dieting versus anxiety


---------72:38----------
or dieting versus


---------72:41----------
social interaction


---------72:43----------
and it's like well no wonder you don't


---------72:44----------
diet


---------72:46----------
and once you say that to them it's like


---------72:48----------
a light bulb goes off oh it's not just


---------72:50----------
because i'm an idiot it's like oh


---------72:52----------
there's an actual cost


---------72:53----------
and then you can work on clarifying the


---------72:55----------
intent and you can overcome the


---------72:56----------
resistance and then they'll actually die


---------72:58----------
right you can start to set appropriate


---------73:00----------
goals the goal is not to diet because as


---------73:02----------
long as your friends are coming over and


---------73:04----------
you're getting high there's no point in


---------73:05----------
dieting but this is what they do right


---------73:07----------
they focus on the goal they're like i


---------73:08----------
need to lose weight i need a diet and


---------73:09----------
then they beat themselves up when they


---------73:11----------
fail whereas they don't realize that the


---------73:12----------
reason they're failing is because


---------73:14----------
they're getting high and getting the


---------73:15----------
munchies


---------73:16----------
so if you really want to succeed what


---------73:18----------
you have to focus on is setting limits


---------73:20----------
around marijuana use and like seeing


---------73:22----------
those friends or you need to focus on


---------73:23----------
getting sober first


---------73:25----------
or what you want to do is conclude hey


---------73:27----------
i'm not willing to do that i


---------73:29----------
like my friends and i like getting high


---------73:31----------
so it's cool so then like let's forget


---------73:32----------
about dieting and then pick something


---------73:34----------
else that you want to work on


---------73:37----------
right and then if you say okay then


---------73:39----------
let's forget about dieting what are they


---------73:40----------
gonna do


---------73:43----------
they're gonna resist that absolutely


---------73:46----------
right what are they going to say


---------73:49----------
whoa whoa whoa no i want to do that


---------73:54----------
and then so when they say whoa whoa what


---------73:56----------
comes next


---------73:59----------
i don't want to give it up


---------74:01----------
whoa whoa whoa i don't


---------74:06----------
want


---------74:07----------
to


---------74:08----------
give


---------74:08----------
up


---------74:09----------
dieting


---------74:11----------
what the [ __ ] that's where motivation


---------74:14----------
comes from you have done your job as a


---------74:15----------
coach because they came in saying i want


---------74:17----------
to diet but i don't want to die


---------74:20----------
and now through this verbal jiu-jitsu


---------74:22----------
which is what most of like these mi


---------74:24----------
techniques are


---------74:25----------
they're telling you i don't want to give


---------74:28----------
up dieting hold on a second i'm not


---------74:31----------
ready to give up on that goal well


---------74:33----------
and and you know don't show them don't


---------74:36----------
show them that you've tricked them into


---------74:38----------
being motivated


---------74:39----------
gotta be sneaky


---------74:41----------
and then you're like wait


---------74:42----------
why don't you want to give it up


---------74:44----------
help me understand that oh clarification


---------74:46----------
of intent reinforcing stuff as they


---------74:49----------
start to voice and they start to tell


---------74:50----------
you well it's important to me because of


---------74:51----------
this this this all those statements are


---------74:54----------
going to build motivation


---------74:56----------
right what about dieting is important to


---------74:58----------
you because and this is where like it


---------75:00----------
all ties together desires


---------75:02----------
values


---------75:04----------
the pot is up here


---------75:06----------
what do you care about right and as you


---------75:08----------
have that conversation you're gonna move


---------75:10----------
them from here to here y'all see that


---------75:14----------
beautiful


---------75:16----------
okay


---------75:18----------
all right so the last thing that we're


---------75:20----------
gonna kind of end up with is remember


---------75:22----------
that this is a high-level kind of


---------75:24----------
principle


---------75:25----------
that your job as a coach is to be the


---------75:27----------
buddhi for your clients


---------75:29----------
right when they're in session with you


---------75:31----------
buddhi is going to be stronger than


---------75:33----------
manas and ahamkar


---------75:36----------
and generally speaking when we see


---------75:37----------
positive behavioral change it's when the


---------75:40----------
buddhi rises to the surface


---------75:42----------
and so this is where like we also go


---------75:43----------
back to like vidya versus neon


---------75:47----------
and then also like explicit versus


---------75:49----------
implicit memory


---------75:54----------
because as you're asking these kinds of


---------75:56----------
questions and pointing these things out


---------75:58----------
to them they're gonna be having like


---------76:00----------
revelations


---------76:02----------
and they're gonna they're gonna start


---------76:03----------
like you're gonna argue with them like


---------76:04----------
hey man i think you should stop dieting


---------76:06----------
because it seems like social interaction


---------76:07----------
and like hanging out with your friends


---------76:09----------
is really important to you they're like


---------76:10----------
no no i don't want to do that


---------76:12----------
and i'm like all right explain to me why


---------76:14----------
like is it social interaction important


---------76:16----------
to you yeah but dieting and blah blah


---------76:17----------
blah blah well if i diet like then i'll


---------76:20----------
be more confident dating


---------76:22----------
and so that then it kind of comes down


---------76:23----------
to and then you kind of like you know


---------76:24----------
lay out a specific goal which is you


---------76:26----------
know the next time your your friends


---------76:28----------
want to come over i think what you


---------76:29----------
really have to ask yourself is what's


---------76:31----------
more important to you


---------76:32----------
seeing my friends now are like


---------76:34----------
recognizing that i'm taking one step


---------76:36----------
towards


---------76:37----------
like


---------76:38----------
being confident myself so i can find a


---------76:40----------
romantic partner what's more important


---------76:42----------
to you as a person


---------76:44----------
and once you kind of


---------76:46----------
get down that track and you put the


---------76:48----------
choice to them you put the cost to them


---------76:50----------
they'll start to make the right choice


---------76:53----------
questions


---------76:58----------
going back to


---------77:00----------
um


---------77:01----------
one of the things in a hom car when we


---------77:03----------
were talking about reluctance


---------77:05----------
it sounded a lot like that was


---------77:07----------
reluctance is


---------77:09----------
where the barrier between what they know


---------77:11----------
and need to know is


---------77:14----------
yeah


---------77:16----------
uh i would say


---------77:19----------
so when i think about know and need to


---------77:21----------
know


---------77:21----------
i don't really think about reluctance i


---------77:24----------
think about that's your job as a coach


---------77:27----------
right so that's tha that's woody that's


---------77:29----------
the buddhi gap so when you talk to


---------77:31----------
someone like y'all may know this even


---------77:32----------
people who are like watching stream will


---------77:33----------
understand this that like


---------77:35----------
people can be stuck in from the outside


---------77:37----------
you can see exactly what they need to do


---------77:39----------
the problem is that if you go from like


---------77:41----------
where you are


---------77:44----------
where they are to where they need to go


---------77:46----------
they can't make that jump


---------77:48----------
right you just need to stop drinking


---------77:50----------
every day easy


---------77:51----------
then all your problems will be fixed so


---------77:53----------
that that knowledge gap is kind of where


---------77:56----------
you use reflective listening like there


---------77:58----------
may be resistance right there but as you


---------78:00----------
use these kinds of questions you'll


---------78:02----------
start to move them along the gap


---------78:04----------
the issue about reluctance is a way to


---------78:07----------
access


---------78:08----------
what their resistance is


---------78:11----------
and it's like a question that kind of


---------78:12----------
empowers them so the reason you want to


---------78:14----------
say like okay what's your reluctance


---------78:16----------
it's


---------78:17----------
asking that question is exploring that


---------78:20----------
barrier does that make sense


---------78:22----------
because they haven't really thought


---------78:23----------
about it


---------78:24----------
or what they've thought about is in one


---------78:25----------
direction but they missed something else


---------78:28----------
because generally speaking if they found


---------78:30----------
the right answer they probably would


---------78:31----------
have changed


---------78:32----------
right all of our clients have made


---------78:33----------
progress on their own in a thousand


---------78:35----------
different dimensions


---------78:36----------
and so if you think about


---------78:38----------
you know why do they get stuck in some


---------78:39----------
places and don't get stuck in other


---------78:41----------
places those are the places that they


---------78:42----------
need you as a coach to help them sort of


---------78:44----------
sort through


---------78:46----------
does that help


---------78:52----------
okay other questions


---------78:56----------
i was wondering when a client's kind of


---------78:58----------
going back and forth between like oh i


---------79:00----------
want to do something oh i don't want to


---------79:01----------
do something i want to give it up i


---------79:02----------
don't um is there any value in kind of


---------79:05----------
pointing that out to them that like


---------79:06----------
they're kind of flip-flopping between it


---------79:08----------
absolutely right so that's the whole


---------79:10----------
point of working with ambivalence


---------79:12----------
is so the value of that is first of all


---------79:16----------
there's like a lot of like shame right


---------79:18----------
so if i set a goal for myself and i


---------79:19----------
don't understand why i can't accomplish


---------79:21----------
it i end up beating myself up


---------79:24----------
it affects my ahamkar right if it


---------79:26----------
solidifies enough then i start to think


---------79:28----------
of myself as someone who's like an idiot


---------79:30----------
can't do anything


---------79:32----------
and then that in turn is going to affect


---------79:33----------
all my neuroscientific calculations of


---------79:35----------
success


---------79:36----------
and make me prone to not do it


---------79:38----------
so as you start to point out to them oh


---------79:40----------
there's like actually a good reason to


---------79:42----------
not diet right because like smoking pot


---------79:44----------
is like really important for your


---------79:45----------
anxiety as you kind of point that out to


---------79:47----------
them


---------79:48----------
there's a lot of subtle advantages the


---------79:51----------
first is that it'll break apart the


---------79:52----------
cycle of oh i'm i suck and therefore i'm


---------79:55----------
a failure and stuff like that so it'll


---------79:56----------
start to chip away at it because you're


---------79:57----------
not stupid it's just a choice between a


---------79:59----------
and b and we'll get to this in goal


---------80:01----------
setting in a second so human beings


---------80:03----------
respond a lot better to choices than


---------80:05----------
direction


---------80:08----------
so if you want a human to like choose


---------80:10----------
like to actually


---------80:12----------
do something it's good to make a choice


---------80:15----------
right if you want and we'll kind of get


---------80:17----------
to this where like if someone wants to


---------80:18----------
get in shape and you say


---------80:21----------
okay you need to go to the gym three


---------80:22----------
days a week that is actually science has


---------80:24----------
shown us research has shown us that that


---------80:26----------
is not as effective as asking someone


---------80:29----------
hey if you want to get into shape like


---------80:30----------
what do you think would be the most


---------80:32----------
effective working on your diet or


---------80:34----------
exercising and they'll say okay i think


---------80:36----------
some kind of exercise would be like the


---------80:38----------
best place to start okay


---------80:40----------
so if it's some kind of exercise do you


---------80:41----------
think it would be useful like do


---------80:42----------
something at home


---------80:44----------
or like would you want to like go


---------80:46----------
somewhere


---------80:47----------
and kind of just focus on exercise and


---------80:49----------
then you'll it'll be really interesting


---------80:50----------
because someone may say well i'll never


---------80:52----------
do it at home


---------80:53----------
so i should probably go somewhere


---------80:55----------
and if you have that same damn


---------80:57----------
conversation with that person and you


---------80:59----------
say hey i think you should go to the gym


---------81:02----------
they won't go


---------81:03----------
but if they come to it


---------81:06----------
through their own reasoning


---------81:08----------
because then if they say like oh i i


---------81:09----------
should go to the gym because i won't


---------81:11----------
exercise at home


---------81:13----------
and then you talk about going to the gym


---------81:15----------
and their social anxiety when they go to


---------81:16----------
the gym they've already set themselves


---------81:19----------
up for the advantage of going to the gym


---------81:20----------
so you're one leg up on the barrier


---------81:22----------
already because it's coming from them


---------81:24----------
does that make sense


---------81:28----------
if i went a little bit off track there


---------81:29----------
but i think absolutely playing with that


---------81:31----------
ambivalence is crucial


---------81:34----------
pointing out that negative pointing out


---------81:35----------
the cost


---------81:37----------
is very important


---------81:40----------
there's even an element of like positive


---------81:42----------
a hum god there


---------81:43----------
so when you sort of frame a question to


---------81:46----------
someone and you say


---------81:47----------
you know there's advantage for there's


---------81:49----------
option a or option b


---------81:51----------
and then on a given day if they choose


---------81:53----------
the right option


---------81:54----------
they start to build like a positive


---------81:56----------
sense of identity i'm someone that can


---------81:58----------
move towards my goals i'm someone that's


---------82:01----------
able to actually make a change in my


---------82:02----------
life because i made the right choice


---------82:04----------
i'm doing this because i care about it


---------82:06----------
i'm doing it because it's my duty i'm


---------82:08----------
doing it because it's my dharma and then


---------82:10----------
that actually builds their confidence


---------82:12----------
and then adjusts the the behavioral


---------82:14----------
action equation in the right way


---------82:20----------
okay


---------82:20----------
other questions


---------82:25----------
okay


---------82:26----------
so let me summarize all right so today


---------82:29----------
we talked about resistance


---------82:30----------
so yesterday we covered intent which is


---------82:32----------
clarifying like the energy inputs or why


---------82:35----------
they want to do something and anytime we


---------82:37----------
try to do something there's going to be


---------82:38----------
like something that keeps us from


---------82:40----------
engaging in that action that's what we


---------82:42----------
call resistance we went over signs of


---------82:44----------
resistance like statements clients will


---------82:46----------
make which sound logical


---------82:48----------
but will be like self-defeating


---------82:50----------
statements that sort of signal to you


---------82:52----------
that they're not actually motivated to


---------82:53----------
act this is stuff like i want to but so


---------82:57----------
butts by the way are like a prime


---------82:59----------
example this is a great idea but you


---------83:01----------
know dot dot dot so i'm not that i can't


---------83:04----------
do that other people can do that i'm not


---------83:07----------
able to it'll be a waste of time what if


---------83:09----------
it doesn't work


---------83:10----------
you know


---------83:12----------
like i don't think i'm ready i'll do it


---------83:14----------
once


---------83:16----------
you know all of those are signs of


---------83:17----------
resistance so as you kind of hear those


---------83:19----------
statements start to dig into them


---------83:21----------
and as you dig into them you'll discover


---------83:23----------
that there's stuff going on in terms of


---------83:24----------
mana samskar or hamkar either it's an


---------83:27----------
identity that they've built up either


---------83:28----------
some kind of emotional block or some


---------83:30----------
kind of pattern that like they've


---------83:32----------
learned right where it's like triggering


---------83:34----------
in them and then they like have


---------83:35----------
difficulty engaging in the action


---------83:37----------
as you


---------83:39----------
uncover that stuff you're going to


---------83:40----------
extend the barrier of their


---------83:42----------
understanding you're going to point out


---------83:43----------
discrepancies you're going to point out


---------83:44----------
conflicts and in that process


---------83:47----------
you'll start to move them towards like


---------83:49----------
motivation they'll start to make


---------83:51----------
discoveries about themselves as they


---------83:53----------
discover some of these things what we


---------83:55----------
kind of went to you guys remember the


---------83:56----------
fact of i am a failure versus i believe


---------83:59----------
i'm a failure which actually causes me


---------84:01----------
to fail you'll start to move in that


---------84:03----------
direction so there's like neuronal


---------84:04----------
rewiring that goes on


---------84:08----------
as you start to do that kind of stuff as


---------84:09----------
you start to ask questions as you start


---------84:11----------
to extend the barrier of their


---------84:12----------
understanding as you start to model the


---------84:14----------
right kind of behavior


---------84:16----------
as you start to model inquiry instead of


---------84:18----------
judgment


---------84:21----------
then they'll start to actually naturally


---------84:23----------
move in the right direction and you'll


---------84:24----------
kind of get them primed to like set up a


---------84:26----------
right the right kind of goal in the


---------84:28----------
right kind of action


---------84:29----------
okay


---------84:31----------
questions


---------84:34----------
awesome so y'all are welcome to step out


---------84:36----------
we're gonna hang around for about 15


---------84:38----------
minutes


---------84:38----------
um i'm going to answer questions on


---------84:40----------
stream do you guys want to stick around


---------84:41----------
and answer questions


---------84:43----------
you'll want to step out i'm indifferent


---------84:45----------
by the way okay so questions from chat


---------85:01----------
okay


---------85:06----------
so oh what would a coach do if they ask


---------85:09----------
what's your reluctance and the client


---------85:11----------
says i don't know


---------85:21----------
first thought is what does i don't know


---------85:23----------
mean


---------85:25----------
but then that might also lead to an idol


---------85:26----------
now


---------85:27----------
so how would you how would you approach


---------85:29----------
that with a client jake when we say when


---------85:31----------
you say what does i don't know mean


---------85:34----------
help us understand what the different


---------85:35----------
things that i don't know could mean


---------85:38----------
sure so there's like confliction so like


---------85:41----------
i want to go to the gym or this and it's


---------85:43----------
like i don't know i don't know what to


---------85:44----------
do


---------85:45----------
um


---------85:46----------
the second is like i feel stupid if i


---------85:48----------
give an answer so i can't say anything


---------85:49----------
so


---------85:50----------
i don't know


---------85:52----------
um and the other is like they generally


---------85:54----------
just have no idea


---------85:56----------
yeah so that's a really important point


---------85:57----------
so like i don't know is a catch-all


---------86:00----------
phrase that actually means different


---------86:02----------
things the first is i don't know can


---------86:04----------
mean conflict so for example like let's


---------86:06----------
just use the example of like what do you


---------86:08----------
want to eat for dinner tonight do you


---------86:09----------
want thai or do you want pizza i don't


---------86:10----------
know it doesn't mean that i i don't know


---------86:13----------
like i don't it means that there's a


---------86:16----------
part of me that wants thai there's a


---------86:17----------
part of me that wants pizza


---------86:19----------
right the second thing the second reason


---------86:21----------
we say i don't know is because we're


---------86:22----------
judging our response


---------86:24----------
so like we're not happy with what we're


---------86:26----------
gonna say so we say i don't know


---------86:28----------
and then third thing that jake pointed


---------86:30----------
out is sometimes people just don't know


---------86:32----------
so i think it's exploring the i don't


---------86:34----------
know that then helps people know and


---------86:36----------
that's a prime example of the barrier of


---------86:38----------
understanding y'all get that


---------86:40----------
and then like once you clarify that like


---------86:41----------
oh they're like oh i'm actually


---------86:43----------
conflicted it's not that i don't know


---------86:44----------
it's that i have good reasons to want


---------86:46----------
both things


---------86:49----------
great um so how do i trust myself when i


---------86:52----------
keep failing my goals


---------87:04----------
i think this goes back to the idea of


---------87:08----------
like judging yourself based on the


---------87:09----------
outcomes


---------87:12----------
i mean


---------87:13----------
in the exact same situation we can argue


---------87:16----------
you're still trying


---------87:18----------
right if you have repetitive goals that


---------87:20----------
you keep attempting


---------87:22----------
then that's positive progress because


---------87:24----------
you're still attempting


---------87:26----------
right so there's a reframe there any


---------87:29----------
other perspectives how would you all


---------87:30----------
help a client who comes in and says how


---------87:32----------
do i trust myself when i keep failing my


---------87:34----------
goals so one option is like


---------87:37----------
you may keep failing but at least you


---------87:38----------
keep trying and if we really think about


---------87:41----------
who's more likely to succeed in the one


---------87:44----------
in the end the person who fails once or


---------87:47----------
the person who keeps failing


---------87:48----------
it's interesting right


---------87:52----------
i think oh i think i would explore like


---------87:54----------
how they're coming up with their goals


---------87:56----------
and like what makes them keep failing at


---------87:58----------
these goals and like


---------87:59----------
what makes them not trust themselves and


---------88:01----------
maybe try and reiterate what what goals


---------88:04----------
they have


---------88:05----------
right well said so it's exploring this


---------88:07----------
is it's all about extending the barrier


---------88:08----------
of understanding so here's the last one


---------88:10----------
that i i


---------88:11----------
end up with how do i trust myself when i


---------88:14----------
keep failing my goals


---------88:17----------
jake what are you thinking thinking what


---------88:19----------
i'm thinking yeah i'm i'm like why is


---------88:22----------
how much you trust yourself based on


---------88:24----------
like your whether or not you succeed in


---------88:26----------
the goal


---------88:28----------
great right so what's the relationship


---------88:30----------
between trust and failing and i'd even


---------88:33----------
go as far as to say that


---------88:35----------
what's the cause and what's the effect


---------88:36----------
do you keep fa do you fail to trust


---------88:39----------
yourself because you keep failing


---------88:41----------
or is it the lack and trust


---------88:44----------
the lack of trust you have in yourself


---------88:46----------
that causes you to fail


---------88:48----------
right so this we see a lot with clients


---------88:50----------
it's a self-fulfilling prophecy


---------88:52----------
and they confuse one with the other


---------88:55----------
do i do i believe i'm a failure because


---------88:58----------
i keep failing or do i keep failing


---------89:00----------
because i believe i'm a failure


---------89:02----------
and so that revelation can be incredibly


---------89:05----------
empowering for people oh crap


---------89:08----------
like


---------89:09----------
i'm setting myself up to fail


---------89:13----------
great answers by the way


---------89:15----------
um


---------89:16----------
okay


---------89:21----------
uh


---------89:26----------
i'm trying to find a good question


---------89:30----------
um


---------89:37----------
oh here's a good one should i get


---------89:39----------
coaching even though i should be getting


---------89:40----------
more professional help what do y'all


---------89:42----------
think


---------89:44----------
why not both


---------89:50----------
yeah other responses


---------89:54----------
i think steve has captured it but i'm


---------89:56----------
just curious if other people would like


---------89:57----------
to add to that


---------90:02----------
i i don't know exactly how i'd approach


---------90:05----------
this but i feel like they already know


---------90:07----------
what that is that they want to do i


---------90:09----------
point that out in some way


---------90:11----------
absolutely so what do you think this


---------90:12----------
person should do eli


---------90:14----------
what do you think they want to do


---------90:16----------
it's i'd say it seems like you want to


---------90:18----------
get professional help


---------90:20----------
so do you think they should get


---------90:21----------
professional help


---------90:25----------
yeah i guess if they think so


---------90:27----------
right yeah


---------90:29----------
so it's it's should i get coaching


---------90:31----------
there's a should


---------90:33----------
even though i should be getting more


---------90:35----------
professional help like there it is


---------90:36----------
there's the intent conflict


---------90:38----------
two shoulds in one sentence


---------90:41----------
right so it's like


---------90:44----------
the other question there is why don't


---------90:46----------
you get professional help


---------90:48----------
even though i should be getting more


---------90:50----------
professional help than like what's


---------90:51----------
stopping you from getting professional


---------90:52----------
help like what's up with that


---------90:55----------
you know


---------90:56----------
i love these questions because they're


---------90:57----------
they're really good examples of exactly


---------90:59----------
what we deal with in coaching so here's


---------91:01----------
another one how do i make my first


---------91:02----------
coaching session smoother


---------91:08----------
except that it's going to be awkward and


---------91:09----------
you kind of have to build a rapport


---------91:13----------
other responses great


---------91:16----------
i'm curious why they expect it not to go


---------91:18----------
smoothly


---------91:21----------
right


---------91:22----------
or why they expect it to go smoothly or


---------91:24----------
why it has to go smooth in the first


---------91:25----------
place


---------91:27----------
like think about this the first time you


---------91:29----------
do something like what's your


---------91:30----------
expectation about it going smoothly just


---------91:32----------
let it be rocky you'll figure it out


---------91:34----------
your coach will figure it out


---------91:37----------
why is it why is the responsibility on


---------91:39----------
you


---------91:40----------
to make your first coaching session


---------91:42----------
smoother you're the client you're just


---------91:45----------
supposed to show up if it's not smooth


---------91:47----------
that's the coach's problem


---------91:49----------
it's not on you you don't have to do


---------91:50----------
anything you just have to show up


---------91:53----------
right there they're the professionals


---------91:57----------
it's great


---------92:00----------
if i know my coach is doing verbal


---------92:02----------
jiu-jitsu on me will that change how i


---------92:03----------
respond to emotional interviewing


---------92:10----------
if someone knows that you're doing


---------92:11----------
motivational interviewing on you does it


---------92:13----------
change the way that you respond


---------92:16----------
no


---------92:17----------
we talked about that with the placebo


---------92:18----------
thing yesterday


---------92:21----------
yeah assuming there's belief there i


---------92:23----------
guess jake what do you think


---------92:26----------
um


---------92:27----------
yeah so i don't know how right this is


---------92:29----------
but i'm hearing like a bit of resistance


---------92:31----------
to the verbal jiu-jitsu so if you're


---------92:33----------
like realizing what's happening you're


---------92:35----------
like i'm not falling for this


---------92:38----------
yes


---------92:39----------
yeah oh go for it eli


---------92:42----------
i was gonna say like


---------92:44----------
kind of along what jake's saying that


---------92:46----------
like


---------92:47----------
noticing pointing out to them like oh


---------92:49----------
what is it that makes you want to resist


---------92:51----------
this you know like i'm trying to help


---------92:52----------
you or like this is the goal of this and


---------92:55----------
like what makes you want to resist it


---------92:57----------
sometimes you can get them to kind of


---------92:58----------
like throw themselves into it a little


---------93:00----------
bit too and say like oh here i am


---------93:02----------
resisting you i mean that can be really


---------93:04----------
helpful


---------93:05----------
so oddly enough like knowing the


---------93:07----------
techniques that your coach is doing is


---------93:09----------
not gonna negatively impact your


---------93:11----------
coaching experience in fact i don't know


---------93:14----------
if you all have had this observation but


---------93:16----------
like as clients learn to do what you do


---------93:20----------
how does that affect your coaching


---------93:21----------
relationship


---------93:23----------
it gets a lot smoother


---------93:25----------
is awesome


---------93:26----------
it's fantastic


---------93:28----------
right because now instead of the coach


---------93:30----------
doing it both of y'all are doing it and


---------93:32----------
you all are both working towards a


---------93:33----------
common goal so what i tend to find is


---------93:36----------
that


---------93:37----------
so i'll have clients when i work with


---------93:38----------
clients like a long time they'll select


---------93:40----------
start to say things like i knew you were


---------93:41----------
going to ask that question and then what


---------93:43----------
i find is that they're doing half of the


---------93:45----------
work that i was doing so we just moved


---------93:46----------
twice as fast it's actually great now


---------93:49----------
sometimes as eli pointed out there's a


---------93:51----------
resistance to it they're like ah


---------93:52----------
i'm not gonna let you trick me and it's


---------93:54----------
like


---------93:55----------
okay


---------93:57----------
so if you don't wanna work towards your


---------93:59----------
goals we don't have to


---------94:02----------
right it's not about trickery it's


---------94:04----------
really not and that's why we we explain


---------94:06----------
it in fact even if you look at group


---------94:08----------
coaching like what do we do the first


---------94:09----------
four weeks of group


---------94:11----------
we teach them how to do mental jujitsu


---------94:13----------
absolutely


---------94:15----------
right and what does that do once you


---------94:17----------
teach the group how to do verbal


---------94:18----------
jiu-jitsu


---------94:20----------
they practice on each other


---------94:22----------
yep and all of them know they're


---------94:24----------
practicing and i don't know if you all


---------94:25----------
remember but when we role play


---------94:28----------
right and you know that someone is doing


---------94:30----------
like reflective listening or open-ended


---------94:32----------
questions or whatever with you like you


---------94:33----------
still the real emotions still come out


---------94:35----------
right like i don't know if you'll


---------94:36----------
remember that but


---------94:38----------
so it still works it's kind of


---------94:40----------
interesting


---------94:41----------
um


---------94:43----------
all right so we've got time for one more


---------94:46----------
anything that y'all want to just share


---------94:48----------
or say


---------94:50----------
um


---------94:55----------
you don't have to well i'm digging for


---------94:56----------
another question but i just wanted to


---------94:57----------
give you all a chance to


---------94:59----------
share thoughts if you want to


---------95:02----------
yeah i mean i appreciate the additional


---------95:03----------
training like


---------95:05----------
just helping me so thanks


---------95:08----------
you're very welcome


---------95:11----------
um you know one thing i guess i would


---------95:12----------
say real quick is it seems like a lot of


---------95:14----------
the questions kind of have a lot of


---------95:16----------
it's like there's a lot of negative


---------95:18----------
anticipation of like what could happen


---------95:20----------
in coaching and i would say that in my


---------95:22----------
experience a lot of times that gets


---------95:24----------
dispelled pretty quickly over the course


---------95:26----------
of a few sessions


---------95:29----------
um


---------95:30----------
well said so i'm noticing that too


---------95:32----------
there's a lot of like


---------95:34----------
what if this happens and what if this


---------95:36----------
happens and like what if i i does it


---------95:38----------
like i need to make it smooth and like


---------95:40----------
you'll see that you guys see what eli is


---------95:42----------
saying it's it's a really good


---------95:43----------
observation that all these questions and


---------95:45----------
i don't think i'm maybe i'm selecting


---------95:46----------
for them


---------95:48----------
um but


---------95:49----------
you know i think there's a lot of them


---------95:53----------
um


---------95:54----------
okay last one


---------95:57----------
what do you do if you don't feel like


---------95:58----------
you're in control of your elec


---------95:59----------
reluctance


---------96:08----------
that sounds like something that coach


---------96:09----------
should help you work on


---------96:11----------
like that sounds like a person's taking


---------96:12----------
too much pressure


---------96:17----------
control is also a weird word to use


---------96:19----------
there


---------96:19----------
because we don't really control our


---------96:21----------
emotions


---------96:22----------
they just happen to us and then we


---------96:25----------
choose to engage with them or not


---------96:28----------
see that's that's the aha moment so like


---------96:30----------
you'll see in that question


---------96:32----------
it's a question that's setting you up to


---------96:34----------
fail because if you're like


---------96:36----------
no one's in control of their reluctance


---------96:38----------
if we were getting control of our


---------96:39----------
reluctance


---------96:42----------
we wouldn't be reluctant


---------96:44----------
right and so it's like teaching this


---------96:46----------
person that core concept that it starts


---------96:49----------
like there's nothing special like


---------96:51----------
if you're not in control of your


---------96:52----------
reluctance that's where everyone begins


---------96:55----------
right it's like that's perfectly


---------96:58----------
acceptable


---------96:59----------
and why are you trying to control it


---------97:01----------
it's how you react to it how you respond


---------97:03----------
to it


---------97:05----------
that ultimately is going to determine


---------97:06----------
your success or failure but if you're


---------97:08----------
getting caught up with beat not being in


---------97:10----------
control of it then you're like oh my god


---------97:12----------
i'm doing this wrong no you're doing it


---------97:14----------
just like every other human being who's


---------97:15----------
ever done it on the planet


---------97:16----------
but you get so caught up in the fact


---------97:18----------
that i'm not in control of my reluctance


---------97:19----------
that you don't actually learn how to


---------97:21----------
deal with it


---------97:23----------
so this is another thing that we kind of


---------97:24----------
do is more implicit at this point but we


---------97:26----------
sort of made it explicit early on in


---------97:28----------
terms of our coach curriculum


---------97:30----------
is that we're not trying to control


---------97:31----------
right we're trying to make choices we're


---------97:34----------
not trying to like


---------97:35----------
it's not like a win or lose or like


---------97:38----------
absolute control versus like that's not


---------97:40----------
how it works it's it's muddy it's messy


---------97:43----------
and once you kind of acknowledge that


---------97:45----------
once you actually surrender the idea of


---------97:47----------
control once you acknowledge that hey


---------97:49----------
i'm not in control of this and sometimes


---------97:50----------
the reluctance is going to win but


---------97:52----------
sometimes i'm going to win too


---------97:54----------
that's when you start to make positive


---------97:56----------
progress


---------97:58----------
okay last question how common is


---------97:59----------
resistance


---------98:04----------
uh universal


---------98:06----------
yep


---------98:07----------
yeah


---------98:08----------
i don't think i've encountered a client


---------98:09----------
without resistance


---------98:12----------
i don't know that i've encountered a


---------98:13----------
human without resistance


---------98:17----------
right so these are fundamental aspects


---------98:19----------
right so this is what


---------98:20----------
yeah i mean it's common so everything


---------98:22----------
that i think people are concerned about


---------98:24----------
i think eli pointed out well that you


---------98:26----------
know people are concerned about this


---------98:27----------
stuff it's totally fine these are all


---------98:29----------
valid concerns that i have and i think


---------98:30----------
