---------00:00----------
i could have been stronger i could have


---------00:02----------
stood up for myself


---------00:04----------
yep right so like like any time i try to


---------00:08----------
blame her


---------00:08----------
you're gonna say like i should have been


---------00:11----------
stronger


---------00:12----------
like you're gonna protect her by blaming


---------00:15----------
yourself


---------00:22----------
and so can you start by just telling me


---------00:23----------
um what i should call you today or what


---------00:26----------
you go by


---------00:28----------
you can just call me by my name gabriel


---------00:29----------
i think i'd actually prefer that because


---------00:31----------
it's gonna feel a bit more personal if


---------00:33----------
you don't mind okay sure


---------00:34----------
so gabriel and what did you want to talk


---------00:37----------
about today


---------00:39----------
so there's a few things uh i wanted to


---------00:43----------
you know uh introduce you to my past a


---------00:46----------
little bit so to speak because i think


---------00:47----------
it's gonna be helpful i'm a very open


---------00:49----------
person so


---------00:50----------
i don't really have an issue talking


---------00:51----------
about the


---------00:53----------
the [ __ ] i went through pretty much okay


---------00:55----------
and


---------00:57----------
uh something really good is happening to


---------00:59----------
me actually i


---------01:00----------
had some pretty severe social anxiety it


---------01:03----------
was


---------01:04----------
very bad pretty much and i came across


---------01:07----------
your content like two months ago


---------01:09----------
and your stuff and the interviews i


---------01:11----------
watched so many of them by now that


---------01:13----------
it has helped me so much like the


---------01:15----------
meditations the alternate nostril


---------01:17----------
breathing


---------01:17----------
like i'm doing a lot of stuff and it's


---------01:19----------
being very helpful and


---------01:21----------
senior stuff actually convinced me to


---------01:23----------
see a therapist as well because i was


---------01:24----------
very resistant for years and years i was


---------01:27----------
like


---------01:28----------
you know i always had that feeling of if


---------01:29----------
there's something wrong with me


---------01:31----------
and i can't fix it myself then no one


---------01:32----------
can and i was just like


---------01:34----------
i'm not gonna go see a therapist like


---------01:35----------
[ __ ] up it's not useful i had that


---------01:37----------
kind of mentality pretty much and


---------01:40----------
i saw your stuff in our cycle this guy's


---------01:42----------
a therapist he's pretty cool i guess


---------01:44----------
you know i'm gonna try at least and so


---------01:46----------
i'm seeing this therapist that's


---------01:48----------
actually


---------01:48----------
a friend of my family and it's been


---------01:50----------
great we we clicked


---------01:51----------
so it's nice and it's part of the topic


---------01:55----------
from today


---------01:56----------
i've dealt a lot with my anxiety and


---------01:58----------
it's a lot better


---------01:59----------
and then i'm noticing that underneath it


---------02:02----------
there's like this layer of


---------02:04----------
what i call depression it may or may not


---------02:06----------
be i don't actually have a diagnosis to


---------02:07----------
be honest


---------02:09----------
but you know for the longest time i


---------02:11----------
thought i didn't do things


---------02:13----------
just because i was anxious and then more


---------02:15----------
and more i lowered my anxiety


---------02:16----------
i noticed that there's something lying


---------02:19----------
underneath


---------02:20----------
that's like a total lack of motivation


---------02:23----------
focus concentration it's


---------02:26----------
you know i just don't have that impulse


---------02:28----------
i kind of don't want to call it an


---------02:29----------
impulse because it kind of has a bad


---------02:31----------
connotation to it but i don't have the


---------02:32----------
impulse to do the things that


---------02:34----------
i know i want to so i can rationalize


---------02:36----------
that i want to do something


---------02:38----------
but it's like my body doesn't respond in


---------02:40----------
a way


---------02:41----------
and my senses also feel very numb it's


---------02:44----------
like


---------02:44----------
it's gonna sound weird to put it this


---------02:46----------
way but i'm very into philosophy so


---------02:48----------
bear with me here uh it's like i see


---------02:51----------
things but i don't perceive them and


---------02:53----------
it's like i hear


---------02:54----------
things but i don't comprehend them and


---------02:56----------
it's like i touch things and i do not


---------02:58----------
feel them


---------02:59----------
that's kind of it


---------03:03----------
gabriel dude you're a poet my friend


---------03:06----------
thank you i actually wrote a lot of


---------03:07----------
poetry during high school i mean


---------03:09----------
yeah i know i mean you certainly have a


---------03:11----------
way with words i think you captured


---------03:13----------
the resistance to see the a therapist


---------03:17----------
and honestly the best way i've ever


---------03:19----------
heard


---------03:20----------
thank you which is which is that i i


---------03:23----------
mean the scent of it was perfect it's


---------03:24----------
like


---------03:25----------
if i can't fix it no one can fix it


---------03:27----------
right it's so weird


---------03:28----------
it's like this kind of weird


---------03:29----------
self-reliance that like i should be able


---------03:31----------
to do


---------03:32----------
this and if i can't do this there's


---------03:33----------
something wrong with me


---------03:35----------
and if there's something wrong with me


---------03:36----------
no one outside of me is going to be able


---------03:38----------
to fix it right


---------03:40----------
it exactly and yeah because as human


---------03:42----------
beings


---------03:43----------
started to interrupt i didn't notice you


---------03:45----------
were going to keep talking sorry here we


---------03:46----------
go


---------03:48----------
as human beings we are so like unique


---------03:51----------
and have so much individuality


---------03:52----------
and we like notice things on such a big


---------03:54----------
scale that the problem can like feel so


---------03:57----------
huge to us and you're like yeah nobody's


---------03:58----------
facing this there's no way


---------04:00----------
yeah absolutely um


---------04:04----------
let me just


---------04:08----------
um so let's start with your past then


---------04:11----------
gabriel so maybe we can help you kind of


---------04:12----------
unpack things understand


---------04:14----------
what's underneath by all means be


---------04:15----------
philosophical bro


---------04:17----------
thank you thank you um yeah i think


---------04:19----------
that's a good place to start as well


---------04:21----------
you know my first therapy session that's


---------04:23----------
basically what i unloaded into my


---------04:25----------
therapist that's the word i used right


---------04:26----------
i didn't tell them i unloaded like all


---------04:29----------
of my past and that


---------04:30----------
took like one and a half hour to two


---------04:32----------
hours don't worry i'm not gonna do the


---------04:33----------
same here because it's very enough time


---------04:35----------
but


---------04:36----------
uh basically you know


---------04:39----------
uh my father was very nice he was pretty


---------04:43----------
you know he was that type of


---------04:44----------
intimidating guy that liked to


---------04:47----------
win over people by being intimidating


---------04:49----------
and


---------04:51----------
forcing them to agree with him in a way


---------04:53----------
so he was a very oppressive


---------04:55----------
presence around the house and


---------05:00----------
where do i even start like sometimes he


---------05:03----------
would get home drunk and he would beat


---------05:04----------
me for no reason so


---------05:05----------
that was a lot of fun i remember


---------05:08----------
specifically at this one time i was just


---------05:10----------
sitting in the couch watching dbz and he


---------05:12----------
just like he just


---------05:13----------
walks in and he i was like you get five


---------05:16----------
or six five before


---------05:17----------
he just walks in and he's like straight


---------05:19----------
up he's just holding me


---------05:21----------
up like one leg in the air it's just


---------05:23----------
like


---------05:24----------
beating my hands and here and


---------05:30----------
if i try to remember how i felt like i'm


---------05:32----------
not even sure i was just like


---------05:34----------
i'm not even sure i knew what was going


---------05:35----------
on i just kept staring at the tv i just


---------05:37----------
kept watching


---------05:38----------
i was like i don't know what's going on


---------05:40----------
and he had a bunch of friends with him


---------05:41----------
as well


---------05:42----------
i heard them laughing that kind of


---------05:44----------
happened but


---------05:45----------
i think you know my child mind made it a


---------05:48----------
point to not look around


---------05:49----------
because you know i didn't want to see


---------05:51----------
the people that were laughing at me it


---------05:53----------
was just like


---------05:54----------
you know i'm just going to stare at the


---------05:55----------
tv i'm not going to look around


---------05:57----------
kind of like you you maybe were seeing


---------05:59----------
but not perceiving


---------06:03----------
yeah i never thought of it that way


---------06:06----------
actually but


---------06:07----------
yeah absolutely absolutely and so i


---------06:11----------
don't know how many times he will do


---------06:12----------
that my memory gets kind of foggy i


---------06:14----------
think it's


---------06:14----------
sort of a protection mechanism maybe


---------06:17----------
some things i


---------06:17----------
can't really remember well so uh he was


---------06:21----------
very like that


---------06:22----------
there would be a lot of arguments in


---------06:23----------
that house and a lot of screaming and he


---------06:25----------
didn't get along well with his brothers


---------06:27----------
as well like


---------06:28----------
sometimes they would pull knives on each


---------06:30----------
other like troll drawers at each other


---------06:32----------
some real [ __ ] up [ __ ] actually at


---------06:35----------
this one time my father was out


---------06:37----------
in the garage so the way that house is


---------06:39----------
set up is kind of like


---------06:40----------
there's a staircase for you to go inside


---------06:42----------
and that staircase


---------06:44----------
when you go down it garages and


---------06:47----------
like there's a window it's kind of hard


---------06:48----------
to explain but basically um


---------06:51----------
my father and my uncle were having an


---------06:53----------
argument through this window


---------06:55----------
you know one down into the garage and


---------06:56----------
the other one you know up


---------06:58----------
near the kitchen area and like they just


---------07:01----------
straight up take a [ __ ] drawer and


---------07:03----------
chuck it through the window there's


---------07:05----------
glass everywhere straight up trying to


---------07:07----------
murder each other in a way


---------07:09----------
but they never did they're both still


---------07:11----------
alive


---------07:13----------
so that kind of thing would happen a lot


---------07:15----------
and


---------07:16----------
my father also wasn't a fan of my


---------07:19----------
expressive outgoing extroverted


---------07:21----------
personality because


---------07:22----------
he's the type of guy that has that


---------07:23----------
mentality that a man should be serious


---------07:25----------
and you know stone-faced


---------07:27----------
you know it's not supposed to have a lot


---------07:29----------
of feelings or


---------07:31----------
no i was a little fried firecracker i'm


---------07:33----------
very energetic so i would be jumping up


---------07:35----------
and down sometimes i'd be running around


---------07:37----------
thousands


---------07:38----------
you know my father was having none of


---------07:39----------
that [ __ ] pretty much


---------07:41----------
so he wasn't very happy about it he was


---------07:43----------
also


---------07:44----------
you know he had a lot of i don't even


---------07:46----------
know how to say this but basically he


---------07:47----------
was homophobic


---------07:49----------
because i behaved it that i behaved that


---------07:51----------
way he believed that meant that i was


---------07:53----------
gay


---------07:53----------
you know because i was very expressive


---------07:55----------
and all that kind of thing


---------07:57----------
and so he would say things like you know


---------07:58----------
i'm not going to raise no gay son and


---------08:00----------
all the classic stuff and so he


---------08:03----------
really like tried to beat that my


---------08:06----------
personality out of me because he didn't


---------08:08----------
like it and


---------08:08----------
he thought it meant that i was fruity


---------08:10----------
and all kinds of things so it wasn't


---------08:12----------
very fun


---------08:13----------
being around him and basically what


---------08:16----------
happened was


---------08:17----------
you know i guess it's pretty obvious


---------08:19----------
from everything that's going on there


---------08:20----------
would be a divorce when i was like six


---------08:23----------
uh he and my mom got separated and


---------08:26----------
i remember feeling very confused at the


---------08:28----------
time because i didn't know who i wanted


---------08:29----------
to stay with and it wasn't actually


---------08:31----------
because of my father because


---------08:33----------
at my father's house he lived together


---------08:36----------
with my grandma his mother


---------08:37----------
and one of my uncles that i really liked


---------08:40----------
his brother


---------08:41----------
because we would play a lot of games


---------08:42----------
together it's like uh his room would be


---------08:44----------
a safe haven for me i would just walk in


---------08:46----------
there and


---------08:47----------
start playing especially because my


---------08:49----------
father


---------08:51----------
along with with this brother than my


---------08:53----------
uncle he wouldn't like interject


---------08:55----------
very much on what we were doing inside


---------08:56----------
his room so


---------08:59----------
yes he was just like i don't want to


---------09:01----------
talk to this guy so


---------09:02----------
whatever so i liked my grandma


---------09:06----------
quite a bit so i was very confused on


---------09:07----------
where i wanted to stay and i would


---------09:09----------
like live four months and with my mother


---------09:12----------
and then four months with my grandma and


---------09:14----------
my uncle and at the time my father was


---------09:16----------
getting


---------09:17----------
uh busy doing uh nurse stuff because


---------09:20----------
he's always been into medicine that's


---------09:22----------
something he wanted me to do he was like


---------09:25----------
you know he noticed that i was very


---------09:26----------
smart from the young age and he was like


---------09:28----------
i'm gonna mold you into this thing


---------09:30----------
but just very annoying type of thing


---------09:32----------
where he was like um


---------09:34----------
i never managed to be a doctor but now


---------09:36----------
because i [ __ ] up you're gonna be a


---------09:38----------
doctor if you're gonna be like this


---------09:40----------
blah blah blah all that kind of stuff


---------09:43----------
eventually i would settle on uh living


---------09:46----------
with my mother because


---------09:47----------
my grandma and uncle also started being


---------09:50----------
quite unpleasant


---------09:51----------
i want to say in the beginning it was


---------09:53----------
cool and then


---------09:54----------
they started criticizing my mother a lot


---------09:56----------
saying things like she was misusing the


---------09:58----------
child support money that she should be


---------10:00----------
buying


---------10:00----------
clothes and you know main courses for me


---------10:03----------
to learn [ __ ] but there you know the


---------10:04----------
reality


---------10:05----------
of the matter is you know i was kind of


---------10:08----------
bored into


---------10:09----------
poverty here in brazil and so


---------10:12----------
that child support money she had used to


---------10:14----------
pay rent and i would always explain it


---------10:16----------
to them like


---------10:17----------
you know what do you expect you want me


---------10:18----------
you want her to buy me clothes


---------10:20----------
then we're just going to sleep under a


---------10:21----------
bridge or something that doesn't make


---------10:23----------
[ __ ] sense


---------10:24----------
so they would criticize her unfairly


---------10:26----------
because they were just like


---------10:27----------
it wasn't fair at all just unfair


---------10:29----------
criticism very much


---------10:31----------
my uncle was becoming more and more


---------10:32----------
bitter i don't know what was going on


---------10:34----------
with him at the time


---------10:35----------
and my grandma she like spoiled me way


---------10:39----------
too much so it's like


---------10:40----------
total contrast between my father and my


---------10:43----------
grandma where


---------10:44----------
my father would have a totally


---------10:46----------
oppressive aura about him and those


---------10:48----------
things he wanted me to do that i was


---------10:49----------
gonna do


---------10:50----------
and then my grandma on the other hand he


---------10:52----------
was she was too far


---------10:53----------
you know on the other end so for example


---------10:57----------
i remember going to a preschool and it


---------10:59----------
was on the same street


---------11:00----------
actually the same street where this


---------11:01----------
house was the preschool was just like


---------11:03----------
right across the street and all you know


---------11:05----------
it's like that either you had one job


---------11:07----------
she had one job that was to uh wake me


---------11:10----------
up at like


---------11:11----------
6am or something for me to get ready and


---------11:14----------
she'd be like


---------11:15----------
oh i tried to wake you up but you you


---------11:18----------
weren't waking up so


---------11:19----------
you know just i i felt bad so


---------11:22----------
and so i would miss a lot of school days


---------11:24----------
because of it she like she felt bad


---------11:26----------
waking up to go to


---------11:28----------
preschool or whatever you know six


---------11:31----------
and something that was very bad that


---------11:34----------
used to happen while i was living there


---------11:35----------
too


---------11:36----------
and in this period where i kept going


---------11:38----------
back and forth


---------11:40----------
was actually there would be nobody


---------11:42----------
around the house for the most part so i


---------11:43----------
would stay in there alone all day


---------11:45----------
because my father and my grandma would


---------11:47----------
be working all day and i can't remember


---------11:49----------
what my uncle was doing for some reason


---------11:51----------
but


---------11:51----------
she also would not be home so i would


---------11:53----------
stay home alone all day


---------11:55----------
and i wasn't allowed to go outside with


---------11:57----------
other kids so i didn't have any friends


---------11:58----------
at that point


---------12:00----------
and i would also like may start uh


---------12:02----------
starve a fair bit because you know i was


---------12:04----------
all alone in the house i had nothing to


---------12:06----------
eat


---------12:06----------
and so here comes you know another part


---------12:09----------
of my grandma


---------12:11----------
spoiled things that weren't very faces


---------12:13----------
she would come home


---------12:14----------
after a day where i you know didn't have


---------12:17----------
anything to eat


---------12:18----------
and she would offer me like cookies and


---------12:20----------
stuff like that it's like


---------12:22----------
that's not what you should be giving me


---------12:23----------
and i was no too young to know any


---------12:25----------
better but anyways


---------12:28----------
eventually that would cause me to


---------12:30----------
actually have some sort of uh


---------12:31----------
issue with my eating i'm not sure what


---------12:33----------
it was no i was too young to actually


---------12:35----------
pay attention


---------12:36----------
but that's gonna tie into later


---------12:40----------
when i'm living with my mother


---------12:41----------
consistently and i never protect her


---------12:44----------
to live at least i did some visits


---------12:47----------
and unfortunately she would have this


---------12:50----------
guy come over to liverpool who would


---------12:51----------
become my stepfather he


---------12:53----------
would also be abusive to me in a similar


---------12:55----------
manner to my father


---------12:56----------
and you know it's in some points he was


---------12:59----------
worse than some he was better so


---------13:00----------
people are different even interviews


---------13:02----------
right the


---------13:04----------
individuality of humanity


---------13:07----------
and i remember specifically i


---------13:10----------
ended up having these stomach issues and


---------13:12----------
that was one of his biggest like


---------13:15----------
problems with me because uh


---------13:18----------
i would go you know have breakfast uh


---------13:22----------
at the the kitchen desk or whatever you


---------13:25----------
call it english


---------13:26----------
and i'd sit there like for three hours


---------13:29----------
trying to eat a loaf of bread like it


---------13:31----------
was really hard for me i was having some


---------13:33----------
real


---------13:36----------
and he would get so mad over that [ __ ]


---------13:39----------
actually


---------13:39----------
so just one time and


---------13:42----------
a fair warning chat if you have a weeks


---------13:45----------
or if you're having lunch right now just


---------13:47----------
just stop for a bit uh i was trying to


---------13:50----------
have my lunch and i would stay basically


---------13:52----------
all day


---------13:53----------
because my mother would be working she


---------13:55----------
was the provider and


---------13:56----------
he would take care of me


---------13:59----------
uh i was having lunch and i just


---------14:02----------
couldn't eat i


---------14:02----------
ate like two spoons of it and i just


---------14:05----------
couldn't eat anymore


---------14:06----------
so he forced me to eat more and that


---------14:09----------
caused me to


---------14:10----------
vomit all over the plate and then if


---------14:13----------
that wasn't bad enough he also made me


---------14:14----------
eat a spoonful of the vomit that i just


---------14:17----------
you know so that wasn't very nice either


---------14:21----------
it's one of the more uh things that


---------14:24----------
marked me that i can remember about that


---------14:26----------
time because i'm sure there were


---------14:28----------
all other kinds of [ __ ] that he would do


---------14:30----------
to me but my memory just


---------14:32----------
it's like i said i think it's maybe a


---------14:33----------
protective thing i don't know because i


---------14:35----------
can't remember much else but


---------14:37----------
uh the feeling was very bad it was like


---------14:40----------
my mother is going to work she was the


---------14:41----------
only


---------14:42----------
family member that was fair and kind to


---------14:45----------
me but she would also


---------14:46----------
instill some you know maturity like my


---------14:48----------
grandma


---------14:49----------
so like my mother was the the star of my


---------14:52----------
my world standpoint so


---------14:55----------
she would leave and i would be alone


---------14:57----------
with my stepfather and was like well


---------14:59----------
i guess now i know i'm alone with this


---------15:01----------
guy maybe i'll eat my vomit today again


---------15:03----------
you know


---------15:03----------
who knows what's gonna happen so


---------15:06----------
sounds like it would be important for


---------15:08----------
you to eat it but not taste it


---------15:13----------
you're good


---------15:16----------
i never thought about it like that


---------15:18----------
either so


---------15:20----------
yeah and it was rough for my mother too


---------15:24----------
she actually ended up


---------15:25----------
developing depression over the years


---------15:26----------
living with this guy because


---------15:28----------
you know she will tell him to [ __ ] off


---------15:29----------
and leave the house because she didn't


---------15:31----------
want him leaving


---------15:32----------
us anymore and he just would not do it


---------15:34----------
for like


---------15:35----------
three or four years she would keep


---------15:36----------
telling him to go away and he just


---------15:38----------
wouldn't


---------15:39----------
because you know it was a free easy life


---------15:41----------
for him he didn't have to work


---------15:42----------
my mother was providing for everything


---------15:45----------
and when we


---------15:46----------
picked him up so to speak uh his father


---------15:49----------
had just like


---------15:50----------
thrown him out of her house because he


---------15:53----------
refused to get a job he just did drugs


---------15:55----------
all day


---------15:55----------
or whatever and so his mother was very


---------15:58----------
pissed at him and


---------15:59----------
threw him on his house and my mother


---------16:01----------
took him up


---------16:02----------
you know my mother is a very kind person


---------16:04----------
she would eventually fall in love with


---------16:06----------
him and all that stuff


---------16:07----------
in the beginning he wasn't so bad he


---------16:08----------
just he transformed into a total [ __ ]


---------16:11----------
dick over the years and said


---------16:13----------
so like at first he was that kind of guy


---------16:16----------
you wouldn't look twice at it's like


---------16:18----------
you know just normal but eventually that


---------16:21----------
would cause problems so she would fall


---------16:22----------
into depression keep telling him to


---------16:24----------
leave her home he wouldn't


---------16:26----------
eventually he did but at that point i'd


---------16:28----------
say a lot of damage had


---------16:29----------
had been done to me already sounds like


---------16:33----------
yeah he had a similar thing to my father


---------16:36----------
where


---------16:36----------
he would also call me gay and all kind


---------16:38----------
of stuff because of the way i just stick


---------16:40----------
with a lot and talk you know and all


---------16:42----------
types of things


---------16:42----------
and like sometimes i wonder like if i


---------16:44----------
was actually homosexual how hard it


---------16:46----------
would be


---------16:46----------
because i'm not even then these things


---------16:48----------
you know still affected me like imagine


---------16:50----------
if i actually was


---------16:52----------
i think i'd have a lot more trouble too


---------16:54----------
but


---------16:55----------
yeah part of the sad thing about this is


---------16:58----------
my uncle would get in on it


---------16:59----------
my mother's brother in this case not


---------17:02----------
from the family of my father


---------17:04----------
so this uncle of mine uh brother to my


---------17:06----------
mother was also getting you know


---------17:08----------
making fun of me for acting and moving


---------17:10----------
the way i did


---------17:11----------
but all that kind of good stuff so they


---------17:14----------
just kind of would come in here


---------17:16----------
and basically leech of homeowners work


---------17:18----------
because they would turn on the computers


---------17:20----------
and use the internet to play like


---------17:21----------
grand chase at the time it was a level


---------17:23----------
up game or whatever


---------17:25----------
and you know while they were doing that


---------17:26----------
they would take the opportunity to rip


---------17:28----------
on me and


---------17:29----------
all kinds of [ __ ] you're talking about


---------17:32----------
your your uncle and your stepdad


---------17:35----------
yeah okay okay they will join forces


---------17:39----------
a malevolent force


---------17:44----------
okay so


---------17:46----------
that was kind of what family life was


---------17:48----------
for me i was always very oppressed for


---------17:50----------
being too well going too loud too


---------17:52----------
extroverted


---------17:53----------
i was like damn i should have been born


---------17:54----------
into a italian family nobody would have


---------17:56----------
had an issue with me but


---------17:58----------
you know that wasn't the case in fact


---------18:01----------
uh so my cousin sorry there's some


---------18:05----------
loud thing going on in my street right


---------18:06----------
now i hope that doesn't bother you but


---------18:09----------
i don't hear anything actually okay


---------18:12----------
that's good


---------18:13----------
that's good i'm super like conscious


---------18:15----------
about the noise because i'm using a


---------18:17----------
phone as a mice


---------18:18----------
a lot of things get picked up uh


---------18:21----------
what was i saying i have a lot of mind


---------18:22----------
by the way you can tell


---------18:24----------
i think that's what they mistook for


---------18:26----------
homosexuality


---------18:28----------
um yeah so can you just tell me a little


---------18:31----------
bit so it sounds like you gave us a


---------18:33----------
little bit about your upbringing


---------18:35----------
and um can you tell us a little bit


---------18:38----------
about the social anxiety


---------18:41----------
yeah so i think it's connected like i've


---------18:44----------
made a lot of observations


---------18:45----------
uh myself along the the years and part


---------18:48----------
of my


---------18:49----------
annoyance at myself is that i knew so


---------18:52----------
much about the roots of my issues but i


---------18:54----------
could never solve anything


---------18:55----------
and that's like without a lot of your


---------18:57----------
content has provided me like


---------18:58----------
ways to deal with it because i've always


---------19:00----------
been very good at noticing so the whole


---------19:02----------
social anxiety thing is like


---------19:04----------
i i definitely see it as you know my


---------19:07----------
natural personality that was so


---------19:09----------
oppressed by my family and then


---------19:11----------
eventually it would become oppression


---------19:13----------
during the repression because


---------19:15----------
i would take those ideas that i should


---------19:16----------
not be that way and i wouldn't implement


---------19:19----------
and internalize


---------19:20----------
them so school wasn't easy for me either


---------19:22----------
i was always bullied a lot and i didn't


---------19:24----------
have a lot of friends so like i was


---------19:25----------
[ __ ] at home i was [ __ ] at school


---------19:28----------
like ironically the place i felt the


---------19:30----------
safest


---------19:31----------
was the streets between my home and


---------19:34----------
between the schools like


---------19:35----------
in the streets i'm the safest so


---------19:39----------
i got bullied a lot too for being 12


---------19:41----------
goalie uh


---------19:43----------
the kids used to call me [ __ ]


---------19:44----------
because like i was always laughing too


---------19:46----------
much and making too many jokes


---------19:48----------
so that would happen as well and i


---------19:51----------
remembered that i had to specific


---------19:53----------
during the elementary at some point


---------19:55----------
where i was like you know i'm gonna turn


---------19:56----------
myself into a machine


---------19:58----------
so like that was my goal i was like i'm


---------19:59----------
gonna take all these things that people


---------20:01----------
are saying you know


---------20:02----------
people pick on me for and i'm gonna just


---------20:05----------
shove it all inside


---------20:07----------
like it's not gonna come out and people


---------20:09----------
i'm not gonna be a target


---------20:10----------
anymore that's kind of how i learned to


---------20:12----------
deal with it


---------20:14----------
and what would happen eventually is that


---------20:17----------
2013 or 2014


---------20:19----------
after going through a long process of


---------20:20----------
shoving all the [ __ ] inside


---------20:22----------
i would have my first panic attack which


---------20:24----------
i see you know as those things coming


---------20:26----------
out because whenever you repress


---------20:27----------
something it's gonna blow off in a


---------20:29----------
certain way so i ended up having these


---------20:31----------
panic attacks


---------20:32----------
and part of the social anxiety issues


---------20:34----------
that i was having is connected to all


---------20:36----------
this


---------20:36----------
in the sense that uh you know probably


---------20:41----------
because of what i was taught and how i


---------20:42----------
internalize things if um


---------20:45----------
if i go in and i talk to people and i'll


---------20:47----------
be myself


---------20:48----------
people are gonna make fun pretty much so


---------20:51----------
that would cause me anxiety


---------20:52----------
because then what i would do is you know


---------20:54----------
i would put on the mask on like so much


---------20:56----------
of us do it's like i can't let that come


---------20:57----------
out so


---------20:58----------
i'm gonna put on this mask on and the


---------21:00----------
problem with putting masks


---------21:01----------
is that it's like an eagle thing that


---------21:05----------
strives for perfection so you know i'm


---------21:07----------
going to go into the social


---------21:08----------
situation and i'm going to act


---------21:10----------
mathematically in a


---------21:12----------
specific way and so people aren't going


---------21:14----------
to see the real me


---------21:15----------
yeah hopefully they're you know not


---------21:17----------
going to make fun of the mask and i was


---------21:18----------
pretty good at it too


---------21:20----------
and when you have that perfectionism


---------21:24----------
of having to put on the mask and what


---------21:26----------
that ego and all that


---------21:27----------
[ __ ] jumble together that causes a lot


---------21:29----------
of anxiety because you get


---------21:30----------
like performance anxiety right it's


---------21:32----------
almost like you're going on a stage


---------21:34----------
it's like i have to you know do this so


---------21:37----------
that's my understanding


---------21:39----------
and so tell me a little bit about it


---------21:41----------
sounds like the the


---------21:44----------
social anxiety has gotten better


---------21:47----------
yeah it has gone so much better you have


---------21:49----------
no idea like


---------21:50----------
a lot of it is thanks to you the


---------21:52----------
meditation the


---------21:54----------
so much it's been amazing yeah you're


---------21:58----------
i'm glad things worked out for you it's


---------22:00----------
kind of you know it's weird gabriel like


---------22:02----------
i was thinking one of the downsides of


---------22:04----------
streaming is that i never


---------22:06----------
get to follow up with people right


---------22:10----------
and and so it's kind of interesting i


---------22:11----------
never had this thought until now so i


---------22:13----------
was thinking that part of the problem


---------22:15----------
with streaming


---------22:16----------
is i can never show people step two i


---------22:19----------
just keep showing step one


---------22:21----------
over and over and over again but there's


---------22:23----------
something strange that's happened over


---------22:24----------
the last week and hearing you


---------22:26----------
talk about it uh hearing you kind of


---------22:28----------
share because like you're already giving


---------22:29----------
me


---------22:30----------
everything like you're packaged in a


---------22:32----------
sense like in a good way right like so


---------22:34----------
i think you've like figured out and so


---------22:36----------
like in in about 15 minutes


---------22:38----------
20 minutes you're able to do a lot of


---------22:41----------
what takes


---------22:42----------
we normally spend an hour and a half on


---------22:43----------
doing so the interesting thing is like


---------22:45----------
we may actually be able to take step two


---------22:47----------
today


---------22:48----------
um which i never normally i take step


---------22:50----------
two with the same person because we you


---------22:52----------
know we meet for a couple of weeks and


---------22:53----------
stuff like that but


---------22:54----------
i think there are potentially like other


---------22:56----------
concepts or advanced concepts that i


---------22:58----------
never thought i would get to


---------22:59----------
on stream because everyone um


---------23:02----------
you know but it sounds like you all are


---------23:05----------
learning


---------23:06----------
and so that's pretty cool um


---------23:09----------
but let's kind of talk a little bit


---------23:11----------
about uh


---------23:12----------
you know so after as the social anxiety


---------23:16----------
has gotten better what have you managed


---------23:17----------
to uncover instead


---------23:22----------
um like there was just


---------23:27----------
it's like i said i don't actually have a


---------23:28----------
diagnosis but it feels a lot like


---------23:30----------
depression or at least aspects of it


---------23:33----------
in the sense that my understanding of it


---------23:36----------
is


---------23:37----------
maybe i'm wrong my understanding of it


---------23:39----------
is i've been depressed this entire time


---------23:42----------
but i didn't realize it anymore because


---------23:44----------
my anxiety was like at


---------23:45----------
such a peak so if my depression is here


---------23:47----------
my anxiety was like here


---------23:50----------
and so like my anxiety was just so loud


---------23:53----------
and deafening that i could not notice


---------23:55----------
the depression anymore and as i'm


---------23:57----------
i'm noticing that down here there's


---------23:59----------
still like a big issue where


---------24:03----------
i it's like i was saying it like my


---------24:05----------
cognitive functions are just


---------24:08----------
not okay it's very hard for me to


---------24:09----------
actually focus and learn things that


---------24:11----------
i used to be very good at and there's no


---------24:14----------
motivation to do things


---------24:16----------
it's like i'm detached from reality in a


---------24:19----------
sense like it's not


---------24:20----------
i don't feel like i'm a part of my room


---------24:22----------
right now for example it feels very


---------24:24----------
weird


---------24:25----------
because back when i used to be mentally


---------24:27----------
healthy in a circumstance


---------24:29----------
i would always feel like i was a part of


---------24:31----------
my environment like


---------24:34----------
it's like things had a presence like


---------24:36----------
it's hard to put into words but


---------24:38----------
like the desk i'm using right now it's


---------24:39----------
like this desk has a presence to it even


---------24:42----------
though it's not a living thing


---------24:43----------
and i was all i would always be able to


---------24:45----------
perceive like the presence of the


---------24:47----------
objects around me it's just


---------24:48----------
like there's nothing there everything is


---------24:50----------
kind of a shade of gray


---------24:52----------
and my mind is also very like scattered


---------24:55----------
and foggy


---------24:56----------
sometimes i'll have like good thoughts


---------24:58----------
because like i i'm planning on actually


---------25:00----------
starting a philosophy


---------25:01----------
channel and writing a book and actually


---------25:03----------
those are things that i want to do


---------25:05----------
and sometimes i'll have a thought that's


---------25:07----------
like oh that's good so i record it to my


---------25:09----------
phone


---------25:09----------
and i'll take my phone to record it and


---------25:11----------
i'll press record and then


---------25:14----------
it's like between my mind and my mouth


---------25:16----------
like things just get lost sometimes


---------25:19----------
it's disappears in the midst it's very


---------25:21----------
hard to explain


---------25:23----------
okay so what are some of the other


---------25:25----------
things that you've noticed


---------25:27----------
have come up as the anxiety has gotten


---------25:30----------
better


---------25:36----------
that sounds pretty hard so why do you


---------25:40----------
call it depression


---------25:46----------
well it's kind of like because of a


---------25:50----------
thing i used to feel before so i gotta


---------25:52----------
feel you feel your wind on this actually


---------25:54----------
uh i was playing actually competitive


---------25:57----------
daughter for a while


---------25:58----------
i mean like 2014 to totally something


---------26:02----------
so what happened was uh my cousin


---------26:04----------
introduced me to


---------26:06----------
the end of 2013 and that was during my


---------26:08----------
high school periods where


---------26:10----------
you know i didn't have any friends and i


---------26:11----------
kind of hated everyone i had a big ego


---------26:13----------
at the time i was like


---------26:15----------
you know all these people they're just


---------26:16----------
stupid i'm not gonna associate with any


---------26:18----------
of them


---------26:18----------
which was also a defense mechanism at


---------26:20----------
the time because you know


---------26:22----------
people always rejected me so my thought


---------26:23----------
process was if i reject them first and


---------26:25----------
they can't do it


---------26:27----------
so i would just like disqualify and you


---------26:30----------
know


---------26:30----------
lower everyone in my mind so that you


---------26:33----------
know i'm the one rejecting all of you


---------26:34----------
now


---------26:35----------
suckers so i didn't have a whole lot of


---------26:37----------
friends with that attitude obviously


---------26:39----------
i just gave to myself so i was playing


---------26:42----------
dota and through dota like i was amazed


---------26:44----------
i fell in love with the game because


---------26:46----------
i've always been very good at games


---------26:47----------
actually and i was picking up the game


---------26:49----------
so fast and learning so fast and i


---------26:50----------
didn't even know if esports at the time


---------26:52----------
like i had no idea that was a thing


---------26:53----------
actually


---------26:54----------
so i would see an art easy screen event


---------26:57----------
and like


---------26:57----------
he had like 10k viewers and he was


---------26:59----------
playing the whole chat was vlogging and


---------27:00----------
i was like


---------27:02----------
wait people liked us a lot i had no idea


---------27:04----------
what's going on here


---------27:06----------
and when i would watch dota tournaments


---------27:09----------
it was back when zyrie had like


---------27:11----------
dreads or whatever and i thought that


---------27:13----------
was so cool i was like man


---------27:14----------
you know that guy's working like that


---------27:18----------
it's like it felt to me like a community


---------27:19----------
where you could really be yourself


---------27:21----------
is what i'm trying to say like that guy


---------27:23----------
is himself he's being himself he has


---------27:25----------
this haircut


---------27:26----------
and he's doing all this cool [ __ ] so i


---------27:29----------
always felt like i couldn't be myself in


---------27:30----------
the real world


---------27:31----------
but in the daughter the online gaming


---------27:33----------
community i was like yeah


---------27:34----------
and i'm gonna have value as a player and


---------27:36----------
then people are gonna have to pay


---------27:38----------
attention to


---------27:39----------
my thought process and i was actually


---------27:41----------
doing very well


---------27:42----------
i was like playing very well i'm still


---------27:44----------
more touring currently i don't want to


---------27:46----------
replay anymore


---------27:47----------
i think i'm not like 6.3 km bar and the


---------27:50----------
only reason i'm giving you all these


---------27:51----------
details is because i know you know about


---------27:52----------
it


---------27:53----------
it's gonna be helpful uh what would


---------27:55----------
happen unfortunately


---------27:57----------
it was something that was absolutely so


---------27:58----------
crushing to me because


---------28:01----------
though i was pushing everybody out and


---------28:03----------
just focusing on dota and i had a


---------28:05----------
pessimistic view about


---------28:06----------
people around me i i didn't feel


---------28:09----------
depressed at all i actually felt like


---------28:10----------
very obese i felt like my feelings were


---------28:12----------
justified


---------28:13----------
and i would embrace them like hey i


---------28:15----------
[ __ ] hate these people i don't care


---------28:16----------
let's play shorter


---------28:17----------
you know i still felt good basically


---------28:21----------
and that was until i had my first panic


---------28:23----------
attack so when i was going to school


---------28:25----------
second year of high school


---------28:27----------
a friend used to come here for us to go


---------28:29----------
to school together


---------28:31----------
and when we were approaching the the end


---------28:33----------
of the street i just


---------28:35----------
my body just did something it had never


---------28:37----------
done before it was a very weird


---------28:39----------
experience so


---------28:40----------
it's gonna be kind of hard to explain as


---------28:42----------
these things are but


---------28:43----------
it felt like everything was moving like


---------28:45----------
a speedo light around me


---------28:48----------
and at the same time nothing was moving


---------28:51----------
it's like


---------28:52----------
everything was moving what uh at the


---------28:54----------
speed of light


---------28:56----------
okay around me it felt like the road had


---------28:58----------
just like evolved into light speed in a


---------29:00----------
millisecond


---------29:02----------
and there wasn't even anything going on


---------29:03----------
like the street was completely empty


---------29:05----------
there were no cars like there was


---------29:06----------
nothing but


---------29:07----------
in my mind like everything was just so


---------29:09----------
fast and rushing and


---------29:11----------
it felt like i could see like 10 years


---------29:13----------
into the future or something it was some


---------29:15----------
really scary [ __ ]


---------29:17----------
and you know i told my friend to stop


---------29:19----------
like i couldn't even speak because i


---------29:21----------
felt like i'm not in my truth and i


---------29:22----------
just you know signaled to my friend i


---------29:24----------
was like wait


---------29:25----------
like took a deep breath


---------29:29----------
and i was like okay i think i'm okay so


---------29:31----------
we went to school that was the first


---------29:32----------
time that happened


---------29:33----------
and what would end up happening is


---------29:36----------
you want to say something yeah i'm just


---------29:39----------
trying to figure out


---------29:40----------
uh where so it sounds like you talked


---------29:42----------
about dota now you're talking about a


---------29:44----------
panic attack


---------29:45----------
i'm not quite sure how this relates to


---------29:48----------
[Music]


---------29:49----------
what depression feels like for you


---------29:51----------
underneath the anxiety


---------29:53----------
it's about to connect sorry i know it's


---------29:55----------
a big tangent to just okay


---------29:58----------
uh what would end up happening is i


---------30:01----------
would have this more and more frequently


---------30:02----------
when it was time to go to school


---------30:04----------
so eventually i just told my mother like


---------30:05----------
i don't want to go school anymore


---------30:06----------
because


---------30:07----------
every time i just merely think about


---------30:09----------
going to school or i know that i'm going


---------30:11----------
to have to


---------30:11----------
like my body my nervous system would


---------30:13----------
just completely [ __ ] itself pretty much


---------30:15----------
so i told her like i don't want to go


---------30:17----------
anymore


---------30:19----------
work you know i'm talented just cut out


---------30:22----------
there for a second i don't want to go


---------30:23----------
any more what


---------30:25----------
yeah i don't want to go anymore because


---------30:27----------
i felt


---------30:28----------
really bad just at the thought of having


---------30:30----------
to go to school and i was telling her


---------30:32----------
you know i'm going to do this dota thing


---------30:34----------
do i know what i'm doing i'm talented


---------30:35----------
it's gonna work so i don't need to go to


---------30:36----------
school anymore


---------30:37----------
you know all that just pretty much and


---------30:40----------
she actually allowed me like


---------30:41----------
she put her trust in me because i was


---------30:43----------
speaking about it very confidently and


---------30:45----------
she was like okay i trust you and and


---------30:48----------
then a terrible thing happened and this


---------30:50----------
guy's is why you don't run away from


---------30:52----------
your feelings because


---------30:53----------
i run i ran away from school because i


---------30:56----------
was feeling panic attacks in there


---------30:58----------
and daughter was always completely fine


---------30:59----------
i would get home from school


---------31:01----------
sure and then what happened was is these


---------31:04----------
attacks transferred over to when i had


---------31:05----------
to play dota


---------31:07----------
it was absolutely terrible so like i


---------31:09----------
would kill up press find


---------31:11----------
match and divide i felt like there was a


---------31:14----------
hand in my throat a lot of times like


---------31:16----------
there was something just crushing it and


---------31:18----------
i would always just like be dry heaving


---------31:20----------
and coughing


---------31:21----------
and i would have to like pause in the


---------31:22----------
middle of matches to run to the bathroom


---------31:24----------
and just throw one


---------31:25----------
then i i would come back and keep


---------31:26----------
stomping noobs but i would be throwing


---------31:28----------
up


---------31:30----------
so it's going to tie into your question


---------31:32----------
it's about it i promise


---------31:34----------
so well what happened was this you know


---------31:37----------
it was a very soft rushing process to me


---------31:39----------
because all i had was


---------31:41----------
you know i had shoved people out of my


---------31:43----------
life involved like


---------31:44----------
i don't want anything to do with any of


---------31:45----------
you and i had a big ego of like


---------31:47----------
you know i was that which is good at


---------31:49----------
dota you know


---------31:50----------
it was my identity and like


---------31:54----------
when that started getting taken away


---------31:56----------
from me for something that was out of my


---------31:57----------
control like i felt so [ __ ] crushed


---------31:59----------
it was like there's nothing left


---------32:01----------
involving like for me it's


---------32:02----------
like this thing that's my passion and i


---------32:04----------
love so much and i'm doing well at it


---------32:06----------
now my body is breaking down and


---------32:08----------
i can't really do it anymore so that's


---------32:10----------
where i started getting depressed


---------32:12----------
in the sense that everything just lost


---------32:14----------
meaning at that point


---------32:16----------
and because you know the only thing i


---------32:18----------
loved was taken away from


---------32:19----------
that sense i couldn't do anything and


---------32:22----------
you know i was a stubborn [ __ ] still


---------32:23----------
at the time so i didn't go seek any help


---------32:25----------
from my panic attacks or anything maybe


---------32:26----------
i should have done that but you know


---------32:28----------
who knows what happened in that parallel


---------32:29----------
universe but


---------32:32----------
it everything just felt really bad and


---------32:34----------
that my i felt my


---------32:36----------
emotions start to numb so like i wasn't


---------32:39----------
really there anymore and i would refuse


---------32:40----------
to eat as well


---------32:42----------
i remember this one time i'll just


---------32:45----------
no longer eat and something very bad


---------32:47----------
happened because i


---------32:48----------
wasn't really eating properly for like


---------32:50----------
two days straight and


---------32:52----------
it's like my head was spinning a lot


---------32:53----------
every time you moved it i couldn't


---------32:55----------
really walk very well


---------32:57----------
so my mother found me i wasn't even


---------32:58----------
gonna tell anybody it's like


---------33:00----------
i was ready to die in a sense i was just


---------33:02----------
sitting in my room in my bed not eating


---------33:04----------
anything


---------33:04----------
and i couldn't really get up very well


---------33:06----------
anymore and i was like you know i don't


---------33:08----------
care


---------33:09----------
i don't have anything so whatever and


---------33:12----------
like my mother opens the door to my room


---------33:15----------
and she's like like you're okay you


---------33:16----------
haven't come out in a bit and


---------33:18----------
she comes to check on me and i just told


---------33:20----------
her like very matter of fact


---------33:22----------
actually i can't talk right now because


---------33:25----------
i'm feeling this way and no no


---------33:27----------
so like she gave me strain at the time


---------33:29----------
she came she held my hand


---------33:30----------
and you know you have to snap out of it


---------33:34----------
kind of thing


---------33:35----------
so i started eating again and eventually


---------33:38----------
i would recover


---------33:38----------
but i wouldn't really feel anything


---------33:41----------
anymore i would be numb


---------33:42----------
for a very long time for maybe like


---------33:44----------
three years


---------33:46----------
and then after those three years just


---------33:47----------
being completely numb and be in my room


---------33:49----------
not doing nothing i didn't go out i


---------33:50----------
didn't get a job nothing like that


---------33:52----------
didn't get any new friends


---------33:54----------
but after that time of three years just


---------33:57----------
in that deep state of what i believed to


---------34:00----------
be depression against little diagnosis


---------34:03----------
uh what happened is that my anxiety


---------34:05----------
picked up and that's what i have lived


---------34:07----------
for the past like


---------34:09----------
five years of my life just baseline


---------34:11----------
anxiety that i told you about


---------34:13----------
so now that i am rid of it i'm seeing


---------34:15----------
that maybe there's remnants of


---------34:16----------
that point in my life and that's why i


---------34:18----------
call it depression that was a very long


---------34:20----------
tension thing


---------34:22----------
yeah so let's we'll talk about tangents


---------34:24----------
in a second but so so


---------34:25----------
i'm still curious about what you


---------34:28----------
experience on a day-to-day basis


---------34:30----------
that makes you use the word depression


---------34:32----------
that's what happened back


---------34:34----------
then what do you experience today


---------34:38----------
uh it's less what i experience and it's


---------34:40----------
more what i don't experience


---------34:42----------
it's a lack of experiencing things what


---------34:44----------
are you ignoring what do you not


---------34:46----------
experience today what's missing from


---------34:48----------
your life


---------34:50----------
color connection are you


---------34:54----------
sad no actually that's something that


---------34:58----------
bothers me a lot


---------34:59----------
because it's like i don't feel the


---------35:00----------
emotions like i want to feel sad i want


---------35:02----------
to cry sometimes and i just can't


---------35:04----------
and i don't think that's normal okay


---------35:09----------
okay so gabriel we got to talk about


---------35:10----------
tangents for a second okay


---------35:13----------
so now you ready for the level two


---------35:16----------
explanation so there yes


---------35:19----------
you're gonna have to be careful because


---------35:21----------
if if if


---------35:23----------
i if we want me to help you


---------35:28----------
i don't need your conclusions i need the


---------35:30----------
raw data


---------35:32----------
so one thing that's happening right now


---------35:34----------
this is a double-edged sword it's


---------35:35----------
neither better nor worse


---------35:37----------
so on the one hand we can cover a lot of


---------35:39----------
ground but i think we're still like


---------35:40----------
missing a lot right so you basically


---------35:42----------
you've watched it's clear you've watched


---------35:44----------
it sounds like videos so you kind of


---------35:46----------
know what kind of


---------35:47----------
questions i ask you're sort of sharing


---------35:49----------
like particular traumatic


---------35:51----------
moments um but you're kind of giving me


---------35:53----------
the package


---------35:54----------
the problem is that like if you give me


---------35:56----------
the package


---------35:59----------
the you've set up the problem in a


---------36:01----------
particular way


---------36:02----------
where there is a answer yeah i didn't


---------36:06----------
need to do that


---------36:07----------
yeah i understand so so that's that's


---------36:09----------
what we're sharing it right so like no


---------36:10----------
one's done that before because


---------36:12----------
you did what i usually do which is fine


---------36:14----------
i hope you're not


---------36:15----------
it occurs to me maybe i'm shaming you


---------36:18----------
but like


---------36:20----------
yeah so like i think there's because


---------36:22----------
honestly there is a lot of good stuff in


---------36:23----------
there but like i i think that


---------36:25----------
um i


---------36:29----------
i would like it if i could ask you


---------36:32----------
questions and you try to stick to the


---------36:34----------
answer don't give me the conclusion


---------36:36----------
because i'm i'm hunting for raw data


---------36:38----------
right so like when you like i'm


---------36:40----------
absolutely fascinated like i have so


---------36:41----------
many questions for you about


---------36:42----------
why sa is toxic and like why do you guys


---------36:45----------
show up on usc


---------36:46----------
servers like you know


---------36:49----------
like i have tons of questions for you


---------36:51----------
love that you shared that you know you


---------36:52----------
tried to go pro dota and


---------36:54----------
stuff like that i i do think you're


---------36:55----------
you're genuinely like you're


---------36:57----------
creating a lot of value by offering like


---------37:00----------
some of the nuggets that you've learned


---------37:02----------
like i


---------37:02----------
imagine that could help a lot of people


---------37:04----------
um


---------37:05----------
because you certainly have a way with


---------37:07----------
words but if we're talking about helping


---------37:08----------
you


---------37:09----------
you know i like so my my question is


---------37:12----------
like you know i have some questions


---------37:13----------
about your upbringing like how do you


---------37:14----------
feel about your mom


---------37:23----------
see it's hard for me to know what i feel


---------37:24----------
i have to think yep


---------37:26----------
good that's what i that's what we want


---------37:29----------
right because usually when i ask you a


---------37:31----------
question you'll give me like a narrative


---------37:32----------
that connects and has a


---------37:34----------
you know a finale yeah


---------37:38----------
yeah sorry so


---------37:41----------
uh i know it's not a very nice thing to


---------37:44----------
feel but we don't control her feelings


---------37:45----------
but


---------37:46----------
i felt like she could have done better


---------37:48----------
in a sense just you know


---------37:50----------
having recently separated from my father


---------37:52----------
and like going so quickly into a


---------37:54----------
relationship with a guy she


---------37:55----------
didn't know enough about i think you


---------37:58----------
know i would have liked if she


---------37:59----------
put a little bit more thought into what


---------38:02----------
that would have done to me


---------38:03----------
but it's not like resentment i don't


---------38:05----------
feel any resentment towards sort of


---------38:07----------
like with like that's uh


---------38:10----------
the house here i live it it's me and my


---------38:12----------
mom so you know


---------38:13----------
we live together we we're both there for


---------38:15----------
each other we help and we support each


---------38:17----------
other we have a really good relationship


---------38:19----------
would you allow yourself to feel


---------38:21----------
resentment towards her


---------38:25----------
when i was younger it was a lot easier i


---------38:27----------
used to feel it a lot back in elementary


---------38:29----------
and things like that like


---------38:31----------
you know like how could it


---------38:35----------
it was like how can she allow this to


---------38:37----------
happen like this guy to do these things


---------38:39----------
you know


---------38:42----------
and what was the answer you came up with


---------38:48----------
there was no answer if i'm being honest


---------38:51----------
so how did you deal with that


---------38:56----------
just smile you know good old fashioned


---------38:58----------
just stuffing


---------39:01----------
how does it feel talking about it now


---------39:06----------
it was kind of unfair i feel like i was


---------39:08----------
robbed of something


---------39:14----------
what were you robbed of


---------39:20----------
can be something upbringing where i


---------39:22----------
could connect emotionally with the


---------39:24----------
adults around me probably


---------39:26----------
and who's who robbed you of that


---------39:31----------
well you could make an argument it was


---------39:33----------
my father first and foremost if he


---------39:34----------
hadn't been such a dick


---------39:38----------
in a sense you know she kind of dropped


---------39:39----------
the ball later as well


---------39:41----------
no everyone has their issues okay


---------39:46----------
so now i'm going to invite you to notice


---------39:49----------
what you did when i asked you that


---------39:50----------
question


---------39:55----------
right so what was the first thing i


---------39:57----------
don't know if you remember because it's


---------39:58----------
hard


---------39:59----------
so i said who robbed you of that and


---------40:01----------
what was the first thing you said


---------40:05----------
nope technically you said you could make


---------40:08----------
an argument


---------40:12----------
right which means if we think about it


---------40:15----------
do you


---------40:15----------
blame your father


---------40:19----------
oh i've done that i know but when i ask


---------40:22----------
you that question who robbed you of that


---------40:24----------
what was the answer that we got


---------40:26----------
does the answer indicate that you blame


---------40:28----------
your father


---------40:30----------
no no what was the next thing that you


---------40:34----------
said


---------40:36----------
that my mom dropped the ball


---------40:39----------
and then you said something else


---------40:42----------
yeah it was some rationalization i can't


---------40:44----------
even remember very good


---------40:48----------
right so like it's really interesting


---------40:53----------
how does it feel when we kind of unpack


---------40:57----------
things and like i'm


---------41:00----------
i'm blaming your mom you feel that


---------41:05----------
how does it feel to have me blame your


---------41:07----------
mom


---------41:11----------
it doesn't feel bad actually i i think


---------41:15----------
you know it's reality whether we like it


---------41:17----------
or not


---------41:20----------
okay


---------41:23----------
so you feel okay with me doing that


---------41:27----------
yeah i don't mind okay


---------41:30----------
can i think for a second sure


---------41:34----------
okay i should have said no damn it


---------41:42----------
what are you up to nowadays


---------41:49----------
i have some things i want but that's


---------41:51----------
future so what i'm up to right now it's


---------41:53----------
basically just self improvement i'm


---------41:55----------
really trying to you know


---------41:57----------
uh figure myself out and so i can have a


---------42:00----------
moral life again kind of thing


---------42:02----------
so i watch a lot of your videos i do a


---------42:04----------
lot of meditation i have


---------42:05----------
been trying my hand at the whole uh


---------42:07----------
dopamine detox thing because


---------42:10----------
i don't actually feel like playing any


---------42:11----------
games anymore that's part of what i


---------42:13----------
consider depression is because it's not


---------42:15----------
just about the games


---------42:16----------
i actually don't feel like doing


---------42:17----------
anything so


---------42:19----------
do you feel like improving


---------42:24----------
sometimes it's very sporadic sometimes


---------42:26----------
i'll have a day where i'm like


---------42:27----------
oh i really want to do this thing or


---------42:28----------
really play this game that's like


---------42:31----------
once every two weeks maybe


---------42:34----------
okay um


---------42:44----------
so we've got a couple of options gabriel


---------42:47----------
okay


---------42:50----------
so one option is we can kind of like in


---------42:53----------
a sense almost start from scratch i


---------42:55----------
think i can ask you


---------42:56----------
questions in a particular way


---------43:00----------
that will lead to maybe a


---------43:03----------
crack within your emotional shell


---------43:07----------
um i think we both know where those


---------43:09----------
questions are gonna go because we've


---------43:12----------
seen


---------43:13----------
you know all of your transparency and


---------43:16----------
even as you're thinking about it i can


---------43:17----------
see there's changes in the way that


---------43:19----------
you're sitting


---------43:19----------
in the way that you're thinking you know


---------43:21----------
you've had a smile on your face for a


---------43:23----------
while and sometimes as we get close to


---------43:25----------
something like you haven't needed to


---------43:26----------
deflect


---------43:27----------
much right but there are like very few


---------43:30----------
times where you'll


---------43:31----------
you'll deflect you'll block right


---------43:34----------
because


---------43:34----------
like it sounds like a and and we you


---------43:36----------
know we can talk about that if you want


---------43:38----------
to


---------43:39----------
um we'll see i i think you are


---------43:42----------
well defended so i don't i don't know


---------43:45----------
that that's actually the best use of our


---------43:47----------
time but if that's what you want if you


---------43:49----------
want to like cry on stream we can try to


---------43:51----------
help you get there


---------43:53----------
okay i think you are quite intellectual


---------43:57----------
and there are other things going on on


---------44:00----------
here which


---------44:00----------
i i'm i'm almost inclined to


---------44:04----------
meet you on an intellectual level which


---------44:07----------
is very different from what i would do


---------44:09----------
in therapy but i think like we're here


---------44:11----------
to teach really more than to do therapy


---------44:13----------
so i think that there are like a lot of


---------44:15----------
important principles or lessons to be


---------44:17----------
learned because this is actually a


---------44:20----------
i'm kind of offering this today because


---------44:22----------
it's a rare opportunity where someone


---------44:24----------
comes in


---------44:25----------
and has already understood so much of


---------44:27----------
what we usually do


---------44:29----------
so it gives us a unique opportunity but


---------44:31----------
i think for you


---------44:33----------
you know some people come on here and


---------44:35----------
they have this kind of like emotional


---------44:36----------
catharsis and then they like start to


---------44:38----------
make changes in their life and it's like


---------44:40----------
i just got a dm this morning from


---------44:41----------
someone you they were being really nice


---------44:43----------
a prior stream guest that was like hey i


---------44:44----------
just wanted to say i've like


---------44:46----------
benefited a lot and like i'm realizing


---------44:48----------
things in a new way like


---------44:49----------
i don't i don't know that if we go the


---------44:53----------
sort of academic or intellectual route


---------44:55----------
i don't know how much it will actually


---------44:58----------
help you as a person


---------44:59----------
i think it'll be very intellectually


---------45:01----------
satisfying but like would you like to


---------45:04----------
understand yourself from a high level


---------45:07----------
or would you like to like feel yourself


---------45:11----------
on an instinctive level like what do you


---------45:14----------
want definitely


---------45:15----------
definitely what i'm missing is the


---------45:16----------
feeling and i like that you used


---------45:18----------
instinctive because


---------45:20----------
that's always like how i've been


---------45:21----------
avoiding like very connected to the


---------45:23----------
the animal side of the human being let's


---------45:26----------
say where


---------45:26----------
i've always felt things very strongly


---------45:29----------
instinctively and now i don't feel them


---------45:30----------
anymore so that's where all it sounds


---------45:33----------
tells you okay that's gonna be tough so


---------45:36----------
let me think about this


---------45:38----------
okay i may wind up going the


---------45:40----------
intellectual route anyway


---------45:43----------
all right it's your show


---------45:46----------
yeah no let me just give me a second


---------45:49----------
okay


---------45:53----------
oh [ __ ] hold on


---------46:04----------
when was the last time that you did feel


---------46:06----------
a lot


---------46:10----------
oh long ago holy [ __ ] it's gonna be hard


---------46:12----------
to remember


---------46:16----------
probably back then because i considered


---------46:18----------
2014 the year i died in a certain sense


---------46:21----------
because


---------46:22----------
that was when i was having the panic


---------46:24----------
attacks in total and from that point


---------46:26----------
onwards i remember specifically


---------46:28----------
for some reason i don't know why uh


---------46:29----------
august of 2014


---------46:31----------
i'm not sure what's up with that date


---------46:33----------
but i remember that from there


---------46:34----------
onwards i haven't felt a whole lot


---------46:40----------
okay so it's like five years give or


---------46:43----------
take maybe


---------46:45----------
when you think about the traumatic stuff


---------46:47----------
that happens to you


---------46:49----------
that happened to you do you feel any


---------46:50----------
emotion


---------46:53----------
no it's because it's it's why i joke


---------46:56----------
about it i'm not really feeling anything


---------46:58----------
too


---------46:59----------
dramatic


---------47:03----------
it may be just part of my personality


---------47:04----------
too because i have that kind of


---------47:05----------
personality where i'll make fun of


---------47:07----------
serious [ __ ] and i have offended people


---------47:08----------
in the past let me answer


---------47:11----------
can you tell me about writing poetry


---------47:14----------
yeah actually this this is going to be a


---------47:18----------
little bit embarrassing


---------47:19----------
so i used to fall in love very easily


---------47:21----------
during my school years


---------47:22----------
and a lot of the poetry i would write


---------47:24----------
would like be specific for a girl i was


---------47:26----------
in love with at the time


---------47:27----------
and i would like show it to her and


---------47:29----------
she'd be like that's [ __ ] stupid


---------47:30----------
country


---------47:32----------
because you know at least like you know


---------47:34----------
public schools in


---------47:36----------
lower income areas in brazil it's a


---------47:38----------
rough crowd


---------47:39----------
i'll say that much there were kids that


---------47:42----------
with problems probably worse than mine


---------47:44----------
in a sense so people weren't very happy


---------47:46----------
with the kind of


---------47:49----------
you know very happy with me in a sense


---------47:51----------
because i was too happy and like a world


---------47:53----------
boy three about love


---------47:56----------
and and what do you


---------48:06----------
how how long has it been since you've


---------48:08----------
fallen in love


---------48:10----------
oh it's been a long time as well and


---------48:14----------
i i had some like in cell issues for a


---------48:17----------
while in the sense that


---------48:18----------
you know i've never been reciprocated so


---------48:21----------
you know for a while there


---------48:22----------
it's been a long time maybe seven or


---------48:25----------
eight years where


---------48:26----------
you know i actually blame the women and


---------48:28----------
all that stuff but


---------48:29----------
it's not like that anymore i realized


---------48:31----------
that i was at fault at the time because


---------48:33----------
i kept constantly trying to fill in a


---------48:35----------
hole that i handed me by


---------48:36----------
you know acquiring partners so to speak


---------48:39----------
so i know it was completely my fault but


---------48:42----------
it's been


---------48:45----------
we're in 2021 maybe four years


---------48:52----------
okay


---------48:59----------
how do you feel about yourself


---------49:03----------
uh i feel like i am capable of a lot of


---------49:07----------
things


---------49:07----------
and it frustrates me that i did not


---------49:12----------
how does it feel to be someone who is


---------49:15----------
incapable


---------49:16----------
of doing what you're capable of


---------49:19----------
feels very weak uh cowardice


---------49:23----------
in a sense also


---------49:28----------
maybe


---------49:30----------
uh some resentment towards myself too


---------49:34----------
can you feel that resentment


---------49:38----------
yeah it's liking my stomach right now


---------49:41----------
okay and what do you feel in your


---------49:43----------
stomach


---------49:45----------
it's gotten heavy on and over


---------49:49----------
okay


---------49:53----------
what do you wish you were


---------49:58----------
is gonna sound like some philosophical


---------49:59----------
[ __ ] but they in their meet that i


---------50:01----------
know that i am


---------50:04----------
what's it like to not have access to


---------50:07----------
that person


---------50:11----------
very disheartening uh


---------50:14----------
disappointing and also maybe


---------50:18----------
uh rage inducing even though i don't i


---------50:21----------
can't feel a lot of anger


---------50:22----------
it feels like i have anger in me


---------50:25----------
somewhere


---------50:26----------
it feels that way i guess how do you


---------50:28----------
know you have anger in you


---------50:33----------
it's a very instinctive thing i can't


---------50:35----------
really explain it


---------50:36----------
it's like i i can kind of just tell that


---------50:39----------
it's in there somewhere


---------50:40----------
that there's no logic to it okay how can


---------50:43----------
you tell though like


---------50:46----------
you know it's kind of a weird question


---------50:48----------
but


---------50:50----------
it's it's sort of like like how does


---------50:52----------
your mind


---------50:53----------
know how do your neurons know to produce


---------50:55----------
the word


---------50:56----------
rage inducing


---------51:02----------
i have no idea but i but i do embody the


---------51:05----------
concept that we aren't just our minds so


---------51:08----------
but yeah it's just michael bs


---------51:13----------
it comes like from somewhere i don't


---------51:15----------
know the soul


---------51:18----------
but that's philosophical right like so


---------51:21----------
so like in a very


---------51:22----------
practical sense when i ask you how you


---------51:25----------
feel about yourself


---------51:28----------
right what i'm hearing is like


---------51:31----------
there's some like you're there's it's


---------51:33----------
rage inducing


---------51:35----------
like the way that you live your life


---------51:37----------
pisses you off


---------51:39----------
yeah because i've had this thing of kind


---------51:41----------
of seeing myself in the third person for


---------51:43----------
a very long time and it's like i'm


---------51:44----------
watching myself


---------51:45----------
ruin my life by inaction and it's


---------51:49----------
it's raging basic and what are you doing


---------51:51----------
about ruining your life like you can see


---------51:53----------
everything


---------51:54----------
gabriel what are you doing about it


---------51:58----------
well i'm trying very hard i'm watching


---------52:00----------
videos i'm seeing a therapist


---------52:02----------
but it's like


---------52:06----------
they're but it's it's a yeah it's as you


---------52:09----------
said there's something missing i don't


---------52:10----------
know what it is


---------52:11----------
exactly what's missing


---------52:16----------
me yeah more importantly whose fault is


---------52:20----------
it that it's missing


---------52:22----------
who's responsible for finding it


---------52:28----------
definitely me and how does it feel to


---------52:31----------
have


---------52:32----------
not found it yet


---------52:35----------
very frustrating it's like it's why i


---------52:38----------
gave in a little i tried for so many


---------52:40----------
years and then i'm like you know i'm


---------52:41----------
finally gonna see a therapist because i


---------52:42----------
was trying really hard to do that


---------52:44----------
and i had a lot of pride about that as


---------52:46----------
well like i'm a smart


---------52:47----------
i could figure this off so i had a lot


---------52:49----------
of broadband how do you feel about


---------52:51----------
seeing a therapist


---------52:53----------
it's been great but i absolutely agree


---------52:56----------
do you feel weak


---------53:00----------
yes because back then when i was


---------53:04----------
you know when i shoved people aside and


---------53:07----------
i had a big eagle


---------53:08----------
and all that i felt very strong i wasn't


---------53:10----------
like


---------53:11----------
i didn't like pick on other people or


---------53:13----------
intimidate them but i would always stand


---------53:14----------
up for myself i was a strong guy and


---------53:17----------
where people would always like be lazy


---------53:19----------
or falter like yeah i'm not going to do


---------53:20----------
this like i would go and do it i


---------53:22----------
just have so much presence to me and


---------53:25----------
none of it is here anymore that's what


---------53:27----------
makes me feel weak it's like i have no


---------53:28----------
presence


---------53:29----------
and i know it is my fault because i made


---------53:31----------
it a point to


---------53:32----------
disappear with my presence because it


---------53:34----------
was making people make fun of me


---------53:37----------
sounds like you screwed up gabriel yeah


---------53:41----------
a lot is that what you feel like


---------53:44----------
a screw-up


---------53:48----------
yeah that's in there alright


---------53:59----------
it's like i'm in such a good position


---------54:00----------
too uh


---------54:02----------
you know my mother is taking care of all


---------54:04----------
the the financial [ __ ]


---------54:06----------
she she's like she's doing so well like


---------54:09----------
it's that thing to where i saw you talk


---------54:11----------
about in one of your interviews when you


---------54:13----------
don't have to do something it's you know


---------54:14----------
harder to get yourself to do it because


---------54:16----------
on a financial stand gabriel do you feel


---------54:19----------
like a deadbeat


---------54:21----------
you know what that term means


---------54:25----------
yeah i know what it means but i won't go


---------54:26----------
that far okay


---------54:29----------
how far would you go


---------54:33----------
um someone who's


---------54:36----------
very actively wasting their time i don't


---------54:38----------
know like what word i would use


---------54:41----------
actively


---------54:45----------
let me see if i understand you here so


---------54:47----------
it sounds like you know you get an a for


---------54:50----------
effort but certainly not an a for


---------54:53----------
results


---------54:55----------
yeah pretty much


---------55:00----------
so is that something that feels distant


---------55:02----------
from you


---------55:03----------
that feeling


---------55:09----------
i would say so yeah everything is just


---------55:11----------
so numb the negative the positive it's


---------55:14----------
like


---------55:14----------
it's all equally hard to get to yeah


---------55:18----------
so here's what i think is going on i


---------55:19----------
think we got close


---------55:22----------
um i i i don't know so this is the kind


---------55:26----------
of thing where like i think i could


---------55:28----------
bludgeon you


---------55:30----------
into emotion


---------55:33----------
like i could do things like i could call


---------55:35----------
you


---------55:36----------
the things that you have called yourself


---------55:41----------
in those dark moments and i'm pretty


---------55:43----------
sure the emotion will come


---------55:45----------
roaring out i think a lot of stuff is


---------55:47----------
gonna come roaring out


---------55:50----------
like the negative emotion is gonna come


---------55:53----------
out


---------55:54----------
and also like anger and hatred and like


---------55:57----------
like you're gonna get like you'll like


---------55:58----------
the ego is gonna come out


---------56:00----------
and you'll then it's going to be me and


---------56:02----------
you like you're going to be in the


---------56:04----------
garage i'm going to be upstairs


---------56:05----------
i'm going to pick up the drawer and i'm


---------56:07----------
going to throw it through the window


---------56:08----------
like the emotion is there does that make


---------56:10----------
sense


---------56:11----------
absolutely yes and so if we were


---------56:14----------
actually a cult and we were


---------56:16----------
at a retreat you know there may be some


---------56:18----------
utility to like having that kind of deep


---------56:20----------
emotional exploration


---------56:22----------
i don't know that this is the time or


---------56:25----------
the place or that i feel comfortable


---------56:27----------
heaping on you the abuse that it takes


---------56:30----------
to get you to feel


---------56:35----------
oh i i would actually like to go for it


---------56:40----------
if you're willing because


---------56:41----------
i think that's what i need i'm not so


---------56:43----------
sure


---------56:44----------
that i'm willing okay


---------56:49----------
because i i don't know that that'll i


---------56:52----------
understand that you're hungry for it


---------56:54----------
i don't know that it's gonna be good for


---------56:56----------
you


---------56:57----------
okay so like yeah


---------57:00----------
what do you think about that


---------57:04----------
i wasn't thinking anything i was just


---------57:06----------
getting a little suck


---------57:09----------
why are you sad


---------57:14----------
but because it's like you said i feel


---------57:16----------
like i really need this but


---------57:17----------
you know


---------57:23----------
yeah so there's something important


---------57:24----------
there right so like


---------57:26----------
when i say that you're not gonna get it


---------57:31----------
what am i sentencing you to


---------57:35----------
just going back to my daily routine of


---------57:39----------
you know kind of trying to do it myself


---------57:41----------
and it never works


---------57:43----------
and how so like how do you feel then


---------57:55----------
right so i i think that as we get to


---------57:57----------
this because like here's what i'm


---------57:58----------
hearing from you okay


---------58:00----------
it's like you're doing all the good


---------58:02----------
stuff


---------58:04----------
right and like you have a lot of


---------58:06----------
patheticness in you


---------58:08----------
but you've learned how to like manage


---------58:10----------
that in a positive way


---------58:13----------
right you're like i'm gonna devote


---------58:15----------
myself to growing and i'm gonna put my


---------58:17----------
life together


---------58:18----------
and so you're almost in a sense putting


---------58:20----------
on a mask like it's the mask of like i'm


---------58:22----------
gonna be


---------58:22----------
someone like this is the road that i


---------58:24----------
have to walk and see


---------58:26----------
look everyone look at how much social


---------58:27----------
anxiety i've cured dr k i came on like


---------58:30----------
i've cured i've been cured of social


---------58:31----------
anxiety i've been watching


---------58:32----------
watching your videos for two months and


---------58:34----------
like look at me look at how


---------58:36----------
how much i'm growing can everyone


---------58:39----------
reassure me that i'm growing please


---------58:42----------
can we talk about how much progress


---------58:44----------
we've made


---------58:46----------
and i played right into it right i was


---------58:48----------
like oh gabriel you're level two bro


---------58:51----------
you're not level one so you came in and


---------58:55----------
you asked me to play a part and i played


---------58:56----------
a part with you


---------58:58----------
which is that gabriel is growing


---------59:01----------
but behind that is like this little


---------59:04----------
thing right this little voice in the


---------59:06----------
back of your head which is like it's not


---------59:08----------
gonna work


---------59:11----------
because like the person who's doing it


---------59:14----------
like we can pretend all we want to we


---------59:16----------
can have an a for effort we can check


---------59:18----------
all the boxes


---------59:19----------
but something fundamentally is [ __ ]


---------59:25----------
and that fundamental thing is me


---------59:29----------
and you can pretend all you want to


---------59:31----------
gabriel we're gonna do all this stuff


---------59:34----------
and like at the end of the day like


---------59:36----------
there's just me


---------59:37----------
who's always known that there's a


---------59:39----------
problem and like i've


---------59:41----------
never been able to do anything about it


---------59:43----------
there's powerlessness


---------59:48----------
right and there's like all kinds of


---------59:50----------
other notes here of like


---------59:52----------
you know you love your mom your mom has


---------59:54----------
been the one person who has like


---------59:56----------
you know been there for you and also


---------60:01----------
you blame her the most


---------60:05----------
and then like that creates conflict too


---------60:07----------
because like if you


---------60:09----------
like that's crazy like your dad is the


---------60:11----------
one who deserves the blame


---------60:12----------
your stepfather is the one who deserves


---------60:14----------
the blame but


---------60:15----------
who is the person who let those people


---------60:18----------
in


---------60:20----------
right who is responsible for protecting


---------60:23----------
you


---------60:24----------
from her like from those people and so


---------60:28----------
it can like it can feel really confusing


---------60:30----------
to like blame and feel resentment


---------60:34----------
towards like the one person who's good


---------60:36----------
in your life


---------60:38----------
and then what ends up happening is like


---------60:40----------
somewhere in there like you're not going


---------60:41----------
to blame your mom dude because that's a


---------60:43----------
dick move


---------60:45----------
so there's like one punching bag that


---------60:47----------
you've got left which is yourself


---------60:51----------
and so like all of the blame that that


---------60:54----------
like she deserves like i


---------60:56----------
i'm just gonna tell you you redirect it


---------60:58----------
to yourself like does that make sense to


---------61:00----------
you


---------61:02----------
like i think i


---------61:05----------
i could have been stronger i could have


---------61:07----------
stood up for myself


---------61:09----------
yep right so like like any time i try to


---------61:12----------
blame her


---------61:13----------
you're gonna say like i should have been


---------61:15----------
stronger


---------61:17----------
like you're gonna protect her by blaming


---------61:22----------
yourself


---------61:37----------
what are you feeling


---------61:41----------
actual sadness for the first time in


---------61:44----------
london


---------61:45----------
and i'm very happy about it ironically


---------61:49----------
right so like now like the dam is


---------61:51----------
opening up and like


---------61:52----------
everything is coming out yeah


---------61:56----------
happiness there's


---------61:59----------
there's there's anger about my father


---------62:01----------
and my stepfather but also with me for


---------62:03----------
not standing up to them


---------62:05----------
and there's frustration of the things i


---------62:08----------
had to go through and have


---------62:09----------
nobody to talk to talk those things


---------62:12----------
through with anybody because


---------62:14----------
i didn't have friends like that


---------62:19----------
so going through it is bad enough going


---------62:21----------
through it alone


---------62:24----------
yeah i also like


---------62:28----------
the the few friends i had they would


---------62:30----------
usually be trained as well


---------62:35----------
i remember telling some very personal


---------62:37----------
things that this elementary friend of


---------62:38----------
mine


---------62:38----------
that he just like exposed me to the


---------62:40----------
whole class for no reason


---------62:43----------
oh sure he had a reason


---------62:47----------
yeah i just don't know what it was i


---------62:50----------
think he's wanted to be a dick right


---------62:52----------
he wanted to take advantage of you he's


---------62:54----------
being a bully well


---------62:56----------
pretty much and the [ __ ] the thing is he


---------62:59----------
was also like a


---------63:02----------
another isolated student like me so


---------63:04----------
maybe he wanted to feel powerful for a


---------63:06----------
day on


---------63:07----------
there's your intellectual mind


---------63:12----------
so notice that every one of those


---------63:13----------
statements you make you're going to move


---------63:15----------
further away from


---------63:16----------
the emotion yeah i do with that don't


---------63:19----------
die i never


---------63:20----------
just now be careful because now we're


---------63:23----------
getting very


---------63:24----------
like meta because do you beat yourself


---------63:27----------
up for doing that


---------63:31----------
because like you like it from my


---------63:32----------
feelings yeah


---------63:37----------
absolutely yes see


---------63:40----------
so you got to be careful okay


---------63:44----------
so like i i know it sounds a little bit


---------63:47----------
unsatisfying and if you want to feel


---------63:49----------
more we can


---------63:51----------
we could go for round two if you really


---------63:52----------
want to


---------63:57----------
i i'm not sure i'm just confused i don't


---------63:59----------
know what would be good for me anymore


---------64:01----------
yeah so here's what i think would be


---------64:03----------
good for you okay


---------64:04----------
so i i think that you have worked very


---------64:07----------
hard


---------64:08----------
to turn the dials on your emotions way


---------64:11----------
down


---------64:13----------
because like in the span of like what do


---------64:15----------
you feel nothing what do you feel


---------64:17----------
nothing what do you feel uh


---------64:18----------
some anger in there how do you know i


---------64:19----------
don't know and then like in 30 seconds


---------64:22----------
it's like


---------64:23----------
anger relief right you said happiness i


---------64:26----------
think it's relief


---------64:27----------
really yeah is that like oh i actually


---------64:31----------
can


---------64:31----------
feel like this is what i've been going


---------64:33----------
for right like but there's also like


---------64:35----------
sadness and like self-loathing and like


---------64:38----------
loneliness


---------64:39----------
which we really haven't heard at all in


---------64:40----------
any of your narratives


---------64:44----------
right of like reaching out to people


---------64:45----------
like for support


---------64:47----------
and like you know them really like


---------64:50----------
stabbing you in the like there's there's


---------64:52----------
just a lot of betrayal


---------64:54----------
like just of so many dimensions


---------64:58----------
you know like your grandmother not


---------65:00----------
teaching you like just


---------65:01----------
kind of abandoning you and then like


---------65:03----------
like you know like


---------65:04----------
giving you bad habits like that's


---------65:08----------
the other thing like i i think you


---------65:09----------
probably let yourself


---------65:12----------
blame them for screwing you up


---------65:15----------
but then what happens is then you tell


---------65:17----------
yourself like any time your mind is like


---------65:19----------
it's their fault for like


---------65:20----------
because we can hear that right like your


---------65:21----------
grandmother should have done a better


---------65:23----------
job


---------65:24----------
but then what you end up doing is you


---------65:26----------
step right into it and you're like oh


---------65:28----------
but i could have been stronger


---------65:32----------
yeah it's always about me


---------65:36----------
right and so it's really interesting


---------65:39----------
because like gabriel i think the reason


---------65:40----------
that you're stuck


---------65:42----------
is because the person responsible is not


---------65:46----------
actually responsible like if i blame


---------65:49----------
myself


---------65:50----------
singularly for global warming and


---------65:52----------
climate change


---------65:55----------
then like i'm never gonna be at peace


---------65:57----------
because


---------65:59----------
i can't single-handedly fix the planet


---------66:03----------
and you're doing this thing where like


---------66:04----------
it always comes back to you


---------66:06----------
and i think the first thing you've got


---------66:08----------
to start with is like self-loathing


---------66:12----------
right because i i mean i think it's like


---------66:14----------
there's a lot there


---------66:15----------
that like you really detest about


---------66:18----------
yourself


---------66:21----------
you know there's a part of you that like


---------66:23----------
rationally says yeah it's other people's


---------66:25----------
fault


---------66:26----------
but then there's a part of you that's


---------66:27----------
like no it isn't


---------66:31----------
yeah you're just like screwed up or


---------66:33----------
something wrong with you


---------66:34----------
yep right and to sit with that thing


---------66:38----------
is like really hard


---------66:42----------
right so in a weird go ahead at some


---------66:46----------
point you know that's just the


---------66:47----------
conclusion you come to because


---------66:50----------
your family is beating on you the school


---------66:53----------
students are beating on you


---------66:55----------
just like every person so it must be me


---------66:58----------
right


---------67:00----------
yeah that is the conclusion you come to


---------67:11----------
like i guess these people are right i'm


---------67:13----------
just i'm just too loud i'm just


---------67:15----------
too outgoing i don't keep to myself


---------67:17----------
enough it's just


---------67:19----------
you know and uh well one particular


---------67:21----------
thing that


---------67:22----------
my mother my cousin told me once when i


---------67:24----------
was like playing video games there


---------67:26----------
with them is that i used to play games i


---------67:29----------
would like


---------67:29----------
stand up next to the couch like doing


---------67:31----------
little hops with the controller in my


---------67:33----------
hand like i was very energetic


---------67:35----------
and a bunch of other kids were there too


---------67:37----------
and she was like


---------67:39----------
why can't she be like the other kids it


---------67:41----------
was like


---------67:43----------
i was too young to even know what that


---------67:44----------
meant you know i was just like


---------67:47----------
what the [ __ ] does that mean it can't be


---------67:48----------
like the other kids don't know


---------67:50----------
oh sure you know what that meant


---------67:54----------
what that meant is why can't you be


---------67:56----------
normal why do you have to be screwed up


---------67:58----------
in some way


---------68:00----------
you understand exactly what that meant


---------68:02----------
yeah


---------68:03----------
it's sunk everyone's just everyone's


---------68:06----------
just like playing sitting down


---------68:08----------
though i'm the only one doing everyone


---------68:10----------
else is living their lives and they're


---------68:12----------
screwed up gabriel


---------68:14----------
hopping around gabriel


---------68:19----------
homosexual gabriel


---------68:24----------
right like it like everyone looked at


---------68:25----------
you and they saw like they weren't sure


---------68:26----------
what it was


---------68:27----------
but they knew something was wrong that's


---------68:29----------
like really the one conclusion


---------68:38----------
the chicks i fell in love with it was


---------68:40----------
the same sentiment as well


---------68:42----------
yep right


---------68:47----------
how are you feeling about this


---------68:48----------
conversation


---------68:51----------
oh it's definitely cracking the shower


---------68:53----------
i'm enjoying it


---------68:55----------
it's weird it's it's yeah it's like you


---------68:57----------
said it's relief


---------69:02----------
it's still hard like the tears don't


---------69:04----------
really come out they're just like


---------69:06----------
you know there's camping here so gabriel


---------69:09----------
dude we don't want to take a


---------69:10----------
sledgehammer to your psychological


---------69:12----------
defense mechanisms


---------69:13----------
as much as like we're gonna do relief


---------69:15----------
like a little bit at a time okay


---------69:18----------
okay you have to like build up a


---------69:19----------
tolerance to it


---------69:22----------
like irritable in this i feel


---------69:25----------
very confident that like


---------69:28----------
you know it's sort of like like if i'm


---------69:30----------
if i'm learning yoga for the first time


---------69:33----------
i don't bend all the way


---------69:37----------
i'll break something or snap something


---------69:39----------
and the mind ain't no different


---------69:42----------
right so like you have to like let your


---------69:44----------
mind gain that flexibility like you're


---------69:46----------
not right like i know you want it


---------69:48----------
like i get that you want the full relief


---------69:52----------
yeah and so like we're gonna like teach


---------69:55----------
you how to like handle a little bit at a


---------69:58----------
time


---------69:58----------
okay oh yeah that totally makes sense


---------70:02----------
i was just sitting here thinking like


---------70:05----------
well the thoughts came to my mind now


---------70:06----------
i'm not sure what i was thinking anymore


---------70:08----------
but


---------70:08----------
i was in agreement with what you're


---------70:10----------
saying i was gonna make an example i


---------70:11----------
don't remember anymore


---------70:13----------
it's okay good so we're short-circuiting


---------70:15----------
your mind which is good


---------70:16----------
so that means that your intellectual


---------70:18----------
like crap up here is like


---------70:20----------
not able to function because there's


---------70:22----------
like a motion that's down below which is


---------70:24----------
exactly


---------70:24----------
so that's good okay so like you'll


---------70:26----------
gabriel like you'll get there man


---------70:28----------
like you don't need to even even there's


---------70:31----------
even another layer of like


---------70:32----------
don't judge yourself for not being able


---------70:34----------
to get there


---------70:35----------
all at once right you're walking your


---------70:38----------
journey


---------70:39----------
and so like it's okay to like feel a


---------70:41----------
little bit of emotion


---------70:42----------
feel a little bit i get you want more


---------70:44----------
you'll get there man like i have


---------70:46----------
complete faith in you


---------70:48----------
okay you'll start to feel again you know


---------70:51----------
and you're just gonna need a little bit


---------70:53----------
of help like and that's okay


---------70:55----------
because let's be honest you weren't


---------70:56----------
given a whole lot of help for like


---------70:58----------
what sounds like the first few decades


---------71:00----------
of life okay


---------71:02----------
pretty much i'm 23 now and and if your


---------71:05----------
solace and bright point of your life was


---------71:07----------
sa dota like


---------71:11----------
yeah it was so good and i actually had


---------71:14----------
an offer to be like people to invite me


---------71:15----------
now i'm not trying to like suck my baby


---------71:17----------
but


---------71:18----------
people still invite me even though like


---------71:19----------
i haven't played for months i got a


---------71:21----------
thing off or not


---------71:22----------
i don't know i just don't feel like


---------71:23----------
playing


---------71:25----------
yeah so now


---------71:29----------
we oh okay i mean so i we stepped into


---------71:31----------
the ring twice


---------71:33----------
i'm hesitant to step into the ring a


---------71:35----------
third time i feel like


---------71:36----------
that size what we're looking for that's


---------71:38----------
our limit okay


---------71:43----------
you feel okay with that yeah how's


---------71:46----------
how's your disappointment


---------71:50----------
it's long okay good right so i i know


---------71:53----------
that earlier when i said i don't know if


---------71:54----------
we can get there you felt disappointed


---------71:56----------
it's cool like that's fine


---------71:57----------
it's all part of the game yeah so that


---------71:59----------
it was like


---------72:01----------
it was like a little voice in my head


---------72:02----------
like oh no even dr k


---------72:04----------
can't help it so yeah yep right so so


---------72:07----------
like that's like


---------72:08----------
we triggered that you know i'm


---------72:10----------
broken.exe


---------72:12----------
and so you came here with that that you


---------72:15----------
know the like oh could dr k will help me


---------72:17----------
like


---------72:17----------
and oh my god like he can't oh my god


---------72:19----------
i'm screwed and then it's okay


---------72:21----------
we'll get there okay yeah


---------72:24----------
so so now i if it's okay with you if


---------72:27----------
you're really feeling okay with it i


---------72:28----------
mean if you want to go round three we


---------72:29----------
can


---------72:30----------
try to each round we go it's going to be


---------72:32----------
trickier for me to do in one setting


---------72:34----------
because i have to like


---------72:35----------
squirt skirt past some of your you know


---------72:39----------
intellectual stuff but i think it's if


---------72:40----------
you're feeling okay with it two rounds


---------72:42----------
of relief like i'd like to share a


---------72:43----------
couple of concepts with you if that's


---------72:45----------
okay


---------72:46----------
yeah absolutely


---------72:50----------
what's going on i said i accidentally


---------72:51----------
said squirt instead of skirt


---------72:53----------
and twitch chat is having a field day


---------72:55----------
with me


---------72:57----------
i noticed but i was like whatever yeah i


---------72:59----------
know


---------73:00----------
um so so here's the first thing that i


---------73:02----------
want to say gabriel okay so


---------73:05----------
what so you were kind of talking about


---------73:07----------
how like you experienced anxiety and


---------73:09----------
panic attacks and underneath was


---------73:10----------
depression


---------73:12----------
right yeah and you kind of call it


---------73:13----------
depression because you're maybe not


---------73:15----------
feeling sad but you don't have any


---------73:16----------
motivation there are problems with your


---------73:18----------
concentration things like that


---------73:19----------
so this is the first thing to understand


---------73:21----------
trauma


---------73:23----------
is the great chameleon of mental illness


---------73:26----------
because it can look like and manifest as


---------73:28----------
anything


---------73:30----------
so one of my teachers once told me that


---------73:32----------
if anyone has


---------73:33----------
three separate diagnoses


---------73:36----------
all of them are wrong and chances are


---------73:39----------
it's trauma


---------73:41----------
so like any time i work with someone who


---------73:44----------
says i was dealing with anxiety first


---------73:46----------
and then i


---------73:46----------
fixed the anxiety and i found depression


---------73:50----------
you're going to fix the depression too


---------73:51----------
and you're going to find something else


---------73:54----------
that's like that's exactly the feeling i


---------73:56----------
was describing to some people i'm like


---------73:58----------
the more it fits the more [ __ ] i find it


---------73:59----------
just like


---------74:00----------
it's and that that's trauma in short


---------74:04----------
okay so trauma is the great chameleon of


---------74:06----------
of mental illness like it just manifests


---------74:09----------
as all these different kinds of things


---------74:11----------
it's like it's like morphing where like


---------74:13----------
one minute it's this thing


---------74:15----------
and then it's gonna turn into something


---------74:16----------
else and then it's gonna turn into


---------74:18----------
something else


---------74:19----------
the good news is that even though it


---------74:21----------
changes


---------74:22----------
shape on you that usually means you're


---------74:25----------
making progress


---------74:26----------
and at the end of the day if you can get


---------74:28----------
to the root of the trauma


---------74:30----------
all of the individual symptomatic


---------74:32----------
manifestations will fall apart


---------74:34----------
and this is where we have to talk a


---------74:36----------
little bit about the western system of


---------74:38----------
psychiatry right


---------74:39----------
because these are symptomatic diagnoses


---------74:42----------
when i say you have


---------74:44----------
anxiety that is not about a root it's


---------74:47----------
about a symptom


---------74:48----------
oh i get nervous and sweaty when i speak


---------74:50----------
in front of people i feel tightness in


---------74:52----------
my throat when i queue up for a game of


---------74:53----------
dota good god bro i'm so sorry


---------74:56----------
like dona's our last bastion from panic


---------74:59----------
attacks and anxiety


---------75:00----------
and you're so screwed if you don't even


---------75:03----------
have that


---------75:05----------
right but it's a symptom it's not like a


---------75:06----------
root it's not like you have you know


---------75:09----------
dota is not the root of your mental


---------75:11----------
illnesses it may be the root of other


---------75:12----------
people's mental illnesses


---------75:14----------
but in yours it's a symptomatic


---------75:16----------
manifestation


---------75:17----------
and this is why people get saddled with


---------75:20----------
like multiple diagnoses


---------75:21----------
i'm sure that someone will diagnose you


---------75:23----------
with anxiety someone will diagnose you


---------75:25----------
with panic attacks


---------75:26----------
someone will diagnose you with


---------75:27----------
depression someone will definitely


---------75:29----------
diagnose you with adhd


---------75:32----------
and at the root of it all is trauma


---------75:36----------
and so like as trauma manifests in


---------75:39----------
different ways


---------75:40----------
our diagnostic system


---------75:43----------
because it focuses on symptoms will end


---------75:46----------
you up with like four diagnoses on your


---------75:48----------
chart if you're not careful


---------75:49----------
okay but at the bottom of it is trauma


---------75:53----------
so let's talk a little bit about like


---------75:54----------
you know what happens in trauma and


---------75:57----------
how these different things happen so if


---------75:58----------
we really listen to you what we hear


---------76:00----------
is really one problem which is that


---------76:03----------
you're busted


---------76:04----------
there's something fundamentally broken


---------76:06----------
with you right


---------76:07----------
and for women it's one thing you went


---------76:09----------
down the in-cell route right so you


---------76:11----------
could have gotten diagnosed with


---------76:12----------
in-cell syndrome you know when it comes


---------76:15----------
to


---------76:16----------
like school it may have been something


---------76:17----------
else when it comes to dota like it's


---------76:20----------
something else like the one message that


---------76:22----------
you've gotten over and over and over


---------76:23----------
again is like you're busted and broken


---------76:25----------
in some fundamental way


---------76:28----------
and where does that come from so it


---------76:30----------
comes from trauma and very specifically


---------76:32----------
where does it come from


---------76:34----------
so when you're a child or an infant


---------76:37----------
really because do you know if you were


---------76:38----------
physically abused when you were like one


---------76:40----------
year old two years old things like that


---------76:43----------
i cannot remember but i would not post


---------76:45----------
it but i would not put it past my father


---------76:48----------
sure so like this is essentially what


---------76:50----------
happens when you're now your


---------76:51----------
philosophical scientific self is gonna


---------76:53----------
love this [ __ ]


---------76:54----------
okay so when you are young


---------76:58----------
there's this thing called theory of mind


---------77:00----------
which is the realization that


---------77:02----------
other human beings exist okay


---------77:05----------
so when you're very young you don't


---------77:07----------
realize that other human beings exist


---------77:11----------
like your brain really doesn't have that


---------77:13----------
capacity as we get a little bit older


---------77:15----------
like as we become a toddler like let's


---------77:17----------
say


---------77:17----------
two years old three years old four years


---------77:19----------
old we start to realize there are other


---------77:21----------
organisms


---------77:22----------
like so like when you're an infant when


---------77:24----------
you're one year old


---------77:26----------
you're a single player in a sandbox game


---------77:28----------
there aren't even npcs


---------77:31----------
and then like when you're five years old


---------77:32----------
you sort of start to realize oh there


---------77:34----------
are npcs in the world


---------77:36----------
and then like when you become an


---------77:37----------
adolescent this is why adolescence is so


---------77:40----------
terrifying


---------77:40----------
you start the process of discovering


---------77:42----------
these aren't npcs


---------77:44----------
this is actually an mmo with other


---------77:46----------
players


---------77:48----------
and that everyone is their own pc in


---------77:51----------
their own world


---------77:52----------
and as we become adults and hopefully if


---------77:54----------
we become empathic and stuff


---------77:56----------
we begin to realize that there are all


---------77:57----------
these other people in the world


---------78:00----------
and so the interesting thing is once we


---------78:01----------
realize there are other people in the


---------78:03----------
world


---------78:03----------
and something goes wrong whose fault can


---------78:06----------
it be


---------78:09----------
all the yours so that's what you


---------78:13----------
think because but when once pcs exists


---------78:17----------
right like


---------78:17----------
once other people are this is exactly


---------78:20----------
like


---------78:20----------
you answer the question incorrectly


---------78:22----------
which shows us the problem and shows us


---------78:24----------
your thinking


---------78:25----------
because once two people exist in the


---------78:27----------
world responsibility can be on


---------78:29----------
either one but if you're a solo player


---------78:33----------
in a sandbox game


---------78:34----------
whose fault is it it can only be your


---------78:37----------
fault


---------78:38----------
so this is what we see in trauma and


---------78:40----------
it's actually like very well studied now


---------78:42----------
and we sort of know this


---------78:43----------
that because of theory of mind if i'm a


---------78:46----------
one-year-old child and i get hit whose


---------78:48----------
fault is it


---------78:49----------
it's my fault and if you think about it


---------78:52----------
if if


---------78:53----------
if we didn't think this way we could not


---------78:56----------
function as infants


---------78:57----------
so when i learn when i'm learning how to


---------79:00----------
walk and i stumble and fall


---------79:02----------
i have to think about what i need to do


---------79:04----------
differently i can't go around like


---------79:06----------
blaming my mom


---------79:07----------
for me stumbling and falling at the age


---------79:08----------
of one it's just you'll never learn


---------79:10----------
anything


---------79:12----------
and so like our brains are wired to


---------79:14----------
blame only ourselves which is why trauma


---------79:16----------
is so devastating


---------79:18----------
because when you get abused like the


---------79:21----------
pain that you


---------79:22----------
feel you think is your fault like every


---------79:24----------
time your dad hits you


---------79:26----------
you think you're doing something wrong


---------79:28----------
it's your fault it's your fault it's


---------79:30----------
your fault because you're the only thing


---------79:32----------
that exists in the world


---------79:34----------
and then we get to this like complex


---------79:36----------
where like you go through life


---------79:38----------
blaming yourself constantly


---------79:42----------
because early on like your mind is like


---------79:44----------
oh clearly like when i'm in pain it's my


---------79:46----------
fault because other people don't exist


---------79:48----------
and then you discover that formula that


---------79:50----------
form formula


---------79:51----------
gets you know not really hardwired but


---------79:54----------
it gets put in right protect mode so


---------79:56----------
it's hard to change


---------79:58----------
and then as you go through life that


---------80:00----------
formula gets reinforced


---------80:03----------
right when girls reject you


---------80:07----------
there's something wrong with me there's


---------80:08----------
something wrong with me there's


---------80:08----------
something yeah something wrong with me


---------80:10----------
i was just about to say it makes a lot


---------80:12----------
of sense for me because back when i was


---------80:13----------
an insult that's


---------80:14----------
exactly what would happen it's like like


---------80:16----------
girls would reject me and i'm like


---------80:18----------
what did i do wrong just because they


---------80:19----------
weren't into me like doesn't necessarily


---------80:21----------
mean anything i know that now


---------80:22----------
but back then yeah so then what happens


---------80:25----------
is we have the trauma


---------80:26----------
and then our intellectual mind comes up


---------80:29----------
with all the adaptations and protections


---------80:31----------
and defense


---------80:32----------
mechanisms which is what happens within


---------80:33----------
cells right so like i can't deal with my


---------80:36----------
sense that i'm doing something so wrong


---------80:38----------
so let me construct an external world


---------80:41----------
view that like deflects blame for myself


---------80:44----------
okay and this is where like you are just


---------80:46----------
misattributing blame right and left like


---------80:49----------
we're like because now


---------80:50----------
like when it comes to your mom you're


---------80:51----------
taking too much blame


---------80:54----------
and when it comes to incels like they're


---------80:56----------
attributing too much blame to the


---------80:57----------
outside world


---------80:59----------
right so like the point though is that


---------81:00----------
something about the responsibility


---------81:02----------
structure in your mind has gotten like


---------81:04----------
miswired and so we see this a lot


---------81:08----------
because like and this is why like it's


---------81:10----------
gonna keep on manifesting as weird


---------81:11----------
things as long as you're fundamentally


---------81:13----------
busted


---------81:14----------
it's going to manifest in particular


---------81:15----------
symptomatic ways


---------81:18----------
yeah that makes a lot of sense because


---------81:20----------
like for example i have all these


---------81:22----------
philosophical ethios that i said i


---------81:24----------
wanted to


---------81:24----------
write a book or like make some youtube


---------81:26----------
videos so i have them here on the


---------81:28----------
notebook and


---------81:29----------
what will usually happen is uh


---------81:32----------
would you allow me to like read a very


---------81:34----------
short stream


---------81:35----------
sure something that i wrote down that i


---------81:39----------
felt very good about and basically what


---------81:41----------
happens is


---------81:42----------
after enough time passes i'm like yeah


---------81:44----------
you know that good thing you wrote down


---------81:46----------
that you're proud of yeah it's trash you


---------81:48----------
know don't share it with anyone


---------81:49----------
that happens a lot so there's this thing


---------81:52----------
i wrote


---------81:53----------
i'm just gonna read it uh


---------81:56----------
take notice of your insecurities and


---------81:58----------
health reproductions of past events


---------82:00----------
by fixing this you will no longer be


---------82:02----------
anxious and require your ego to protect


---------82:05----------
you


---------82:06----------
so that's like like the type of things


---------82:08----------
that i write down and then you know i


---------82:09----------
can go deeper into it i'm


---------82:11----------
if i'm gonna make a video about it and


---------82:12----------
so i write these things down


---------82:14----------
and it depends on how good i i felt


---------82:16----------
about it like the more


---------82:18----------
the better i felt about the idea at the


---------82:20----------
moment it takes longer for that thought


---------82:21----------
to come


---------82:22----------
but eventually it comes like either a


---------82:24----------
couple hours or a couple days i'm like


---------82:26----------
yeah you know that thing you wrote down


---------82:28----------
yeah not like


---------82:28----------
it's obvious it's not there's no point


---------82:31----------
in sharing it


---------82:33----------
absolutely so now let's talk a little


---------82:35----------
bit about like principle number two


---------82:37----------
which


---------82:38----------
is how this trauma leads to a lack of


---------82:41----------
motivation


---------82:43----------
so like there's a there's an equation


---------82:44----------
that's going on in your head right like


---------82:46----------
you


---------82:47----------
you do something that you're proud of


---------82:50----------
and then that voice creeps up in the


---------82:52----------
back of your mind that then says


---------82:54----------
this is dumb because from a very young


---------82:57----------
age you were taught


---------82:59----------
that like you're fundamentally busted


---------83:01----------
right so when you get abused


---------83:03----------
and you start to like blame yourself for


---------83:05----------
the things that happened to you


---------83:07----------
which is the basic problem like that's


---------83:09----------
what you experienced through and through


---------83:11----------
then how can you ever be motivated


---------83:13----------
because what's the point


---------83:16----------
if you were fundamentally busted in even


---------83:18----------
your greatest


---------83:19----------
efforts are actually trash


---------83:24----------
why would you ever act


---------83:27----------
so this is where like you know when you


---------83:28----------
say there's a lack of motivation


---------83:30----------
absolutely so the motivation the lack of


---------83:33----------
motivation is because like human beings


---------83:34----------
our brain is wired to predict the


---------83:37----------
success


---------83:37----------
of an action and that's what causes us


---------83:40----------
to act


---------83:42----------
like i'm not gonna go you know try to


---------83:44----------
chop down a tree to get a glass of water


---------83:46----------
because my brain


---------83:47----------
says like it's absurd my brain's like


---------83:49----------
there's no point in doing that because


---------83:51----------
it'll never work


---------83:54----------
and so as long as you believe that thing


---------83:57----------
about yourself the motivation will be


---------83:59----------
not even hard to come by it'll be


---------84:01----------
impossible to come by it doesn't mean


---------84:03----------
that you can't act


---------84:06----------
right but like as as long as there's a


---------84:08----------
voice in your head


---------84:09----------
telling you any action you take is


---------84:12----------
worthless because it's never going to


---------84:14----------
amount to anything


---------84:14----------
it's going to be impossible to motivate


---------84:16----------
yourself so that's what we sometimes


---------84:17----------
call


---------84:18----------
depression because you're like i don't


---------84:19----------
know what to call this thing so i'mma


---------84:21----------
call it depression


---------84:23----------
right which is fair it's like it's the


---------84:25----------
experience of depressed people but i


---------84:27----------
think that depression is actually like a


---------84:28----------
complicated


---------84:30----------
term that can actually lead to like


---------84:33----------
if you follow depression down to its


---------84:35----------
roots we're going to see multiple things


---------84:37----------
and what i'd say is if you're struggling


---------84:39----------
with motivation and you have a history


---------84:40----------
of trauma


---------84:42----------
the key thing that will really just


---------84:44----------
shatter that apart in the same way that


---------84:46----------
we like


---------84:46----------
you know cracked your damn and like all


---------84:49----------
kinds of emotions came out


---------84:50----------
sadness anger relief happiness like what


---------84:54----------
the hell is going on


---------84:56----------
the system will fall apart and in the


---------84:59----------
same way your lack of a


---------85:01----------
motivation will also just like it'll


---------85:03----------
just crumble man


---------85:06----------
that feels very good to hear yeah if you


---------85:09----------
can change your perception of yourself


---------85:11----------
and that's where we get into like all


---------85:12----------
kinds of other things because


---------85:13----------
if you can't change into your perception


---------85:15----------
of yourself whose fault is it


---------85:17----------
mine absolutely it'll keep going okay so


---------85:20----------
be careful for it


---------85:22----------
but i've seen it happen and in the same


---------85:24----------
way that all the emotions will come


---------85:25----------
rushing out


---------85:26----------
like you'll just start to feel motivated


---------85:30----------
because there's a point to you acting


---------85:33----------
then motivation will come but in order


---------85:35----------
for there to be a point


---------85:36----------
in you acting you have to have like some


---------85:38----------
degree of like


---------85:40----------
compassion and faith in yourself that


---------85:43----------
you can do it


---------85:44----------
and that's a slow journey and in your


---------85:48----------
case it starts with learning how to feel


---------85:52----------
and also like crazy yeah


---------85:55----------
it's crazier mentioning this because


---------85:57----------
it's like it's like i was saying i can


---------85:59----------
see an inner knee


---------86:00----------
like i know what he's like he's very


---------86:03----------
like charismatic


---------86:04----------
good with people he has lots of friends


---------86:06----------
like he just goes and does


---------86:07----------
things and he sparkle when i'm dipping


---------86:09----------
to meditation i can


---------86:11----------
see that person inside myself so what


---------86:13----------
you're saying makes a lot of sense that


---------86:14----------
i need to try and get to him because all


---------86:16----------
this shit's in the way


---------86:18----------
yeah and if you want to go even deeper


---------86:21----------
you don't need to get to him he's


---------86:22----------
already there


---------86:25----------
it's your effort to try to get to him


---------86:29----------
that creates the sense of incapability


---------86:34----------
oh i'm chasing an idea oh [ __ ]


---------86:38----------
right so this is where like like it's


---------86:40----------
weird


---------86:41----------
but as long as you're trying to get to


---------86:43----------
him


---------86:45----------
you're not him and what makes you not


---------86:48----------
him is like


---------86:51----------
not being him you know does that sound


---------86:52----------
kind of weird i completely understand


---------86:55----------
because i'm all about the philosophical


---------86:56----------
[ __ ] so i got


---------86:58----------
it you you get me so it's it's the chase


---------87:00----------
for the goal


---------87:01----------
that actually it becomes the


---------87:03----------
self-fulfilling prophecy


---------87:05----------
because you don't need to be any


---------87:06----------
different gabriel that dude's there bro


---------87:08----------
you're there we've seen him today


---------87:12----------
you've always been you it's [ __ ] up


---------87:15----------
because people tell me that all the time


---------87:17----------
they're like they can see like my


---------87:18----------
charisma and my whatever and i'm just


---------87:20----------
like


---------87:21----------
nah i don't think it's there right but


---------87:24----------
you know it's there


---------87:26----------
it's the fact that you can't see it


---------87:29----------
that moves it away


---------87:36----------
yeah that's that's exactly what happens


---------87:38----------
yeah absolutely


---------87:40----------
and you know it's like you were saying


---------87:42----------
as long as i chase it so i'm not going


---------87:43----------
to get to it i just need to pee


---------87:45----------
i completely understand and it reminds


---------87:48----------
me of you know


---------87:49----------
uh vegeta chasing goku he's like he


---------87:51----------
never gets up he catches love because


---------87:53----------
he's just chasing


---------87:55----------
yeah and this is where where there's um


---------88:00----------
you know i think like the last thing


---------88:02----------
i'll kind of leave you with


---------88:04----------
is this sort of idea from like like this


---------88:06----------
is why like when we we look at


---------88:07----------
enlightenment


---------88:08----------
there's all the zen masters will say


---------88:10----------
that we're already enlightened


---------88:13----------
we actually don't need you can't become


---------88:16----------
enlightened you can't


---------88:17----------
become anything there's just what is


---------88:21----------
and so like the the first thing that a


---------88:23----------
zen master does when they become


---------88:24----------
enlightened is laugh


---------88:25----------
because and someone asked him why are


---------88:27----------
you laughing like a crazy person like


---------88:28----------
this has all been a


---------88:29----------
gargantuan waste of time i didn't need


---------88:32----------
to do any of it


---------88:34----------
i was already perfect and so even when


---------88:38----------
we say


---------88:39----------
enlightenment we will also translate it


---------88:41----------
as realization


---------88:43----------
realization is not about gaining


---------88:45----------
something new


---------88:47----------
right it's you already have it you just


---------88:49----------
realize it


---------88:51----------
yeah it's noticing what is


---------88:56----------
right so like when you meditate and you


---------88:59----------
feel that


---------89:00----------
perfect you that's not a perfect you


---------89:03----------
it's you


---------89:07----------
and as long as you think of it as a


---------89:08----------
perfect you you will by definition


---------89:11----------
create and imperfect you the two come


---------89:14----------
handily yeah


---------89:16----------
yeah because i will be the one that is


---------89:18----------
not


---------89:19----------
that yep so as long as there's


---------89:22----------
this you're going to create a vat and


---------89:25----------
since you love the philosophical stuff


---------89:27----------
that is the root of advaita vedanta


---------89:30----------
if you know what that is it's


---------89:31----------
non-dualism which is like the


---------89:33----------
major yogic philosophy that i tend to


---------89:36----------
teach from


---------89:38----------
international families yeah so i'll oh


---------89:41----------
so it's a d v a i t a


---------89:44----------
v a d a n t a i'll message you in


---------89:46----------
discord


---------89:48----------
okay but but it's sort of this idea that


---------89:50----------
like you know there's just a one thing


---------89:51----------
and


---------89:52----------
everything else is an artificial


---------89:53----------
construction that's created from the


---------89:55----------
mind


---------89:57----------
and i think when you as you start to


---------89:58----------
like you know meditate and stuff you'll


---------90:00----------
begin to understand


---------90:01----------
so this is a philosophy that wasn't


---------90:03----------
developed as a philosophy it wasn't


---------90:05----------
developed as an intellectual exercise


---------90:07----------
it was devel it was the way that people


---------90:09----------
tried to put into words the experiences


---------90:12----------
of meditation


---------90:15----------
makes sense so you know


---------90:19----------
any questions


---------90:22----------
uh not really i think you've taught me a


---------90:25----------
lot


---------90:26----------
because you're definitely right on the


---------90:28----------
thing that you know i wasn't trying to


---------90:29----------
come across that way as


---------90:30----------
smart as when i joined but i definitely


---------90:33----------
had this whole


---------90:34----------
thing of you know i've learned a lot


---------90:35----------
i've done all these things and


---------90:37----------
blah blah blah and you've helped me see


---------90:39----------
something that i could not see so that's


---------90:41----------
the biggest gift i could ask for


---------90:43----------
well i'm happy to give it so i'm gonna


---------90:46----------
leave you with a meditation


---------90:48----------
practice and and i guess i'm going to


---------90:49----------
leave it for everyone i don't know that


---------90:51----------
many people are going to be able to do


---------90:52----------
it very easily


---------90:54----------
but like gabriel this is the main thing


---------90:56----------
you need to learn when you meditate


---------90:58----------
and you find your perfect self i want


---------91:01----------
you to just


---------91:02----------
sit between your perfect self and your


---------91:06----------
imperfect self


---------91:08----------
so every time you tell yourself you are


---------91:10----------
incapable


---------91:11----------
that should become your meditation and i


---------91:14----------
want you to look at that and realize


---------91:16----------
like


---------91:17----------
why do i feel imperfect now


---------91:20----------
and when you meditate and you feel that


---------91:22----------
true you


---------91:23----------
why do you feel like that's the true you


---------91:28----------
like because if you really want to


---------91:29----------
overcome this you need to understand


---------91:31----------
like


---------91:32----------
what is the true you so every time you


---------91:34----------
feel incapable


---------91:35----------
sit with it every time you meditate sit


---------91:38----------
with it in the same way


---------91:40----------
be non-judgmental don't prefer one over


---------91:43----------
the other


---------91:46----------
and for those of you who have experience


---------91:48----------
with meditation i would encourage you to


---------91:50----------
do the same thing right so like


---------91:52----------
when we meditate we sometimes see a


---------91:54----------
version of ourself that we try to


---------91:56----------
gravitate towards


---------91:57----------
why do we prefer that person as opposed


---------91:59----------
to this person what's the difference


---------92:02----------
i want you to swim in that space between


---------92:05----------
perfection and imperfection


---------92:10----------
sounds hard but i know what you're


---------92:12----------
saying yep


---------92:15----------
and so what you'll discover i'll give


---------92:17----------
you a little do you want to hint


---------92:20----------
yes please so what you'll discover


---------92:24----------
this is the real thing it says you swim


---------92:26----------
between perfection and improv


---------92:27----------
like there's the perfect you and there's


---------92:29----------
the imperfect you right


---------92:32----------
hopefully one day you'll realize who the


---------92:34----------
[ __ ] is doing the swimming


---------92:38----------
that's a very good question


---------92:42----------
huh


---------92:47----------
no i don't have a philosophical [ __ ]


---------92:49----------
answer this time so good because you're


---------92:51----------
never going to have one


---------92:52----------
it's impossible so that's good so then


---------92:55----------
that's the meditation practice for you


---------92:57----------
so at the edge of


---------92:58----------
philosophy i'm not saying philosophy is


---------93:01----------
bad it's definitely very useful


---------93:02----------
but at the edge of philosophy comes


---------93:04----------
subjective experience


---------93:06----------
because philosophy is like the


---------93:07----------
translation of it's the objectification


---------93:10----------
of subjective experience


---------93:11----------
that we try to transmit between each


---------93:13----------
other so by all means like do philosophy


---------93:15----------
dude write your book


---------93:17----------
share your thoughts because i genuinely


---------93:19----------
think they have value i think you need


---------93:20----------
to work on them


---------93:22----------
right so thank you but that means a lot


---------93:25----------
coming from you because i'm definitely


---------93:26----------
felt


---------93:28----------
like i didn't know you wanted to write a


---------93:29----------
book on philosophy but like within the


---------93:31----------
first five minutes i thought the way


---------93:32----------
that you put things together


---------93:34----------
is like quite good it's like


---------93:37----------
instagram calendar level tweet


---------93:40----------
level deep shower thoughts yeah


---------93:43----------
so that's just i am very smart


---------93:48----------
i've done so much introspection and gone


---------93:50----------
through so much that i want to share


---------93:52----------
this with other people pretty much so


---------93:55----------
that's how we see it


---------93:56----------
i i think it's fine to share but i would


---------93:59----------
really


---------94:00----------
learn be a master of it before you share


---------94:02----------
it don't share a half-baked thing


---------94:06----------
it's like that right so like devote


---------94:08----------
yourself to this and then like


---------94:10----------
absolutely write a book but like it


---------94:11----------
should be packaged complete and thorough


---------94:16----------
okay i'll take that advice yeah


---------94:20----------
thank you thank you guys so much for


---------94:22----------
having me


---------94:23----------
thank you man see you chad see ya


---------94:28----------
okay chat tricky one was gabriel
