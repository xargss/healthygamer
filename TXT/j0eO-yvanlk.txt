---------00:00----------
last time I talked to you you you went


---------00:01----------
by Raj mm-hm and just a little bit


---------00:05----------
curious about what prompted the change


---------00:07----------
well I I had a there's just like a


---------00:10----------
tremendous amount of people that I mean


---------00:12----------
I don't know exactly how many people but


---------00:14----------
there are a lot of people that felt like


---------00:16----------
that it was like they're very


---------00:18----------
problematic and offensive um and I know


---------00:21----------
that there was other people that like


---------00:23----------
didn't and I I mean I spoke with you and


---------00:25----------
I you said that you know like oh it's


---------00:27----------
just the internet but I didn't want to


---------00:28----------
leave any real like reason for those


---------00:32----------
people within my community to feel like


---------00:33----------
they were excluded because of that


---------00:36----------
offense and to be completely honest like


---------00:38----------
he didn't make sense anyway like I was


---------00:40----------
doing I was me I was Who I am you know


---------00:42----------
didn't really make any sense so I wanted


---------00:45----------
to move on yeah cool man I just want to


---------00:47----------
reiterate that like like I said to you I


---------00:50----------
wasn't defendant as an Gujarati Indian


---------00:53----------
so your name is Ravi or your name sir


---------00:56----------
you know I grew up around uh in a


---------01:00----------
predominantly Indian community like with


---------01:01----------
a lot of Indian friends but I felt like


---------01:03----------
that didn't justify my use of the name


---------01:06----------
and such so like I just I wanted to you


---------01:10----------
know apologize to those who that that


---------01:12----------
that were personally affected or


---------01:14----------
impacted and just sort of move on from


---------01:16----------
it oh and by the way start about the


---------01:18----------
bandaid on my forehead I uh it's not as


---------01:21----------
it but it's a I got a biopsy from a wart


---------01:27----------
that I had so no judgment


---------01:33----------
yeah and just just about that for a


---------01:36----------
second so I won't actually like say I


---------01:38----------
appreciate like even though I wasn't


---------01:40----------
personally offended I really appreciate


---------01:42----------
the change and the reason is because


---------01:44----------
first of all like I know I did and said


---------01:47----------
a lot of things I don't know when you


---------01:49----------
came up with the name but like you know


---------01:51----------
when I was 19 I did a lot of stupid and


---------01:53----------
offensive stuff and I think it's like


---------01:56----------
important to you know change and grow


---------02:00----------
and I can totally get you know where


---------02:03----------
you're coming from in terms of sort of


---------02:04----------
saying like even though it doesn't


---------02:05----------
bother some people and like you know is


---------02:07----------
it offensive is it not offensive just


---------02:08----------
like you know just change and then the


---------02:11----------
other thing is that I think that a lot


---------02:12----------
of times people


---------02:13----------
looked figures like streamers and even


---------02:17----------
though the streamer may not be doing


---------02:18----------
something that's like completely out of


---------02:20----------
line it gives their audience license to


---------02:24----------
do things that are more out of line yeah


---------02:29----------
I mean in we yeah it's it's it's sort of


---------02:34----------
one of those things I mean you know as


---------02:35----------
you say I mean I've gone through


---------02:37----------
tremendous progression in my own life my


---------02:39----------
personal life my professional life you


---------02:41----------
know I came out this past year as gay or


---------02:45----------
mostly gay as I say because sexuality is


---------02:48----------
complex and you know it's I've realized


---------02:52----------
that there's just a journey and you know


---------02:53----------
when I first started experimenting with


---------02:55----------
my sexuality at that moment I was like


---------02:57----------
nobody's ever gonna know this is a phase


---------03:00----------
you know that sort of thing so you know


---------03:04----------
I've just been on this sort of journey


---------03:06----------
over the last bit of time and it's I'm


---------03:11----------
happy you know but it it sucks you know


---------03:13----------
you make mistakes and it sucks but yeah


---------03:15----------
I hate that I I'll be honest you know I


---------03:17----------
hate that I I like I don't want to say I


---------03:20----------
hate myself but like I'm just like god


---------03:22----------
what a [ __ ] loser you were you know


---------03:24----------
like what no I'm I'm I'm with you man I


---------03:27----------
mean I think that's actually like what I


---------03:29----------
really respect about what you're doing


---------03:30----------
is because like we all make mistakes and


---------03:32----------
like somewhere along the way it became


---------03:33----------
okay to not make mistakes you know yeah


---------03:37----------
and and not to say that it is like it


---------03:40----------
doesn't justify the behavior but I think


---------03:42----------
the most important thing to remember is


---------03:43----------
that like humans human beings aren't


---------03:45----------
born perfect and ultimately what I look


---------03:48----------
for and and what Garner's my respect is


---------03:50----------
like someone's ability to look into


---------03:52----------
their past and say hey like I did this


---------03:55----------
then and I didn't know any better and


---------03:56----------
now I do so I'm gonna change and I think


---------04:00----------
often times you know people will just


---------04:02----------
like judge people for being idiots which


---------04:05----------
is sort of fair because you were an


---------04:06----------
idiot and like so I get that but at the


---------04:08----------
end of the day you know I think that we


---------04:11----------
should also respect people who are


---------04:12----------
willing to like change the way that they


---------04:14----------
think and take a step forward because


---------04:17----------
and I've been thinking about this a lot


---------04:19----------
like I don't know how what kind of role


---------04:21----------
models we have on the Internet and and I


---------04:26----------
think a lot of what we see is because


---------04:27----------
like we don't have people don't know


---------04:29----------
like what good looks like and I just


---------04:34----------
think well it sure I can bandaid on the


---------04:37----------
forehead I can tell you that what are we


---------04:41----------
talking about today


---------04:42----------
we're talking about we're talking about


---------04:46----------
anxiety culture dog I almost called you


---------04:49----------
mr. Kay that's cool since you're a


---------04:52----------
doctor no I mean I'm not a foe okay yes


---------04:56----------
I know mr. mr. dr. kay people call me


---------05:01----------
dr. show which is not not accurate I'm


---------05:05----------
not a doctor I don't want and show isn't


---------05:07----------
my last name I don't know where that


---------05:08----------
came from but I changed my channel name


---------05:11----------
to Austin show and people call me mr.


---------05:12----------
and dr. show so that's a doctor I am not


---------05:16----------
offended by you being called doctor I


---------05:18----------
think it's just except I can change them


---------05:20----------
can we page one into dr. show is that


---------05:22----------
what I can do


---------05:22----------
yeah I mean the only thing is I would


---------05:24----------
consult with an attorney to make sure


---------05:25----------
that your audience understands that


---------05:26----------
you're not a real doctor but as a


---------05:29----------
personal doctor an Indian person I have


---------05:31----------
not been personally offended by either


---------05:33----------
of those okay I mean there are all kinds


---------05:36----------
of people calling them doctors all kinds


---------05:39----------
of [ __ ] yeah that's okay yeah


---------05:41----------
so it's ironic doctor get yeah then I'm


---------05:44----------
anxious to talk about anxiety it's


---------05:47----------
actually kind of fitting but yeah most


---------05:49----------
great you be open and open and


---------05:51----------
transparent with it and I think that


---------05:52----------
maybe I'm sure there's a lot of people


---------05:54----------
that can relate with anxiety in the chat


---------05:56----------
but as we go through the course of our


---------05:58----------
conversation they'll probably understand


---------05:59----------
why sure yeah so you want to just start


---------06:04----------
there like why are you anxious to talk


---------06:06----------
about anxiety um I think I think anxiety


---------06:10----------
and and sort of like you know mental


---------06:13----------
health in general is a very personal


---------06:14----------
intimate thing I guess not I feel like


---------06:16----------
it's something that definitely needs to


---------06:18----------
be talked about because it's a it's a


---------06:19----------
problem that that so many people deal


---------06:21----------
with and I think the solution is talking


---------06:24----------
about it and and sort of being open


---------06:26----------
about open about your emotions and


---------06:29----------
feelings but I just think that like the


---------06:33----------
anxiety from talking about it xiety is


---------06:35----------
like sort of like the idea of like being


---------06:36----------
feeling vulnerable and talking about


---------06:39----------
things that are just you know


---------06:41----------
things that are personal to you that you


---------06:43----------
don't really talk about because you sort


---------06:45----------
of put on like a rough exterior is a


---------06:49----------
personality that like you you are


---------06:52----------
expected to sort of be more than or like


---------06:57----------
above you know what I mean


---------06:59----------
what are you expected to be well I mean


---------07:02----------
I don't know if the expectation is like


---------07:04----------
exactly set forth like specifically but


---------07:09----------
I feel like I'm expected to sort of be


---------07:10----------
perfect in some regard and Marcus sort


---------07:14----------
of held to a higher standard which I


---------07:16----------
understand why that would be the case


---------07:17----------
you know given that I think we are held


---------07:19----------
to a higher standard and rightfully so


---------07:21----------
we have a lot of influence and so we


---------07:25----------
should be held to a higher standard but


---------07:28----------
but yeah but like but still despite that


---------07:31----------
I still am a human being and I have


---------07:35----------
these emotions and everything so it's


---------07:37----------
very complicated sorry I don't know if I


---------07:39----------
answered your question


---------07:39----------
yeah I mean I think you answered it


---------07:41----------
really well I think you know it's kind


---------07:43----------
of interesting it's like I don't know


---------07:45----------
when we started holding different humans


---------07:48----------
to different standards like if that's


---------07:51----------
actually good like so yeah like if


---------07:55----------
you're a streamer you shouldn't be an


---------07:57----------
[ __ ] but if you're in twitch at like


---------08:01----------
it's okay to be a racist [ __ ] you


---------08:06----------
know it's kind of interesting it's like


---------08:07----------
everyone says like it's the standard


---------08:09----------
thing that everyone says like oh like I


---------08:11----------
you know I should be he'll do it like


---------08:12----------
I'm held too high like why why can't we


---------08:15----------
hold like why can't we expect everyone


---------08:18----------
to be decent human beings yeah it's a


---------08:22----------
it's a good point


---------08:24----------
I mean I've come to the conclusion that


---------08:26----------
we including myself as everybody's a


---------08:28----------
little bit of a hypocrite yeah you know


---------08:30----------
that's the board like if you if you


---------08:32----------
evaluate everybody's life holistically


---------08:35----------
is that the right word dr. K I'm in I'm


---------08:37----------
in an intellectual environment you're a


---------08:38----------
doctor because the right word let me


---------08:40----------
look tell me man


---------08:41----------
holistically I don't know what you're


---------08:44----------
trying to say so I don't know if it's


---------08:45----------
the right word I was just like trying to


---------08:48----------
say over overall like look sure whole


---------08:50----------
picture sounds like everybody's life


---------08:55----------
like on the whole picture I I think you


---------08:57----------
would find that everybody is a hypocrite


---------09:00----------
everybody yeah hundred Britain of the


---------09:02----------
people are hypocritical sure to some


---------09:04----------
degree I mean if you really look at it


---------09:06----------
that sort of thing but yeah yeah cool I


---------09:10----------
mean I don't know where I was gonna I


---------09:12----------
it's just interesting cuz I hear this


---------09:13----------
line a lot that everyone like you know I


---------09:15----------
should be held to a higher standard than


---------09:17----------
other people and I feel that way too


---------09:19----------
like I feel like I have to be held to a


---------09:20----------
higher standard but then like there are


---------09:22----------
other parts of me that like why do other


---------09:24----------
people get a pass why can't we hold


---------09:27----------
everyone to the same standard isn't that


---------09:29----------
really what equality is like and and I


---------09:32----------
also think that sometimes what I see is


---------09:34----------
that actually people hold streamers to


---------09:37----------
unfair standards


---------09:40----------
you know cuz I I feel like yeah I mean


---------09:42----------
what do you mean in particular I mean


---------09:44----------
just just like you know so if we just


---------09:47----------
listen to some of what you started


---------09:49----------
saying you were kind of saying like I


---------09:51----------
feel like I have to maintain an exterior


---------09:53----------
right you feel like you have to maintain


---------09:55----------
something you feel like maybe other


---------09:57----------
people are allowed to feel


---------10:00----------
whereas on some level you may not be or


---------10:05----------
you may not feel as allow to feel right


---------10:08----------
and unclear whether you're actually


---------10:10----------
allowed or not allowed but like let me


---------10:13----------
give me an example of like in the the


---------10:16----------
exterior portion and how that's


---------10:18----------
communicated to the audience because I


---------10:19----------
think maybe that people might not


---------10:21----------
understand exactly where I'm coming from


---------10:22----------
let's say I'm like going through like a


---------10:24----------
like a serious like mental health


---------10:26----------
breakdown or something like you know and


---------10:29----------
like I need to like I alway take out a


---------10:32----------
show I like cancel the show I sometimes


---------10:34----------
don't feel well in sometimes I'll be


---------10:37----------
like hey I'm going through a rough patch


---------10:38----------
and I'll explain that but other times I


---------10:40----------
feel like I can't really say like hey


---------10:43----------
the reason I acted this way B was


---------10:44----------
because I was anxious because people


---------10:46----------
like oh yeah nice excuse or something


---------10:48----------
like that or the reason I was like you


---------10:51----------
know doing this or whatever is because I


---------10:53----------
was anxious people you know I feel like


---------10:55----------
that it's just it's just an excuse or


---------10:57----------
whatever so you feel judged yeah I mean


---------11:01----------
certainly I mean yeah of course yeah


---------11:03----------
some degree for being human yeah but


---------11:10----------
look I mean III also want to say that


---------11:13----------
I'm extremely extraordinarily blessed to


---------11:15----------
be in the position that I'm in and like


---------11:16----------
I feel like you know the the the the


---------11:19----------
pros of this oh hold on hold on a second


---------11:22----------
Austin yeah hold on okay this is weird


---------11:25----------
so I'm okay why not so I said do you


---------11:28----------
feel judged for being human and what was


---------11:30----------
your response to go to basically say


---------11:35----------
that I'm not human yep right like


---------11:38----------
basically to basically be like yeah


---------11:40----------
you're just human and then like think of


---------11:42----------
it as sort of like an excuse that you


---------11:44----------
said like I thought you saying that was


---------11:46----------
giving me an excuse it's weird right so


---------11:48----------
so I said hey man you're allowed to be


---------11:50----------
human and you said but I'm blessed


---------11:53----------
and there's a saddle there's a subtle


---------11:54----------
there's a subtle there's of something


---------11:56----------
very insidious there which I like really


---------11:58----------
want to point out like I could be wrong


---------12:00----------
about this by the way yeah it's weird


---------12:02----------
right like I'm saying Austin you're


---------12:04----------
allowed to be human and you're basically


---------12:06----------
saying in your response I didn't even


---------12:08----------
let you finish I'm sure you would have


---------12:09----------
said something but I just want you to


---------12:10----------
notice what your mind did is you talked


---------12:13----------
about the privilege and why does someone


---------12:15----------
like talking about the privilege that


---------12:17----------
you've been given in life sort of in


---------12:20----------
that moment invalidates like your


---------12:23----------
capacity to be upset or hurt or whatever


---------12:28----------
I see this a lot with like privileged


---------12:30----------
people where they almost like invalidate


---------12:33----------
like that's that's the standard that you


---------12:35----------
hold yourself to you see that it's like


---------12:36----------
you're not letting yourself be like a


---------12:38----------
human and and you know somebody else is


---------12:40----------
a twitch streamer and they say yeah like


---------12:44----------
you know life is hard you're gonna be


---------12:46----------
like but you're blessed that's that's


---------12:48----------
not what you say to them you're like


---------12:50----------
yeah man like you deserve to be have a


---------12:52----------
rough life too like even if you're a


---------12:54----------
trick streamer like it's cool but it


---------12:55----------
comes with a lot of pressure but when


---------12:56----------
you think about yourself you're like oh


---------12:58----------
but I'm blessed it's almost like it's


---------13:00----------
like a party line that you have to say


---------13:01----------
to like not feel like an [ __ ]


---------13:03----------
basically it's like I feel because and I


---------13:07----------
feel like that has to something to do


---------13:08----------
with the culture sort of like of our of


---------13:11----------
our industry in general just culture in


---------13:13----------
general I think that people that and I


---------13:16----------
even feel guilty even talking about this


---------13:18----------
because like I feel like people are


---------13:19----------
gonna be reacting the same way but


---------13:21----------
celebrity types and I'm not a celebrity


---------13:23----------
but you know I get people with influence


---------13:26----------
and large audiences I feel like the


---------13:28----------
stigma is like oh you make a lot of


---------13:30----------
money you're fine like you're good let's


---------13:35----------
talk about that guilt what makes you


---------13:37----------
feel guilty like about like being


---------13:41----------
privileged yeah


---------13:44----------
um I don't know IIIi don't necessarily


---------13:48----------
feel guilty about like being privileged


---------13:50----------
person yeah I just feel like I can't


---------13:54----------
communicate my feelings without being


---------13:57----------
judged about them if that makes sense


---------13:59----------
that makes so like I feel like I have


---------14:01----------
tremendous privilege but I don't want


---------14:03----------
people to conflate is that the right


---------14:06----------
word dr k i'm using big words here


---------14:11----------
confession basically sir to conflate


---------14:14----------
what does conflate mean it means mix up


---------14:17----------
mix up okay good I'm happy I'm using


---------14:20----------
these words correctly I don't want


---------14:22----------
people to conflate me talking about my


---------14:24----------
emotions and feelings as me not being


---------14:27----------
appreciative of the privileged position


---------14:29----------
that I'm in and I feel like often if I


---------14:32----------
were to talk about some of the things


---------14:33----------
that I feel like my anxious thoughts or


---------14:35----------
feelings and it might not be rational I


---------14:38----------
feel like maybe people would be like wow


---------14:40----------
this guy's complaining when he drives a


---------14:42----------
Lambo and I don't drive a Lambo dr. K


---------14:44----------
that's just a meme but um like oh this


---------14:47----------
guy's got a this guy's got a great life


---------14:49----------
you know like why is he complaining


---------14:52----------
about anything at all you know so I try


---------14:54----------
to keep any complaining about anything


---------14:56----------
to a minimum base yeah so let me ask you


---------15:00----------
see what's happening to me but ya know


---------15:02----------
to to I just close twitch at a little


---------15:07----------
while ago cuz I can't I like reading it


---------15:09----------
actually I don't know why I just like


---------15:10----------
maybe I mean I like it too it's just it


---------15:12----------
maybe I'm like a masochist I really


---------15:16----------
reading sorry Chet Austin two thoughts


---------15:18----------
okay okay first is just think about you


---------15:24----------
know what it like you're saying like


---------15:27----------
there's a part of you that says and I'm


---------15:30----------
not saying this part is wrong I'm just


---------15:31----------
saying like let's look at it okay we


---------15:33----------
could talk about your anxiety at some


---------15:34----------
point if you want to yeah this is all


---------15:38----------
connected right it's okay I think so so


---------15:40----------
if you know there's a part of you that


---------15:44----------
basically says like you're not allowed


---------15:46----------
to complain right like you're and like


---------15:49----------
I've seen that before and bizarrely like


---------15:54----------
I'm not trying to draw a connection here


---------15:55----------
it's just it's just weird because like


---------15:57----------
really I hear this kind


---------15:58----------
dialogue in abusive relationships people


---------16:01----------
invalidate their own viewpoint and they


---------16:05----------
say I'm not allowed to suffer because


---------16:07----------
dot-dot-dot are you saying dr. K I'm in


---------16:10----------
an abusive relationship with my audience


---------16:12----------
there's conflation my friend you


---------16:15----------
understand no it's a reasonable


---------16:21----------
conclusion because I said that these


---------16:23----------
teeth I'm just saying like it's not


---------16:24----------
important out an observation I actually


---------16:26----------
don't know what it means


---------16:27----------
yeah but I mean like I see this sort of


---------16:31----------
idea that like oh I'm not allowed to


---------16:32----------
complain right and like it's fair in a


---------16:35----------
sense right that like you should be


---------16:38----------
grateful for your privilege and you


---------16:39----------
should be grateful that you have things


---------16:41----------
that other people don't have and I I do


---------16:45----------
believe that like I kind of agree with


---------16:46----------
this guy Gautam Buddha Buddha then you


---------16:50----------
know suffering is like a part of life


---------16:52----------
and that there's no human that is not


---------16:55----------
going to experience suffering or is


---------16:57----------
entitled to experience suffering do I


---------16:59----------
think that all people experience the


---------17:01----------
same amount of suffering no but I don't


---------17:03----------
think that like gatekeeping suffering is


---------17:05----------
like a way forward because that leads to


---------17:08----------
all this weird toxic [ __ ] like you know


---------17:10----------
one-upmanship and like invalidation of


---------17:12----------
other feelings and like you know just I


---------17:14----------
just don't think that that's all thing


---------17:16----------
the second thing is are you alright like


---------17:19----------
you can keep on asking me about like


---------17:20----------
using language properly or like are you


---------17:23----------
concerned about being perceived as like


---------17:25----------
not intelligent no I don't care it's


---------17:29----------
actually joking yeah sort of a meme or


---------17:31----------
joke okay okay I'm just I actually don't


---------17:33----------
really mind being like perceived as an


---------17:35----------
idiot okay okay I I think sometimes


---------17:38----------
maybe like it would get to me but I mean


---------17:41----------
oh like I don't really care too much


---------17:45----------
like it doesn't really bother me that


---------17:47----------
much okay about being like perceived as


---------17:49----------
it is an absolute [ __ ] because I think


---------17:51----------
generally twitchchat across the board


---------17:53----------
thinks we're all stupid like and it's


---------17:55----------
sort of like a fun loving way sure um


---------17:57----------
yeah I don't think I'm stupid I don't


---------18:00----------
have like a okay good like like a


---------18:02----------
complex where I feel like I'm stupid you


---------18:04----------
know can I ask you just one more


---------18:05----------
question about that go ahead yeah would


---------18:08----------
it be okay if you did have a cop


---------18:09----------
it's about feeling stupid yes I think


---------18:13----------
hold on wait let me think about that


---------18:15----------
question um yeah I suppose so I guess


---------18:20----------
what I don't know if they're it's sort


---------18:23----------
of like I guess that's the way you feel


---------18:24----------
right um but it's not like something


---------18:27----------
that I like maybe like there's isolated


---------18:30----------
moments like because I think we all have


---------18:31----------
these right we all have like these


---------18:33----------
moments where like is is broadcasters


---------18:36----------
like maybe we're being serious about


---------18:39----------
something and they'd we don't want to be


---------18:40----------
joking in that moment and then they then


---------18:42----------
maybe we take it more personally but it


---------18:44----------
to me it's not like I get off stream I'm


---------18:46----------
like oh god they think I'm so dumb I'm


---------18:48----------
not actually um you know I don't have


---------18:50----------
that problem it doesn't bother me at all


---------18:52----------
okay okay cool thanks for answering that


---------18:54----------
I appreciate it now I do have a problem


---------18:56----------
with with with the saying like a lot but


---------18:59----------
I'm dealing with it what do you mean by


---------19:01----------
that


---------19:05----------
yeah so let's talk about anxiety let's


---------19:08----------
talk about it so what it what do you


---------19:10----------
mean by anxiety um that's a good


---------19:14----------
question really making me think here


---------19:17----------
what do I mean by anxiety the way I


---------19:20----------
define anxiety is just sort of like the


---------19:23----------
the physiological response to events out


---------19:29----------
of my personal control so let's say I'm


---------19:33----------
going on an airplane


---------19:35----------
my mind will immediately go to the


---------19:38----------
worst-case scenario that could possibly


---------19:40----------
happen I get on the plane I'm in a


---------19:43----------
seconds to disaster movie next thing you


---------19:45----------
know we're going down it's over on a you


---------19:50----------
know because in the call and and and for


---------19:53----------
some reason my mind it's hard for me to


---------19:56----------
explain this but my mind will go to the


---------19:58----------
worst-case scenario of anything like


---------20:00----------
let's say I'm going I went on a trip I


---------20:01----------
went out of town like last week and I


---------20:05----------
drove I drove to this this town in in in


---------20:09----------
a different state and on that drive you


---------20:12----------
go through a mountain pass and through


---------20:13----------
that mountain pass you are that you are


---------20:16----------
going through periods of places where


---------20:18----------
you are going to like get there's like


---------20:24----------
oncoming traffic or whatever that you


---------20:26----------
could you could cross over the there's


---------20:29----------
no median you could cross over and


---------20:31----------
coming to a head-on collision and so


---------20:33----------
every time I Drive up there the thought


---------20:35----------
in my head is oh my gosh that could


---------20:38----------
happen to me I need to be so careful and


---------20:41----------
then I get anxious about it like oh my


---------20:42----------
gosh what what if I get in this head-on


---------20:44----------
collision like I'm gonna draw I'm gonna


---------20:46----------
move and so as I Drive up there I like


---------20:50----------
I'm like during this part of the drive


---------20:52----------
I'm like holding the wheel very tightly


---------20:55----------
hugging the right side just in case and


---------20:57----------
like especially when cars like come the


---------20:59----------
other way and like just making sure that


---------21:02----------
and part of that's being just safe is


---------21:04----------
the driver and be sort of wheelchair but


---------21:05----------
but part of that's like irrational like


---------21:08----------
of course yes that's a possibility to


---------21:10----------
happen but is that really rational and


---------21:13----------
and why would I get worked up about it I


---------21:14----------
have no idea in even no matter how often


---------21:17----------
I


---------21:20----------
go through this it just for some reason


---------21:25----------
and like try to justify it and know that


---------21:27----------
it's like crazy I still have these crazy


---------21:31----------
thoughts of the worst case scenario


---------21:33----------
worst possible thing that can happen so


---------21:38----------
so yeah thank you so much for sharing


---------21:41----------
that I think it's a beautiful picture of


---------21:44----------
anxiety can I collect my thoughts for a


---------21:47----------
second yes please go ahead


---------21:59----------
you


---------22:01----------
how old are you Austin 26


---------22:06----------
you


---------22:09----------
you


---------22:17----------
okay


---------22:19----------
gonna need another like maybe like a


---------22:21----------
minute I'm just coming up with a plan to


---------22:25----------
kind of think through and approach this


---------22:27----------
with you


---------22:37----------
you


---------22:43----------
okay how long have you been having these


---------22:47----------
thoughts


---------22:50----------
since I can remember


---------22:53----------
[Music]


---------22:54----------
since I was younger how young gosh it's


---------23:01----------
gotten worse with age I'd say okay


---------23:06----------
but I'd say like


---------23:11----------
probably I can't really remember to be


---------23:14----------
honest just very early I sort of had


---------23:16----------
like the inclination but it yeah okay so


---------23:22----------
do you remember what thinly like paint


---------23:23----------
us a picture of what used to worry about


---------23:25----------
like as a kid


---------23:33----------
is a kid


---------23:38----------
I would worry about they wouldn't be the


---------23:40----------
same so I mean sort of similar things


---------23:41----------
like for example you know around like


---------23:44----------
the the I don't know I'm just trying to


---------23:47----------
think of something random from my


---------23:49----------
childhood that I like what one time I if


---------23:51----------
it's a lot of this has to do with planes


---------23:53----------
which is ironic because I used to want


---------23:54----------
to be a commercial airline pilot and I


---------23:56----------
still have a passion for aviation but


---------23:59----------
this one time like I was like getting on


---------24:03----------
a plane and I had like a complete mental


---------24:05----------
like breakdown and like anxiety attack I


---------24:08----------
was with my mom we were on like a soccer


---------24:09----------
trip and I saw like a box board the


---------24:13----------
plane right just like unlike like a box


---------24:16----------
it was like all taped up and weird and


---------24:18----------
just stuff and immediately my mind went


---------24:21----------
too you know because this was like 2000s


---------24:23----------
you know and you know and I was like


---------24:25----------
immediately my mind went to oh [ __ ] like


---------24:29----------
we're gonna go like it's it's gonna like


---------24:31----------
this is it like that's that's a


---------24:32----------
suspicious package it's gonna it's gonna


---------24:35----------
you know something's gonna happen


---------24:36----------
that there's something in there that's


---------24:38----------
gonna take the plane down or something


---------24:39----------
and I like panicked and just like I


---------24:41----------
didn't want to board the plane at all of


---------24:43----------
course we ended up boarding and is fine


---------24:44----------
right but that was where my brain went


---------24:46----------
okay so there's something weird there so


---------24:49----------
like you said your brain is like it's a


---------24:51----------
suspicious package and the plane is


---------24:54----------
gonna go down yeah wondering that not


---------24:56----------
more like it's weird that's what's in


---------24:59----------
the package that's what I was thinking


---------25:02----------
it was probably the likely scenario is


---------25:04----------
in which it was it was just some package


---------25:07----------
filled with some stuff nano but but why


---------25:09----------
can't she use the word bomb I I don't


---------25:13----------
know that because I don't know is that


---------25:15----------
what she thought was in the package yeah


---------25:16----------
I thought it was some sort of explosive


---------25:18----------
yeah so it's just weird because like


---------25:20----------
even now as you tell the story like you


---------25:23----------
know I would imagine that if I had


---------25:25----------
anxiety mm-hmm and like because we all


---------25:28----------
know you're talking about a bomb yeah


---------25:30----------
but you're not using the word bomb it's


---------25:31----------
just strange


---------25:34----------
IIIi don't know


---------25:35----------
yeah yeah I I don't know exactly what to


---------25:39----------
make of that observation but like it's


---------25:40----------
almost


---------25:43----------
there's like a Voldemort aspect to it


---------25:45----------
where if you like you know speaking its


---------25:46----------
name is like somehow I don't know it


---------25:49----------
just feels weird like it feels like kind


---------25:51----------
of like avoidant to use the like you're


---------25:53----------
not trying to use the like you're trying


---------25:54----------
to say it without using the word bomb


---------25:56----------
which I don't know what the significance


---------25:57----------
of that is but it certainly seems to be


---------25:59----------
like a bear I mean yeah I don't know


---------26:06----------
maybe I don't know exactly why do you


---------26:08----------
see what I'm saying though yeah I get it


---------26:10----------
yeah so so I mean it's just like we


---------26:12----------
don't have to understand everything


---------26:13----------
let's just make observations then we'll


---------26:15----------
short out you know whether there's some


---------26:18----------
kind of like avoidance yeah or does it


---------26:20----------
make you feel silly to use that word


---------26:22----------
yeah well it sort of makes me feel silly


---------26:26----------
that I even thought that if that makes


---------26:28----------
sense yes it just silly that I even


---------26:30----------
thought that would be the case so you're


---------26:32----------
dodging yeah you're judging yourself for


---------26:35----------
your irrational words and so like maybe


---------26:38----------
speaking irrational words like makes


---------26:41----------
your thoughts sort of more real and like


---------26:43----------
the silliness increases right because it


---------26:47----------
is so silly because dr. K this was a


---------26:49----------
flight that if I can remember in


---------26:51----------
particular was like a 25-minute flight


---------26:54----------
like from it was like literally like a


---------26:57----------
flight it like rationally it doesn't


---------26:59----------
make sense you know it just first of all


---------27:01----------
it never made sense but like just the


---------27:03----------
idea that this random flight would be


---------27:05----------
the target of something like it just


---------27:06----------
doesn't there's no rationale period from


---------27:09----------
any in anything but like it was just so


---------27:11----------
stupid to even think of that in that


---------27:13----------
particular situation okay so you


---------27:15----------
sometimes I'm not so sure I agree with


---------27:18----------
that but we'll oh you don't think it's


---------27:20----------
rational we'll get there mate okay okay


---------27:24----------
so let me ask you this like so you


---------27:26----------
basically think about your it sounds


---------27:27----------
like your anxiety is mostly thinking


---------27:29----------
about catastrophic very low likelihood


---------27:33----------
scenarios actually right right which I


---------27:37----------
think yeah but I think I don't know does


---------27:40----------
everybody think like that or in in the


---------27:43----------
sense that like they think of the


---------27:44----------
worst-case scenario I think the thing


---------27:45----------
for me is I will obsess over it for sure


---------27:48----------
like I will obsess over to lose sleep


---------27:50----------
over it I won't eat you know I can't


---------27:52----------
sleep as soon it like for example when I


---------27:54----------
go on long flights


---------27:55----------
I won't I cannot


---------27:57----------
at all just because for the reason that


---------27:59----------
I'm afraid that if I go to sleep I'm


---------28:00----------
gonna wake up to everybody around me


---------28:02----------
screaming and if I let my personal guard


---------28:05----------
down it's just what might hate thought


---------28:07----------
my brain goes if I let my personal guard


---------28:09----------
down then something's gonna happen if I


---------28:11----------
relax something's gonna happen if I stop


---------28:14----------
I'm not oh no what happened when you did


---------28:17----------
let your personal guard down


---------28:21----------
nothing nothing when I relax nothing I


---------28:24----------
mean nothing's happened I don't think is


---------28:28----------
there anything and so now we got to be


---------28:30----------
careful because I suspect that so we're


---------28:33----------
running up against an enemy here which


---------28:35----------
is your judgment that's gonna make it


---------28:37----------
hard for you to speak right so has


---------28:41----------
something happened to you that feels


---------28:43----------
super irrational where you let your


---------28:46----------
guard down and something catastrophic


---------28:47----------
happen to you as a result


---------28:53----------
I can't think of like anything in


---------28:55----------
particular


---------28:56----------
okay where that was a case can you tell


---------29:00----------
me you'll go ahead sorry


---------29:02----------
go ahead no you go ahead go ahead can


---------29:03----------
you just tell me a little bit about your


---------29:05----------
upbringing yeah sure


---------29:07----------
what about it what do you want to know


---------29:08----------
just where did you grow up what was that


---------29:10----------
like um I grew up in I don't I don't


---------29:15----------
geographical stuff is like irrelevant


---------29:18----------
but on the west coast or dinner state of


---------29:19----------
Oregon I had a pretty good


---------29:24----------
I had a stable upbringing there was no


---------29:26----------
real issues can you tell me about your


---------29:29----------
parents


---------29:30----------
yeah married like they were I love my I


---------29:36----------
love my mom and dad they they've been


---------29:38----------
like you know extremely you know support


---------29:42----------
of me throughout and provided me with


---------29:44----------
the tools I feel like that have created


---------29:46----------
the person that I am today so and who's


---------29:49----------
the person that you are today


---------29:51----------
well I mean I feel like you know


---------29:54----------
obviously as anybody I've made mistakes


---------29:56----------
and done things but I feel like I feel


---------29:58----------
like I'm a good person you know I feel


---------30:00----------
like I try to do the right thing I feel


---------30:01----------
like I've made mistakes but you know I


---------30:03----------
feel like yeah I feel like that that's


---------30:06----------
who I am


---------30:07----------
are they proud of you Austin yeah yeah


---------30:10----------
they are they tell me that they are so


---------30:12----------
do you feel like they're proud of you I


---------30:14----------
know they are yeah I do


---------30:16----------
how does that feel it feels good it


---------30:19----------
feels really good it feels good to know


---------30:21----------
that you know and I have a hard time


---------30:24----------
sort of communicating that sort of thing


---------30:27----------
to them or you know I like about hard


---------30:30----------
time communicating emotions sometimes or


---------30:32----------
whatever but sure you know I am yeah


---------30:34----------
very sorry I'm getting yeah I get it


---------30:38----------
yeah anyway


---------30:40----------
what about telling for no no nothing


---------30:43----------
just getting sort of like crying I guess


---------30:46----------
I don't know what's wrong with that


---------30:48----------
nothing nothing I think I think we


---------30:51----------
should be do you feel like something is


---------30:53----------
wrong with it I think this is just like


---------30:56----------
this whole issue of like being judged


---------30:58----------
I guess it's we goes back to the root of


---------31:01----------
the conversation sure being judged so


---------31:04----------
this is like not okay you can't feel


---------31:06----------
this this is not what this is you know I


---------31:08----------
guess it goes back to that yeah it does


---------31:10----------
what does that feel like it doesn't feel


---------31:12----------
good cuz I want it I want to share


---------31:15----------
because I feel like there's people that


---------31:16----------
relate but I just feel like because of


---------31:19----------
who we like I like like the the the


---------31:22----------
influence that I have I sort of have to


---------31:24----------
put on a happy face and just you know


---------31:28----------
what I mean yeah so here's what I'm


---------31:32----------
hearing from you awesome you're not


---------31:33----------
allowed to


---------31:37----------
yeah it's not like I feel like I'm not a


---------31:41----------
like I feel like I'm not allowed to


---------31:43----------
express myself in this particular way


---------31:45----------
and again there I go my mind just went


---------31:49----------
to like a justification like to try to


---------31:52----------
clear up like my mind at that moment


---------31:54----------
when you said that my mind went to I


---------31:57----------
don't feel this way all the time and I


---------31:59----------
actually don't really feel like I'd even


---------32:00----------
need to talk about it


---------32:01----------
like it's just this is just like we're


---------32:02----------
talking about things that happen and


---------32:03----------
it's not even a big deal and I you know


---------32:05----------
that's where my mind went


---------32:06----------
yeah that's hurt what even in the


---------32:09----------
context of a place where we're talking


---------32:10----------
about this sort of thing yeah so it's


---------32:13----------
also weird because like you almost said


---------32:15----------
that you're not allowed to be happy I


---------32:17----------
mean sorry you're not allowed to because


---------32:19----------
we've been talking about you don't have


---------32:20----------
the right to be sad or suffer and yet


---------32:23----------
that part of you that self judgmental


---------32:26----------
and doesn't allow you to actually pops


---------32:30----------
up when you're expressing gratitude


---------32:32----------
appreciation and good feelings but you


---------32:35----------
still feel like you're not allowed to


---------32:36----------
like you see that's weird


---------32:37----------
even the rational justification for why


---------32:40----------
you're not allowed to feel props off


---------32:43----------
when it doesn't even apply which is like


---------32:46----------
are you not allowed to say that like you


---------32:49----------
say I'm privileged but what you just


---------32:52----------
showed us is your privilege in its


---------32:55----------
purest and you know highest form which


---------33:00----------
is that like I had a stable household


---------33:02----------
with parents who loved me and they're


---------33:04----------
proud of me


---------33:05----------
which is like something that not much of


---------33:07----------
our not many people in our audience have


---------33:09----------
yeah and yet you know you still feel


---------33:12----------
like like when you you can say the words


---------33:14----------
I'm privileged but you can't show it to


---------33:16----------
people right it's weird yeah I want to I


---------33:20----------
want to highlight something because I


---------33:21----------
don't know if this is the case it is


---------33:25----------
I was about my upbringing because


---------33:30----------
and I don't know if this is the root


---------33:32----------
cause of anything because I've done some


---------33:34----------
self-reflection like on things like that


---------33:36----------
to try to clear psychoanalyze myself you


---------33:39----------
know and think and I'm trying to like


---------33:42----------
wonder if growing up my mom is a


---------33:45----------
tremendous mother like she was


---------33:46----------
tremendous and and in you know was


---------33:50----------
awesome


---------33:51----------
throughout one thing she did do is she


---------33:55----------
scared the ever littie ever living [ __ ]


---------33:57----------
out of me about things drugs you know


---------34:03----------
going making sure that you're you know


---------34:06----------
you're not crossing the street and in a


---------34:08----------
certain place or like making sure you're


---------34:11----------
being safe about that where you know


---------34:13----------
very much stressing you know wear a


---------34:15----------
helmet and those are like common things


---------34:17----------
right but like almost to like a like


---------34:19----------
very much like if you don't you like


---------34:21----------
something negative will happen to you


---------34:23----------
sort of thing like like something


---------34:25----------
negative will happen and I don't know


---------34:26----------
what the association with is but I do do


---------34:30----------
like like for example I hope people are


---------34:32----------
gonna laugh but I I don't do drug I do I


---------34:35----------
smoke marijuana right but that's the


---------34:37----------
only that's the you know it's the only


---------34:39----------
thing that I do that's like a drug and


---------34:41----------
even that it took me till I was about


---------34:43----------
eight nineteen years old to even try


---------34:45----------
that because I was terrified of even


---------34:47----------
that but I don't drink and when I say


---------34:52----------
don't drink it's like I don't like I


---------34:55----------
have maybe a drink every once in a while


---------34:58----------
but it's very rare um I've been drunk


---------35:01----------
I've not like I have anything against


---------35:03----------
drinking but those are things that I


---------35:05----------
feel like I growing up I was told you


---------35:09----------
know basically not the drinking part as


---------35:10----------
much but more like the drugs part not to


---------35:12----------
do and so I'm absolutely terrified


---------35:14----------
that's probably a good thing but I don't


---------35:16----------
know


---------35:16----------
so Austin let me ask you something so


---------35:18----------
you offered this you said I


---------35:20----------
psychoanalyze myself my mom used to your


---------35:23----------
words were scare the other living [ __ ]


---------35:25----------
out of you yeah how do you think thats


---------35:28----------
related to your anxiety well I think


---------35:33----------
that like my mom would describe things


---------35:35----------
that the way that I think of it and it's


---------35:37----------
weird like when I'm conscious of this


---------35:38----------
but I still have this the reaction you


---------35:40----------
know but the way that my mom would


---------35:43----------
describe things like let's say that


---------35:46----------
there was a you know like let's say the


---------35:49----------
the helmet thing right


---------35:51----------
they I don't know she would go to


---------35:53----------
describe just like the traumatic brain


---------35:56----------
injury that I that could be sustained


---------35:58----------
off of that or the drug related thing


---------36:01----------
like you it just takes one time and


---------36:03----------
here's a situation where this person


---------36:04----------
died you know instantly and they were


---------36:06----------
just they were just like you and they


---------36:08----------
just died you know and I feel like all


---------36:10----------
these things as a mother I don't blame


---------36:12----------
her for telling me in these particular


---------36:13----------
situations because obviously it


---------36:15----------
prevented me from doing drugs for enemy


---------36:17----------
from wearing a helmet but like I wonder


---------36:19----------
if there is certain situations where it


---------36:22----------
was the the maybe it like sort of went


---------36:24----------
my mind sort of just goes to everything


---------36:26----------
that I do to the worst-case scenario and


---------36:28----------
I don't know if that's true or not I'm


---------36:29----------
just sort of wondering if that had


---------36:31----------
anything to do with it cuz I don't know


---------36:33----------
where this comes from and what do you


---------36:34----------
think I don't know I just lot summer had


---------36:38----------
come from I have no idea okay I don't


---------36:42----------
know where they come from


---------36:43----------
yes I'm not trying to blame her for see


---------36:45----------
there my mind went again I'm not trying


---------36:47----------
to blame her it's not her fault you know


---------36:49----------
that's I get try to so be careful would


---------36:51----------
you be okay blaming her if it was her


---------36:53----------
fault because I love my mom I don't


---------36:58----------
think that it would be her intention to


---------37:00----------
do something like that you know to like


---------37:01----------
cause me nice dogs used Boston blame has


---------37:14----------
such like a negative connotation it


---------37:16----------
doesn't like blame like she did


---------37:18----------
something horribly wrong like she's a


---------37:20----------
terrible person for that or something


---------37:22----------
like that but that to me that's not the


---------37:24----------
case like I don't want people to think


---------37:26----------
that if I say my mother it's my mother's


---------37:28----------
fault as for that there's conflation


---------37:30----------
right so so like like let me put it this


---------37:35----------
way so I'm with you that the word blame


---------37:36----------
carries a bad connotation is it possible


---------37:40----------
for her to be responsible without you


---------37:42----------
blaming her yeah I think so


---------37:46----------
up yeah certainly if we just talk about


---------37:48----------
it like straight up here if something


---------37:51----------
that she did I guess it could be


---------37:53----------
responsible whether what she did was


---------37:57----------
so yeah there I go again dr. K trying to


---------37:59----------
go for it say it say that what but like


---------38:02----------
if what she was doing was wrong was it


---------38:06----------
wrong or was it just how I became like


---------38:09----------
is is is doing those things or saying


---------38:11----------
those things is that inherently wrong or


---------38:14----------
is it just like something that just was


---------38:17----------
a sort of like an unfortunate that my


---------38:20----------
brain just happened to work this way and


---------38:21----------
maybe she was saying it to the wrong kid


---------38:24----------
basically you know so give me a second


---------38:30----------
and then I will have I believe I may


---------38:32----------
have answers for you okay okay sure and


---------38:36----------
that too could be a mistake because like


---------38:38----------
well let me say I have hypotheses yep


---------38:41----------
sure yep okay


---------38:50----------
oh wow


---------38:58----------
you


---------39:08----------
I mean so awesome let me ask you


---------39:10----------
something sure do you think that you're


---------39:12----------
anxious because your mom scared the ever


---------39:14----------
living [ __ ] out of you on a relatively


---------39:15----------
constant basis


---------39:24----------
you


---------39:26----------
my true answer is I don't know I don't


---------39:29----------
know if that was the case I've just I'd


---------39:32----------
sort of came across my mind I feel like


---------39:34----------
it's a possibility I feel like what what


---------39:37----------
does it feel what does it feel like the


---------39:38----------
answer is I'm not asking for the right


---------39:43----------
answer I'm asking for the visceral


---------39:45----------
answer and if the answer is I don't know


---------39:46----------
that's fine it were truly is doctor I


---------39:49----------
don't know that's what uh in my mind I


---------39:52----------
feel like it's a potential that


---------39:54----------
contributed but I don't believe that it


---------39:57----------
would be 100% okay the reason but maybe


---------40:00----------
it will kind of tendril i I think I I'm


---------40:04----------
with you a hundred percent and I would


---------40:06----------
agree with that 100% I don't think it's


---------40:07----------
everything I think it's a potential


---------40:10----------
contributor so let's just talk for a


---------40:12----------
second about where thoughts come from so


---------40:15----------
I know it's kind of like a basic


---------40:16----------
question but generally speaking thoughts


---------40:19----------
come from experiences right like I don't


---------40:21----------
start thinking about unicorns until like


---------40:24----------
I see unicorns like I don't start you


---------40:27----------
know you don't you can't fall in love


---------40:29----------
with a girl or guy that you've never


---------40:32----------
seen or met right like it's kind of


---------40:35----------
simple but like you know you can't want


---------40:37----------
to eat a hamburger until you like see it


---------40:39----------
or smell it or like see pictures of it


---------40:41----------
or see your friends eating it like the


---------40:44----------
thoughts in our mind are generated from


---------40:47----------
generally speaking our experiences the


---------40:51----------
other thing is like the things that our


---------40:53----------
mind learns how to do it learns from


---------40:56----------
like some pretty common sources and at


---------41:00----------
the top of the list or parents right so


---------41:03----------
like if I'm you know if I say please and


---------41:05----------
thank you then it's gonna be like


---------41:08----------
something that my mind automatically


---------41:10----------
generates based on the way that I was


---------41:13----------
raised if I'm a racist [ __ ] that also


---------41:18----------
is gonna probably be related to the way


---------41:21----------
that I was raised right like if you look


---------41:24----------
at like I grew up in East Texas where


---------41:25----------
you know there were a lot of racist


---------41:27----------
people and I was kind of racist - I'm


---------41:29----------
still sorta racist like it's so in in me


---------41:33----------
I can feel it I try to like but like I


---------41:36----------
was raised in a particular way you know


---------41:38----------
like think about


---------41:39----------
people in a particular way and oddly


---------41:41----------
enough like some of my racism is towards


---------41:43----------
like white people because I grew up with


---------41:45----------
people that I used to call rednecks


---------41:47----------
right and so I was like these guys are


---------41:50----------
on culture like that's actually still


---------41:51----------
racist you get that like you know I'm


---------41:55----------
judging the class of people based on the


---------41:57----------
color of their skin or where they come


---------41:59----------
from and I make assumptions about them


---------42:01----------
and and so the first thing to understand


---------42:04----------
is like in my experience anxiety comes


---------42:06----------
from two places so the first thing is


---------42:07----------
it's not irrational like we think it's


---------42:09----------
irrational because when we judge the


---------42:12----------
thought we're like that's not going to


---------42:14----------
happen but what is completely rational


---------42:16----------
is that our mind is going to generate


---------42:18----------
our mind doesn't generate irrational


---------42:21----------
thoughts it generates thoughts as best


---------42:23----------
as it knows how and even off in the


---------42:26----------
objective manner of truth those thoughts


---------42:29----------
are irrational like you can say that you


---------42:31----------
know like let's just talk about sexual


---------42:32----------
assault for a moment so like when


---------42:34----------
someone is sexually assaulted they feel


---------42:37----------
like a bad person and I'll give you just


---------42:40----------
a very visceral but like I think this is


---------42:43----------
the truest example this when a child is


---------42:45----------
sexually assaulted so back when kids are


---------42:48----------
growing up they don't have something


---------42:49----------
called theory of mind which means that


---------42:51----------
they don't understand that other human


---------42:53----------
beings exist literally their brain has


---------42:55----------
not developed the capacity to understand


---------42:58----------
that like other human beings exist


---------43:00----------
they're like they're super narcissistic


---------43:03----------
like a kid when it's hungry doesn't


---------43:05----------
understand that like a parent is busy or


---------43:08----------
like has a phone call they just know


---------43:09----------
that I'm hungry and like there's no food


---------43:10----------
and they get upset they're like the only


---------43:13----------
actor and then over time they developed


---------43:15----------
something called theory of mind and


---------43:16----------
their theory of mind gets like really


---------43:18----------
really good when they hit teenage years


---------43:19----------
and that's why people become so socially


---------43:22----------
anxious as teenaged because they're like


---------43:23----------
oh [ __ ]


---------43:24----------
other people exist and they have


---------43:26----------
opinions about me and what I do affects


---------43:28----------
the way that they think about me does


---------43:30----------
that make sense like like a 7 year old


---------43:32----------
just isn't really I'm concerned with


---------43:34----------
like what people think generally ok yeah


---------43:37----------
oh so so imagine if you're the only


---------43:40----------
person in the world and you get sexually


---------43:44----------
assaulted whose fault is it


---------43:48----------
if you're the only person in the world


---------43:49----------
and you get sexually assaulted by


---------43:51----------
yourself it's your fault


---------43:53----------
absolutely you're the only person in the


---------43:56----------
world yeah so like when you have a four


---------43:58----------
year old that gets sexually assaulted


---------44:00----------
they feel like it's their fault


---------44:02----------
they feel like they're bad people right


---------44:05----------
in it's bizarre because it's sort of


---------44:07----------
like when I'm learning and that's


---------44:08----------
evolutionary it's like when I'm learning


---------44:10----------
to walk and I fall down and I'm two


---------44:12----------
years old whose fault is it it that's so


---------44:16----------
interesting I've never even thought of


---------44:18----------
it that way ever


---------44:19----------
yeah it's shock in it because because a


---------44:21----------
lot of people don't understand I'm like


---------44:23----------
how could that be your fault sort of


---------44:26----------
yeah but that's what they say like if


---------44:27----------
you talk to them like everyone knows


---------44:29----------
that victims of sexual assault blame


---------44:31----------
themselves and what we all tell them is


---------44:34----------
it's not your fault but they feel like


---------44:36----------
it's their fault right so like where the


---------44:37----------
[ __ ] does that come from and then we say


---------44:39----------
like and then they feel even stupider


---------44:43----------
because there's a lot of people out


---------44:45----------
there telling them it's not your fault


---------44:48----------
but they're like but it feels like it's


---------44:50----------
my fault it's invalidating their


---------44:52----------
perspective and so it sort of it sort of


---------44:55----------
makes rational sense right that it's not


---------44:57----------
your fault that like you were assaulted


---------44:59----------
certainly if you're not for but at the


---------45:02----------
same time that's the way that they feel


---------45:04----------
and it like the the thoughts that are


---------45:07----------
generated by the mind may seem


---------45:10----------
objectively irrational but the mind has


---------45:13----------
a damn good reason for generating a


---------45:15----------
particular thought like if our thought


---------45:18----------
if our mind generated unuseful or


---------45:21----------
unadapted thoughts we wouldn't be alive


---------45:23----------
the first thing to understand is that


---------45:25----------
your mind adapts to circumstances like


---------45:27----------
if you stub your toe your brain is like


---------45:29----------
let's take care of that [ __ ] how can a


---------45:32----------
brain that can teach you how to walk


---------45:34----------
teach you how to talk teach you how to


---------45:36----------
like deal with animals deal with people


---------45:38----------
understand broad societal movements and


---------45:41----------
why you should change your name can


---------45:44----------
reflect on like what you've done in the


---------45:46----------
past this is the instrument that you're


---------45:48----------
dealing with and you're just saying like


---------45:49----------
in this one random corner of your mind


---------45:52----------
it's just broken like that's not how it


---------45:55----------
works


---------45:57----------
anxiety comes from somewhere and this is


---------46:01----------
the


---------46:01----------
and why people can't get over their


---------46:03----------
anxiety because you assume that there's


---------46:05----------
a part of your car that's busted when


---------46:07----------
actually it's working exactly I think


---------46:08----------
it's supposed to so any attempts to fix


---------46:11----------
it or not gonna work because you don't


---------46:12----------
understand actually what's going on so


---------46:16----------
okay and sorry if I go back to specific


---------46:20----------
examples go for I want to know as time


---------46:23----------
goes on I'll be like because it's kind


---------46:26----------
of like embarrassing some of this stuff


---------46:27----------
that I do to like try to fix which went


---------46:30----------
immediately when I feel anxious what I


---------46:32----------
want to do is try to get rid of those


---------46:34----------
feelings of anxiety you're doing what


---------46:36----------
I'm doing I'm fortunate enough where


---------46:38----------
again here I go but I'll just say I'll


---------46:40----------
just talk because I'm sure it's okay for


---------46:42----------
my anxiety doesn't normally stop me from


---------46:45----------
doing anything okay sort of makes the


---------46:48----------
experience very unpleasant like okay it


---------46:50----------
really wasn't so like for I'll go back


---------46:54----------
to the plane one because I think it's


---------46:55----------
like an easy example the point two


---------46:57----------
things that I do specifically so this is


---------46:58----------
my process before I go on a flight and


---------47:00----------
for the record I used to be a commercial


---------47:02----------
airline pilot which I'm sure a lot of


---------47:03----------
people are like really they don't


---------47:05----------
understand how you can have a fear of


---------47:06----------
flying whoops Wow


---------47:08----------
like yeah be a pilot sure maybe I don't


---------47:11----------
really know the answer to that but when


---------47:14----------
I go on a plane you know I'm scared of


---------47:16----------
all the things that I alluded to before


---------47:19----------
but so what I try to do in my head is to


---------47:21----------
work to try to make myself feel better


---------47:23----------
so what does that mean and so what I'll


---------47:25----------
do is I'll look up the flight I'll look


---------47:27----------
up the flight plan I'll look up the


---------47:29----------
weather forecast I'll monitor the


---------47:31----------
plane's altitude and airspeed while the


---------47:34----------
plane is flying like I'll sit there and


---------47:37----------
you know like on the airline's on the on


---------47:39----------
the screen you'll you'll see like


---------47:42----------
airspeed and and like altitude and


---------47:44----------
whatnot and because of my knowledge of


---------47:46----------
aviation I'll be like I'll feel better


---------47:49----------
watching the the the airspeed the


---------47:52----------
weather and everything just feeling to


---------47:55----------
make sure it's normal because when


---------47:56----------
you're sitting in a plane in the back of


---------47:57----------
it often you can't really tell what in


---------48:00----------
what isn't normal right so like you know


---------48:03----------
like when we're going in for when we're


---------48:05----------
taking off Oh monitor the airspeed when


---------48:07----------
we're taking off and I'll look at my


---------48:08----------
phone alright I look at my phone I'll


---------48:10----------
look at the airspeed I'm like well we're


---------48:11----------
in a 737-900 you know we need to be at


---------48:14----------
you know


---------48:15----------
at this time you know we need to be at


---------48:17----------
this particular speed or you know or or


---------48:21----------
like I'm expecting that we're gonna turn


---------48:23----------
this I'm gonna ask you a question does


---------48:25----------
that feel like you're feeding or


---------48:27----------
satisfying something it feels in the


---------48:30----------
moment it feels like I'm like okay


---------48:32----------
everything's actually going normal


---------48:34----------
because looking at like I said looking


---------48:35----------
out the window it's hard to really judge


---------48:37----------
it's satisfying right so your mind is


---------48:39----------
hungry for something yes and then you


---------48:42----------
provide it with something yeah and then


---------48:44----------
it's satisfied right so what happens to


---------48:47----------
something that is hungry and then you


---------48:51----------
give it food it's sad as it's full yep


---------48:55----------
and what happens to it over time you


---------48:59----------
need to eat again absolutely but but


---------49:05----------
I've never I've never thought of these


---------49:06----------
behaviors as being like exceptionally


---------49:08----------
like healthy like cuz cuz like for me I


---------49:11----------
feel like because they're going on my


---------49:13----------
yeah exactly like going on like my phone


---------49:16----------
and connect and buying Wi-Fi too so look


---------49:19----------
at all these things is just no reception


---------49:21----------
yeah so let's I don't want you okay so


---------49:24----------
we're gonna talk man there's so much


---------49:26----------
talk about this is fantastic man so I


---------49:27----------
think I really want to explain a lot of


---------49:29----------
stuff to you and I hope that your


---------49:31----------
anxiety can get better


---------49:32----------
also you should talk a little bit about


---------49:34----------
you know whether you should actually get


---------49:35----------
into treatment because it sounds like


---------49:37----------
you may have an anxiety disorder yeah


---------49:39----------
so I would recommend that you actually


---------49:41----------
get evaluated by a real psychiatrist for


---------49:43----------
that yeah absolutely but let's just talk


---------49:46----------
about the nature of mind for a second


---------49:48----------
and talk about anxiety in general okay


---------49:49----------
so the first thing is that like I want


---------49:52----------
you to just think about a scenario so


---------49:54----------
let's say I have low self-confidence


---------49:55----------
and then like I'm feeling bad about


---------49:58----------
myself so what I do is I like ID I'm a


---------50:00----------
friend of mine and I'm like hey like do


---------50:01----------
you think I'm a piece of [ __ ] and then


---------50:04----------
they say no man you're awesome and then


---------50:06----------
like what happens to my feeling of low


---------50:08----------
self confidence I'm hoping that it would


---------50:13----------
go up at that point but then but then


---------50:16----------
you would probably I kind of maybe


---------50:19----------
forgive me if I'm going ahead of you but


---------50:21----------
are you instantly like later


---------50:23----------
the self-confident would that hit that


---------50:25----------
was him eating yep right and filling him


---------50:28----------
up but and then afterwards he has to eat


---------50:30----------
again absolutely right so like like but


---------50:32----------
is that your observation in the world


---------50:35----------
that reassurance to people who lack


---------50:38----------
confidence doesn't really fix the


---------50:41----------
problem


---------50:42----------
it just is sort of like a band-aid


---------50:43----------
that's the hypothesis do you agree with


---------50:46----------
that uh now the way you described it yes


---------50:50----------
but I think that a lot of people would


---------50:51----------
think that like constant support in that


---------50:53----------
radicular situation would get them to be


---------50:57----------
more confident yeah but that's actually


---------50:59----------
not what happens yeah okay


---------51:01----------
right cuz like you guys y'all will know


---------51:04----------
this if you have either been this person


---------51:06----------
or you have had a friend who's like this


---------51:09----------
that no matter how many times you tell


---------51:12----------
them that they are awesome people they


---------51:15----------
need to hear it again


---------51:17----------
that's so god I never you're blowing my


---------51:20----------
mind because I've never thought of it


---------51:22----------
that way


---------51:23----------
cuz I've been on the opposite end of


---------51:25----------
people that feel that way and me telling


---------51:27----------
them I'm like I feel like this is like


---------51:30----------
helping them like they're gonna feel


---------51:31----------
better and they may feel better than


---------51:32----------
they do feel better in the moment and


---------51:35----------
then after that just feeding the beast


---------51:37----------
exactly I didn't even I did I never


---------51:40----------
thought about it that way I always


---------51:42----------
thought it is like the solution was to


---------51:44----------
make continue to make them feel


---------51:46----------
absolutely and like let's just think


---------51:47----------
about that scientifically if that was


---------51:50----------
the solution if you did it for a couple


---------51:52----------
months they should be better then like


---------51:55----------
people wouldn't have if we look at it


---------51:57----------
systemic Lee as a society people have


---------52:00----------
confidence problems all the time


---------52:01----------
everyone's [ __ ] reassuring each other


---------52:03----------
if that was this good solution no one


---------52:06----------
would have conference problems the


---------52:08----------
solution so so what I really want to


---------52:11----------
encourage you to do Austin and we're


---------52:14----------
gonna talk about this in a second with


---------52:15----------
commercial pilot and fear of flying is


---------52:18----------
instead of taking something that doesn't


---------52:20----------
make sense and adjusting the data we


---------52:24----------
need to adjust the way that we look at


---------52:26----------
the data for the data to make sense the


---------52:28----------
data is the data just because it's


---------52:31----------
irrational for you to want to be a


---------52:33----------
commercial airline pilot and have a fear


---------52:35----------
of flying doesn't mean it's irrational


---------52:37----------
both both of those things exist in your


---------52:39----------
mind that doesn't mean it's a rational


---------52:40----------
we need to take a step back and assume


---------52:42----------
for a moment that's perfectly rational


---------52:43----------
perfectly rational and then we need to


---------52:46----------
understand understanding of the mind


---------52:48----------
that makes those two thoughts coexist


---------52:51----------
because that's actually what's happening


---------52:53----------
in your mind does that make sense


---------52:55----------
yeah it makes sense and it's it's weird


---------53:01----------
dr. K cuz I in the moment like I talked


---------53:05----------
about all the things that I do in the


---------53:07----------
fear and whatnot but it never would stop


---------53:09----------
me from wanting to go on an airplane


---------53:10----------
does that make sense it never wants to


---------53:13----------
cuz I like love the idea of flight and


---------53:15----------
like like flying flight simulator like I


---------53:18----------
love that I love everything that goes


---------53:19----------
into it I watch plane videos like it's


---------53:22----------
something that I like yeah I'm so we're


---------53:24----------
gonna be a course airline pilot yeah so


---------53:26----------
nice to really enjoy it sorry go ahead


---------53:27----------
so here we go okay so like here's the


---------53:29----------
thing you get on the flight and Austin


---------53:31----------
loves flying


---------53:34----------
and Austin's mom whose voice he's


---------53:37----------
internalized because that's what we do


---------53:40----------
Austin's mom's voice pops into your head


---------53:42----------
and it's like you're gonna die


---------53:46----------
and then there's like a conflict between


---------53:48----------
these two things because your mom taught


---------53:50----------
me right like they teach us things yeah


---------53:53----------
like I try to teach my kids to like


---------53:56----------
flush the toilet yeah and so like what's


---------53:59----------
happening in their tiny little mind and


---------54:01----------
like even even my so my youngest


---------54:03----------
daughter does this thing where she likes


---------54:05----------
to get off of the potty and then wipe


---------54:07----------
herself and then like that makes wiping


---------54:10----------
way harder right like wiping is easier


---------54:12----------
when you're on the potty


---------54:13----------
so I like try to teach her like we wipe


---------54:15----------
on the potty I wipe off the potty dr.


---------54:19----------
kay but I mean well actually I used to


---------54:20----------
know yeah I use a bidet now but okay


---------54:23----------
before you have to stand up I mean this


---------54:24----------
is a whole nother that debate okay


---------54:26----------
anyway it's not judging days be great if


---------54:36----------
you want me to judge you for being a


---------54:37----------
stick master we have to talk about so


---------54:43----------
now what she does is like when she's on


---------54:45----------
the potty she literally says the words


---------54:46----------
we wipe on the potty and I'm like yes we


---------54:48----------
wipe on the potty she has internalized


---------54:50----------
my voice because internalizing the voice


---------54:52----------
of our parents is what we call any idea


---------54:55----------
oh good


---------54:58----------
is this a quiz yes I'm putting you on


---------55:01----------
the spot internalizing dr. kay show more


---------55:04----------
parents voice is something that we call


---------55:07----------
its a read my mind question oh I learn


---------55:12----------
okay learning is its yeah it's the


---------55:17----------
hardest questions are the simplest ones


---------55:19----------
right I got it got it makes sense so


---------55:21----------
like that it's literally what learning


---------55:23----------
is like we don't even think about what


---------55:25----------
learning is like we just like to use the


---------55:27----------
word but like literally learning is like


---------55:29----------
the process of internalizing things


---------55:31----------
around us and like making it a part of


---------55:33----------
our thought process so like racism is


---------55:35----------
learned right like like it becomes


---------55:38----------
internal and then once we learn


---------55:39----------
something it's sort of like pops up it


---------55:42----------
starts generating certain thoughts


---------55:44----------
because like we understand it now and


---------55:47----------
so what I think happened in your case is


---------55:49----------
and this is just a preliminary thought


---------55:51----------
right is that like your mom taught you


---------55:53----------
and I that's that's the way I want you


---------55:55----------
to think about your anxiety it's not


---------55:56----------
that it's irrational it's that it's talk


---------55:58----------
she like literally taught you that like


---------56:00----------
if you put on a bike helmet if you don't


---------56:04----------
put on a bike helmet you're gonna get a


---------56:05----------
TBI and you're gonna die if you ever


---------56:07----------
drink alcohol you're gonna die if you


---------56:10----------
ever do this you're gonna die and then


---------56:13----------
we see that in your mind there's like


---------56:15----------
Austin who loves planes and then there's


---------56:19----------
your mom's voice who's ya gonna die and


---------56:24----------
anything happens is you're like that


---------56:26----------
doesn't make sense because Austin is


---------56:28----------
like no I'm not gonna die and then like


---------56:31----------
they have a little war in your head and


---------56:32----------
then you pull out your phone and then


---------56:34----------
you start to pull out all your things


---------56:35----------
then what you do is you kind of calm


---------56:36----------
down the anxiety but actually what


---------56:39----------
you're doing is feeding it because


---------56:40----------
you're not getting to the root of where


---------56:42----------
it comes from


---------56:43----------
you're like alleviating it from the top


---------56:45----------
it's like the root is that is not


---------56:47----------
reassurance you need to challenge the


---------56:49----------
very idea that you're gonna die that's


---------56:52----------
and that's in that for me that's a


---------56:54----------
challenge because if I don't know how to


---------56:57----------
explain this but it's this feeling of if


---------56:59----------
I let my guard down I'm gonna die yeah


---------57:03----------
if I like if I'm letting it it doesn't


---------57:04----------
make sense because let's face it dr. K


---------57:07----------
if I'm flying at 35,000 feet and I'm


---------57:10----------
gonna die


---------57:10----------
I can't me thinking me they like nah it


---------57:14----------
doesn't matter I'm gonna die right


---------57:16----------
that's just what's gonna happen if your


---------57:18----------
planes going down me in the back I'm


---------57:20----------
with my iphone looking up the flight in


---------57:23----------
the airspeed is it gonna change my you


---------57:25----------
know yeah so so this is where we learn


---------57:27----------
how to do things like sit with it okay


---------57:29----------
so now like I'm gonna give you an


---------57:31----------
alternate scenario I think if you want


---------57:32----------
your anxiety to improve over time mm-hmm


---------57:35----------
first thing that you've got to do is


---------57:36----------
like let yourself die bro like when


---------57:40----------
you're sitting there there's like


---------57:41----------
recognize first of all that like Austin


---------57:43----------
loves flying like Eli Gus is like I live


---------57:45----------
in stuff and then there's this other


---------57:47----------
part of you so we could call it the


---------57:48----------
voice of your mom but maybe it's maybe


---------57:50----------
she's just a contributor so the other so


---------57:52----------
yeah I'll talk about that in a second


---------57:55----------
because it may not be the voice of your


---------57:56----------
mom right the second there's just your


---------57:58----------
anxiety so your anxiety like I want you


---------57:59----------
to think about it like


---------58:01----------
Austin it's not a single-player game


---------58:02----------
it's like a party RPG and you've got a


---------58:06----------
bunch of characters in there and you've


---------58:08----------
got Austin right who's like your


---------58:10----------
protagonist and then you have your


---------58:12----------
anxiety which is actually a really


---------58:14----------
important member of your party it's not


---------58:16----------
actually irrational and bad it's not an


---------58:18----------
enemy this is what people think like


---------58:19----------
when we start calling it mental illness


---------58:21----------
which you know could be apply but we


---------58:24----------
think about it as an enemy but you gotta


---------58:26----------
understand your anxiety is helping you


---------58:27----------
out bro your anxiety is the part of your


---------58:30----------
mind which looks into the future


---------58:32----------
predicts danger and make sure you don't


---------58:35----------
screw up it's the same part of your mind


---------58:38----------
that is telling you hey it's time to


---------58:39----------
start calling myself Raj Patel or Austin


---------58:43----------
yeah right like it's it's saying like


---------58:46----------
hey like if I continue doing this bad


---------58:49----------
things could happen and like how is that


---------58:52----------
not a good part of your party right you


---------58:56----------
know like anxieties protect protective


---------58:59----------
that's why we have it like human beings


---------59:02----------
like why does the human brain think


---------59:04----------
about terrible things happening to us


---------59:06----------
because back when we were like monkeys


---------59:08----------
in the jungle we were walking around and


---------59:11----------
we would see a tiger footprint and there


---------59:12----------
were two kinds of monkeys one monkey was


---------59:14----------
like oh [ __ ] there's probably a tiger


---------59:17----------
behind that bush even though the


---------59:19----------
likelihood that the tiger behind the


---------59:21----------
bush was low you just need a little bit


---------59:23----------
of information and then you project


---------59:25----------
danger and then there was the monkey


---------59:28----------
that was like ah NBD and one of them got


---------59:31----------
eaten and one of them did yeah and so


---------59:35----------
anxiety is adapted it's a war asleep


---------59:38----------
yeah why do we still have those types of


---------59:41----------
people then like why do we like we still


---------59:43----------
have those people's that like like my


---------59:45----------
friends that I like fly with they get on


---------59:47----------
the plane and you know they order a


---------59:49----------
drink and they're just you know they


---------59:51----------
don't care and they just sit her and no


---------59:53----------
matter what happens what movement


---------59:55----------
they're just


---------59:56----------
yeah so great question so now we get to


---------59:59----------
like okay where does your anxiety come


---------60:00----------
from so here are the two hypotheses one


---------60:03----------
is they didn't have your mom mm-hmm


---------60:05----------
right so like when I had you when I went


---------60:10----------
on a flight my dad did the opposite I


---------60:13----------
would be anxious and he would be like


---------60:16----------
it's gonna be okay and he's like you


---------60:19----------
know it's gonna Rumble for a while and


---------60:21----------
then also I had like particular


---------60:23----------
experiences that I remember like


---------60:25----------
cognitively like I remember I used to be


---------60:28----------
scared of flights and then I would start


---------60:30----------
playing the Super Mario music in my head


---------60:32----------
because sometimes in Super Mario like


---------60:35----------
you'd get launched somewhere and it


---------60:37----------
would be like you know and so like I


---------60:39----------
started playing like literally in my


---------60:41----------
mind I started playing the Super Mario


---------60:43----------
music in my head and I'd pretend that I


---------60:45----------
was like Mario flying through space and


---------60:48----------
like that seemed to help I tried


---------60:51----------
something like that I would turn on you


---------60:54----------
I would try to turn on like happy like


---------60:56----------
music that like would sort of bring me


---------60:58----------
to like a normal place so I actually


---------61:00----------
like started playing and I only did this


---------61:03----------
for a brief period of time and then it's


---------61:05----------
frustrating because so I know I'm trying


---------61:08----------
to distract myself this is the


---------61:11----------
difference I wasn't trying to distract


---------61:12----------
myself I was trying to change I was


---------61:15----------
sitting with the feeling of flying and


---------61:17----------
changing the framework around it I


---------61:19----------
wasn't trying to distract myself at all


---------61:21----------
okay does that make sense yeah okay yeah


---------61:24----------
cuz when I when I think because I tried


---------61:25----------
playing the song I tried playing the


---------61:27----------
song big ol jet airliner by Steve Miller


---------61:30----------
you know daran daran big ol jet line and


---------61:33----------
it was like a happy like yeah you know


---------61:36----------
going on the road and doing like fun


---------61:38----------
stuff but and like I would listen to


---------61:39----------
that on takeoff which is like the part


---------61:41----------
of the flight where I'm like most


---------61:42----------
anxious and in my head like it kind of


---------61:47----------
helped a little bit but I just stopped


---------61:48----------
doing it because again I feel like if


---------61:50----------
I'm actively trying to and again I


---------61:53----------
understand what you said by the way


---------61:55----------
about what your how you were doing but


---------61:56----------
in my head I was like I know I know


---------61:58----------
intuitively what I'm doing is trying to


---------62:01----------
take my mind off of the


---------62:03----------
the anxiety around flight and in that in


---------62:05----------
my head that's letting my guard down and


---------62:07----------
I must be ready to look at everything


---------62:10----------
and know what's happening all the time


---------62:11----------
yeah so so let's just clarify for a


---------62:14----------
second I get that you understood what I


---------62:15----------
said so I'm gonna explain it just as


---------62:18----------
clearly as I can so when you face


---------62:21----------
anxiety you've got a couple of options


---------62:22----------
one is to distract yourself one is to


---------62:26----------
feed it or reassure yourself by giving


---------62:29----------
in to it okay the third option is to be


---------62:33----------
with it but like not do anything and and


---------62:37----------
somehow I was lucky enough to stumble on


---------62:39----------
I think it's just random chance it's not


---------62:41----------
like I was smart or anything it was just


---------62:42----------
like I just stumbled on like this this


---------62:45----------
way of sitting fully with my feelings I


---------62:47----------
wasn't trying to move away from them I


---------62:49----------
just sort of pretended it was like in a


---------62:51----------
different context and even now I find


---------62:54----------
myself doing that on flights for a few


---------62:56----------
seconds and I still feel uncomfortable


---------62:57----------
and like I sit with the feeling kind of


---------63:00----------
fully and so you can kind of sit with it


---------63:04----------
which is what I think you need to learn


---------63:06----------
how to do but that's challenging because


---------63:08----------
it's sort of like sitting with like a


---------63:10----------
hungry stomach right so like it's gonna


---------63:13----------
want things and it's gonna like grab at


---------63:15----------
you Austin it's gonna be like I need


---------63:17----------
this I give this to me give this to me


---------63:20----------
give this to me I have a question when


---------63:23----------
you're ya know kuffar why do I feel cuz


---------63:27----------
I'm not like completely I don't want you


---------63:32----------
know don't I'm not anxious throughout


---------63:33----------
the entire like there are there are


---------63:36----------
moments of flight where I feel clunk


---------63:37----------
calm but not consistently like it just


---------63:40----------
depends right it varies by flight right


---------63:42----------
there are moments during the flight


---------63:44----------
where I am calm but then but that's when


---------63:48----------
you know we're flying smoothly we're at


---------63:50----------
cruise altitude everything's smooth as


---------63:52----------
soon as we hit a bump my heart starts


---------63:56----------
racing the phones out again looking you


---------63:59----------
know it the weather like what's gonna


---------64:01----------
happen how long are we gonna be flying


---------64:03----------
through this you know I do things like I


---------64:05----------
go like you know I'm taking you through


---------64:07----------
exactly like if you're watching me on a


---------64:08----------
plane I go like this I like I grab on to


---------64:13----------
myself like I claw unto myself when I


---------64:15----------
grab on


---------64:17----------
on to things like I I put my hands in my


---------64:20----------
face I start to like panic during during


---------64:22----------
turbulence and thing in the crazy thing


---------64:25----------
about this dr. K is I understand


---------64:27----------
logically


---------64:28----------
that turbulence in the forces on earth


---------64:30----------
have literally never taken down a


---------64:32----------
commercial aircraft there was one


---------64:34----------
incident of it and it was like in the


---------64:35----------
60s back when claims were made out of


---------64:37----------
cardboard you know or whatnot but it's


---------64:40----------
just not rational in the modern world


---------64:42----------
for turbulence to impact the aircraft


---------64:44----------
but for me the the the thought in my


---------64:48----------
head at that moment is when I feel the


---------64:51----------
turbulence I know turbulence isn't crazy


---------64:53----------
but but like I can't a suit like what if


---------64:57----------
it wasn't turbulence what if it was what


---------64:59----------
if something else is going wrong what if


---------65:01----------
what if we are in that crazy type of


---------65:03----------
turbulence it could impact the aircraft


---------65:05----------
you know sure yes oh that's so we're


---------65:08----------
gonna talk about some scars and kind of


---------65:10----------
getting I have had some traumatic


---------65:12----------
experience flying and I could I don't


---------65:14----------
know if that helps that certainly hurts


---------65:16----------
uh yeah and I'll tell you my anxiety


---------65:20----------
around flying has gotten worse since


---------65:21----------
this one particular experience yeah so I


---------65:24----------
describe it to you if you were hurt go


---------65:25----------
for it um I went on a flight from and


---------65:29----------
this might not have even been bad


---------65:30----------
because it just felt bad right I went on


---------65:33----------
a flight from Los Angeles to Nashville


---------65:36----------
and on Southwest Airlines and I would we


---------65:42----------
were in there and the pilot came over


---------65:44----------
and he said hey were experiencing some


---------65:47----------
you know we're about to experience some


---------65:49----------
severe turbulence and the flight


---------65:52----------
attendants are gonna be seated


---------65:53----------
you know nothing normal or abnormal I


---------65:55----------
don't know if he used the word severe I


---------65:56----------
can't recall exactly but he said you


---------65:58----------
know some significant turbulence and we


---------66:02----------
told that told him to seat the flight


---------66:04----------
attendants the flight since receded and


---------66:05----------
then the flight attendants came over to


---------66:06----------
reiterate how like critical it was that


---------66:09----------
you were in your seat because you know


---------66:09----------
some people don't usually take it


---------66:11----------
seriously and I and they mentioned that


---------66:16----------
it was a thunderstorm and this I was


---------66:18----------
still a augment admittedly I was looking


---------66:21----------
at my phone at this time like checking


---------66:22----------
whether and still doing those sorts of


---------66:23----------
things and so I look and there was a


---------66:26----------
thunderstorm that extended the entire


---------66:29----------
central United States and it


---------66:31----------
almost impossible to fly around and


---------66:33----------
being being somebody that knows aviation


---------66:35----------
one of the more dangerous things to


---------66:37----------
aircraft is severe thunderstorms because


---------66:40----------
that's like something that can actually


---------66:41----------
impact air speed and when you impact air


---------66:43----------
speed there's a you know the it's just


---------66:45----------
all sorts of like things that that go


---------66:48----------
through my head so I'm a little scared


---------66:51----------
right I'm a little scared and but not


---------66:54----------
like crazy scared cuz you know again


---------66:56----------
this is this is you know I've been


---------66:58----------
through stuff you know this this didn't


---------67:00----------
seem bad but immediately we start going


---------67:03----------
through and let me tell you the plane


---------67:04----------
was thrashing people were screaming


---------67:07----------
people I look up the aisle people are


---------67:09----------
holding hands I was holding hands with a


---------67:11----------
woman next to me I was like oh my god I


---------67:13----------
was I was like on the verge of tears


---------67:15----------
there was a guy next to me rubbing my


---------67:17----------
shoulder and other people were freaking


---------67:19----------
out and in that experience I can hear


---------67:21----------
the engines going


---------67:25----------
because when you're in turbulence and


---------67:28----------
the and the plane is like going through


---------67:32----------
this like pilots often step climb and go


---------67:35----------
up and down out the treats to try to


---------67:36----------
find smooth air but in my head in that


---------67:38----------
moment I'm not sure what what's going on


---------67:40----------
because I can't see anything so and


---------67:42----------
we're in a black cloud you look outside


---------67:44----------
the window it's black out there and you


---------67:45----------
can't see anything so there's no frame


---------67:47----------
of reference you feel the plane going up


---------67:49----------
and down you hear the engines and it was


---------67:52----------
just very very like scary it very


---------67:55----------
traumatizing to me I was shaking I


---------67:57----------
remember I was so like happy that like


---------67:59----------
it was over with that I bought like the


---------68:02----------
entire people around me drinks I said


---------68:04----------
drinks on me I'm so happy to be alive


---------68:06----------
who wants to drink I don't even drink


---------68:09----------
dr. K as I said like I don't I got a


---------68:11----------
drink cuz I was like let's celebrate and


---------68:13----------
so I bought drinks as it drinks on


---------68:15----------
everybody and I bought everybody like I


---------68:17----------
don't know remember what it was but


---------68:18----------
everybody get drinks and thank God the


---------68:22----------
whole plane didn't go get want drinks


---------68:24----------
cuz then I would have had serious bill


---------68:26----------
but but that was an experience that I


---------68:28----------
had that was very traumatizing and I had


---------68:31----------
a similar experience not as bad but


---------68:34----------
going into Las Vegas you know how Las


---------68:36----------
Vegas is from LA to Las Vegas is


---------68:39----------
notoriously bad for like turbulence and


---------68:42----------
stuff I went into Las Vegas crazy


---------68:45----------
updrafts and I remember sitting I was


---------68:47----------
sitting next to this girl at this


---------68:49----------
Australian girl and she and I was like


---------68:50----------
going through my panicky thing and she


---------68:53----------
looks at me she says you're not gonna


---------68:54----------
die and like you know like like I was


---------68:57----------
being so rational and you know anyway


---------69:00----------
sort of I was just exported like the the


---------69:04----------
experience that I had after the fact but


---------69:08----------
still but yeah that's not it's not


---------69:11----------
nothing happened but still but let's


---------69:12----------
start with this how does that how does


---------69:14----------
it feel that I mean I've shared it


---------69:17----------
before I might have even shared it on


---------69:19----------
streem but it feels like I feel happy to


---------69:22----------
be that I survived that you know even


---------69:25----------
though you know I know that we probably


---------69:28----------
were never in danger ever you know but


---------69:30----------
still I felt like I was and I feel like


---------69:32----------
I we I survived it I feel good about


---------69:35----------
that so let's think about this on the


---------69:37----------
ground so what does that do


---------69:39----------
to your anxiety does it increase it or


---------69:41----------
decrease it like when I talk about it


---------69:48----------
let's start with the experiences the


---------69:51----------
experience like I talked about it and I


---------69:55----------
laugh about it right now


---------69:56----------
because I'm on the ground and I'm not


---------69:59----------
Europe I'm not going on a plane but when


---------70:02----------
I get on the plane and I'm not


---------70:05----------
necessarily saying I consciously think


---------70:06----------
about that one particular experience but


---------70:08----------
when I get on a plane I start to fear


---------70:10----------
that I'm going to go through that again


---------70:11----------
absolutely it starts to jump or anything


---------70:15----------
so I get where's the thing Austin you've


---------70:17----------
just fed your anxiety so much not


---------70:19----------
default right but like because the thing


---------70:21----------
is like the voice let's just assume for


---------70:23----------
a second it's the voice of your mom and


---------70:24----------
we got to go back and and kind of talk


---------70:25----------
about how it couldn't may not be but I'm


---------70:28----------
just gonna call it that so the voice of


---------70:29----------
your mom is like just think about all


---------70:32----------
the times that she told me to do


---------70:34----------
something and then you sort of deviated


---------70:35----------
off course and how much she liked even


---------70:37----------
more flipped her [ __ ] looks like she's


---------70:40----------
like you gotta wear her helmet otherwise


---------70:41----------
you're gonna die and then you wear your


---------70:43----------
helmet I have an interesting thing about


---------70:45----------
the helmet thing it happened later in


---------70:46----------
life though and I don't know if it


---------70:48----------
really let's steer clear stories for a


---------70:50----------
second sure but her you know it sounds


---------70:52----------
to me like you should definitely find


---------70:54----------
someone to talk to because it sounds


---------70:55----------
like you yes Yeah right so like this is


---------70:59----------
this is how no no don't apologize it's


---------71:01----------
just like this is how emotional


---------71:02----------
processing works like the stuff has to


---------71:04----------
come out mm-hmm right it's not like


---------71:07----------
reassurance it's like you just gotta


---------71:09----------
like go back to those feelings and


---------71:11----------
actually what you need to do is like sit


---------71:14----------
with those feelings and not and kind of


---------71:17----------
like decompress them so it's almost sort


---------71:19----------
of like exposure therapy where you know


---------71:22----------
what you do is like if you're afraid of


---------71:24----------
dogs like you just go and you like look


---------71:25----------
at a dog and then you let those feelings


---------71:27----------
arise and then you don't go anywhere


---------71:30----------
with them you don't run away from the


---------71:32----------
dog and then you don't like force


---------71:33----------
yourself to pet the dog because that's


---------71:35----------
irrational and so you got to force


---------71:37----------
yourself to no you just like sit with it


---------71:39----------
and you let the like you let the


---------71:41----------
feelings come up you let them just hang


---------71:42----------
out for a while and you do nothing and


---------71:45----------
so sometimes in therapy like that's


---------71:48----------
something that people do there's like a


---------71:49----------
technique called the EMDR that oh that


---------71:52----------
has


---------71:53----------
you know mix evidence behind it but some


---------71:55----------
people find it very useful what do you


---------71:57----------
like recall a traumatic experience but


---------71:59----------
you're basically doing sort of like a


---------72:00----------
meditation kind of thing while you're


---------72:02----------
recalling the experience so your mind


---------72:04----------
can't fully go back into that space it's


---------72:07----------
sort of like half here and half there


---------72:08----------
which allows you to sort of like swim in


---------72:11----------
that water which without getting


---------72:12----------
something you know going under anyway in


---------72:16----------
your case I think what's happening is


---------72:19----------
like those kinds of things are feeding


---------72:21----------
your anxiety because remember before


---------72:23----------
that happened everything was irrational


---------72:26----------
but now your anxiety is like but that


---------72:30----------
almost happened right it's like this is


---------72:34----------
everything we were afraid of and like


---------72:36----------
sure we made it this time like before


---------72:38----------
that it like you had a one in a hundred


---------72:40----------
chance of going down in a thunderstorm


---------72:42----------
before the thunderstorm it was like one


---------72:45----------
in a million and now your anxiety is


---------72:47----------
like if that happens 99 more times we're


---------72:50----------
[ __ ] right the Las Vegas is like 1 in


---------72:53----------
2,000 but like the thing is it's like


---------72:55----------
it's reinforcing the basic idea that


---------72:58----------
your anxiety has that like things can go


---------73:00----------
wrong on a plane and this is the other


---------73:03----------
really weird thing is that your


---------73:04----------
knowledge of aviation do you think that


---------73:06----------
makes your anxiety better or makes it


---------73:08----------
worse I've I've drawn almost wonder if


---------73:15----------
it makes it worse because I know a lot I


---------73:19----------
know what can go wrong on a plane yeah


---------73:21----------
and it's not perfect so so this is where


---------73:24----------
this is where I want you to just oh man


---------73:26----------
there's just so much to explain but ok


---------73:27----------
so like I want you to understand that


---------73:28----------
like what happens is your knowledge of


---------73:30----------
the airplane is hijacked by your anxiety


---------73:33----------
that which should reassure you because


---------73:36----------
you know all the statistics actually


---------73:39----------
somehow it gets like hijacked by the air


---------73:41----------
like the the anxiety to like be used


---------73:45----------
against you it's like Austin knows like


---------73:47----------
oh like actually flying is safe and like


---------73:49----------
you know I can't I've never met a person


---------73:53----------
who knows when the last accident related


---------73:57----------
to turbulence was I like literally never


---------73:59----------
met that person I was in Fiji in 1960


---------74:03----------
something I frightened so that's what


---------74:05----------
anxious people


---------74:06----------
they have all kinds they understand what


---------74:10----------
they're anxious about in and out and it


---------74:12----------
only seems to make things worse right


---------74:14----------
whereas we have this assumption that the


---------74:17----------
more you learn about something the more


---------74:19----------
your anxiety should go down you should


---------74:22----------
be reassured by knowledge but if we


---------74:24----------
actually look at the data that's not how


---------74:26----------
it works


---------74:27----------
knowledge and by the way it's like if


---------74:29----------
you read less about airplanes I don't


---------74:31----------
know that your anxiety would be less I


---------74:33----------
think it just it's just like it uses it


---------74:35----------
it uses your anxiety is gonna use


---------74:37----------
whatever it can in your mind because


---------74:39----------
anxiety is a feeling and it's gonna wrap


---------74:42----------
whatever logical [ __ ] it can to like


---------74:45----------
bring in to itself it doesn't matter


---------74:48----------
what I have a question yeah


---------74:52----------
I want to know if this is unhealthy


---------74:54----------
because I genuinely enjoy it it doesn't


---------74:56----------
make me anxious in the moment but I do


---------75:00----------
watch like aircraft disaster things like


---------75:04----------
disaster you know YouTube video you know


---------75:06----------
it's you know okay like I do that


---------75:08----------
because I enjoy like the educational


---------75:10----------
portion of it like what happened what


---------75:11----------
went wrong


---------75:13----------
but like I don't know like I don't know


---------75:17----------
if this was like a like a like a sort of


---------75:19----------
like a I know it sounds so dumb like why


---------75:23----------
would you watch that if you're afraid of


---------75:25----------
it but it's almost like I want my


---------75:27----------
justification in my head is number one I


---------75:30----------
like enjoy like seeing the aviation


---------75:32----------
portion I like it but number two I want


---------75:34----------
to know what went wrong and what steps


---------75:36----------
they took to fix it so like now I know


---------75:39----------
when I go on a plane that the likelihood


---------75:41----------
of that particular situation isn't gonna


---------75:42----------
happen again sort of thing


---------75:44----------
yes yeah makes a lot of sense so the


---------75:46----------
short answer is like yes and no does it


---------75:48----------
is it a good idea or bad idea so it's


---------75:50----------
fine because remember that Austin likes


---------75:52----------
aviation that has nothing to do with


---------75:53----------
your anxiety right like if it's not


---------75:56----------
triggering for you I think it's fine to


---------75:58----------
watch it and we see the second piece too


---------76:00----------
which is that the reassurance piece is


---------76:02----------
actually feeding your anxiety but


---------76:03----------
anything you do to reassure yourself is


---------76:05----------
gonna feed anxiety right you see that


---------76:07----------
yeah and I'm not actively thinking about


---------76:10----------
these disaster videos in flight like oh


---------76:12----------
I'm gonna be that flight yeah so I mean


---------76:14----------
it sounds like it's like I think that I


---------76:16----------
think that the solution to your anxiety


---------76:19----------
does not involve


---------76:20----------
in a significant way stopping - watching


---------76:22----------
youtube videos about aviation okay I


---------76:25----------
think the solution to your anxiety is


---------76:27----------
like pretty simple and it's like the


---------76:28----------
solution to like most anxiety which


---------76:31----------
we'll get to in a second but let's go


---------76:32----------
back to the origin for a second okay so


---------76:35----------
is this the voice of your mom that's


---------76:38----------
what it looks ounds like right that's


---------76:40----------
the best example of a smoking gun that


---------76:42----------
we've got but there are a couple of


---------76:44----------
other things which I want to clue people


---------76:45----------
in on so first of all really interesting


---------76:48----------
study okay so they took kids diagnosed


---------76:51----------
with anxiety who have had parents who


---------76:55----------
had diagnosed nosis of anxiety and they


---------76:59----------
found that treating the parent


---------77:02----------
actually treats the child even after the


---------77:07----------
FET or just whether a child okay so like


---------77:09----------
if I if I take a child like a ten year


---------77:12----------
old with an anxiety disorder and I take


---------77:15----------
their 35 year old mom with an anxiety


---------77:17----------
disorder and I give the 10 year old


---------77:19----------
medication and I in one group I give I


---------77:23----------
medicate the child and in the other


---------77:25----------
group I medicate the mom both results


---------77:27----------
are the same


---------77:29----------
wow that's incredible phrase because the


---------77:32----------
source of the anxiety is the theory that


---------77:34----------
the sort the anxiety came from the


---------77:36----------
mother or the person with the anxiety


---------77:38----------
yeah sort of like that's what the data


---------77:40----------
suggests right so then there are a


---------77:42----------
couple of other things so we know that


---------77:43----------
anxiety disorders run in families so


---------77:45----------
there is an inherited component so there


---------77:47----------
may just be something and I do think I


---------77:49----------
don't think it's just your mom so I


---------77:50----------
think your brain Austin as evidenced by


---------77:53----------
your professional success is very good


---------77:56----------
at projecting catastrophe which actually


---------77:58----------
helps you succeed professionally because


---------78:01----------
your brain is capable of considering ups


---------78:04----------
and downs that the average person may


---------78:06----------
not be able to consider which can is


---------78:09----------
attentive and beneficial to you so you


---------78:11----------
would avoided certain pitfalls and you


---------78:14----------
also can put eyes on some low


---------78:18----------
possibility things because you were able


---------78:20----------
to predict them because all anxiety is


---------78:22----------
is your predictive capability right the


---------78:25----------
better you are at predicting the worse


---------78:27----------
your anxiety is gonna be yeah I can see


---------78:32----------
that so so one thing is that like you


---------78:35----------
may just have an inherited component


---------78:36----------
which may not be like due to the


---------78:38----------
environment of your mom it could just be


---------78:40----------
like genetically your neurons are sort


---------78:42----------
of wired to be like a little bit more


---------78:44----------
anxious you probably have high trait


---------78:46----------
neuroticism which is another personality


---------78:48----------
component sure second thing is that


---------78:50----------
going no you go ahead no please so no so


---------78:53----------
second thing is like better you learn to


---------78:55----------
listen sorry second thing is that you


---------78:57----------
know I do think that it sort of makes


---------78:59----------
sense to me that you were taught to be


---------79:01----------
fearful you were taught to be fearful so


---------79:06----------
that's how I would reframe your anxiety


---------79:08----------
is like this is your conditioning it's


---------79:11----------
not irrational its conditioning and


---------79:14----------
conditioning can absolutely be


---------79:16----------
irrational like then you're like why am


---------79:18----------
i this way it's because you're [ __ ]


---------79:20----------
conditioned and that solves everything


---------79:22----------
it's weird I'm starting to think because


---------79:27----------
my mother like but my dad is also kind


---------79:32----------
of paranoid


---------79:33----------
it keeps kind of paranoid too like I'm


---------79:35----------
not saying I don't think my mom when I


---------79:37----------
think of somebody that has anxiety I


---------79:39----------
think of my mom because she's she like


---------79:42----------
shares many traits with me in terms of


---------79:43----------
like my personality and and stuff but my


---------79:48----------
dad is also paranoid in like different


---------79:52----------
areas like my dad a walk on a plane and


---------79:54----------
you know he'll eat an edible and he'll


---------79:57----------
be passed out and doesn't care right


---------79:59----------
doesn't care doesn't give a rip just


---------80:02----------
chill him with his coffee you know


---------80:03----------
chilling and you know whatever he'll


---------80:05----------
he'll go someplace and not worry about


---------80:07----------
anything you know yeah now now now


---------80:10----------
everybody knows where I got it from no


---------80:12----------
I'm just kidding


---------80:13----------
but uh but but my dad like he's also


---------80:17----------
very like paranoid about other things


---------80:19----------
like he's like different things that are


---------80:21----------
different from my mother


---------80:22----------
like it's different aspects of life I'm


---------80:25----------
trying to think of like an example and


---------80:26----------
is your blind a combination of those two


---------80:29----------
people often say that I have my


---------80:32----------
personalities like my mother and my like


---------80:36----------
more people say like my more like if you


---------80:39----------
will like


---------80:43----------
trying to think of it a personality


---------80:45----------
mother people say that my dad is is very


---------80:48----------
much like a like sort of like my more my


---------80:53----------
more rational side if you will like I


---------80:55----------
don't I want to say my mom's irrational


---------80:57----------
but like my more yes like in if I had


---------81:00----------
and I'm not saying my mom's stupid right


---------81:02----------
but if I had like a more intellectual


---------81:04----------
like critical thinking side it would be


---------81:06----------
from my dad right my mom's not that way


---------81:09----------
but that like my my habits sorry good


---------81:13----------
yeah so so so well so Austin I'm just


---------81:16----------
noticing there's a lot left to talk


---------81:18----------
about so we'll talk about how to talk


---------81:20----------
about what's left to talk about


---------81:22----------
cuz we you know I want I don't want to


---------81:24----------
give you the sense that I'm not offering


---------81:25----------
you complete picture I'm giving you like


---------81:27----------
10% because there's you know individuals


---------81:30----------
are like I'm gonna share a couple


---------81:31----------
principles with you we can talk a little


---------81:33----------
bit more about that but I want to get to


---------81:34----------
a couple of other things just about


---------81:36----------
generally speaking the origin of anxiety


---------81:38----------
so what is like we can think that you


---------81:39----------
are conditioned so the other big place


---------81:42----------
that anxiety comes from is actually what


---------81:44----------
I asked you earlier about like so you


---------81:48----------
can learn you can learn to be afraid of


---------81:51----------
catastrophe in two ways one is that you


---------81:53----------
can be taught to be afraid of


---------81:54----------
catastrophe by like your parents or you


---------81:58----------
can actually have faced catastrophe


---------82:00----------
before and then your mind then it's no


---------82:03----------
longer theoretic right because if it's


---------82:04----------
happened to you then it's actually a


---------82:07----------
possibility and so I'll just give you


---------82:09----------
like an example which of a patient of


---------82:11----------
mine who has allowed me to share this


---------82:15----------
component because she thinks it would be


---------82:17----------
helpful so she's someone who had anxiety


---------82:19----------
for like 17 years and then at this like


---------82:24----------
and it was irrational right like she


---------82:25----------
would always like think about horrible


---------82:27----------
things going wrong and and the more that


---------82:29----------
we kind of talked about her it was just


---------82:30----------
so she had lost her or father due to


---------82:33----------
cancer and so like that had been


---------82:35----------
explored in therapy as well and like


---------82:36----------
like if she had kind of talked about the


---------82:38----------
loss and how that was like sad and


---------82:40----------
grievous and and all that kind of stuff


---------82:42----------
and so she sort of been like okay so


---------82:44----------
like lost dad like sometimes that leads


---------82:45----------
to an anxiety disorder didn't seem to be


---------82:47----------
the case


---------82:48----------
she was actually anxious before she lost


---------82:50----------
her dad so the question is like when did


---------82:51----------
you become anxious so like it turns out


---------82:53----------
that the root Harang her anxiety is that


---------82:56----------
when she was like 6 or so


---------82:57----------
she knew her dad had cancer she like


---------83:00----------
knew something was wrong and everyone


---------83:02----------
told her everything was okay


---------83:03----------
but in her heart of hearts she felt like


---------83:08----------
something was true and she was taught


---------83:10----------
that she was irrational when in fact


---------83:13----------
she's been right all along and so her


---------83:17----------
sense of what is real and unreal got


---------83:20----------
[ __ ] up at a young age and the second


---------83:22----------
she ought not the second but over the


---------83:24----------
course of a couple of weeks is she


---------83:25----------
realized that like her problem her


---------83:29----------
freedom from anxiety was not in calling


---------83:31----------
it irrational it was in recognizing that


---------83:33----------
it's actually very rational it's the


---------83:37----------
opposite and then she got better because


---------83:40----------
she's like oh like these feelings that I


---------83:42----------
have are not wrong they're actually


---------83:45----------
right and that allowed her to sit with


---------83:47----------
them and it's like your fears are real


---------83:50----------
they're not wrong and the whole reason


---------83:52----------
that our anxiety never gets better is


---------83:54----------
because she actually like invalidates


---------83:56----------
her feelings and she assumes she's


---------83:58----------
irrational she assumes something is


---------84:00----------
broken when actually it's working fine


---------84:02----------
and then like how the [ __ ] like no


---------84:04----------
wonder you can't drive your car properly


---------84:06----------
because you're pretending like you have


---------84:08----------
a flat and your tires fine right so in


---------84:14----------
my experience comes from two places


---------84:15----------
either conditioning or an event where


---------84:18----------
the catastrophe actually happened and


---------84:19----------
then it's like no longer irrational for


---------84:21----------
you it's a reality it actually happened


---------84:24----------
so this is why like you know people who


---------84:26----------
have bad [ __ ] happen to them to develop


---------84:29----------
anxiety disorders because like something


---------84:33----------
happens where that one-in-a-million


---------84:34----------
thing like I had another patient who was


---------84:36----------
like attacked in a gas station bathroom


---------84:39----------
by like a 13 year old male patient who


---------84:44----------
was attacked in a bathroom by like a 30


---------84:46----------
year old truck driver like sexually


---------84:50----------
in a gas station bathroom and like after


---------84:53----------
that he's got anxiety because think


---------84:55----------
about the worst thing that you could


---------84:56----------
possibly think about when you're 13 and


---------84:58----------
think about how irrational it is for


---------85:01----------
that [ __ ] to happen and then this


---------85:02----------
confess to you and the low likelihood of


---------85:06----------
the world getting hit by a meteor is


---------85:09----------
actually like this is way worse and the


---------85:13----------
worst thing can happen to you I have a


---------85:15----------
question yeah is Earth's is there such


---------85:18----------
thing as a combination of both like


---------85:20----------
solutely sort of okay so that's why I so


---------85:24----------
so I think I think if you feel like your


---------85:25----------
mom is not all of the picture Isis I


---------85:28----------
don't suspect one of the hypotheses is


---------85:31----------
that something happened to you that felt


---------85:34----------
incredibly catastrophic that because of


---------85:37----------
the way that your mind tends to discount


---------85:39----------
the way that you feel because you're


---------85:41----------
irrational and you just invalidate


---------85:42----------
yourself all the time I don't even know


---------85:44----------
that you're able to like go back there


---------85:46----------
because you probably felt like it was so


---------85:48----------
stupid and insignificant


---------85:51----------
and that my mind that I like I can't


---------85:53----------
even remember because I heard it all


---------85:55----------
exactly exactly and this is exactly what


---------85:58----------
happened with the other patient which is


---------85:59----------
that she thought that actually losing


---------86:02----------
her dad is so much more of a logical


---------86:04----------
thing that should contribute to anxiety


---------86:06----------
then knowing that your dad was sick is


---------86:08----------
like her actual memories where the


---------86:10----------
anxiety was born was like seeing like


---------86:12----------
they would like her dad wouldn't go into


---------86:14----------
work one day and he'd like go to the


---------86:15----------
clinic and they'd like drop him off to


---------86:17----------
get chemotherapy and then she'd be like


---------86:19----------
what why are we here and they're like oh


---------86:22----------
not everything's okay everything's okay


---------86:23----------
and then her dad would like come back


---------86:25----------
from chemotherapy and he'd be like he


---------86:28----------
looked sick he'd be like sunken and he'd


---------86:31----------
lose weight and she's like what's wrong


---------86:33----------
with that and they'd say nothing and


---------86:35----------
actually that's way worse than losing


---------86:37----------
him because she was six and then when


---------86:40----------
she was like 18 and her dad was actually


---------86:41----------
dying she could understand what was


---------86:43----------
happening and also they were like they


---------86:45----------
were telling her reality right her


---------86:48----------
disconnection if you think about anxiety


---------86:50----------
you keep on saying it's so rational it's


---------86:51----------
so rational that disconnection from


---------86:53----------
reality happens at six because she


---------86:57----------
actually got disconnected from reality


---------86:58----------
and so it's not irrational for your mind


---------87:01----------
to be disconnected from reality because


---------87:02----------
that's what


---------87:03----------
you learn you learned that everything


---------87:05----------
that you feel is not actually correct


---------87:08----------
that's what she learned right and


---------87:12----------
somewhere along the way you learned this


---------87:14----------
stuff you're not broken man


---------87:18----------
like it's just how your mind has learned


---------87:21----------
how to function


---------87:25----------
so there there may be an experience


---------87:27----------
somewhere in there where like you felt


---------87:30----------
like it could be something dumb like


---------87:32----------
forgetting your homework


---------87:35----------
and it could be something where like you


---------87:37----------
were afraid are you getting emotional no


---------87:39----------
I'm good I think it's very powerful what


---------87:42----------
you said because I've always out of it


---------87:43----------
is saying it's irrational I've always


---------87:47----------
thought irrational rational rational and


---------87:49----------
I've heart on that and I thought that


---------87:50----------
was a productive thing to do like my


---------87:53----------
fear is irrational that's that's all


---------87:55----------
that I thought that that was like a


---------87:56----------
solution to no problem so awesome I


---------88:00----------
return you to what I said earlier about


---------88:02----------
being scientific everyone thinks that


---------88:05----------
their fear is irrational and what does


---------88:07----------
it do to their anxiety doesn't help it


---------88:11----------
absolutely so that's not a useful


---------88:14----------
framework because data suggests it


---------88:16----------
doesn't work so let's stop thinking it


---------88:19----------
even though we think it's right it


---------88:22----------
sounds rational for us to approach


---------88:25----------
anxiety as irrational right but it's


---------88:29----------
just not because it doesn't work it's


---------88:31----------
not it doesn't mirror actual reality so


---------88:34----------
we need to be more open-minded right I'd


---------88:37----------
never thought of it that way


---------88:39----------
ever yeah so you heard it in passing but


---------88:42----------
this is like so the last thing is that


---------88:46----------
you know are your parents to blame


---------88:47----------
because I think in order for you to


---------88:49----------
understand where this comes from you


---------88:51----------
have to let your parents take some


---------88:52----------
responsibility for this so I want to


---------88:55----------
help you do that and let me just say


---------88:56----------
this no matter how good of a parent you


---------88:58----------
are there's gonna be collateral damage


---------89:00----------
for your kids doesn't mean that they did


---------89:02----------
a bad job it's clear that they did a


---------89:04----------
great job and they're not perfect nor


---------89:07----------
should we expect them to be perfect and


---------89:08----------
they kind of screwed you up in some ways


---------89:10----------
which is what parents do


---------89:11----------
like my kids are gonna be screwed up in


---------89:13----------
some ways it doesn't like there's no way


---------89:14----------
to avoid that like it's just like the


---------89:16----------
goal is for parents to be like good


---------89:18----------
enough right it's not for them to be


---------89:20----------
perfect and it's okay like my parents


---------89:22----------
like I'm a pretty healthy human being


---------89:24----------
and I'm grateful for my upbringing I


---------89:26----------
think my parents are awesome and they


---------89:28----------
screwed me up in some ways that's just


---------89:29----------
part of life like there is no


---------89:31----------
parent-child relationship I have ever


---------89:33----------
seen no matter how good the parent is


---------89:34----------
where the child is not a little bit


---------89:35----------
[ __ ] up just how it works you know


---------89:39----------
they do the best that they can and then


---------89:40----------
you try to because I'm sure there are


---------89:42----------
some things you've already decided that


---------89:44----------
you're gonna do differently from your


---------89:45----------
parents if you ever I don't


---------89:48----------
and everyone thinks that and that that


---------89:49----------
doesn't make your parents bad it's just


---------89:51----------
like they're not perfect and I think you


---------89:54----------
know we definitely see it's interesting


---------89:55----------
because when we hear about your mom and


---------89:57----------
this this kind of you know this


---------89:59----------
conditioning and all that kind of crap


---------90:00----------
and it's actually borne out in evidence


---------90:02----------
as well that like if if maybe your mom


---------90:04----------
had treated had been treated you may not


---------90:06----------
have had the anxiety that you do to


---------90:08----------
think we don't blame her for that


---------90:10----------
because she did the best that she could


---------90:11----------
right it's in the same way that we don't


---------90:13----------
blame you for calling yourself Raj Patel


---------90:14----------
a while ago because you didn't know any


---------90:16----------
better like isn't wrong sure but like we


---------90:19----------
don't blame you for it cuz it you know


---------90:22----------
in the same way like could she have done


---------90:23----------
better sure but we don't blame her for


---------90:24----------
it like she did the best that she could


---------90:25----------
she did a really good job we could be


---------90:27----------
grateful and be like okay so like now we


---------90:29----------
know that does that make sense


---------90:31----------
yeah it makes sense so I do have a


---------90:36----------
question though yeah and this is the


---------90:38----------
hard part that I have with this and


---------90:39----------
associate and blame to my parents


---------90:42----------
because and this is sort of in the


---------90:43----------
process of getting older and maybe


---------90:45----------
people can relate to this but when you


---------90:46----------
grow up you sort of have a perfect image


---------90:48----------
of your parents and they can do no wrong


---------90:51----------
you know that sort of thing and the idea


---------90:54----------
to like say blame it's just like I don't


---------90:57----------
know why and I understand what what


---------90:59----------
you're saying but in my mind my mind


---------91:01----------
immediately goes to as soon as they I


---------91:05----------
would say blame to my parents that would


---------91:07----------
implicate them as like being just bad


---------91:09----------
just because like how people perceive if


---------91:11----------
that's the only thing people have heard


---------91:13----------
from my parents that they were the


---------91:14----------
reason why I'm so anxious I'm afraid


---------91:17----------
that they would think that they're bad


---------91:18----------
parents and you logically you being who


---------91:20----------
you are I understand that you wouldn't


---------91:22----------
get it that way but I don't want anybody


---------91:24----------
else to think that way or like the


---------91:25----------
public image of them being like bad


---------91:28----------
parents you know what I mean


---------91:30----------
yeah so I mean I think that's just where


---------91:32----------
like as human beings we need to be more


---------91:35----------
nuanced right right so like I'll share


---------91:37----------
with you another story if that's okay


---------91:39----------
yes I had another patient who also you


---------91:43----------
know okay with me sharing just that like


---------91:44----------
yep so he also


---------91:46----------
uh you know lost a parent when he was


---------91:49----------
young and then I would ask him about


---------91:52----------
like you know what was your other parent


---------91:54----------
like and he said my other parent did the


---------91:56----------
did the best study that they could and I


---------92:00----------
sort of like thought it was weird that


---------92:01----------
like you know okay fine they did the


---------92:02----------
best they of course right that's what


---------92:03----------
all parents do is they did the best they


---------92:05----------
could but like I was like you know have


---------92:06----------
house your house your dad


---------92:08----------
like he did the best that he could and


---------92:10----------
then we kind of talked a little bit and


---------92:11----------
turns out that like after work his dad


---------92:13----------
would like usually go to the bar and


---------92:14----------
like have a couple beers with his


---------92:16----------
friends and that was like kind of a


---------92:18----------
daily occurrence and he was grieving and


---------92:19----------
stuff like that so patient really blame


---------92:22----------
him he's like you know he's like the


---------92:23----------
dude lost a wife it's got to be tough he


---------92:26----------
did the best that he could what do you


---------92:28----------
think though is that like he never says


---------92:30----------
that his dad did a great job he says


---------92:32----------
that his dad did the best that he could


---------92:34----------
all right so there's like there's no


---------92:36----------
blame but there's also like a subtle


---------92:40----------
under the surface acknowledgement that


---------92:42----------
like I mean his son had lost a mother


---------92:45----------
and he instead of coming home because he


---------92:48----------
had certain needs of like dealing with


---------92:51----------
zone emotions like hung out in a bar and


---------92:52----------
it's really hard to blame him for that


---------92:55----------
but it's really important to do that


---------92:58----------
right it's it's it's one thing because


---------93:01----------
here's the problem that he had he


---------93:03----------
couldn't forgive his dad because you


---------93:05----------
can't forgive someone unless they did


---------93:08----------
something wrong and in his mind he was


---------93:11----------
making excuses so like there's no chance


---------93:13----------
for forgiveness so oddly enough his path


---------93:16----------
forward was to acknowledge that like his


---------93:17----------
dad did the best that he could I don't


---------93:19----------
blame him for that and forgive him for


---------93:20----------
being not a perfect parent and now he's


---------93:24----------
fine like it's like been settled like he


---------93:25----------
doesn't hold a grudge he doesn't talk


---------93:27----------
[ __ ] about his dad know when things his


---------93:28----------
dad is a bad person that's where


---------93:30----------
conflation happens that's where like


---------93:32----------
pitchforks come out right and you can


---------93:35----------
like and this is where like you have to


---------93:37----------
I think it's healthy as a child to


---------93:39----------
recognize that your parents are flawed


---------93:40----------
because they're not perfect it's healthy


---------93:44----------
you have to grow into recognizing that


---------93:46----------
your parents did the best study that


---------93:48----------
they could and you don't blame for that


---------93:50----------
but it [ __ ] a couple of things up and


---------93:52----------
like that's actually okay like we need


---------93:54----------
to live in a world where instead of


---------93:56----------
expecting people to be perfect we need


---------93:58----------
to like understand that they're not


---------94:00----------
like actually be okay with that it's


---------94:02----------
about sitting with it right not making


---------94:06----------
it go away not treating it not


---------94:08----------
discounting with it just sitting with it


---------94:11----------
and saying that's the way they are


---------94:14----------
they're not perfect and I'm grateful to


---------94:16----------
them I mean I think there's no doubt in


---------94:17----------
anyone's mind because watch this whole


---------94:19----------
stream that you were incredibly grateful


---------94:21----------
to your parents and they're incredibly


---------94:22----------
proud of you and just because your


---------94:24----------
anxiety is related to them doesn't


---------94:26----------
change any of that we need to be able to


---------94:30----------
hold two contrary concepts in our mind


---------94:32----------
which is not something that our that


---------94:35----------
we're good at as a society


---------94:36----------
I love planes I have a fear of flying


---------94:39----------
those can absolutely coexist right


---------94:44----------
someone is a bad person and I mean this


---------94:48----------
is gonna be kind of controversial but


---------94:50----------
like this is just what I've you know


---------94:52----------
what I when you work with criminals


---------94:53----------
sometimes you begin to see that people


---------94:56----------
can do deplorable things but it doesn't


---------94:58----------
make them absolute incarnations of evil


---------95:03----------
right that sometimes like it's bizarre


---------95:05----------
like when you work with someone who is a


---------95:07----------
sexual abuser who in turn was sexually


---------95:10----------
abused


---------95:10----------
does it absolve them of responsibility


---------95:12----------
of their actions absolutely not


---------95:14----------
shouldn't they be punished absolutely


---------95:16----------
and like sometimes there should be room


---------95:20----------
for compassion I'm not asking anyone to


---------95:22----------
do that that's been my personal


---------95:23----------
experience that I have come to deal with


---------95:26----------
people and the more that I see the world


---------95:28----------
is less black-and-white I'm not trying


---------95:30----------
to be an apologist for rape or anything


---------95:32----------
like that I I mean I think they deserve


---------95:33----------
to be in jail and also like once they're


---------95:36----------
in jail you know it doesn't mean that we


---------95:38----------
should I personally choose to try to be


---------95:41----------
compassionate towards as many people as


---------95:43----------
I can which I'm not expecting other


---------95:44----------
people to do but what I want to say talk


---------95:48----------
about things being misinterpreted and


---------95:49----------
conflated of the internet time and


---------95:51----------
feathering you know what I want to say


---------95:53----------
is that we should be able to hold two


---------95:54----------
things at the same time right that like


---------95:58----------
that your parents did a wonderful job


---------96:01----------
and they weren't perfect and that like


---------96:05----------
you need to get your own anxiety


---------96:07----------
disorder if you have one treated if you


---------96:09----------
get kids yeah


---------96:12----------
I have a question yeah I've been its


---------96:14----------
medicating myself for anxiety and and I


---------96:17----------
know I don't smoke weed for my anxiety


---------96:19----------
in fact it sometimes it makes it


---------96:21----------
incredibly worse I smoke weed because it


---------96:24----------
makes food taste good and you know and


---------96:27----------
other other stuff feel good you know


---------96:30----------
but i i've been very against medication


---------96:33----------
do you have like a particular stance on


---------96:35----------
that sure I think if you're against


---------96:37----------
medication don't take medication fair


---------96:40----------
enough that's I feel like it's cheating


---------96:42----------
and I'm like I'm almost anxious to take


---------96:44----------
this is kind of messed up have you seen


---------96:47----------
a psychiatrist or like had an evaluation


---------96:49----------
for anxiety


---------96:50----------
no it just sort of just sort of known


---------96:53----------
that I have it and like it's a problem


---------96:54----------
okay so I would start there okay and I


---------97:01----------
would start there


---------97:02----------
and then you know I would listen to the


---------97:07----------
option so be careful about the kind of


---------97:09----------
like mental health treatment provider


---------97:10----------
you go to because some psychiatrists or


---------97:13----------
psycho pharmacologists which means that


---------97:16----------
they will see like three to four


---------97:18----------
patients an hour and they basically


---------97:20----------
prescribe medications


---------97:21----------
that's literally with their job it's


---------97:23----------
like it's like a psychopharmacology


---------97:25----------
position so in my experience so just a


---------97:27----------
couple of things about data okay so


---------97:29----------
let's talk about data for a second


---------97:31----------
psychotherapy is about as equal as as


---------97:33----------
effective as medication they're just as


---------97:36----------
good psychotherapy plus medication


---------97:38----------
outperforms either one on one in my


---------97:41----------
personal experience I prescribed


---------97:44----------
medications to about twenty to thirty


---------97:46----------
percent of my patients so sometimes like


---------97:49----------
the question the real question about


---------97:50----------
medication it's not like a value


---------97:52----------
judgment or anything like that I think


---------97:53----------
is just like a tool in your tool belt


---------97:54----------
and you shouldn't have a bias against it


---------97:56----------
or think that it's like people do think


---------97:58----------
it's sort of like a crotch or a weakness


---------97:59----------
or things like that I mean I prescribe


---------98:01----------
medication depending on what's going on


---------98:04----------
I'm not afraid of it being like a stigma


---------98:07----------
I'm just like afraid of what it would do


---------98:09----------
to my mind like sure that's valid yes I


---------98:12----------
want to do withdrawals associated with


---------98:14----------
it you know so I think that's something


---------98:16----------
you should bring up with your providers


---------98:17----------
I get that fear a lot and I manage it


---------98:19----------
pretty well I'll tell people okay like


---------98:21----------
here's what I understand about


---------98:22----------
withdrawals and things like that so the


---------98:23----------
first thing I would tell


---------98:24----------
is that for the most part your brain is


---------98:26----------
developed so developing brains are more


---------98:28----------
vulnerable than developed brains because


---------98:30----------
your brain is like growing with this


---------98:32----------
chemical around right still at the same


---------98:34----------
time like you know sometimes 16


---------98:36----------
year-olds get prescribed antidepressants


---------98:38----------
or anti-anxiety medications that's fine


---------98:39----------
I think John yeah is it weird that like


---------98:43----------
I'm afraid to take like I'm not and I'm


---------98:46----------
not prescribed it but like the idea of


---------98:48----------
taking like like what do they call that


---------98:52----------
medication that just like it's like one


---------98:54----------
of those you you're not supposed to take


---------98:55----------
it all the time it's an anxiety


---------98:57----------
medication okay then X yeah I'd be


---------99:01----------
afraid to take it because I'd afraid


---------99:03----------
that it would kill me or something


---------99:04----------
even though like it's even if it was


---------99:06----------
prescribed to me I'd be afraid that it


---------99:08----------
would kill me or like it was something


---------99:09----------
would happen bad yeah so that is I okay


---------99:12----------
this is kind of a loaded term that's an


---------99:14----------
irrational fear right okay so most fear


---------99:17----------
by definition is irrational because it's


---------99:19----------
an emotion it's a different part of the


---------99:21----------
brain at the same time I think it's


---------99:23----------
completely reasonable and rational for


---------99:25----------
you to have that fear mm-hmm right so


---------99:28----------
like fears aren't rational by their


---------99:31----------
nature I think it's I think you should


---------99:33----------
be concerned about xanax so I do my


---------99:37----------
level best to never prescribed xanax


---------99:40----------
personally because it's highly addictive


---------99:44----------
and it works


---------99:47----------
entirely too well that's that's that's


---------99:50----------
part of my fear is that I would get


---------99:52----------
addicted to it because it would work so


---------99:53----------
well yeah that's anxious I take it and


---------99:57----------
it would get away my anxiety and just


---------99:58----------
the frequency of how often I am a I


---------100:00----------
would be taking it every time I felt


---------100:03----------
like yeah and then one of these so in my


---------100:05----------
training program like they really taught


---------100:08----------
us conditioned us to fear xanax okay and


---------100:12----------
like they're always like there's a


---------100:13----------
there's a pit in my stomach I remember


---------100:15----------
when I would work like impatient like so


---------100:17----------
when people get hospitalized when I look


---------100:18----------
at the patient's medication list any


---------100:20----------
time I saw xanax I liked like mice like


---------100:23----------
I would feel a pit in my cell right like


---------100:25----------
oh [ __ ] yeah it's gonna be hard to deal


---------100:27----------
with this person because it's hard to


---------100:28----------
get off the Medicaid it's not the


---------100:29----------
person's fault right right


---------100:31----------
it makes prescribed usually as like as


---------100:34----------
needed or is it like a like sometimes


---------100:37----------
prescribed like generally it's


---------100:38----------
supposed to be used as needed and


---------100:40----------
they're there like a handful of people


---------100:42----------
for whom you can really get away with


---------100:43----------
xanax and like those people are people


---------100:45----------
who have like fears of flying or like


---------100:48----------
public speaking where like you know the


---------100:51----------
as-needed is not something that by


---------100:53----------
definition can happen every day like


---------100:56----------
someone who needs an X like two to three


---------100:57----------
times a year would be the kind of person


---------100:59----------
that I would prescribe xanax for


---------101:03----------
other medications and it's completely


---------101:05----------
reasonable for you to be afraid of


---------101:06----------
medications I have been prescribed


---------101:08----------
something like I'm sorry I interrupted


---------101:10----------
you go ahead go ahead


---------101:12----------
I've been prescribed not xanax but some


---------101:15----------
or other hydroxyzine is that the correct


---------101:18----------
yeah that hydroxyzine they typically


---------101:21----------
used as like a anti-allergy but it was


---------101:26----------
used to be treated as anxiety yeah and


---------101:28----------
also that's sort of in the same family


---------101:31----------
as benadryl just stronger correct I


---------101:33----------
don't know about stronger but yeah okay


---------101:36----------
everything else is correct okay yes so


---------101:40----------
that's one of the things that I've so


---------101:41----------
the reason that a lot of people will use


---------101:42----------
hydroxyzine is because it is a


---------101:44----------
anti-anxiety agent that acts quickly so


---------101:48----------
there are two kinds of anti-anxiety


---------101:50----------
agents those that lower your baseline


---------101:52----------
level of anxiety so those are not as


---------101:55----------
needed medications those are things that


---------101:57----------
you take every day so if we think about


---------101:59----------
heart disease for example there are


---------102:02----------
medications that you take for your heart


---------102:03----------
that will like lower your blood pressure


---------102:05----------
on a daily basis and then there are some


---------102:08----------
acute blood-pressure agents that we'll


---------102:11----------
use to like in seconds if you're having


---------102:14----------
a heart attack


---------102:15----------
drop your blood pressure so that your


---------102:17----------
art can pump normally or anyway that's


---------102:21----------
not actually how they work but so that


---------102:23----------
they're like in medicine we have acute


---------102:25----------
agents and then we have like long-term


---------102:26----------
agents and for anxiety treatment there


---------102:29----------
are both kinds they're the kinds that


---------102:30----------
you use for acute anxiety and then there


---------102:33----------
are those that you use to lower baseline


---------102:35----------
levels of anxiety that experience from


---------102:38----------
day to day the reason that a lot of


---------102:39----------
people use hydroxyzine is because


---------102:41----------
hydroxyzine is not habit-forming so it's


---------102:44----------
not addictive like xanax or


---------102:46----------
benzodiazepines which are addictive


---------102:48----------
they're basically like alcohol in like


---------102:51----------
pill form and modified and so you know


---------102:55----------
it sort of makes sense it signals to me


---------102:57----------
that the prescriber who prescribed that


---------102:59----------
to you is probably doing it generally


---------103:02----------
speaking a good job yeah and I also


---------103:05----------
express my like fear of those at benzos


---------103:08----------
but most and I would I would really


---------103:10----------
recommend that you get a thorough mental


---------103:12----------
health evaluation because there's a lot


---------103:13----------
of information that we haven't


---------103:16----------
talked about which is actually really


---------103:17----------
important important in determining


---------103:20----------
whether you have an a true anxiety


---------103:21----------
disorder and that includes like we


---------103:24----------
haven't I don't ask some basic questions


---------103:25----------
like how often do you have anxiety you


---------103:28----------
know like it was I'm just giving that as


---------103:31----------
an example right so there's a lot of


---------103:33----------
other stuff like I haven't asked you so


---------103:34----------
sometimes anxieties related to actually


---------103:36----------
physical conditions so endocrine


---------103:39----------
imbalances like if you have your thyroid


---------103:41----------
hormone is too high there's a lot of


---------103:43----------
other due diligence that needs to happen


---------103:45----------
before someone diagnoses you with


---------103:47----------
anxiety well what I tried to do today


---------103:50----------
and I guess now I'm sort of explaining


---------103:52----------
myself is explain that dealing with


---------103:55----------
anxiety is of medical illness is


---------103:57----------
actually a completely different thing


---------103:59----------
than helping a human being understand


---------104:01----------
how anxiety in their mind interrupts


---------104:04----------
right both of those will hopefully


---------104:07----------
alleviate anxiety but one is like more


---------104:09----------
educational and like in terms of


---------104:10----------
treatment it sounds like you really do


---------104:12----------
need an evaluation so I would strongly


---------104:14----------
encourage you to get I really want


---------104:15----------
therapy for that because like it's


---------104:17----------
anybody anybody that has anxiety like I


---------104:22----------
have moments of clarity and it's not


---------104:24----------
like an everyday thing okay there I go


---------104:25----------
again see trying to justify that it's


---------104:27----------
not and so we're like the more it's it's


---------104:29----------
it's absolutely crippling it's crippling


---------104:32----------
and it's it sucks you can't enjoy


---------104:34----------
certain things that you want to enjoy


---------104:36----------
because it's absolutely crippling to you


---------104:39----------
and it sucks and I want it to just be a


---------104:41----------
way I just don't want have to worry


---------104:42----------
about you yeah so in Masan here's my


---------104:44----------
general thought about medication just


---------104:47----------
strategically why I prescribe it okay


---------104:49----------
there are different options for you to


---------104:51----------
no longer make it crippling if you can


---------104:54----------
engage in those then I don't think you


---------104:56----------
need medication if you're unable to


---------104:59----------
engage in those that's what a pill is


---------105:01----------
for right if you can meditate do yoga


---------105:03----------
and exercise adjust your dot diet get a


---------105:07----------
nice Ayurvedic diet going and all this


---------105:08----------
kind of crap go to your therapist and


---------105:11----------
there aren't any like houses burning


---------105:12----------
down and you can afford to deal with the


---------105:16----------
damage from anxiety while all this other


---------105:19----------
stuff works because that stuff takes


---------105:20----------
time then you don't need medication the


---------105:23----------
reason that I recommend medication is


---------105:25----------
because first of all sometimes people


---------105:26----------
have lifestyles where they can't do the


---------105:28----------
other things the know


---------105:29----------
pharmacologic treatments for anxiety so


---------105:32----------
depending on what your life is like you


---------105:34----------
may not be able to do that stuff


---------105:35----------
the second reason is because there's a


---------105:37----------
certain acuity like so sometimes if


---------105:39----------
someone is depressed and they're on the


---------105:41----------
cusp of getting fired


---------105:42----------
they don't have six to eight months to


---------105:44----------
start doing all this front they have to


---------105:45----------
like do something now students is


---------105:47----------
another good example like if you're a


---------105:49----------
sophomore in college and you're


---------105:51----------
depressed you don't have nine months of


---------105:54----------
you can't be depressed for two semesters


---------105:57----------
because that's going to tank your GPA


---------105:59----------
and then you're gonna have to deal with


---------106:00----------
that for the rest of your life so it's


---------106:02----------
like a very individual conversation


---------106:04----------
about your circumstances risks benefits


---------106:07----------
and for you to make the right choice


---------106:10----------
like given all of these things and you


---------106:14----------
should probably also as part of that you


---------106:16----------
know anxiety evaluation get like certain


---------106:19----------
lab tests and things like that because


---------106:21----------
the last thing that you want to do is be


---------106:22----------
talking to someone about your feelings


---------106:24----------
when your thyroid hormone is way too


---------106:26----------
high because that says the like it


---------106:30----------
depends in general it depends okay


---------106:34----------
generally speaking I test a lot of stuff


---------106:37----------
for people with depression less stuff


---------106:39----------
from people with anxiety okay because


---------106:41----------
they could just ask you other questions


---------106:42----------
that like if your thyroid was out of


---------106:44----------
whack like you'd have other symptoms too


---------106:45----------
right


---------106:47----------
okay that makes sense yeah it's


---------106:51----------
interesting you mentioned well I don't


---------106:53----------
want to tell my family that's probably


---------106:56----------
not something I should get into yeah


---------106:57----------
family history that's why this isn't


---------107:00----------
medical advice right if I was your


---------107:02----------
doctor we would definitely have to talk


---------107:04----------
about that because there's no way to


---------107:05----------
make an accurate diagnosis without all


---------107:07----------
of that information is the thyroid


---------107:09----------
associated with anxiety sure if it's too


---------107:14----------
high interesting


---------107:17----------
but I don't yeah too low leads to


---------107:19----------
depression too high leads to anxiety


---------107:21----------
interesting but it's just interesting


---------107:25----------
I'll share that with you off stream


---------107:27----------
while that's interesting other time but


---------107:29----------
yeah sure interesting


---------107:30----------
share it with an actual doctor bro yeah


---------107:33----------
well this but I don't like I've never


---------107:37----------
had like a psychologist or anything like


---------107:40----------
that it's more of like than a general


---------107:41----------
general care physician yeah but yeah


---------107:46----------
it's more of like a like if not me


---------107:48----------
personally I don't know but see I don't


---------107:50----------
even know if my my thyroid has been


---------107:52----------
checked about that sort of thing you can


---------107:55----------
general your primary care physician


---------107:57----------
about it yeah I thought that they would


---------107:59----------
just do that in like a test given and


---------108:01----------
also like my mom and I shared the same


---------108:03----------
doctor for an extended period of time


---------108:05----------
and they knew about my mom's history so


---------108:08----------
I you would think but anyway sorry


---------108:10----------
that's probably another conversation


---------108:11----------
yeah so here's what I just say real


---------108:13----------
quick about that is that like there are


---------108:15----------
a lot of things that doctors should do


---------108:17----------
and the reason that oftentimes they


---------108:20----------
don't do them is not because they're bad


---------108:22----------
doctors but because they've just got way


---------108:24----------
too much other [ __ ] to do mmm-hmm and


---------108:27----------
it's hard for them to analyze their


---------108:29----------
their patients to the depth yeah so I


---------108:32----------
think it just sort of depends on like I


---------108:34----------
think it's good to have a conversation


---------108:35----------
with your doctor about it and like you


---------108:38----------
know can I tell you learn through this


---------108:40----------
yeah my tendency to push things away and


---------108:47----------
say I'm not it's not a problem or try to


---------108:50----------
like be like it's not an issue I'm like


---------108:52----------
most of the time I'm good that tendency


---------108:54----------
has been communicate like because of


---------108:57----------
that it's how it's impacted the way I've


---------108:59----------
communicated with doctors and people


---------109:01----------
professionals and and people in my life


---------109:03----------
so nobody really like I've pushed it off


---------109:08----------
as an issue so I really haven't talked


---------109:09----------
about it and maybe that's a problem like


---------109:11----------
I've talked about it but I haven't


---------109:12----------
really like yeah every time I about it I


---------109:14----------
push up I'm like yeah I have these


---------109:16----------
anxious things and it's really bad but


---------109:17----------
but like I can be I can still live my


---------109:19----------
life and I can still do things like so


---------109:21----------
maybe yes it's good that you recognize


---------109:23----------
that because as a doctor I can tell you


---------109:25----------
one of the most difficult things is


---------109:27----------
having a patient who has a problem that


---------109:29----------
they met


---------109:32----------
right so then like if they say like hey


---------109:34----------
sometimes I get anxious and I'm like oh


---------109:35----------
does it like how bad of a problem is it


---------109:37----------
you're like it's no big deal


---------109:38----------
and I'm like spider I really thank you


---------109:41----------
for that because I didn't think about


---------109:43----------
just like an epiphany I didn't even


---------109:45----------
think about it that way ever yeah what


---------109:47----------
are they supposed to do with that they


---------109:49----------
supposed to take it as are they supposed


---------109:50----------
to test your thyroid because you're kind


---------109:52----------
of saying it's not that big of a deal


---------109:53----------
right this anxiety have anything to do


---------109:58----------
with control sure wanting is that what


---------110:01----------
it's all about like wanting control


---------110:02----------
about oh no I don't think so but I think


---------110:04----------
that control is one of the foods for


---------110:08----------
anxiety that we talked about because if


---------110:11----------
you can control then you don't have to


---------110:13----------
worry but it doesn't deal with the


---------110:15----------
source of the word mm-hmm right so like


---------110:19----------
if you think about when you pull up the


---------110:20----------
cell phone even though you're not


---------110:21----------
controlling it's in the same vein as


---------110:24----------
controlling right like you're like


---------110:26----------
giving yourself order around your fear


---------110:29----------
to reduce your fear


---------110:34----------
and so do pecan people get better like


---------110:37----------
that sass stupid question of course they


---------110:40----------
can but like I can't even in my head


---------110:42----------
being so consciously aware of the


---------110:45----------
problem and like even being conscious of


---------110:47----------
like maybe even a solution to fix it


---------110:49----------
it's hard for me to go through that like


---------110:51----------
the gymnastics to say that's going to


---------110:54----------
get that's going to improve because I'm


---------110:55----------
conscious of certain things okay let's


---------110:58----------
talk about this for a second you said


---------111:00----------
that's a stupid question is it a stupid


---------111:04----------
question I guess not why not


---------111:11----------
I'm thinking that's in my head and I'm


---------111:14----------
thinking it good excellent great place


---------111:17----------
to start so now the question becomes why


---------111:19----------
are you thinking that because I feel


---------111:24----------
like if I'm aware of what's wrong I


---------111:28----------
should it shouldn't be a problem if I'm


---------111:30----------
aware of the problem why shouldn't why


---------111:32----------
should like why can't I fix it yeah so


---------111:35----------
beautiful so like I'm gonna phrase it a


---------111:37----------
different way I think that's a


---------111:37----------
manifestation of what I'm about to say


---------111:39----------
the reason it's not a stupid question is


---------111:41----------
because you have no experience of having


---------111:44----------
fixed yeah so why on earth would we


---------111:47----------
expect you to believe that something is


---------111:49----------
fixable if you flipped it your entire


---------111:50----------
life yeah it's like telling a deaf


---------111:53----------
person like oh yeah you can hear and


---------111:55----------
they're like that sounds dumb and so if


---------111:58----------
you've lived with anxiety your entire


---------112:00----------
life it's completely normal to feel


---------112:03----------
skeptical that this kind of change is


---------112:05----------
possible because like in your brain like


---------112:09----------
you've been conditioned to have anxiety


---------112:12----------
all the time and for it to be crippling


---------112:15----------
and you did your research on the


---------112:16----------
internet and you looked at this and you


---------112:17----------
looked at this and you looked at this


---------112:18----------
and you've been fighting against it for


---------112:20----------
decades and it's still there


---------112:22----------
and we want to call you irrational for


---------112:25----------
thinking it'll never go right nothing


---------112:29----------
man


---------112:29----------
it's completely rational and it happens


---------112:33----------
to be the case that you can't get rid of


---------112:35----------
it it's just I haven't taken those tiny


---------112:40----------
des take those steps I want to take


---------112:41----------
those steps sure cuz you know I'm sure


---------112:45----------
my audience sees it affects my people


---------112:50----------
call me you know I spent like one


---------112:52----------
specific example my professional life is


---------112:54----------
my tendency to be very almost too much


---------112:58----------
with the tos on Twitch because of


---------113:01----------
getting banned like I'm very very very


---------113:02----------
very very very aggressive in moderating


---------113:05----------
that and they see that but that's rooted


---------113:09----------
in my anxiety surrounding making sure


---------113:13----------
that the platform stays up you know up


---------113:17----------
and it doesn't go down or get banned or


---------113:20----------
whatever somebody doesn't say the wrong


---------113:21----------
thing or somebody doesn't get hurt by


---------113:23----------
what somebody says


---------113:25----------
it's all rooted in that which is as now


---------113:28----------
I've learned through this which is


---------113:29----------
rational but


---------113:33----------
it's so sorry it's so complicated but


---------113:35----------
like maybe


---------113:37----------
or maybe I overreact a lot uncertain


---------113:40----------
things so here's what I'd leave you with


---------113:42----------
Austin okay because I think we should


---------113:44----------
probably wrap up so the first thing is


---------113:46----------
that I want you to try to notice the for


---------113:49----------
lack of a better term it may not really


---------113:51----------
be the voice of your mom but notice the


---------113:52----------
voice of your mom as it's up so like in


---------113:55----------
that moment where you're like concerned


---------113:57----------
about TOS is that Austin speaking or is


---------114:00----------
that Austin's mom speaking and then the


---------114:03----------
next thing to do is if it's Austin's mom


---------114:07----------
then see if you can like just listen to


---------114:11----------
her words without doing anything about


---------114:14----------
it as best as you can just sit with that


---------114:17----------
fear and acknowledge to yourself that


---------114:19----------
like if you're on a plane and you're


---------114:20----------
like okay here we go again


---------114:23----------
this is the part of my mind that's gonna


---------114:25----------
activate and it's gonna be terrified


---------114:27----------
about all these things and if I open up


---------114:30----------
my cell phone and I look up things that


---------114:34----------
part of me is gonna feel better and now


---------114:36----------
this is where people start to jump to


---------114:38----------
conclusions and they say don't open up


---------114:40----------
the phone incorrect the most important


---------114:43----------
thing is that you see like okay can I


---------114:45----------
get away with not opening the phone or


---------114:47----------
does this part of me really need this


---------114:49----------
right now and if it really needs it like


---------114:53----------
you don't want to be an [ __ ] to that


---------114:55----------
part of you like


---------114:57----------
cuz there's a chance that there's a


---------114:58----------
six-year-old to whom something


---------114:59----------
catastrophic happened and now the


---------115:01----------
six-year-old is just paranoid because


---------115:02----------
they're afraid catastrophic things are


---------115:03----------
gonna happen we don't want to be an


---------115:05----------
[ __ ] to that six-year-old we got to


---------115:07----------
understand that sometimes the


---------115:08----------
six-year-old needs things that are a


---------115:09----------
little bit irrational and like aren't


---------115:11----------
great in the long term but sometimes


---------115:12----------
they just need what they need because


---------115:14----------
they're six and so as fast as you can


---------115:17----------
just play with that and sort of be like


---------115:19----------
okay can I get away with not doing this


---------115:21----------
or do I really need this and if you


---------115:23----------
really need it go ahead and do it and


---------115:24----------
then this becomes the important thing


---------115:26----------
watch what happens to the voice of your


---------115:29----------
mom see where it goes does it go away


---------115:32----------
does it feel better does it feel


---------115:34----------
relieved is she yelling at you about


---------115:37----------
helmets and then you put on your helmet


---------115:39----------
and then she kind of calms down and the


---------115:40----------
second take off your helmet again there


---------115:42----------
comes the yelling I put on my helmet I


---------115:45----------
went for a ride around the neighborhood


---------115:46----------
with my friends I came back and my my


---------115:49----------
helmet was off that's the jolt


---------115:51----------
that's the turbulence and then she comes


---------115:54----------
out of the house and she starts yelling


---------115:55----------
again she turns on and she turns off so


---------115:58----------
what happens when I do this start to


---------116:00----------
become familiar with that part of your


---------116:02----------
mind understand in what ways it works


---------116:04----------
and it what ways it does it and it's


---------116:07----------
through familiarity with who we are and


---------116:09----------
how we function that we gain control


---------116:11----------
over ourselves we're living a life where


---------116:14----------
we're blind to like who we are we don't


---------116:18----------
understand how we work and then we get


---------116:20----------
confused and we call ourselves


---------116:21----------
irrational we have invalidated herself


---------116:23----------
because it doesn't make sense because we


---------116:25----------
don't understand like no there's nothing


---------116:27----------
about you that is false like I don't


---------116:29----------
know how to say this but like reality is


---------116:30----------
real like you're real your thoughts are


---------116:32----------
real there are just thoughts they're not


---------116:34----------
facts they're not reality but they're


---------116:36----------
thoughts you're real you actually exist


---------116:38----------
this is a problem that you have


---------116:40----------
irrationality is just a lack of


---------116:42----------
understanding because nothing in the


---------116:44----------
world is rational like people thought


---------116:45----------
that you know like gravity and all this


---------116:48----------
kind of crap there's order everywhere


---------116:49----------
economics medicine physiology psychology


---------116:52----------
orders everywhere


---------116:54----------
nothing is rational and the the better


---------116:59----------
you understand that you were like a


---------117:01----------
human being and your mind can be


---------117:03----------
understood your anxiety can be


---------117:04----------
understood you just have to look at it


---------117:06----------
cuz you've never looked at it you're so


---------117:07----------
busy judging it and dismissing it you


---------117:08----------
got to look at it in that


---------117:11----------
zopi man because it's like it's like


---------117:14----------
you're trying to play league of legends


---------117:16----------
with a blindfold on and like you're just


---------117:17----------
getting bodied right and left like no


---------117:19----------
wonder look I would get bodied if I


---------117:23----------
played it at all but yeah yeah okay well


---------117:29----------
thank you very much for allowing me to


---------117:31----------
do this it's been a tremendous


---------117:32----------
experience thank you to your audience


---------117:35----------
and for listening it was sort of in the


---------117:37----------
beginning I was very anxious to say the


---------117:40----------
least to talk about it I feel very calm


---------117:42----------
now and collected yeah thank you very


---------117:45----------
much so one last thought so people I


---------117:48----------
sometimes let people slip away without


---------117:50----------
meditating do you met do you wanna learn


---------117:52----------
meditation are you interested in that do


---------117:53----------
you meditate I don't I'm open to


---------117:56----------
anything


---------117:58----------
did you nose clogged you have like


---------118:01----------
allergies yet I think I have allergies


---------118:04----------
and [ __ ] is there a booger that looking


---------118:06----------
at for the last no just just based on


---------118:08----------
your eye or by the Constitution I'm


---------118:09----------
assuming that it's gonna be hard for you


---------118:10----------
to do nasal breathing practices uh hold


---------118:13----------
on runny nose yeah yeah I think


---------118:17----------
allergies yeah yeah I can it looks like


---------118:22----------
allergies and anxiety are related by the


---------118:24----------
way and I really yeah if your seasonal


---------118:28----------
allergies as a kid it's just general


---------118:31----------
like a 2p kind of crap yeah like little


---------118:33----------
scratchy throat I lost my voice I don't


---------118:35----------
know what's going on there but yeah can


---------118:37----------
you edge with allergies huh you lose


---------118:40----------
your voice with allergies have a raspy


---------118:42----------
voice generally no but I think you just


---------118:45----------
got a topic stuff going on do you have


---------118:46----------
like eczema and stuff to like dry skin


---------118:48----------
oily skin like different parts of your


---------118:50----------
skin are all severe acne moderately


---------118:53----------
severe acne growing up so I tend on the


---------118:56----------
oily side but that was treated with yeah


---------119:00----------
accutane anyway so I'm thinking that


---------119:03----------
that maybe nasal practices aren't gonna


---------119:05----------
be great but we're still gonna have to


---------119:09----------
use the nose cuz you're okay breathe at


---------119:11----------
some point yep so let me just think how


---------119:13----------
do you feel about chanting we haven't


---------119:15----------
done chanting in a while chanting yeah


---------119:17----------
very anxiety-provoking huh uh yeah it


---------119:20----------
sounds it sounds scary but what it what


---------119:23----------
what is the yes


---------119:24----------
what is or is it so this is great so I'm


---------119:27----------
gonna show you we're gonna do ohm


---------119:29----------
Genting we haven't taught this in a


---------119:30----------
while so we'll do it


---------119:31----------
so ohm is composed of three syllables


---------119:35----------
ah-ooh and and so basically the way to


---------119:41----------
think about it is like if you start with


---------119:43----------
a completely open mouth let you cut out


---------119:48----------
actually


---------119:50----------
[Music]


---------119:57----------
do I stop no yeah so just go from like


---------120:01----------
open mouth to closed mouth right do you


---------120:02----------
see how it like that's the syllables Oh


---------120:06----------
sir I'm so sorry you keep coming out so


---------120:09----------
I don't know exist court discord does


---------120:11----------
this okay yes yeah it just keeps cutting


---------120:14----------
out so I'm just like ah yeah I think


---------120:18----------
that's right you're cutting out for me


---------120:21----------
too but okay so you know ah and then I


---------120:23----------
shut my mouth


---------120:24----------
you go ah then you go ooh and then you


---------120:27----------
go mmm and then you shut your mouth yeah


---------120:32----------
and then when you shut your mouth you go


---------120:34----------
mm-hmm okay


---------120:41----------
great yeah I think it's something with


---------120:43----------
like auto-detect voice algorithms with


---------120:45----------
discord that we can't hear you either so


---------120:47----------
but so I do that but how long do I go


---------120:51----------
I'm gonna demonstrate I'm gonna teach


---------120:52----------
you hold on let's start with this okay


---------120:56----------
because I'm I know is gay is okay so


---------120:59----------
we're gonna do hold on


---------121:02----------
voice activity let's do push-to-talk


---------121:07----------
okay I'm gonna hold on you can't hear me


---------121:10----------
anymore


---------121:12----------
so does this transmit better if I do


---------121:15----------
push-to-talk


---------121:16----------
let's try


---------121:20----------
[Music]


---------121:23----------
yes okay great


---------121:25----------
so I'm gonna demonstrate for you right


---------121:27----------
here you cuz your push-to-talk oh [ __ ]


---------121:29----------
okay so I'm gonna demonstrate so I'm


---------121:32----------
gonna show you one round okay so what I


---------121:34----------
want you to do is sit up straight take a


---------121:37----------
deep breath okay push-to-talk no no it's


---------121:42----------
okay I'll transmit cuz it's okay the


---------121:45----------
chat will follow me okay okay close my


---------121:48----------
eyes


---------121:48----------
yeah so I'm gonna demonstrate first okay


---------121:50----------
so I'm gonna demonstrate two rounds so


---------121:52----------
I'm gonna take a deep breath in


---------121:57----------
[Music]


---------122:09----------
and one more time okay and we'll talk


---------122:14----------
before we have you do it mm-hmm as I can


---------122:16----------
see you're anxious to never try you know


---------122:22----------
don't try not to be anxious the whole


---------122:24----------
point of this is that we want you to be


---------122:26----------
anxious I'll explain that in a second


---------122:28----------
one more one more observation okay


---------122:46----------
why do I feel compelled that like giggle


---------122:49----------
giggle I can't hear you sorry doctor


---------122:52----------
giggle like Vacon you're doing it


---------122:56----------
I laugh but I didn't want to be


---------122:58----------
disrespectful yes oh man as I know this


---------123:00----------
is like an actual thing didn't giggle oh


---------123:04----------
okay we're gonna do it again


---------123:05----------
what now that you say that now I'm not


---------123:07----------
gonna laugh so that's like no no just


---------123:10----------
giggle just see what happens


---------123:12----------
notice notice it within yourself and


---------123:14----------
just do whatever you want with it okay


---------123:15----------
we're gonna be one more time


---------123:16----------
you can giggle if you want to no big


---------123:18----------
deal yeah I don't I don't need you


---------123:20----------
probably cuz there you know let's see


---------123:21----------
okay ready


---------123:27----------
[Laughter]


---------123:34----------
[Music]


---------123:40----------
here go no see that's so you taught me


---------123:44----------
another thing is when when you can like


---------123:46----------
call out the fact that you have a


---------123:48----------
tendency to laugh on something that


---------123:49----------
maybe you shouldn't be laughing at and


---------123:51----------
that what's what was interesting is I


---------123:53----------
felt like I shouldn't be laughing at


---------123:55----------
that but I didn't find it funny it was


---------123:57----------
just that I was laughing at the fact


---------123:58----------
that I shouldn't laugh


---------123:59----------
is that weird yeah and then when we call


---------124:02----------
attention to it you gain awareness of it


---------124:04----------
and I tell you to giggle what happens to


---------124:06----------
your desire to giggle you be giggle


---------124:08----------
anymore that's what you need to do with


---------124:10----------
your anxiety just goes away if you look


---------124:13----------
at it it just goes away that's the whole


---------124:15----------
[ __ ] point okay so now we're gonna do


---------124:18----------
that with chanting and what I want you


---------124:21----------
to do is pay attention to your anxiety


---------124:25----------
because everyone else is gonna be


---------124:27----------
giggling at you got it right you see


---------124:30----------
that I might give it's gonna be silly


---------124:32----------
and they're gonna laugh at you awesome


---------124:35----------
because Austin is a silly boy okay okay


---------124:39----------
right and so notice that feeling in


---------124:41----------
yourself and then close your eyes and


---------124:44----------
what I want you to do is take a deep


---------124:45----------
breath in and I'll walk you through it


---------124:47----------
okay and then what I want you to do is


---------124:49----------
don't focus on the sound focus on their


---------124:53----------
necks good especially did it need to be


---------125:01----------
funny for you to laugh don't control it


---------125:03----------
don't dismiss it none of that okay okay


---------125:10----------
okay so notice it within yourself and


---------125:14----------
then when when you're chanting I don't


---------125:16----------
want you to focus on the sound focus on


---------125:18----------
the vibration I want you to pay


---------125:20----------
attention to where in your body do you


---------125:22----------
feel the sound okay okay it's fine smile


---------125:26----------
okay so close your eyes sit up straight


---------125:27----------
okay deep breath in


---------125:30----------
ah


---------125:42----------
[Music]


---------125:46----------
there it is okay good


---------125:49----------
we're gonna do it again eyes closed no


---------125:51----------
breaking character that's the only thing


---------125:53----------
okay you can giggle but no opening the


---------125:55----------
eyes okay just keep keep if I giggle


---------125:58----------
just like in a performance of any kind


---------126:00----------
you just go you move forward you just


---------126:02----------
yeah you just giggle but sit with your


---------126:04----------
giggling with your eyes closed


---------126:05----------
make giggling your meditation if that's


---------126:07----------
what happens okay so we're gonna do it


---------126:10----------
again so deep breath in


---------126:16----------
[Music]


---------126:26----------
good again deep


---------126:37----------
[Music]


---------126:45----------
look at the silliness for a second just


---------126:48----------
look at it


---------126:49----------
eyes closed its reopening silly again


---------126:54----------
third time


---------127:02----------
[Music]


---------127:11----------
okay it takes a little bit is that


---------127:13----------
normal that's fine we're gonna do three


---------127:15----------
more


---------127:16----------
no talking eyes closed no talking


---------127:19----------
giggling is allowed observing equaling


---------127:21----------
is allowed nothing else is allowed okay


---------127:23----------
three more in succession okay


---------127:25----------
so I'm just gonna do a breath chant


---------127:28----------
breath chant breath chant after the


---------127:31----------
third chant we're gonna just remain


---------127:33----------
silent no talking no opening your eyes


---------127:36----------
feel the person that you are when your


---------127:38----------
left over okay here we go


---------127:56----------
you


---------127:59----------
again


---------128:05----------
[Laughter]


---------128:13----------
[Music]


---------128:20----------
third one make it count


---------128:25----------
[Laughter]


---------128:34----------
[Music]


---------128:42----------
don't stop it just be


---------128:52----------
good eyes closed just feel it feel


---------128:55----------
yourself


---------129:03----------
you


---------129:05----------
we'll do this for about another 30


---------129:07----------
seconds okay


---------129:13----------
try to feel the residual sensation of


---------129:16----------
vibration


---------129:22----------
I don't want


---------129:29----------
you


---------129:41----------
and now we're going to take a couple of


---------129:42----------
deep breaths so I want you to breathe in


---------129:44----------
for three seconds and out for three


---------129:53----------
for three and out for five so slow it


---------129:58----------
down


---------130:02----------
and then in four three and out for seven


---------130:07----------
real slow


---------130:14----------
and when you're ready open your eyes


---------130:21----------
that was actually I feel very calm


---------130:28----------
when I was


---------130:31----------
was nervous in the beginning because I


---------130:33----------
was afraid that laughing was


---------130:35----------
inappropriate


---------130:38----------
and like it just feels very like I feel


---------130:40----------
very relaxed


---------130:43----------
what happened to the anxiety it's gone


---------130:47----------
for now but yes it's gone in this moment


---------130:50----------
yeah yeah but wasn't it there before we


---------130:53----------
started the practice yes when did it go


---------130:56----------
it went away after this was after like I


---------130:59----------
acknowledged through this process that


---------131:01----------
it was okay to laugh


---------131:03----------
in this moment I could giggle I could I


---------131:06----------
could chuckle it the fact that we were


---------131:08----------
going on and then I acknowledge that and


---------131:12----------
then is that is that the practice is


---------131:16----------
that literally is this is this something


---------131:18----------
that you find people giggling at all the


---------131:20----------
time or is it just like my personal


---------131:22----------
experience with it or maybe it's


---------131:25----------
irrelevant but yes that's the right


---------131:27----------
thing it's irrelevant okay because it


---------131:30----------
doesn't matter really it worked for me


---------131:32----------
so why would I care about it


---------131:33----------
yes Austen and and here's the thing so


---------131:36----------
there's a couple of really important


---------131:38----------
things about this practice what have you


---------131:40----------
cognitively been doing for the last two


---------131:42----------
hours


---------131:45----------
like what's what's that thing that you


---------131:47----------
catch yourself doing that I taught you


---------131:48----------
at the beginning um


---------131:50----------
I catch myself like trying to tell like


---------131:54----------
explain that like it's like it's not a


---------131:56----------
big problem


---------131:57----------
or things aren't a big problem or all


---------131:59----------
kinds of all kinds of restrictions of


---------132:01----------
who you are what you think and what you


---------132:04----------
feel


---------132:05----------
and there's that restriction with the


---------132:08----------
giggling if you can learn how to giggle


---------132:11----------
all of those restrictions are gonna go


---------132:13----------
away you can just be you


---------132:16----------
that's the whole [ __ ] point


---------132:19----------
people think like oh you shouldn't


---------132:21----------
laughter in meditation what do you guys


---------132:24----------
think the pointless laughing during


---------132:26----------
meditation is like the best outcome it's


---------132:30----------
not serious


---------132:31----------
like what are we doing this for


---------132:34----------
Island


---------132:36----------
bliss if you could laugh during


---------132:38----------
meditation when Zen masters become


---------132:40----------
enlightened the first thing that they do


---------132:41----------
is laugh so laugh let it out buddy just


---------132:47----------
let yourself like if it's silly like go


---------132:50----------
for it


---------132:51----------
silliness is irrational it's the nature


---------132:55----------
of irrationality so who the [ __ ] cares


---------132:57----------
embrace it laugh be at peace let


---------133:01----------
yourself be yourself thank you you're


---------133:06----------
welcome in that was you I really think


---------133:10----------
what you're doing is tremendous yeah


---------133:11----------
thank you you're welcome bro take care


---------133:14----------
of you take care of dr. K thank you so


---------133:17----------
much I guess


---------133:20----------
