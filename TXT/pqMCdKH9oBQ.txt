---------00:00----------
so for this person and everyone else out


---------00:02----------
there who's stuck trying to find a


---------00:03----------
career what i'd say is like think about


---------00:05----------
what you're passionate about first


---------00:07----------
and then try to figure out how can i


---------00:09----------
make this work as a job how can i get


---------00:11----------
compensated for doing this


---------00:13----------
how do i find a career when everything


---------00:15----------
in life is boring to me i've tried


---------00:17----------
college and self-study in the past but i


---------00:19----------
never finished anything i've switched


---------00:21----------
majors like eight times and i was still


---------00:23----------
unhappy i just can't see really see


---------00:25----------
myself doing anything to be honest in


---------00:27----------
the past ten years the only career


---------00:29----------
fields i've worked on have been


---------00:31----------
restaurants


---------00:32----------
and clinics working in the billing call


---------00:34----------
center departments i've hated them both


---------00:36----------
because both are dead end low paying


---------00:38----------
stressful and soul-crushing


---------00:41----------
i don't care about being super rich i


---------00:43----------
just want to find something that pays


---------00:45----------
decent and that also doesn't make me


---------00:47----------
want to kill myself by the end of the


---------00:48----------
week


---------00:49----------
this is something that i can absolutely


---------00:51----------
sympathize with empathize with


---------00:53----------
um you know i had a period of time in my


---------00:55----------
life when i was like


---------00:57----------
really felt like everything was sort of


---------00:59----------
a dead end and and nothing was really


---------01:01----------
working for me so let's take a look at


---------01:03----------
this because i think this is a really


---------01:04----------
common problem so nowadays a lot of


---------01:06----------
people


---------01:07----------
struggle to find a career and find


---------01:09----------
everything to be boring right so they're


---------01:12----------
like i tried this i found it boring i


---------01:14----------
tried this i found it boring like how do


---------01:15----------
i figure out like what kind of career to


---------01:17----------
have


---------01:19----------
so i want to talk to you all a little


---------01:20----------
bit about how we approach decision


---------01:22----------
making and how to find the right career


---------01:24----------
for you okay so the first thing


---------01:27----------
is that we have this idea that like we


---------01:30----------
need a career right and so like there's


---------01:33----------
we're sort of like taught like


---------01:35----------
societally that there is oh god so this


---------01:38----------
is a really common problem that people


---------01:40----------
have right they'll say like how do i


---------01:41----------
find the right career for me like i've


---------01:42----------
tried this i've tried this i did this


---------01:45----------
for a while


---------01:46----------
and um you know none of it really worked


---------01:49----------
i didn't enjoy it how do i find the


---------01:51----------
right career


---------01:52----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------01:54----------
we tend to think about


---------01:56----------
a career right we say to ourselves like


---------01:58----------
oh like i need a career of some kind


---------02:01----------
the other thing that tends to happen is


---------02:03----------
if we look at how people make decisions


---------02:05----------
it's basically like monkey see monkey do


---------02:08----------
so i remember i was working with a a you


---------02:10----------
know a young patient of mine who um had


---------02:13----------
started to use substances and so i was


---------02:14----------
his addiction psychiatrist and he had


---------02:16----------
gone to a 30-day rehab and he was trying


---------02:18----------
to figure out you know what to do with


---------02:19----------
his life and i you know i was kind of


---------02:21----------
asking okay so like what's your plan


---------02:22----------
going forward and he's like well you


---------02:24----------
know i've got a body that works at


---------02:26----------
an auto shop so i think he can hook me


---------02:28----------
up with a job


---------02:30----------
and so it was really interesting because


---------02:31----------
as i talked to him what i realized is


---------02:33----------
like the options that he was considering


---------02:36----------
are basically


---------02:37----------
exactly what's in front of him so we as


---------02:40----------
human beings tend to be like very monkey


---------02:42----------
see monkey do so like based on when we


---------02:45----------
think about the options for like what we


---------02:47----------
should do with ourselves


---------02:49----------
it tends to be based on things that are


---------02:51----------
immediately available like so i'm the


---------02:53----------
child of two doctors and i grew up in a


---------02:55----------
small town in east texas


---------02:57----------
where three out of five of the indian


---------03:00----------
kids in my class like in my grade there


---------03:02----------
were like five indian kids that were in


---------03:04----------
my grade in the entire city three of


---------03:06----------
them wound up becoming doctors so when i


---------03:09----------
was growing up and i went to college


---------03:10----------
like i majored in pre-med because that's


---------03:13----------
just what people


---------03:14----------
did


---------03:15----------
right


---------03:16----------
so when we look at decision making


---------03:19----------
what we tend to do is we don't actually


---------03:21----------
make like


---------03:22----------
objective decisions we don't really look


---------03:24----------
at all of the choices available to us we


---------03:27----------
tend to reach for the first thing that


---------03:29----------
is available to us


---------03:30----------
so like it's kind of weird because this


---------03:33----------
is there's a there's a good um


---------03:35----------
exploration of this kind of thing


---------03:37----------
in um who's that nobel prize-winning


---------03:39----------
economist daniel kahneman so i think he


---------03:41----------
sort of talks about this it's important


---------03:43----------
in medicine as well


---------03:45----------
where one of the things that doctors are


---------03:46----------
trained how to do is to not


---------03:49----------
make decisions based on the first thing


---------03:51----------
that pops into their head or the second


---------03:53----------
thing or the third thing or the fourth


---------03:54----------
thing so a lot of times doctors make


---------03:56----------
mistakes when they sort of rely on like


---------03:59----------
their first instinct to make a decision


---------04:02----------
and what we train doctors to do is


---------04:03----------
something called differential diagnosis


---------04:06----------
which is to think through all of the


---------04:08----------
possibilities before settling on one


---------04:12----------
so i see this a lot where people are


---------04:13----------
trying to figure out what should my


---------04:15----------
career be i've tried all this stuff i've


---------04:17----------
tried switching majors eight times and


---------04:20----------
it still hasn't worked what do i do so


---------04:22----------
i'd say the first thing to do is to take


---------04:24----------
a step back and to really think about


---------04:26----------
okay what are all of the possibilities


---------04:28----------
here construct a differential diagnosis


---------04:31----------
about how you can spend your time and


---------04:34----------
when someone says i can't figure out


---------04:36----------
what my career is i'd say that's


---------04:38----------
actually too narrow to begin with


---------04:40----------
because forget about a career like i you


---------04:42----------
know even a career is maybe not like is


---------04:45----------
the problem is that your mind is coming


---------04:48----------
up with solutions that are already so


---------04:50----------
narrow so if your problem is that i


---------04:52----------
don't i can't find a career i enjoy i


---------04:54----------
think part of that problem is because


---------04:56----------
your mind is narrowly chasing options


---------04:59----------
for a career and by doing so you may


---------05:02----------
actually miss out on all kinds of things


---------05:05----------
that you could earn like a livable wage


---------05:08----------
with but your mind won't even consider


---------05:10----------
them because you're locked into this


---------05:11----------
idea of career


---------05:13----------
because the problem is that when you


---------05:14----------
think about career right like then you


---------05:16----------
start thinking about things like call


---------05:18----------
center oh i can get a job at a call


---------05:19----------
center i can get a job at a billing


---------05:21----------
department i can get a job in food


---------05:23----------
service so you're reaching for the


---------05:25----------
simplest thing the most available thing


---------05:28----------
instead of considering all of your


---------05:30----------
options


---------05:31----------
so what i'd strongly recommend is take a


---------05:34----------
step back from the idea of a career


---------05:36----------
entirely even if we look at how we


---------05:38----------
started a healthy gamer like this is a


---------05:40----------
mental health startup that's relatively


---------05:42----------
successful right like we're doing some


---------05:44----------
good stuff we're helping some people


---------05:46----------
things like that i did not start out


---------05:50----------
like thinking i'mma create a mental


---------05:52----------
health startup and quit my job that is


---------05:53----------
really not what i cared about at all it


---------05:55----------
was like hey there's uh there's there's


---------05:57----------
like people who are really struggling in


---------05:59----------
a particular way and i'm gonna try to


---------06:01----------
help these people because it seems like


---------06:03----------
no one else is


---------06:04----------
and so when you're really thinking about


---------06:06----------
what you should do the first thing i do


---------06:08----------
is take a step back from the idea of


---------06:10----------
career


---------06:11----------
and so this person was kind of saying


---------06:13----------
everything that i've tried is boring


---------06:15----------
so then what i'd say is like take even a


---------06:17----------
further step back and ask yourself the


---------06:19----------
question if you're trying to find a


---------06:20----------
non-boring career start by asking


---------06:23----------
yourself what do you enjoy and forget


---------06:25----------
about the career right start to think


---------06:27----------
like okay what what was the was what's


---------06:29----------
something that i'm genuinely interested


---------06:30----------
in what's something that i enjoy doing


---------06:32----------
what's something that i you know really


---------06:34----------
like


---------06:35----------
kind of been passionate about when was


---------06:36----------
the last time that i really had a lot of


---------06:38----------
fun doing something


---------06:40----------
when was the last time i was


---------06:41----------
intellectually engaged what do i care


---------06:44----------
about what do i think i can do to make


---------06:46----------
the world like a better place like


---------06:48----------
what's some kind of problem in the world


---------06:50----------
that i would like to have an impact on


---------06:52----------
and you have to be kind of careful here


---------06:54----------
because your mind may go for more what


---------06:56----------
we call premature closure because it may


---------06:58----------
say oh i'm really passionate about


---------07:01----------
you know


---------07:02----------
like equal rights


---------07:04----------
but i have no qualifications okay and so


---------07:08----------
then then what your mind does is it'll


---------07:09----------
say oh that's not an option because i


---------07:11----------
have no qualifications that's a


---------07:13----------
premature closure too


---------07:15----------
um thinking about a career is also a


---------07:17----------
premature closure so what we want to do


---------07:19----------
is take a really big step back


---------07:21----------
and then start to think about what you


---------07:23----------
actually care about what you find


---------07:25----------
interesting


---------07:26----------
and then once you pick a couple of those


---------07:28----------
things then what we're gonna do is like


---------07:30----------
an investigation based on what you find


---------07:33----------
interesting


---------07:34----------
and what the purpose of an investigation


---------07:36----------
is a couple fold the first is like it's


---------07:38----------
really interesting because i don't know


---------07:39----------
if you guys know this but like there are


---------07:40----------
professional dms in new york city that


---------07:43----------
will charge like 400 a week to run like


---------07:46----------
a dm'ing session right and so you may


---------07:49----------
say to yourself like i never realized


---------07:50----------
that was a career i don't even know if


---------07:52----------
it is a career but what some people


---------07:54----------
discovered is that hey i'm really really


---------07:56----------
passionate about this and it does seem


---------07:58----------
like there's a lack of good dms so


---------08:00----------
there's actually like people who are


---------08:01----------
willing to pay like like 400 bucks a


---------08:04----------
week you've got like you know people who


---------08:06----------
are


---------08:06----------
you know maybe investment bankers or


---------08:08----------
whatever like in new york city there's


---------08:10----------
like five people in the group they're


---------08:12----------
all willing to chip in 80 bucks a week


---------08:13----------
and like that's their entertainment


---------08:14----------
budget because if you go out a single


---------08:16----------
night like you go to dinner and you get


---------08:18----------
drinks in new york city it's like 200


---------08:20----------
bucks at a minimum right so there's


---------08:22----------
actually like supply and there's demand


---------08:24----------
and like i've actually met some


---------08:25----------
professional dms and it's kind of


---------08:26----------
interesting


---------08:28----------
you may say to yourself oh i never


---------08:29----------
realized that was a career and like yeah


---------08:31----------
because we don't think about that as a


---------08:32----------
career right it's not something that


---------08:34----------
people around you are going to be


---------08:35----------
regularly doing but there are all kinds


---------08:37----------
of niche opportunities for you to make a


---------08:39----------
livable wage doing something that you


---------08:41----------
love


---------08:42----------
and the key thing to get into that kind


---------08:44----------
of thinking is to step out of the idea


---------08:47----------
of a career so i'd say start with


---------08:49----------
something like thinking about what do


---------08:51----------
you actually enjoy what do you care


---------08:52----------
about what do you like find interesting


---------08:55----------
and then what you want to do is start to


---------08:57----------
think a little bit about okay like i'm


---------08:59----------
how can i pursue this how can i make


---------09:00----------
this work and then something really


---------09:02----------
fascinating will happen so let's say


---------09:04----------
that you're interested in like you know


---------09:07----------
equal rights or whatever like


---------09:09----------
then the interesting thing is you may


---------09:10----------
not have any skill set


---------09:12----------
but as you start to like move towards


---------09:15----------
something that you genuinely care about


---------09:17----------
the ability to do things that you don't


---------09:20----------
enjoy will become far more tolerable so


---------09:23----------
the problem right now is that we have a


---------09:24----------
group of people who like go to school


---------09:26----------
and they have no end game in mind


---------09:28----------
they're not going to school for a


---------09:30----------
particular reason that they're


---------09:31----------
passionate about this is something in


---------09:33----------
addiction psychiatry that we call a


---------09:35----------
competing interest so this is a really


---------09:37----------
important principle


---------09:39----------
if you want to do something that's very


---------09:41----------
very difficult


---------09:42----------
you have to have a competing interest so


---------09:45----------
an addiction psychiatry if you want to


---------09:47----------
get someone to quit smoking smoking


---------09:49----------
offers a strong biological reward it


---------09:52----------
offers dopamine it offers nicotine it


---------09:54----------
offers socialization it helps calm you


---------09:56----------
down it's an easy way to meet people so


---------09:59----------
smoking has all of these advantages and


---------10:02----------
it turns out that if you want to get


---------10:03----------
someone to quit smoking you can't just


---------10:05----------
give them information and say hey you're


---------10:07----------
going to get heart disease you're going


---------10:08----------
to get lung cancer you'll get bad you


---------10:10----------
know complications of covid all of that


---------10:12----------
information doesn't actually affect


---------10:15----------
behavior what affects behavior is a


---------10:17----------
competing interest something that you


---------10:18----------
care about and once you develop a


---------10:20----------
competing interest so you know my


---------10:22----------
favorite thing in terms of working with


---------10:24----------
smokers is i'll ask them like what do


---------10:25----------
they care about right what do they think


---------10:27----------
is interesting


---------10:28----------
and so i had you know one patient and


---------10:30----------
this is sort of the example that i use


---------10:33----------
so i had one patient who was a smoker


---------10:35----------
and i tried to explain and this is early


---------10:36----------
on in my career and so i tried to


---------10:38----------
explain to them i was like okay if you


---------10:40----------
if you smoke you're gonna get lung


---------10:41----------
cancer do you want lung cancer and he's


---------10:43----------
like no i don't want lung cancer comes


---------10:45----------
in a month later i'm like how's your


---------10:46----------
smoking going is oh i'm still smoking


---------10:47----------
i'm like okay you'll also get heart


---------10:49----------
disease you'll get stroke comes in a


---------10:51----------
month later


---------10:52----------
and he's like still smoking right


---------10:54----------
so then finally i get to like talk to


---------10:55----------
the guy and i get to know him and then


---------10:57----------
like it turns out that he's got a


---------10:58----------
daughter and he's like really happy and


---------11:00----------
like he's you know he likes his daughter


---------11:01----------
a lot and then you know i even try this


---------11:04----------
sort of thing where it's sort of like


---------11:05----------
hey like you know if you want to stay


---------11:07----------
alive and healthy for your daughter like


---------11:09----------
you know maybe you should quit smoking


---------11:10----------
he's like yeah that sounds really


---------11:11----------
important but he still continues to


---------11:12----------
smoke so one day we talk a little bit


---------11:14----------
about oh you know would you like to walk


---------11:16----------
your daughter down the aisle one day and


---------11:18----------
he's like yeah absolutely and then i


---------11:19----------
asked him you know when you walk your


---------11:21----------
daughter down the aisle do you want to


---------11:22----------
be wheeling an oxygen tank behind you


---------11:25----------
and then he's


---------11:26----------
like no


---------11:29----------
right so like he's got this vision he's


---------11:30----------
working really hard he's like trying to


---------11:32----------
be a good parent he wants to like


---------11:35----------
like be there for his daughter and then


---------11:37----------
it's about finding something that they


---------11:38----------
care about and once you develop that


---------11:41----------
competing interest


---------11:42----------
that competing interest that thing that


---------11:44----------
you care about then becomes enough to


---------11:47----------
overcome all of the biology all of the


---------11:49----------
dopamine all of the nicotine all of the


---------11:52----------
the you know social aspects of smoking


---------11:54----------
and then over the next like six to eight


---------11:56----------
months he actually like quit smoking


---------11:58----------
and it's all about developing a


---------12:00----------
competing interest and the problem right


---------12:01----------
now that i see is that a lot of people


---------12:03----------
like find a career because it's logical


---------12:05----------
it's good on paper but that logical


---------12:08----------
advantage of like oh i should do this


---------12:10----------
and should do this is not enough to


---------12:12----------
actually overcome


---------12:14----------
the suffering that you have to go


---------12:15----------
through for the career


---------12:17----------
so as you think about what you actually


---------12:19----------
care about and then you enroll in a


---------12:21----------
school with a purpose and then even


---------12:24----------
though you don't want to take statistics


---------12:26----------
even though you don't want to take you


---------12:28----------
know philosophy or like intro to


---------12:30----------
chemistry


---------12:31----------
once you have a good competing interest


---------12:33----------
and you're like hey this is something


---------12:34----------
that i actually care about i want to


---------12:36----------
learn this and this


---------12:38----------
this is what i'm passionate about and


---------12:40----------
then what you do is you align your


---------12:42----------
career behind your passions right


---------12:45----------
it's not how do i find a career that i


---------12:48----------
can enjoy and like your passions are


---------12:50----------
sitting over here you start by like


---------12:52----------
thinking about what you care about what


---------12:54----------
you enjoy and then you try to do like a


---------12:57----------
very systematic process of making it


---------12:59----------
work


---------13:00----------
so i'd say like if we go back to this


---------13:01----------
reddit post we can kind of see it pretty


---------13:03----------
clearly that like you know i want you


---------13:05----------
all to pay attention to this how do i


---------13:06----------
find a career when everything in life is


---------13:08----------
boring to me i don't think everything in


---------13:09----------
life is boring


---------13:10----------
right what we see is that i've tried


---------13:12----------
college and self-study but i never


---------13:13----------
finished anything i keep on switching


---------13:16----------
majors and i'm still unhappy so the real


---------13:18----------
question that this person should be


---------13:19----------
asking is what are you attracted to what


---------13:22----------
do you gravitate towards what do you


---------13:24----------
care about what do you genuinely enjoy


---------13:26----------
doing


---------13:27----------
and then be careful because your mind


---------13:28----------
may tell you oh you can't do that


---------13:30----------
because x y z


---------13:32----------
and the cool thing is that when your


---------13:34----------
mind tells you you can't do that because


---------13:36----------
xyz


---------13:37----------
that is actually going to be like your


---------13:40----------
solution


---------13:41----------
so as your mind tells you you can't do


---------13:43----------
that because you haven't graduated from


---------13:45----------
college then you know what you need to


---------13:46----------
do you need to graduate from college


---------13:48----------
well you can't graduate from college


---------13:49----------
until you get into college okay so then


---------13:51----------
it sounds like what we need to do is get


---------13:53----------
into college you can't get into college


---------13:54----------
without applying to college okay then it


---------13:56----------
sounds like i need to write an


---------13:57----------
application and the cool thing is then


---------13:59----------
when you write your college application


---------14:01----------
and you write your college essay if you


---------14:03----------
have that end goal in mind like when you


---------14:06----------
look at your essay it's going to be like


---------14:07----------
why do you want to go to college i want


---------14:08----------
to go to college because i'm interested


---------14:10----------
in supporting equal rights and


---------14:12----------
developing countries i want to go to


---------14:14----------
college because i'm interested in


---------14:15----------
esports i want to study creative writing


---------14:18----------
because i want to be a professional dm


---------14:20----------
and i want formal training and sort of


---------14:22----------
constructing adventures and storytelling


---------14:24----------
like


---------14:25----------
colleges love


---------14:27----------
seeing unorthodox candidates that have


---------14:30----------
like interesting ideas about what they


---------14:32----------
want to do


---------14:33----------
right it's really fascinating and what i


---------14:35----------
found time and time and time again is


---------14:37----------
that people who are able to do this


---------14:39----------
process of taking a step back really


---------14:41----------
think about what you enjoy doing think


---------14:44----------
about what you're passionate about and


---------14:46----------
then if you have to make some sacrifices


---------14:48----------
along the way to get to where you want


---------14:50----------
to go it works out really really well


---------14:53----------
so for this person and everyone else out


---------14:55----------
there who's stuck trying to find a


---------14:56----------
career what i'd say is like think about


---------14:58----------
what you're passionate about first


---------15:00----------
and then try to figure out how can i


---------15:02----------
make this work as a job how can i get


---------15:04----------
compensated for doing this


---------15:06----------
and like literally it was like i enjoy


---------15:08----------
talking to gamers all day like that's


---------15:10----------
what i like doing i like helping people


---------15:11----------
with their problems so one way that i


---------15:14----------
was able to turn that into a career is


---------15:16----------
by going to medical school and becoming


---------15:17----------
a psychiatrist but then i was also like


---------15:19----------
you know that's not insufficient for me


---------15:21----------
i actually like vibing with chat so what


---------15:24----------
are we gonna do i guess maybe i'll start


---------15:25----------
streaming on twitch and like i don't


---------15:28----------
know if y'all get this but like i just


---------15:29----------
started streaming on twitch one day


---------15:30----------
right like i had like 10 people who were


---------15:33----------
viewers and then we had like 15 and then


---------15:35----------
we had 50 and then we had 200 we were


---------15:37----------
like sitting around 200 viewers for a


---------15:39----------
couple of weeks and if you're passionate


---------15:41----------
about something and you kind of give it


---------15:42----------
your all and you try really hard it


---------15:44----------
turns out that i think the world will


---------15:46----------
kind of respond to you like pretty well


---------15:48----------
and that's why we have professional dms


---------15:50----------
we've got people who are like hey i


---------15:51----------
really love dming and like that's their


---------15:53----------
job now so what if he doesn't know what


---------15:55----------
he enjoys doing or he lost interest in


---------15:57----------
everything he used to love like me so


---------15:59----------
that's a great question so then the


---------16:01----------
question becomes how did you lose


---------16:03----------
interest right because that passion is


---------16:05----------
there it's just buried and so then well


---------16:08----------
i think we'll have a couple of other


---------16:10----------
posts today that that may relate to that


---------16:12----------
but like


---------16:13----------
interest is something that is not like


---------16:16----------
gained or lost i think it tends to be


---------16:18----------
buried or not buried


---------16:20----------
so a case in point like i had kova the


---------16:22----------
last two weeks so like all of the things


---------16:24----------
that i was passionate about and


---------16:25----------
interested in i didn't care about


---------16:28----------
right like when you've got covid you


---------16:30----------
just don't care about anything you're


---------16:31----------
kind of an hedonic


---------16:33----------
even playing video games and stuff would


---------16:34----------
like not be fun so then there's like a


---------16:37----------
there's a process of sort of uncovering


---------16:39----------
what you enjoy what you love like where


---------16:41----------
did you lose sight of it what made you


---------16:44----------
lose sight of it there also all kinds of


---------16:46----------
like physical things that you can do


---------16:47----------
right you can take care of your body and


---------16:49----------
then your interest will naturally grow


---------16:51----------
so you can do stuff like yoga meditation


---------16:53----------
eating healthy food like all that kind


---------16:55----------
of stuff is going to be good for you you


---------16:57----------
know if you go see your doctor you know


---------16:58----------
get your vitamin d levels checked


---------17:01----------
get um you know there are all kinds of


---------17:03----------
biological things that can result in a


---------17:05----------
lack of motivation so you can kind of


---------17:07----------
work on some of those things


---------17:10----------
and remember that just because you've


---------17:11----------
lost your interest doesn't mean that you


---------17:13----------
can't find it again you have to really


---------17:14----------
figure out how it got buried
