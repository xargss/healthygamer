---------00:00----------
i want to talk to you guys for a second


---------00:02----------
about


---------00:03----------
fighting yesterday's battles and


---------00:05----------
insecurity


---------00:08----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------00:09----------
like


---------00:11----------
you know be careful about what makes you


---------00:15----------
feel good and what makes you feel bad


---------00:18----------
because a lot of times we have hunger


---------00:21----------
and that hunger is to like


---------00:22----------
right or wrong from like yesterday


---------00:26----------
or a decade ago or two decades ago


---------00:29----------
right it's an insecurity that's born


---------00:31----------
like when we're young


---------00:33----------
and then what happens is we carry that


---------00:35----------
insecurity we like feel a particular way


---------00:37----------
about ourselves right like we're not


---------00:38----------
attractive or we're not worth loving or


---------00:41----------
we're stupid or we're smart which can


---------00:44----------
also be an insecurity


---------00:46----------
and then what happens is like we want to


---------00:48----------
we do everything we can to reassure


---------00:50----------
ourselves


---------00:51----------
that that insecurity is false right so


---------00:54----------
if you're


---------00:55----------
if you think you're smart and you're


---------00:56----------
insecure about your intelligence


---------00:58----------
then you won't ever really apply


---------01:00----------
yourself


---------01:01----------
because you'd rather half asset and get


---------01:04----------
a c


---------01:05----------
then do your best and get a b and so you


---------01:08----------
look for reassurance around that


---------01:10----------
insecurity


---------01:11----------
if you're in a relationship for example


---------01:13----------
like you need to hear other people tell


---------01:14----------
you hey like


---------01:16----------
do you really love me and so you seek


---------01:18----------
reassurance and there's that hunger


---------01:20----------
right like you want other people to tell


---------01:22----------
you


---------01:22----------
that yeah you're worth being with you're


---------01:24----------
awesome you're beautiful


---------01:26----------
or you run around on the internet and


---------01:29----------
you


---------01:29----------
you know talk about how smart you are in


---------01:31----------
theoretical physics because you want


---------01:33----------
other people to appreciate your


---------01:34----------
intelligence


---------01:35----------
you need that appreciation and so the


---------01:38----------
tricky thing about insecurity is it's


---------01:40----------
like a hunger inside you that needs to


---------01:42----------
be fed from the outside


---------01:44----------
and so you go outside you look for i'm


---------01:46----------
going to get it fed over here i'm going


---------01:47----------
to get fed over here


---------01:48----------
i'm going to flex on these guys i'm


---------01:49----------
going to stomp these noobs


---------01:51----------
i'm going to show everyone


---------01:54----------
and the crazy thing is that the things


---------01:56----------
that you need to show


---------01:57----------
everyone are the things that you don't


---------01:59----------
believe about yourself


---------02:01----------
you're looking to solve that insecurity


---------02:03----------
on the outside


---------02:05----------
you're looking for their responses


---------02:08----------
to show you that the insecurity is false


---------02:11----------
because you believe it yourself


---------02:13----------
but you're afraid that it's true so you


---------02:15----------
go to other people and the problem is


---------02:17----------
that kind of hunger can be satisfied for


---------02:19----------
a time by reassurance


---------02:22----------
but it's like a band-aid because the


---------02:23----------
insecurity comes from within


---------02:25----------
and so anything that you do from the


---------02:27----------
outside is not gonna fix it


---------02:29----------
and that's what we see right like the


---------02:31----------
person who needs to be reassured in a


---------02:32----------
relationship needs to be reassured the


---------02:34----------
next day and the person who thinks


---------02:36----------
they're really smart and flexes on these


---------02:38----------
noobs


---------02:39----------
has to flex on some other noobs tomorrow


---------02:41----------
because the internet is not like those


---------02:43----------
people don't flex on like egotistical


---------02:45----------
people on the internet aren't


---------02:46----------
egotistical one day


---------02:48----------
and then they disappear no they live on


---------02:50----------
the internet for their entire lives and


---------02:51----------
they're


---------02:52----------
they're flexing on everyone as much as


---------02:54----------
they can because they believe


---------02:56----------
something about themselves that they


---------02:57----------
don't want to be true


---------02:59----------
so the crazy thing is like how do you


---------03:00----------
deal with that and the first thing is


---------03:02----------
stop feeding it from the outside


---------03:04----------
because here's the crazy thing when you


---------03:06----------
have an insecurity and you feed it from


---------03:08----------
the outside


---------03:10----------
what happens to things that you feed


---------03:12----------
they grow


---------03:14----------
and so each time you seek that


---------03:16----------
reassurance you're gonna need more


---------03:18----------
of it the next time and you're gonna


---------03:19----------
need more of it the next time


---------03:21----------
and the more you rely on outside things


---------03:24----------
the more i know this sounds


---------03:26----------
crazy the more you become dependent


---------03:29----------
on those outside things you need those


---------03:32----------
outside signals that's what you rely on


---------03:35----------
to feel good about yourself and then you


---------03:38----------
wind up with these kinds of


---------03:39----------
situations where you feel wonderful one


---------03:41----------
day and you feel like crap another day


---------03:43----------
and what's the difference it's how


---------03:45----------
you're treated by the outside world


---------03:47----------
your happiness is not dependent on


---------03:50----------
yourself it's dependent on other people


---------03:53----------
and so then what you do is you sign away


---------03:55----------
the rights to control your life to the


---------03:57----------
outside world


---------03:58----------
and then you're not in control


---------04:01----------
life is taking you wherever it wants to


---------04:04----------
take you you feel powerless other people


---------04:06----------
make you feel a particular way


---------04:08----------
you're a victim to their feelings and


---------04:09----------
their whims


---------04:11----------
so what do you do what do you do about


---------04:13----------
this


---------04:15----------
it's hard but you start by going to the


---------04:18----------
source of the insecurity and recognize


---------04:20----------
that


---------04:20----------
if you're confident if your confidence


---------04:22----------
in yourself is lacking the only place


---------04:24----------
it's going to come from is within


---------04:26----------
if you're insecure about your appearance


---------04:28----------
no amount of reassurance by the outside


---------04:30----------
world is going to make that go away


---------04:33----------
if you're insecure about your capability


---------04:36----------
about your worth about your value


---------04:39----------
no amount of the outside world is going


---------04:41----------
to be able to teach that to you


---------04:44----------
so what you've got to do is sit with it


---------04:46----------
right so like look at yourself in the


---------04:47----------
mirror and then like


---------04:48----------
look at yourself and this be like okay


---------04:50----------
where is where is the ugliness and you


---------04:53----------
may see it


---------04:54----------
you may see it right away you look at


---------04:55----------
yourself in the mirror you'll be like oh


---------04:56----------
my god


---------04:57----------
this guy's hideous and then notice how


---------05:00----------
you feel and sit with that feeling and


---------05:02----------
tolerate it tolerate the hunger


---------05:05----------
tolerate it sit with it


---------05:08----------
and then something magical will happen


---------05:11----------
it's going to be a waiting game


---------05:13----------
it's going to try to feed thoughts into


---------05:14----------
your head


---------05:16----------
be careful don't give in to those


---------05:18----------
thoughts put your focus on something


---------05:20----------
else


---------05:21----------
so go and find like a candle


---------05:24----------
and then like look at so what i want you


---------05:26----------
to do is place a mirror


---------05:28----------
and place a candle in front of the


---------05:29----------
mirror and then look at the


---------05:31----------
look at your reflection in the mirror


---------05:32----------
and then look at the candle


---------05:34----------
and then look at the candle and put your


---------05:36----------
entire attention on the candle


---------05:39----------
and then notice that as your attention


---------05:41----------
goes onto the candle


---------05:42----------
the hunger within you the thoughts of


---------05:44----------
judgment of your own appearance


---------05:46----------
will begin to subside and then you step


---------05:49----------
back into the arena you look at your


---------05:51----------
reflection again


---------05:52----------
and notice all of those thoughts come up


---------05:55----------
and then turn your attention to the


---------05:56----------
candle and with each of those moments


---------06:01----------
the hunger will start to subside it'll


---------06:04----------
start to melt away because you're not


---------06:05----------
feeding it


---------06:06----------
and if you do that practice enough the


---------06:08----------
insecurity will dis


---------06:09----------
will dissolve with it all you guys have


---------06:11----------
to do is stop feeding it


---------06:13----------
bring it up face the hunger and stop


---------06:15----------
feeding it


---------06:17----------
you can even do with food if you have a


---------06:18----------
temptation with food watch what happens


---------06:20----------
to your desire


---------06:21----------
get some kind of food or get a coke or


---------06:23----------
whatever you kind of struggle with and


---------06:25----------
look at it


---------06:26----------
notice your desire come up and then turn


---------06:28----------
your attention to something else


---------06:30----------
and then look at the thing again notice


---------06:32----------
it come up and turn your attention to


---------06:34----------
something else


---------06:35----------
and eventually learn how to tolerate


---------06:39----------
the bad feelings on the inside and as


---------06:42----------
you learn how to tolerate them as you


---------06:44----------
learn how to


---------06:45----------
sit with them you will start to accept


---------06:47----------
them and they'll start to dissolve


---------06:49----------
and the insecurity will dissolve with it


---------06:52----------
so stop fighting yesterday's battles


---------06:55----------
today because that's what we see a lot


---------06:57----------
of


---------06:58----------
right everyone else made fun of you so


---------07:00----------
now you've got to show the rest of the


---------07:01----------
world how awesome you are


---------07:03----------
it's yesterday's battles it's not


---------07:05----------
today's


---------07:06----------
and it ends up creating all kinds of


---------07:08----------
these like weird problems in your life


---------07:10----------
because


---------07:11----------
you start to be treat people in a way


---------07:13----------
that's kind of bizarre


---------07:14----------
and is like dependent on how you felt


---------07:16----------
some time ago


---------07:17----------
so stop fighting yesterday's battles


---------07:19----------
today and the second thing is


---------07:20----------
stop fighting internal battles on the


---------07:22----------
outside


---------07:24----------
if you have an insecurity nothing in the


---------07:26----------
outside world is going to take that away


---------07:27----------
that's a battle that has to be fought


---------07:28----------
in here so if you want to do that that's


---------07:31----------
how you deal with insecurity


---------07:33----------
in terms of meditation practice i


---------07:35----------
actually encourage you guys to do what i


---------07:37----------
just said


---------07:38----------
so to actually take a candle and go and


---------07:41----------
sit


---------07:42----------
in front of a mirror and look at


---------07:44----------
yourself in the mirror and see what you


---------07:46----------
think about yourself


---------07:47----------
and then look at the candle and then


---------07:49----------
look at the mirror


---------07:51----------
let those thoughts come up and tolerate


---------07:53----------
sit with the person that you are


---------07:55----------
because you're not a bad person but it's


---------07:58----------
when you refuse to hang out with


---------08:00----------
yourself and you distract yourself with


---------08:02----------
alcohol or video games or whatever


---------08:05----------
that you start to like slip away be with


---------08:08----------
yourself


---------08:09----------
see who you are because i guarantee you


---------08:12----------
that


---------08:12----------
it's not nearly as bad as you think it


---------08:14----------
is if you guys need a little bit of help


---------08:17----------
with this kind of stuff


---------08:19----------
that's what we made our coaching program


---------08:21----------
for right because


---------08:22----------
people want time with dr k but


---------08:24----------
unfortunately i'm a little bit busy and


---------08:26----------
i can't reach everyone


---------08:27----------
the good news i know this sounds crazy


---------08:29----------
but it turns out that if you look at


---------08:31----------
outcomes the coaches tend to do


---------08:34----------
as well as i do in terms of actually


---------08:36----------
improving people's lives


---------08:37----------
i'm not saying that you're going to have


---------08:39----------
an emotional catharsis within the first


---------08:41----------
session that's probably not gonna happen


---------08:43----------
but people do have emotional catharsis


---------08:45----------
through our coaching program pretty


---------08:47----------
consistently it's just


---------08:48----------
the coaches work a little bit slower


---------08:50----------
than i do but at the end of


---------08:51----------
eight twelve or sixteen weeks we tend to


---------08:54----------
actually


---------08:54----------
help our clients the same amount so


---------08:56----------
they're basically as good as i am


---------08:58----------
so if you guys need help with that


---------09:00----------
that's why we started the coaching


---------09:01----------
program


---------09:02----------
and we're building additional things for


---------09:05----------
you guys


---------09:06----------
more stuff like what we're doing
