---------00:00----------
hi hey what's going on


---------00:04----------
good to meet you good to meet you too


---------00:08----------
um yeah where do i start um


---------00:11----------
you can call me flo perfect bro uh


---------00:17----------
we've talked before i was on one of your


---------00:20----------
um


---------00:20----------
porn addiction streams a while back ah


---------00:23----------
good to see you again thank you good to


---------00:26----------
speak to you again


---------00:27----------
um so my age is 22


---------00:31----------
and i'm a software engineer in germany


---------00:34----------
and my question was how do i tell my


---------00:37----------
parents


---------00:38----------
that i was suicidal as a kid and


---------00:42----------
that i'm currently fighting depression


---------00:45----------
basically without hurting them or


---------00:47----------
blaming them


---------00:48----------
for like


---------00:51----------
what happened to me um


---------00:55----------
do you blame them for what happened to


---------00:57----------
you


---------01:01----------
i think that yeah a part of my


---------01:04----------
how i was brought up definitely plays a


---------01:06----------
role in it


---------01:08----------
like yeah i i blame them


---------01:12----------
i mean like i see them as flawed people


---------01:15----------
but i think some of their actions


---------01:19----------
yeah make me who i am i think


---------01:22----------
if that makes sense so


---------01:26----------
okay if you want i can


---------01:30----------
give you like a background


---------01:38----------
okay so uh i i do want a background but


---------01:41----------
just in a moment are you watching stream


---------01:44----------
uh i closed it good give me just one


---------01:48----------
moment


---------01:48----------
okay sure okay so why don't you tell me


---------01:52----------
a little bit


---------01:53----------
about um


---------01:57----------
you know what so help me understand a


---------01:59----------
little bit about


---------02:00----------
your you wanna um you wanna talk to your


---------02:04----------
family about


---------02:06----------
you want to share you want to tell your


---------02:08----------
parents that you're suicidal and you're


---------02:10----------
depressed


---------02:11----------
right and you're having difficult but


---------02:14----------
you want to share it in a way that


---------02:16----------
prevents them from


---------02:19----------
feeling blamed yes


---------02:24----------
so


---------02:28----------
yeah so tell me a little bit more so


---------02:32----------
basically um so my family situation


---------02:37----------
parents are still together um i have a


---------02:40----------
sister


---------02:41----------
an older one and um


---------02:46----------
my parents weren't really like an


---------02:48----------
emotional support


---------02:49----------
when i grew up so they were like really


---------02:52----------
distant we never talked about how we


---------02:53----------
felt


---------02:54----------
um and


---------02:58----------
they would usually like show their life


---------03:00----------
through like financial support


---------03:02----------
okay and um


---------03:07----------
like my mom is like pretty dominant and


---------03:10----------
actually thinks like um that people


---------03:13----------
that go and do therapy are basically


---------03:16----------
crazy


---------03:17----------
and um that it's pretty uncommon to


---------03:20----------
go to therapy so she has like a bias a


---------03:24----------
strong wise about that


---------03:25----------
and my dad is like a lot more


---------03:27----------
approachable but


---------03:29----------
very passive and


---------03:32----------
basically i never shared


---------03:36----------
that i am in therapy with them or that i


---------03:39----------
was depressed


---------03:42----------
because i'm afraid of their reaction and


---------03:46----------
um they


---------03:50----------
found out a while ago that my sister


---------03:53----------
is in therapy and their reaction was


---------03:56----------
kind of scary as well


---------03:57----------
like first of all they're really


---------03:58----------
confused what


---------04:01----------
happened to her or why she


---------04:05----------
is in therapy because she's so distant


---------04:08----------
that she


---------04:09----------
doesn't want to talk about it and


---------04:15----------
now i feel like this might be the right


---------04:17----------
time to open up to them


---------04:19----------
and although we never talk about


---------04:22----------
emotions like


---------04:24----------
um


---------04:27----------
yeah just just kind of i kind of want


---------04:29----------
want some relief


---------04:30----------
from being able to tell them how i


---------04:33----------
really feel if they ask me


---------04:35----------
like like we we meet from time to times


---------04:38----------
we don't live together anymore


---------04:40----------
and if they ask me how i'm doing i'm not


---------04:42----------
telling them if i had like a really bad


---------04:44----------
day


---------04:45----------
for example so and why don't you tell


---------04:48----------
them that you have a bad day


---------04:52----------
um because it would usually lead into


---------04:56----------
i had like lots of anxiety today and


---------05:00----------
i'm working on xyz


---------05:03----------
through my therapy and then i would just


---------05:05----------
open up like the whole


---------05:07----------
thing so what i'm hearing is that you um


---------05:10----------
and by the way just to clarify are we


---------05:12----------
showing your face or not


---------05:14----------
because i know you're on a video call i


---------05:18----------
however you want i don't i don't mind


---------05:21----------
okay let me just go to


---------05:22----------
our interview screen then okay so


---------05:25----------
um so are we


---------05:28----------
showing faces


---------05:32----------
someone else joined the channel but i


---------05:33----------
don't know uh


---------05:35----------
wait can they hear the ping i'm sorry


---------05:38----------
yeah that they can't it's okay though i


---------05:40----------
i mean i guess i have the notification


---------05:42----------
on it's okay


---------05:43----------
um so flo let's just think a little bit


---------05:46----------
about so on the one hand


---------05:48----------
this is what i'm hearing the first thing


---------05:49----------
is that you've been struggling with some


---------05:51----------
of these issues of


---------05:52----------
depression and suicidality for a while


---------05:55----------
it sounds like your parents won't be


---------05:56----------
very


---------05:57----------
open to hearing that and so what i'm


---------06:00----------
hearing


---------06:00----------
is that you're essentially carrying this


---------06:02----------
burden kind of on your own


---------06:04----------
and it's not that you expect your


---------06:06----------
parents to really fix it for you but


---------06:07----------
that


---------06:08----------
you're afraid of their judgment um and


---------06:11----------
and i think that you know the people


---------06:13----------
that we love we just


---------06:14----------
you know we want them to support us


---------06:17----------
you know even if it's not like in a big


---------06:18----------
way like at least emotionally i mean you


---------06:20----------
want to tell


---------06:21----------
your parents what you're going through


---------06:23----------
but you're afraid of how they're going


---------06:24----------
to react so you're not


---------06:26----------
and this is where things get really


---------06:27----------
tricky because like not only are you


---------06:29----------
trying to


---------06:30----------
you know avoid their judgment that but


---------06:32----------
there's also a part of you that is


---------06:34----------
um you know afraid that


---------06:40----------
they did have some role in it and that


---------06:43----------
they won't


---------06:43----------
respond very well to like that idea


---------06:47----------
is what i'm hearing so in a weird way


---------06:50----------
um you know they're you're almost kind


---------06:53----------
of protecting them by keeping it from


---------06:55----------
them


---------06:56----------
but you're carrying an extra heavy


---------06:57----------
burden because of that in a weird way


---------06:59----------
does that make sense


---------07:01----------
yes that that yeah applies


---------07:04----------
so so let me so there


---------07:08----------
so there are a couple of principles at


---------07:10----------
play here but first i'm going to just


---------07:11----------
answer your question and then i'm going


---------07:13----------
to share one or two principles okay so i


---------07:16----------
think the way that you tell them


---------07:17----------
is just like that so you just say mom


---------07:20----------
dad i just you know there's some there's


---------07:21----------
a part of my life that i haven't really


---------07:23----------
shared with you very much because i've


---------07:25----------
been afraid of your judgment


---------07:27----------
and you know i was suicidal when i was


---------07:29----------
younger and i've been struggling with


---------07:31----------
depression


---------07:31----------
a lot like my sister for a couple of


---------07:34----------
years now


---------07:35----------
and i just wanted y'all to know now


---------07:38----------
there are a couple of important pieces


---------07:40----------
there so one is like your expectation


---------07:42----------
about the conversation is going to be a


---------07:44----------
lot of your suffering


---------07:47----------
okay so you know who your parents are


---------07:50----------
and it can be sad but


---------07:51----------
try to let go of that expectation and


---------07:54----------
you know i do think that it is possible


---------07:56----------
to get to a place where your parents can


---------07:58----------
support you


---------08:00----------
and i think the most important part is


---------08:02----------
the next part


---------08:03----------
which is that the first conversation


---------08:05----------
shouldn't be one where you're sharing a


---------08:07----------
lot of information it should be one


---------08:08----------
where you're asking a few questions


---------08:10----------
if you can manage it and i would start


---------08:13----------
with the question


---------08:14----------
what's your understanding of what


---------08:16----------
depression is


---------08:20----------
like when i say that i was suicidal and


---------08:22----------
i've been depressed for years like what


---------08:23----------
does that mean to you


---------08:26----------
and listen to what they have to say


---------08:31----------
and be aware that you know part of their


---------08:33----------
defensiveness may be a sense of blame


---------08:35----------
like they may be like blaming themselves


---------08:37----------
and their ego arises in response to that


---------08:40----------
so like i know it's really hard but i


---------08:42----------
don't know that they're gonna be in a


---------08:43----------
place to listen it just sort of depends


---------08:45----------
but if you're wondering how you have


---------08:46----------
that first conversation


---------08:48----------
i think being honest about it being


---------08:51----------
simple like it's like one or two


---------08:52----------
sentences it's not a whole lot of


---------08:54----------
explanation


---------08:54----------
it's not a whole lot of excuses it's not


---------08:56----------
a whole lot of it's not your fault where


---------08:58----------
really they do have something


---------08:59----------
like you know you can you can get down


---------09:01----------
that that road later


---------09:03----------
um but i'd say you know two or three


---------09:05----------
sentences and then what does that mean


---------09:07----------
to you


---------09:08----------
and then really listen to them


---------09:11----------
um how does that sound um


---------09:15----------
yeah i think um it sounds good


---------09:18----------
it sounds like a like i didn't think


---------09:21----------
about


---------09:23----------
um kind of asking


---------09:28----------
them for their understanding of what i'm


---------09:30----------
going through so


---------09:31----------
but i yeah


---------09:35----------
like you you um said something about


---------09:37----------
expectation


---------09:38----------
which is like my expectation right now


---------09:41----------
is that


---------09:41----------
they really don't know


---------09:44----------
what depression really is like they


---------09:48----------
have like


---------09:51----------
not a lot of knowledge about mental


---------09:53----------
health in general


---------09:55----------
so that's and i got that impression as


---------09:58----------
well from


---------09:59----------
seeing their reaction to finding out


---------10:02----------
that my sister


---------10:03----------
is in therapy so


---------10:06----------
yeah so i gotta let go of the


---------10:07----------
expectation yeah so but let's talk about


---------10:09----------
the expectation for a second what do you


---------10:11----------
um what do you feel like


---------10:16----------
how does it how do you feel knowing that


---------10:18----------
they're not going to respond to you


---------10:21----------
or imagining they won't respond to you


---------10:23----------
with like support


---------10:27----------
that's really hard um


---------10:31----------
it kind of adds to the general sense i


---------10:33----------
have when i'm with my parents which is


---------10:36----------
lots of times like feeling worthless so


---------10:40----------
it's like


---------10:44----------
such a big step to tell them about it


---------10:46----------
and if they


---------10:47----------
don't care then or they


---------10:52----------
like i i know that my mom for a fact


---------10:54----------
will tell me that


---------10:55----------
there's probably something wrong with me


---------10:57----------
and i am


---------10:59----------
i have caused my suffering which is


---------11:02----------
true to some extent but um


---------11:06----------
kind of not what you want to hear in


---------11:07----------
that situation so it's um


---------11:11----------
yep yeah it's just it's just um


---------11:15----------
i feel really sad right now thinking


---------11:16----------
about it


---------11:18----------
because it's like they don't care yep i


---------11:21----------
i i know exactly how you feel man


---------11:24----------
um i think it can be really really


---------11:27----------
challenging


---------11:29----------
um and so what we're going to try to do


---------11:32----------
is


---------11:33----------
like so this is where flo i think so it


---------11:36----------
sounds like you do have a therapist


---------11:37----------
right


---------11:39----------
yes okay so i think you know you should


---------11:41----------
definitely lean on them


---------11:42----------
but i i think there are a couple things


---------11:44----------
that i i want to kind of share with you


---------11:46----------
one is that


---------11:48----------
you know so it's that attitude so


---------11:49----------
somewhere along the way


---------11:51----------
you were sort of taught that you're to


---------11:54----------
blame


---------11:56----------
yeah right so so if we look at it's i'm


---------11:58----------
gonna just take a step back and


---------12:00----------
explain something so sigmund freud um


---------12:04----------
conceptualized depression as anger


---------12:06----------
turned against the self


---------12:09----------
and so you blame yourself for everything


---------12:12----------
like


---------12:13----------
you know your mom and like if we think


---------12:14----------
about where did you learn how to blame


---------12:16----------
yourself like unfortunately a lot of


---------12:18----------
times we learn from our parents


---------12:20----------
and sorry yeah go ahead


---------12:23----------
um i i was on like the


---------12:26----------
um the healthy gamer coaching


---------12:30----------
like the free coaching for a while and


---------12:32----------
it's something that i talked to adam


---------12:34----------
about a lot


---------12:35----------
and he he actually asked me like what


---------12:37----------
did your


---------12:38----------
parents tell you that


---------12:42----------
could lead to the self of like self


---------12:45----------
worth that you have right now


---------12:46----------
and something they always told me was


---------12:49----------
basically since growing up


---------12:53----------
like when you were born we had to move


---------12:56----------
out of our bedroom in order to make


---------12:58----------
plays for you


---------13:00----------
and like this is not your bedroom it's


---------13:03----------
ours but we made space for you so i was


---------13:06----------
kind of already blame


---------13:07----------
blamed for being born because i was


---------13:10----------
always


---------13:12----------
it was already a burden for them because


---------13:14----------
they had to leave their room


---------13:15----------
so yeah yeah that's that's


---------13:19----------
it does go deep and and what i'm hearing


---------13:21----------
is that even in this conversation


---------13:24----------
you're taking over a part of their


---------13:26----------
peaceful mental household too


---------13:30----------
they have this beautiful house built in


---------13:31----------
their head of what their what their life


---------13:33----------
is like and what their children's life


---------13:35----------
is like


---------13:35----------
and it's pretty imperfect and you know


---------13:38----------
you're occupying the space that you're


---------13:40----------
supposed to occupy


---------13:42----------
and by telling them this what you're


---------13:44----------
gonna do is


---------13:45----------
move into their spare bedroom that


---------13:48----------
wasn't the life that they


---------13:49----------
built right and how does it feel


---------13:52----------
to go


---------13:56----------
take space that isn't yours


---------14:02----------
um she's really bad


---------14:06----------
yeah um right so what i want you to


---------14:10----------
understand so now comes


---------14:11----------
the good part but also the hard part is


---------14:15----------
that flow these


---------14:17----------
these thoughts that you have are like


---------14:19----------
they're like a


---------14:20----------
parrot that is just repeating what it's


---------14:23----------
heard


---------14:24----------
right these are your parents thoughts


---------14:25----------
they're not actually a measure of your


---------14:27----------
value like they're not


---------14:29----------
you know they're not true they're just


---------14:30----------
like echoes


---------14:32----------
and so i think that that process and


---------14:34----------
this is where you know if we want to be


---------14:36----------
a little bit


---------14:38----------
forgiving so i think one way to move


---------14:41----------
forward here is to forgive


---------14:43----------
but in order to forgive you have to


---------14:45----------
blame them first


---------14:47----------
right and this is where the tricky part


---------14:48----------
comes in whereas like if you can never


---------14:50----------
move past it if it's not like if you


---------14:51----------
don't blame them


---------14:52----------
you can't forgive them because i


---------14:55----------
certainly did a number on you i think


---------14:56----------
everyone's aware of that


---------14:58----------
yeah and and so i'm not saying you have


---------15:00----------
to forgive them right away but i think


---------15:02----------
that like you know if you say they don't


---------15:03----------
understand mental health and stuff like


---------15:04----------
understand that


---------15:05----------
their response to you sure there's


---------15:08----------
some stuff that you know we can blame


---------15:10----------
them for but some of that is like they


---------15:11----------
may just not understand mental health


---------15:13----------
and so i think the first conversation is


---------15:15----------
sort of like a conversation about hey


---------15:17----------
here's what i'm going through


---------15:19----------
what's your understanding of it because


---------15:22----------
in your mind


---------15:23----------
a lot of the fears that you have are


---------15:25----------
fair a lot of the blame that you have is


---------15:27----------
fair


---------15:28----------
a lot of the ways that they make you


---------15:29----------
feel like you don't belong here


---------15:32----------
right so i'm imagining that you're


---------15:33----------
pulling them into a conversation where


---------15:35----------
they don't want to be


---------15:36----------
and you're kind of inconveniencing them


---------15:38----------
by having it


---------15:40----------
so there's all of that which is like a


---------15:43----------
some scar and then there's also the


---------15:44----------
mental health stigma


---------15:46----------
which is actually has nothing to do with


---------15:47----------
you and nothing to do with them it's


---------15:48----------
just if they haven't learned it


---------15:50----------
and so you're gonna fight be fighting


---------15:52----------
two battles one is sort of a more


---------15:53----------
traditional one and one is like this


---------15:55----------
mental health stigma battle


---------15:56----------
and this is where i i encourage you to


---------15:59----------
you know lean on your therapist


---------16:00----------
lean on us welcome back it's good to see


---------16:03----------
you again


---------16:04----------
thank you um and and you know we're


---------16:06----------
we're here to help you and you have a


---------16:08----------
lot of people


---------16:09----------
in your life who do care about you who


---------16:10----------
want you to be here


---------16:12----------
who enjoy seeing you um i love to see


---------16:15----------
you again i think it's fantastic that


---------16:17----------
you're back


---------16:18----------
um you know i wish you know at some


---------16:20----------
point i'd like to talk about happier


---------16:22----------
things but i'm i'm more than happy to


---------16:23----------
talk about this right now because


---------16:25----------
we meet people where they're at right


---------16:28----------
and what you've got to do is meet peop


---------16:29----------
meet your parents where they're at


---------16:34----------
that's hard man i'm sorry


---------16:38----------
yeah it's um yeah i just i just really


---------16:41----------
hope that i


---------16:42----------
i'll feel at least some relief


---------16:46----------
so my hope is that the relief that


---------16:47----------
you're gonna feel is one of like


---------16:50----------
detachment where you can't really


---------16:51----------
control the people that they are


---------16:54----------
you can just take the first step of the


---------16:56----------
journey like


---------16:57----------
you just because the journey isn't gonna


---------16:59----------
wind up where you want it to go


---------17:01----------
doesn't mean that you shouldn't take


---------17:02----------
that first step


---------17:05----------
and what i want you to do is take that


---------17:06----------
first step and like


---------17:09----------
you know it's going to be a step in the


---------17:10----------
right direction it may not go the way


---------17:11----------
that you want to


---------17:12----------
and you hopefully still have you know


---------17:15----------
years


---------17:16----------
if not a decade or two to get to a place


---------17:19----------
where you're you know you can educate


---------17:20----------
your parents and they can support you


---------17:22----------
and hopefully you can kind of come out


---------17:24----------
of that depression a little bit and


---------17:25----------
explain to them


---------17:29----------
so take take the first step even though
