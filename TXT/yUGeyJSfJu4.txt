---------00:20----------

---------00:22----------
no it's fine well I'm never I'm so


---------00:27----------
nervous


---------00:28----------
yeah me too mmm what are you what what


---------00:31----------
what are you nervous about um I don't


---------00:36----------
know like I often talk about like house


---------00:40----------
like topics that we might talk about


---------00:43----------
today but I never talk with someone on


---------00:45----------
stream about them does it make sense


---------00:47----------
yeah sure thanks oh and one of the


---------00:49----------
topics that we might talk about today Oh


---------00:53----------
could be anything from mental health to


---------00:57----------
anxiety to traumas to I don't I don't


---------01:01----------
know like I've seen clips of yours and


---------01:02----------
usually those are like the topics so I'm


---------01:04----------
expecting those what do you want to talk


---------01:07----------
about um what do I want to talk about


---------01:12----------
well okay can you maybe talk about what


---------01:16----------
you usually do in stream like how the


---------01:17----------
process of it okay sure okay the process


---------01:21----------
of so okay so stream usually starts I


---------01:23----------
try to start on time mm-hmm like at 12


---------01:28----------
or 12:01 or 1202 and then usually the


---------01:33----------
first 5 to 10 minutes involves me trying


---------01:36----------
to fix a technical difficulty because


---------01:37----------
I'm a Boomer and I tell you what Jade I


---------01:41----------
literally do not understand this like I


---------01:43----------
swear to god there's some kind of curse


---------01:45----------
like I'm not that incompetent because


---------01:48----------
the thing that I don't understand so I


---------01:49----------
have a computer you know I have a


---------01:51----------
microphone and every time I turn on the


---------01:55----------
computer like the desktop is the same


---------01:57----------
every time I load a video game it's not


---------01:59----------
like my mouth stops working so my


---------02:01----------
understanding is that if I open stream


---------02:03----------
labs and it's configured and I haven't


---------02:05----------
touched anything it should work the


---------02:06----------
exact same way as it did the day before


---------02:08----------
all right


---------02:09----------
like I have this microphone and this


---------02:12----------
microphone is the same [ __ ]


---------02:13----------
microphone that I've been using for like


---------02:15----------
two months and then today I log on and


---------02:18----------
it's like staticky and I do not


---------02:20----------
understand how that works so I spend the


---------02:22----------
first 10 minutes trying to figure out


---------02:24----------
why the [ __ ] I'm so incompetent and


---------02:28----------
twitch at usually you know enjoys that


---------02:33----------
and or we have some fun with it and then


---------02:37----------
I give a little disclaimer I have some


---------02:39----------
kind of spiel where I usually like so


---------02:41----------
I'm an academic mm-hmm and so I tend to


---------02:44----------
like to hear myself talk


---------02:47----------
so I usually talk at my audience for


---------02:50----------
about 15 to 20 minutes about what's on


---------02:52----------
my mind and then we have an interview


---------02:54----------
with a human being and then I ask the


---------02:57----------
human being if there's some way that I


---------02:59----------
can be helpful and I have a background


---------03:02----------
in you know so I studied for a monk to


---------03:05----------
become a monk for about seven years a


---------03:07----------
monk yeah oh that's interesting yeah


---------03:12----------
that's cool and then I met my wife and


---------03:15----------
so things got confusing I mean I met her


---------03:19----------
so so you know I met her actually three


---------03:24----------
months three months in of the seven


---------03:26----------
years I met my wife and then was


---------03:28----------
thinking was planning on becoming a monk


---------03:30----------
and so studied a lot of like yoga and


---------03:31----------
meditation and spirituality and stuff


---------03:33----------
and then she is a wonderful person but


---------03:37----------
also wanted to be married to a doctor so


---------03:39----------
I decided to go to medical school and


---------03:42----------
then no way yeah kind of


---------03:46----------
and so then you know I I did


---------03:51----------
neuroscience research for a couple of


---------03:52----------
years and then studied like basically


---------03:54----------
the brain psychology and medicine for


---------03:56----------
another eight years and then now I show


---------04:00----------
up on stream and I talked to a human and


---------04:02----------
then I try to use anything from that 15


---------04:05----------
years that I've learned to try to help


---------04:07----------
them with any kind of problem that


---------04:09----------
they're having okay that's cool like


---------04:14----------
super interesting like everything


---------04:18----------
together sounds like you should write a


---------04:20----------
book


---------04:20----------
maybe one day I'll make someone write a


---------04:22----------
book for you I mean it's worth it yeah I


---------04:26----------
get it


---------04:27----------
oh yeah sure I try to write I'm trying


---------04:30----------
to write like five books no that's great


---------04:33----------
a biographical but yeah I'm glad you


---------04:38----------
found my story interesting can you tell


---------04:40----------
me about yourself mmm okay I'm Jay's I


---------04:44----------
grew up in Germany


---------04:46----------
Bona raised him lived for two years in


---------04:49----------
Thailand but now I'm back


---------04:50----------
due to Corona I wanted to be with my


---------04:52----------
family and I started streaming on Twitch


---------04:56----------
around two years ago okay but I really


---------05:00----------
got like into the community since


---------05:03----------
December before that I just did my own


---------05:05----------
thing I wasn't really associated with


---------05:06----------
any other streamers and what I stream is


---------05:11----------
basically mainly just chatting if I have


---------05:13----------
a PC like right now I try to game and


---------05:17----------
yeah I just do just chatting and and


---------05:21----------
when you say you you weren't really a


---------05:22----------
part of the community and until December


---------05:24----------
what is that how does one become a part


---------05:27----------
of the community what does that mean oh


---------05:29----------
I would say like not community but like


---------05:31----------
associated with other streamers like


---------05:33----------
before that I didn't know any other


---------05:34----------
streamers I didn't extra filly any


---------05:36----------
streamers and in December around that


---------05:38----------
time period


---------05:40----------
I got to know other streamers and that's


---------05:42----------
how I slowly got into the hole and I'm


---------05:46----------
stuck the lifestream fail hole yeah tell


---------05:54----------
me about the livestream fail hole oh it


---------05:57----------
starts usually like with one two clips


---------06:00----------
that are like really funny and then


---------06:02----------
people want to see more and then there's


---------06:04----------
more clips out of context that are not


---------06:06----------
as funny that are just really drama


---------06:10----------
creating clips and then you kind of


---------06:13----------
stuck there because all your clips keep


---------06:15----------
being posted there you can't do anything


---------06:17----------
against it really so and how does that


---------06:19----------
feel I feel helpless because I contacted


---------06:24----------
the mods of the reddit the subreddit but


---------06:27----------
they don't care obviously cuz clips and


---------06:30----------
use and abuse clips of use I mean


---------06:33----------
upwards downwards like that's all the


---------06:34----------
matters not how the people actually feel


---------06:36----------
why do you always post it there mmm


---------06:39----------
guess there's


---------06:40----------
people eventually end up on my stream


---------06:42----------
and it's hard to like stream and then


---------06:45----------
seeing all the negativity in the other I


---------06:47----------
must say from reddit specifically I got


---------06:49----------
a bunch of viewers who are really nice


---------06:52----------
just though they're of you individuals


---------06:54----------
who make it hard for me too mmm and this


---------07:00----------
is what we do by the way yeah I noticed


---------07:02----------
I see you what you do it's like the


---------07:05----------
things they write in chat I really heard


---------07:07----------
full cuz I mean I can't blamed and they


---------07:09----------
see one thing about me they don't know


---------07:11----------
anything about me and then they'll


---------07:13----------
direct accordingly to what I say okay so


---------07:17----------
yeah and what what are they what is the


---------07:20----------
slice of you or the thing that's taken


---------07:22----------
out of context that they react to it's


---------07:26----------
mostly and only very sexual the things I


---------07:30----------
say thank you really random sexual


---------07:35----------
things


---------07:36----------
like I don't say random the sexual


---------07:38----------
things that are taken out of yeah yes


---------07:41----------
yes you say random sexual things that


---------07:44----------
are taken out of context and I mean it's


---------07:48----------
altogether like something sexual but


---------07:49----------
they did take like one part of it I see


---------07:51----------
and like which looks they're really


---------07:54----------
really bad and I can't like I mean it


---------07:56----------
does but yeah I can't really defend


---------08:00----------
myself here what it is sorry about that


---------08:11----------
no okay so and and so is theirs so it


---------08:16----------
sounds like it's pretty stressful for


---------08:17----------
people to you know for people to take


---------08:21----------
things that you say out of context it


---------08:23----------
does sound like you talk about sex or


---------08:25----------
sexuality in some form on your stream


---------08:28----------
mm-hmm okay


---------08:29----------
and that gets taken out of context and


---------08:31----------
then it's kind of stressful because


---------08:33----------
you're trying to fight against a false


---------08:36----------
perception of yourself right I mean I


---------08:39----------
don't want to fight against the fact


---------08:41----------
that I am like always horny or like


---------08:44----------
somewhat perverted it's just to make it


---------08:46----------
the way they make it always seem like is


---------08:48----------
that I say they made me say those things


---------08:54----------
um okay maybe I should throw in


---------08:56----------
something I'm hyper sexual which is


---------08:58----------
something that I've been since 2016 what


---------09:02----------
does that mean dude Edie I had a sexual


---------09:06----------
trauma like sexual violence against me


---------09:10----------
and since then in order to cope with


---------09:12----------
that I started to become sexual in order


---------09:14----------
to normalize what happened to me back


---------09:16----------
then and now it became like a


---------09:18----------
unfortunately became of a trade of mine


---------09:21----------
like being always sexual I'm talking to


---------09:25----------
Lube do I make sense yeah you make


---------09:28----------
perfect sense I'm just trying to okay


---------09:30----------
although what you're saying is good I'm


---------09:32----------
not sure if I follow what I say no Jayde


---------09:35----------
let me just tell you another thing that


---------09:36----------
I do sometimes I like I will just not


---------09:38----------
say anything because I'm processing and


---------09:40----------
then I may actually ask you for time to


---------09:42----------
think about what I say and that is also


---------09:45----------
a meme mm-hmm we're all just people like


---------09:48----------
can I just think for a second okay come


---------09:50----------
but but you can keep going so you were


---------09:53----------
saying that you had a sexual trauma that


---------09:54----------
happened when in 2016


---------09:56----------
do you mind if I ask I know generally


---------09:58----------
speaking it's an impolite question to


---------10:00----------
ask so you don't have to answer it but


---------10:01----------
can you tell me like ballpark how it


---------10:03----------
will do you are I was 16


---------10:05----------
you were 16 so you're 20 now yes okay


---------10:10----------
that's very young too okay okay


---------10:14----------
hmm so what is happening okay


---------10:25----------
okay sorry someone is remote desktop


---------10:29----------
again maybe they need to fix something


---------10:33----------
that I'm not aware of but okay sorry


---------10:36----------
about that so you were saying you are


---------10:37----------
you were so you're hyper sexual as a


---------10:41----------
result of sexual trauma mm-hmm yes and


---------10:46----------
so what do you mean by what is hyper


---------10:49----------
sexual mean and oh god okay so basically


---------10:56----------
to simplify it it's just my thoughts and


---------10:59----------
fantasies my thoughts and sexual


---------11:01----------
fantasies hold me back in life like I


---------11:05----------
sabotage myself because I act


---------11:07----------
impulsively on my sexual needs and my


---------11:11----------
thoughts are usually most of time to


---------11:14----------
always on sex and well what comes with


---------11:20----------
it and it's something I tried to get rid


---------11:23----------
of really because sometimes I have it at


---------11:24----------
the most inappropriate moments like at


---------11:26----------
the funeral which is really bad it's


---------11:29----------
just I can't get rid of it's like my


---------11:30----------
mind is stuck and I really try because


---------11:33----------
I've noticed that me being like that


---------11:34----------
makes people uncomfortable and yeah I'm


---------11:38----------
really working on that too


---------11:41----------
okay so let me ask you have you seen a


---------11:44----------
mental health professional like a


---------11:46----------
psychiatrist or therapist


---------11:48----------
yeah I've seen six seven with I was


---------11:52----------
actually meant at the mental asylum


---------11:54----------
mental asylum mental hospital the roof


---------11:57----------
that is seven because it was but it was


---------11:59----------
more than one specialist but I'd taken


---------12:01----------
one category so seven okay and so you've


---------12:05----------
seen seven while you were in the


---------12:07----------
hospital or like you're talking about


---------12:09----------
before now no no like six altogether and


---------12:11----------
like when I was in the hospital like


---------12:13----------
that time I take us number seven in


---------12:15----------
there was more than one yeah and so six


---------12:19----------
therapists have they been helpful have


---------12:23----------
any of them been helpful one one was


---------12:26----------
helpful there are they made it worse


---------12:29----------
that one person was helpful I don't know


---------12:33----------
like them way they put them a lot of


---------12:34----------
things in my mind I didn't think about


---------12:36----------
beforehand wish


---------12:38----------
me worry more and more okay like but the


---------12:43----------
one that helped me was the one who was


---------12:44----------
to say straightforward he was like an


---------12:47----------
[ __ ]


---------12:48----------
he was straightforward he didn't care


---------12:49----------
about my Felix and that's exactly what I


---------12:50----------
needed and he said basically if you


---------12:53----------
forget back then I was a I I was in the


---------12:57----------
asylum because I tried to take my life


---------12:59----------
not assign imma keep saying asylum


---------13:01----------
mental hospital and he basically said so


---------13:04----------
you don't want to be here anymore and me


---------13:06----------
back then super dramatic no and he said


---------13:08----------
then


---------13:09----------
so how would she like the idea of you


---------13:11----------
being buried and your siblings would be


---------13:14----------
around your grave and that like that


---------13:16----------
image made me realize that I don't want


---------13:19----------
to die yeah it was tough I was there


---------13:21----------
seventeen my arms were open and I was


---------13:25----------
just really blank and I had only one


---------13:27----------
thought which was I want I don't want to


---------13:29----------
be here anymore


---------13:29----------
and then after he said that I just I


---------13:32----------
realized I can't do this I can't leave


---------13:35----------
them behind so do you remember why you


---------13:39----------
didn't want to be alive yeah yes I do


---------13:45----------
it's yeah that's why I'm here like I am


---------13:49----------
in general I'm always comfortable about


---------13:51----------
talking anything and everything because


---------13:53----------
I hope by me being open about it that


---------13:55----------
someone will see it and eventually open


---------13:56----------
up


---------13:57----------
I had a depression since I've been 8 and


---------14:01----------
I always had like this constant sadness


---------14:04----------
like like this in order to how I says


---------14:09----------
every time I was sad I thought it would


---------14:12----------
better to hurt myself because the pain


---------14:14----------
would be better than the feelings I feel


---------14:17----------
and I was always the sadness wherever I


---------14:19----------
would be and then bad fix it happened


---------14:22----------
like in 2016 or when I was younger like


---------14:24----------
all together those felt so heavy and I


---------14:26----------
felt like a burden because I could see


---------14:28----------
my parents always worried they always


---------14:31----------
had this worry in their eyes like when


---------14:33----------
they asked me somethings how are they


---------14:34----------
they say how are they like how are you


---------14:36----------
but in my case every time I felt like


---------14:37----------
when they asked me how I am


---------14:38----------
it was more like checking like am i


---------14:40----------
stable am i mentally ok and I just


---------14:43----------
really felt like a burden constantly so


---------14:45----------
some point I felt like let's just get it


---------14:48----------
over with and do you just feel like a


---------14:51----------
burden


---------14:53----------
not as much sometimes


---------14:56----------
emotionally I feel like a burden to them


---------14:58----------
but not like like me I earn my own money


---------15:00----------
I am in that way I'm independent but


---------15:03----------
like emotionally I do you think that I


---------15:05----------
weighed them down sometimes and yeah


---------15:09----------
it's I don't know it's like when parents


---------15:14----------
hide from their children that they cry


---------15:16----------
because I don't want them to feel


---------15:17----------
worried that's how I feel like now I


---------15:18----------
don't want the emotion around them


---------15:20----------
anymore cause I'm afraid that they will


---------15:23----------
worry again Jim I think for a second


---------15:42----------
turn off my marker because someone is


---------15:46----------
it's distracting so they're trying to I


---------15:50----------
think fix something but let me just


---------15:52----------
think the the therapist who was helpful


---------15:59----------
was the one that you saw when you were


---------16:01----------
in the hospital no that was the one


---------16:04----------
after the hospital and why did you stop


---------16:07----------
seeing them because I felt I don't want


---------16:13----------
a long-term thing I want someone who


---------16:14----------
helps me like for a couple of months and


---------16:16----------
then I'm done


---------16:17----------
like I back then I was just really edgy


---------16:20----------
like oh I just want to party like what's


---------16:22----------
the point of going every Wednesday there


---------16:24----------
and after you said I felt like okay I


---------16:26----------
don't need him anymore I don't want to


---------16:27----------
die anymore


---------16:28----------
so I was like okay I'm done but that was


---------16:31----------
just what do you think wish me what I


---------16:35----------
need yeah fundamentally there is nothing


---------16:41----------
really I need it's just always like in


---------16:43----------
moments like where you once like someone


---------16:45----------
to cry on her shoulder like a hug like


---------16:47----------
simple things like this in moments what


---------16:49----------
I needed but like right now no I don't


---------16:53----------
need anything maybe if I do


---------16:59----------
but right now I wouldn't know what to


---------17:01----------
say to be honest because there's nothing


---------17:02----------
really right now my mind I need that


---------17:04----------
yeah so I think that's a problem it is


---------17:07----------
yes so I'm gonna just toss this out so I


---------17:11----------
think what I'm hearing from you is that


---------17:13----------
your perception of your needs depend on


---------17:17----------
individual states of mind hmm but I I


---------17:22----------
think you need something how can I say


---------17:28----------
this I think you need something right


---------17:33----------
now because I I don't get the sense that


---------17:35----------
you're well mm-hmm right so you may be


---------17:39----------
functional and you may actually be like


---------17:42----------
80 percent healthy or 90 percent healthy


---------17:44----------
but it still sounds like you have a


---------17:46----------
particular function of your mind which


---------17:48----------
is out of your control and what what it


---------17:52----------
sounds like when you try to fix


---------17:54----------
something is when you perceive that


---------17:55----------
something is broken does that make sense


---------17:59----------
yeah and I think that's a problem


---------18:02----------
because just because you don't perceive


---------18:06----------
it's broken


---------18:07----------
doesn't mean that it isn't broken and


---------18:10----------
that it can't be worked on hold on my my


---------18:16----------
mind is so let me put it this way I get


---------18:19----------
the sense that what so like you deal


---------18:22----------
with fires whenever they start so like


---------18:25----------
your house starts burning like it


---------18:26----------
catches on fire then you take a bucket


---------18:28----------
of water and you're like I don't then


---------18:29----------
you put out the fire right make sense


---------18:31----------
but what I'm getting the sense of is


---------18:33----------
that your your house maybe catches fire


---------18:35----------
pretty frequently and so even though you


---------18:38----------
only need water when it catches fire


---------18:40----------
there may be some value to working on


---------18:43----------
yourself in between the times that your


---------18:45----------
house is burning so that it doesn't


---------18:47----------
catch fire is often all right what do


---------18:51----------
you think about that and sorry because I


---------18:54----------
didn't explain it very well but I mean I


---------18:57----------
don't understand somewhat but I'd never


---------18:59----------
put I didn't really see you like that


---------19:01----------
like at all like I didn't feel like I


---------19:05----------
didn't think that I give off the


---------19:07----------
presence that I am NOT okay and when I'm


---------19:11----------
not okay that I fix a meal ages and then


---------19:13----------
okay again this makes sense yeah so so


---------19:17----------
but is that what you like you basically


---------19:18----------
you try to become okay when you're not


---------19:20----------
okay


---------19:20----------
um that I wouldn't even say okay that's


---------19:24----------
it what it but means okay like


---------19:26----------
emotionally okay or together like what


---------19:32----------
but do you understand under being okay


---------19:34----------
yeah so let me even take a step back


---------19:37----------
okay so are you happy with who you are


---------19:41----------
right now and the way that your life is


---------19:42----------
oh no I think I can improve okay what do


---------19:47----------
you what do you wish was different about


---------19:48----------
your life


---------19:49----------
um above my life specifically maybe my


---------19:52----------
living situation cuz I had like I again


---------19:56----------
like I mentioned I left at Thailand now


---------19:58----------
I'm back in Germany but I currently


---------19:59----------
living at my grandparents was just


---------20:00----------
awesome I love them but I want my own


---------20:03----------
life kind of like that's like a one part


---------20:07----------
that I would like to change here are you


---------20:09----------
happy as a person um sometimes like I do


---------20:17----------
have my moments like yeah I'm good okay


---------20:21----------
mm-hmm


---------20:22----------
I think I'm I'm rubbing up against the


---------20:26----------
same thing but I just don't know exactly


---------20:28----------
how to


---------20:34----------
hold on sorry this is great confusing if


---------20:41----------
someone's on my desktop again so ok let


---------20:47----------
me just think about this for a second


---------20:48----------
hmm okay let's keep talking I'm gonna


---------20:56----------
try to piece this together in my mind as


---------20:59----------
we talk so you say you're happy


---------21:01----------
sometimes yeah but I think it's normal


---------21:06----------
no like yes you bad times you good times


---------21:08----------
yeah yeah so some people have a sense of


---------21:11----------
overall contentment or happiness that is


---------21:14----------
not an emotion here here we go okay so


---------21:17----------
they're there too when I say the word


---------21:19----------
happy there are two things that I'm


---------21:21----------
referring to one is an emotion and an


---------21:24----------
emotion is something that you experience


---------21:25----------
in the present and the second is like an


---------21:29----------
overall sense of like contentment with


---------21:33----------
your life okay okay so my answer to this


---------21:38----------
I don't think so I think so is I agree


---------21:43----------
so the old state the overt state of man


---------21:46----------
like yeah heavy and and and so then when


---------21:48----------
I ask you and some of this could be a


---------21:50----------
language barrier but when I ask you you


---------21:54----------
know what do you feel like you need and


---------21:55----------
when you say nothing I feel like you


---------21:57----------
need something because I don't think


---------21:58----------
that your overall sense of contentment


---------22:01----------
is there and that something needs to be


---------22:03----------
worked on or changed for you to feel


---------22:05----------
overall happy and content with your life


---------22:09----------
okay no I understand okay then let's go


---------22:11----------
back to the question what do I need I


---------22:13----------
feel like what I mostly need is a sense


---------22:16----------
of progress cuz I feel like the past


---------22:19----------
weeks I haven't had any progress


---------22:21----------
whatsoever as a matter of fact I feel


---------22:23----------
like I'm took a huge step back in life


---------22:27----------
when if something happened over the past


---------22:29----------
few weeks uh know it well months in that


---------22:33----------
case it's actually been quite a while


---------22:34----------
but again I have to go back to the thing


---------22:36----------
where I lived in Thailand and I kept it


---------22:38----------
my life there for two years and then


---------22:39----------
something happened and like having my


---------22:43----------
own life and just going back to my old


---------22:44----------
life


---------22:44----------
that really took a toll on me okay and


---------22:48----------
yeah so need to progress in life that's


---------22:50----------
but it's a little bit difficult because


---------22:52----------
I actually planned on taking it step by


---------22:54----------
perhaps staying away in America but now


---------22:57----------
I can't obviously sound like a little


---------22:59----------
bit like that's my issue it made like a


---------23:01----------
goal like oh and free months are going


---------23:02----------
to America and then I'm gonna do this


---------23:04----------
injustice but not because of do to covet


---------23:06----------
and the well the other issues that are


---------23:09----------
going on right now I can't do that so I


---------23:12----------
had to again do step back and now I feel


---------23:14----------
like I'm stuck in my old life can you


---------23:20----------
tell me about what your old life is like


---------23:22----------
well living in my city which is a


---------23:25----------
beautiful city


---------23:26----------
my family's here I'm happy to have


---------23:29----------
across with my family but I left the


---------23:31----------
city my home for a reason was I because


---------23:35----------
I connect with this place sadness I am


---------23:42----------
sad in living in my city living and


---------23:46----------
Jeremy maybe all together


---------23:48----------
but maybe the the people the memories


---------23:54----------
the a lot of okay I don't want to do the


---------24:02----------
victim card cuz I have done things in


---------24:05----------
life that are not okay


---------24:06----------
but no I'm just saying what I've said


---------24:10----------
now things like Oh betrayal and like


---------24:12----------
pain like sounds like I always got pain


---------24:15----------
but I also did things that were not okay


---------24:19----------
but I mean yeah but I connect whole


---------24:22----------
things I asked you what makes you sad


---------24:25----------
yes but I wanted to say like the that


---------24:31----------
the pain I got by living here and the


---------24:33----------
amount of times I've been betrayed and


---------24:35----------
lied to and like like in general it's


---------24:38----------
more negative feelings that I have


---------24:40----------
connected to my home than positive yeah


---------24:43----------
but but I thought why did you feel the


---------24:45----------
need to say I don't want to play the


---------24:47----------
victim card because it's like right now


---------24:50----------
the way I talk it sounds like I'm really


---------24:54----------
like I'm being a victim but I don't want


---------24:57----------
to be a victim I don't want to make it


---------24:58----------
sound like that it's just I can't say it


---------25:00----------
any differently because that's how I


---------25:01----------
feel


---------25:02----------
so why do you feel like this is being


---------25:04----------
made why do you think you sound like a


---------25:07----------
victim okay I guess all I do right now


---------25:11----------
is like complain and complain and only


---------25:17----------
like if I've only talked about negative


---------25:19----------
things right now I don't know


---------25:21----------
you mean right now is in over the course


---------25:22----------
of this conversation yeah it makes you


---------25:25----------
feel like really like Oh pity me like


---------25:27----------
and I want to do you think I'm hitting


---------25:30----------
you know like that's how I feel about


---------25:33----------
myself and hear myself talk I agree


---------25:36----------
that's yeah so so let's just look at


---------25:38----------
that for a second yeah so you have a


---------25:41----------
perception hold on sorry


---------25:46----------
there's I'm trying to give birth to a


---------25:49----------
thought and I'm trying to make it so I


---------25:54----------
want you to notice that when you start


---------25:58----------
to talk about your pain there is a part


---------26:02----------
of your mind that invalidates or D


---------26:06----------
values your experience hmm do you see


---------26:10----------
that yeah I do I feel like that's


---------26:15----------
significant but I'm not quite sure how


---------26:18----------
or why do you have any idea how that


---------26:20----------
could be significant no okay maybe you


---------26:28----------
need another fought baby I do need


---------26:31----------
another thought baby would it be okay if


---------26:35----------
you are you a victim no I don't see


---------26:45----------
myself as a victim what do you see


---------26:51----------
yourself as I wouldn't I don't know if I


---------26:57----------
can label myself to be honest well you


---------27:01----------
see yourself as something because it's


---------27:03----------
not a victim no not even I just know I'm


---------27:06----------
not an another victim I don't know


---------27:08----------
exactly


---------27:09----------
well light I don't know exactly what I


---------27:11----------
am but to that question I'm no I'm not


---------27:15----------
so so so okay no no no no it's it's


---------27:22----------
great


---------27:22----------
no so Jade I think I get it right so let


---------27:25----------
me put it this way your sense of


---------27:27----------
identity is built on the idea that you


---------27:30----------
are not a victim that's what your


---------27:32----------
identity is yeah right so like that


---------27:37----------
seems weird to me in some way I'm not


---------27:40----------
quite sure why I'm not saying you're ill


---------27:42----------
or anything so let me let me let me say


---------27:45----------
a couple you want to say you look like


---------27:47----------
everyone sees no it's just maybe I have


---------27:49----------
this mind like saying that I'm not a


---------27:50----------
victims because when I look at other


---------27:53----------
people's when they talk the way I talk


---------27:54----------
about what I just mentioned and


---------27:56----------
everything people always label them as


---------27:58----------
victims or like survivors and so I just


---------28:01----------
when I don't know that that's how it's


---------28:03----------
like online like first time they meet


---------28:04----------
you movement and they're people call


---------28:07----------
them survivors and victims and so on and


---------28:09----------
that's why I said like I am NOT that


---------28:11----------
after mentioning everything I mentioned


---------28:15----------
what's wrong with being that there's


---------28:19----------
absolutely nothing wrong with that it's


---------28:21----------
just that's not how I see myself


---------28:23----------
so what's wrong with you seeing yourself


---------28:25----------
that way dad I don't know it's just it


---------28:30----------
doesn't sit with me


---------28:31----------
right what doesn't sit with you so if I


---------28:34----------
were to say you Jade I think you are a


---------28:36----------
victim


---------28:39----------
so it sounds weak to me not that being a


---------28:48----------
victim is weakness it's just again no no


---------28:50----------
no no no it is hold on let's be clear


---------28:53----------
about what you're saying okay how do you


---------28:54----------
feel right now you feel okay I've been


---------28:58----------
cornered I see that I'm sorry by you and


---------29:02----------
a son that's one good the son is alive


---------29:05----------
I've recruited the Sun to shine in your


---------29:07----------
face okay so so I I get that you feel


---------29:09----------
cornered so let's just talk about that


---------29:12----------
for a second yes what are we doing


---------29:15----------
that's making you feel cornered mmm


---------29:18----------
maybe it's because for Safari Kevin


---------29:22----------
comes not that I want to conclusions


---------29:23----------
just usually you talk about something


---------29:25----------
then you come to in conclusion but we


---------29:27----------
keep jumping and jumping and I feel like


---------29:28----------
overwhelmed


---------29:29----------
the range of topics we've been already


---------29:33----------
talking about so I apologize for that


---------29:37----------
no it's that's that's not it's not a bad


---------29:40----------
thing it's like it came from me as well


---------29:42----------
like I jumped all so so sure but can I


---------29:48----------
apologize for it no I don't think that


---------29:50----------
it's just of course yes of course you


---------29:55----------
can apologize okay do you forgive me


---------29:58----------
yeah we do


---------30:01----------
thank you so I'll try to jump around a


---------30:04----------
little bit less and I wonder if you're


---------30:07----------
feeling cornered because I'm looking at


---------30:11----------
something that you makes you


---------30:14----------
uncomfortable like all this talk I've


---------30:15----------
gotten the sense that you felt cornered


---------30:18----------
since we started talking about your


---------30:20----------
identity as a victim or not a victim yes


---------30:23----------
because I never thought about that topic


---------30:25----------
like the other things we talked about


---------30:26----------
came up to my mind but that's


---------30:28----------
specifically I'm I'm prepared you could


---------30:30----------
say so I really wanted to yeah so let's


---------30:33----------
talk about that for a second so I think


---------30:35----------
usually the way in which I try to help


---------30:37----------
people is by not talking about what they


---------30:40----------
understand but talking about what they


---------30:43----------
don't understand and I do think that it


---------30:46----------
makes sense to me like for example I


---------30:48----------
haven't asked you a whole lot about your


---------30:49----------
sexual perversions and stuff like that


---------30:51----------
because I think you get that stuff and


---------30:53----------
it's the cool thing is that your that


---------30:57----------
looks really uncomfortable this one is


---------31:00----------
almost good so so in a sense Jade


---------31:06----------
because you have thought about that and


---------31:08----------
talked about all that stuff you're able


---------31:10----------
to actually explain it to me very like


---------31:12----------
succinctly and then like I feel


---------31:14----------
comfortable moving on because like you


---------31:15----------
actually understand all that stuff yes


---------31:18----------
and and I I do think that what we're


---------31:20----------
running up against is okay so while we


---------31:24----------
wait for the Sun I'm gonna compose my


---------31:26----------
thoughts okay okay


---------31:38----------
okay give me just give me a minute


---------32:00----------
okay I'm ready so either this is gonna


---------32:06----------
make sense it's not gonna make any sense


---------32:08----------
at all then we have to go back to the


---------32:09----------
drawing board okay okay okay so


---------32:13----------
something happened to you when you were


---------32:14----------
16


---------32:15----------
right yes and then you say that you're


---------32:20----------
not a victim right yeah okay so like so


---------32:25----------
when I asked you like who are you you're


---------32:27----------
like I don't know but I'm not a victim


---------32:29----------
so I think your sense of identity is


---------32:31----------
built around the fact that you are not a


---------32:33----------
victim like that's who you are it's like


---------32:36----------
it's it's a sense of identity that's


---------32:38----------
built around negative space it's not


---------32:41----------
like I am this it's what I am is not


---------32:44----------
this and then when I ask you like okay


---------32:48----------
what's wrong with being a victim and


---------32:50----------
then you say well like being a victim is


---------32:52----------
weak and then you do something very


---------32:53----------
simple like very tricky and then you say


---------32:56----------
other victims aren't weak but I'm if I'm


---------32:59----------
a victim you don't blame other people


---------33:00----------
for like being victims if they're


---------33:03----------
sexually assaulted but you don't get to


---------33:05----------
blame yourself if you were sexually


---------33:06----------
assaulted you see how you do that


---------33:08----------
because you don't think other people are


---------33:10----------
weak but you think yourself is weak if


---------33:12----------
you are a victim yeah right and then


---------33:17----------
what happens is like there's something


---------33:18----------
weird because if you were sexually


---------33:20----------
assaulted and Europe if there's a victim


---------33:23----------
there's a perpetrator right there's a


---------33:25----------
criminal and for that relationship to


---------33:29----------
exist if someone is a victim it's not


---------33:33----------
their fault it's the other person's


---------33:36----------
fault right and so then the question


---------33:39----------
becomes if you're not a victim then


---------33:42----------
whose fault is it I may be but on who is


---------33:54----------
responsible for what happened to you


---------33:55----------
when you were 16 I think both parties me


---------34:02----------
and the person did it to me okay how do


---------34:06----------
you feel like you're responsible


---------34:11----------
there there were rules like that I


---------34:14----------
didn't like them there were rules you


---------34:17----------
shouldn't be out that long and I went


---------34:22----------
out longer than that order longer than


---------34:24----------
the curfew and I drank so I was drunk


---------34:28----------
and I broke the rules


---------34:30----------
that's how I got into your situation so


---------34:33----------
that's why I feel like I definitely am


---------34:36----------
to blame here okay as well can I think


---------34:44----------
about that for a second yeah


---------34:47----------
actually first let me take a step back


---------34:49----------
what did you think about what I shared


---------34:51----------
earlier about like what happened to you


---------34:53----------
and like sort of the identity of being a


---------34:54----------
non victim and it may be sound like a


---------34:58----------
hypocrite kind of like the way yeah they


---------35:01----------
Kathy got it I definitely see how what i


---------35:04----------
hiccup hypocrite I am being well so I so


---------35:08----------
I'd be careful so I wouldn't use the


---------35:10----------
word hypocrite but I understand what you


---------35:11----------
mean so this is what I would say I think


---------35:14----------
you hold yourself to a different


---------35:15----------
standard than you hold other people what


---------35:17----------
do you think about right sure


---------35:22----------
is that what you mean by hypocrite like


---------35:24----------
you judge yourself differently from the


---------35:26----------
way that you judge other people I mean


---------35:28----------
yeah but I mean that's true


---------35:31----------
I do a lot myself different than other


---------35:33----------
people that's true I have a different


---------35:35----------
opinion they say it's someone who has


---------35:36----------
the same experience as I do I would


---------35:38----------
still judge differently denied judge


---------35:40----------
myself yeah and so the reason I wouldn't


---------35:42----------
quite call it a hypocrite is because I


---------35:44----------
think a hypocrite tends to judge


---------35:46----------
themselves unfairly in like a positive


---------35:50----------
way mm-hmm whereas I think you actually


---------35:53----------
are the office of America which is that


---------35:55----------
sure you have a double standard but


---------35:57----------
you're harder on yourself than you are


---------35:59----------
on other people hmm what do you think


---------36:02----------
about that


---------36:04----------
I never really noticed till now I mean


---------36:10----------
what would you say though so let's think


---------36:12----------
about it now I mean yeah just judging by


---------36:17----------
the example that we just have with me


---------36:19----------
saying I'm weak and daughters aren't it


---------36:21----------
does sound like I'm harder myself I'm


---------36:24----------
like I'm my biggest critic but I like to


---------36:27----------
be that I like to be my biggest critic


---------36:28----------
my biggest hater so others can't be


---------36:30----------
doesn't make sense yeah there we go


---------36:33----------
there it is okay what it sounded like


---------36:39----------
they came and fought to some like


---------36:43----------
everything up like there it is like oh


---------36:46----------
I'm sorry didn't I felt like that was a


---------36:50----------
very significant statement what okay I I


---------36:56----------
really am not sure about anything I say


---------36:58----------
right now okay that's okay maybe I'm


---------37:00----------
relying too much on your thoughts right


---------37:02----------
now - in order to understand mine that's


---------37:07----------
just maybe that's my thing I think


---------37:09----------
that's probably true yeah okay that's


---------37:13----------
also a good observation how are you


---------37:18----------
feeling right now Jade I can imagine


---------37:19----------
you're feeling quite uncomfortable no


---------37:22----------
not uncomfortable it's of course as we


---------37:25----------
talked about things I've never really


---------37:26----------
considered or came up to my mind like


---------37:29----------
it's it's it's new that's all yeah good


---------37:37----------
yeah so it's foreign okay so what did


---------37:43----------
you say you say you like to blame


---------37:44----------
yourself more than what why are you so


---------37:47----------
harsh on yourself oh okay this is a


---------37:52----------
stupid but do you know the movie pitch


---------37:55----------
perfect no there's this girl called fat


---------37:59----------
Amy and she just calls her name she


---------38:01----------
calls us her fat Amy so other people's


---------38:04----------
can call her fat and after watch a movie


---------38:07----------
something in my mind was like that makes


---------38:09----------
sense so I became like that as well I


---------38:11----------
think I judge myself harder I'm in


---------38:14----------
general like always see like the


---------38:15----------
negative things first


---------38:18----------
and then perhaps a positive mm-hmm say


---------38:22----------
yeah so so I think you said something in


---------38:25----------
it I think you said it beautifully that


---------38:26----------
you you liked to you know put yourself


---------38:29----------
down or blame yourself so that other


---------38:31----------
people can't hurt you more than you can


---------38:33----------
hurt yourself yes what do you think


---------38:38----------
about that that's toxic and yeah and


---------38:47----------
also it is not stupid okay so I know I


---------38:52----------
agree with you that it's toxic but


---------38:55----------
there's something very very adaptive


---------39:03----------
so here's here are the two scenarios


---------39:06----------
okay so here I I think it's very


---------39:09----------
important for you to do that for


---------39:11----------
yourself right now and I and let me


---------39:13----------
explain to you why okay so I'm gonna


---------39:18----------
need a second to collect my thoughts


---------39:19----------
again so I'm gonna lay out two scenarios


---------39:23----------
for you okay there's one world in which


---------39:30----------
you don't know if you're a good person


---------39:32----------
or a bad person and maybe people will


---------39:36----------
treat you with love and maybe people


---------39:37----------
will treat you with hate and that's a


---------39:40----------
scary world that go to live in because


---------39:42----------
you don't know what's gonna happen when


---------39:45----------
you step outside your door you could get


---------39:48----------
hugged and you could get punched and


---------39:50----------
that's [ __ ] terrifying there's


---------39:53----------
another world in which I wake up every


---------39:59----------
morning and I punch myself in the face


---------40:01----------
and I survive that and then I know that


---------40:04----------
when I step outside no one out there can


---------40:08----------
hurt me in a way that I won't be able to


---------40:11----------
survive because I've already hit myself


---------40:13----------
and I can survive so nothing that the


---------40:16----------
world can send me is gonna knock me down


---------40:19----------
hmm because I've already done it to


---------40:22----------
myself which world do you think is safer


---------40:26----------
the second


---------40:28----------
absolutely why because there's nothing


---------40:32----------
unexpected I already know absolutely so


---------40:37----------
the thing is Jade what you need is


---------40:40----------
courage hmm you need courage to


---------40:44----------
entertain the possibility that you could


---------40:46----------
live in the first world right because


---------40:51----------
it's scary because you don't know how


---------40:53----------
people are gonna treat you and so if you


---------40:56----------
beat yourself up and you know you can


---------40:58----------
survive that then you have nothing to


---------41:00----------
fear from the rest of the world does


---------41:01----------
that make sense


---------41:02----------
it's like fear becomes a non-issue


---------41:04----------
because you're already doing the worst


---------41:06----------
to yourself that can possibly be done


---------41:08----------
and so it's like no big deal no big deal


---------41:11----------
you have nothing to worry about you can


---------41:12----------
go out you can be happy some days you


---------41:14----------
can be sad some days but as long as


---------41:16----------
you're beating the [ __ ] out of yourself


---------41:18----------
every day you can enjoy a wonderful


---------41:21----------
sandwich or be disappointed but as long


---------41:23----------
as you're beating the crap out of


---------41:25----------
yourself people can hate you on Twitch


---------41:27----------
people can love you on Twitch you can


---------41:29----------
deal with their criticism because at the


---------41:31----------
end of the day nothing they can do is


---------41:34----------
worse than what you do to yourself and


---------41:36----------
if you can survive what you do to


---------41:38----------
yourself you can survive what they're


---------41:40----------
gonna do to you mmm what do you think


---------41:43----------
about that Oh sounds like I really have


---------41:51----------
to step out of my comfort zone okay so


---------41:55----------
so be careful Jade so you took one step


---------41:58----------
ahead you said what you need to do about


---------42:01----------
it I'm not asking what you need to do


---------42:03----------
about it


---------42:03----------
no you wouldn't think that's what that I


---------42:06----------
need to do that sort of think about it


---------42:08----------
that yeah I know I know that you think


---------42:10----------
of mine that this state is safe but not


---------42:15----------
good necessarily what what do you mean


---------42:17----------
do you think that the why not both are


---------42:21----------
really optimal but say like this but


---------42:23----------
maybe I should that say it like gonna


---------42:25----------
fun ways switch it up a little bit sure


---------42:27----------
so I think that that makes sense but I


---------42:29----------
don't even want you to talk about what


---------42:31----------
you should do okay so I'm asking so I


---------42:35----------
presented to you a possibility of what


---------42:38----------
could be true about your life in the way


---------42:40----------
that you look at yourself


---------42:42----------
before we figure out whether how to fix


---------42:44----------
it what I'd first like to understand


---------42:46----------
because sometimes I'm wrong about this


---------42:47----------
[ __ ] so like does that resonate with you


---------42:51----------
like we can talk about how to fix it


---------42:53----------
later but is that right or like off-base


---------42:57----------
sir


---------42:57----------
I mean and I don't really say it's right


---------43:01----------
or wrong it's just it's good to know


---------43:03----------
doesn't make sense like do you think it


---------43:05----------
applies happen mind um I'm the first


---------43:09----------
scenario where you're like they doesn't


---------43:11----------
agree I hit myself every morning and I


---------43:13----------
go out and there'd everyone sure the


---------43:15----------
other one I'm not kind of present sure


---------43:18----------
what's the other one punching the


---------43:20----------
punching and the hugging okay yeah so I


---------43:24----------
don't think you do that the first one I


---------43:26----------
think you do the second one yes I think


---------43:28----------
the second one describes how you view


---------43:31----------
yourself and why yeah like it's like it


---------43:35----------
goes back like you you're incredibly


---------43:36----------
invalidating towards yourself yeah no


---------43:40----------
it's just the courage part got me that I


---------43:44----------
need to just be more courageous adjust


---------43:48----------
like elite courageous like in general


---------43:52----------
like that's stuck with me for at the


---------43:55----------
whole topic we just had the what courage


---------43:57----------
you just threw out that okay so that


---------44:02----------
bothers me a little bit so I'm gonna run


---------44:04----------
something by Jade I'm really gonna need


---------44:06----------
your help and I'm sorry because this is


---------44:08----------
super weird hypothetical abstract stuff


---------44:10----------
so okay so try to run with me let me see


---------44:14----------
if I see if you can follow me and if you


---------44:17----------
can't I apologize because it's it's


---------44:19----------
gonna be hard to explain I'm wondering


---------44:21----------
if you latched on to the only part that


---------44:25----------
is where you're lacking like so I


---------44:31----------
basically said there's one thing that is


---------44:33----------
wrong with Jade and that's she needs


---------44:35----------
more courage and that's the one thing


---------44:37----------
that you ran towards does that make


---------44:39----------
sense


---------44:40----------
yes are you just piggybacking on the


---------44:42----------
idea that I picked the one flaw and


---------44:45----------
you're saying yes I can get behind the


---------44:47----------
flaw because Jade needs to be better


---------44:48----------
do you see that am i no I see that I see


---------44:52----------
that absolutely right it's weird right


---------44:55----------
because you're like you're kind of


---------44:56----------
piling on to like oh yeah like oh sure


---------44:58----------
there's something wrong with me


---------44:59----------
absolutely I can get behind that that's


---------45:02----------
what I'm hearing from you in a weird way


---------45:04----------
yeah so I don't think that that's


---------45:07----------
actually helpful because that's you


---------45:11----------
that's you that's you hitting yourself


---------45:13----------
again because you're saying oh I'm not


---------45:14----------
courageous enough yeah I'm weak


---------45:18----------
sometimes I see did are you familiar


---------45:21----------
with like games and like skill trees


---------45:23----------
where you have like abilities and yes


---------45:25----------
yeah and I just saw right now that I


---------45:28----------
leveled up of you skill trees and the


---------45:30----------
courage one I didn't it level up enough


---------45:32----------
so maybe I went the I tried to level up


---------45:34----------
that one as quick as possible even


---------45:36----------
though I there might be out of school


---------45:38----------
trees I need to level up first that's


---------45:40----------
how I just thought maybe right now like


---------45:41----------
oh dad my dad needs level up yeah so so


---------45:45----------
my point is that your mind is going to


---------45:48----------
look at whichever skill tree you're the


---------45:50----------
worst at in falling into the trap of


---------45:53----------
like me not being so the other way we


---------45:56----------
can think about it is I need courage I'm


---------45:58----------
gonna translate that as I'm not good


---------46:00----------
enough


---------46:01----------
does that make sense and so like I think


---------46:04----------
the core part of your identity is the


---------46:06----------
belief that you're not good enough that


---------46:08----------
other people deserve to be victims but


---------46:10----------
you don't that other people can afford


---------46:14----------
to take a day off if they've been


---------46:16----------
sexually assaulted at the age of sixteen


---------46:18----------
but if you do that you're weak hmm so I


---------46:24----------
think you're very quick to pile on to


---------46:27----------
any deficiency which I point out to you


---------46:30----------
but I want to be really careful because


---------46:32----------
I don't want you to I don't want to let


---------46:34----------
you get away with that


---------46:35----------
and that's also why I don't care about


---------46:38----------
what you want to do to fix it because


---------46:40----------
you're always looking about I don't


---------46:42----------
think you need to fix anything what do


---------46:45----------
you think about that I mean in general I


---------46:48----------
don't think I need necessarily fixing


---------46:50----------
either it's more like I'm up improvement


---------46:51----------
that I want like I don't know I feel


---------46:56----------
like I can improve myself what do you


---------47:00----------
think that's wrong with yourself


---------47:01----------
anything mmm yeah there are a few things


---------47:05----------
but of course you can


---------47:08----------
so this fro randomly out what I can


---------47:10----------
improve or sure procrastinating


---------47:14----------
procrastinating yeah that's okay


---------47:18----------
so I was asking like are you sure I can


---------47:20----------
throw it like anything no no I'm glad


---------47:22----------
because I'm glad you threw that out


---------47:24----------
because I was trying to get a sense of


---------47:25----------
that whether that's I think that that's


---------47:27----------
I agree with you that all that stuff you


---------47:29----------
can improve I don't think that that's


---------47:30----------
what we're talking about


---------47:31----------
what are you mean like emotional


---------47:33----------
improvement uh sure I let me just think


---------47:36----------
can I think for a second yes do you have


---------47:41----------
questions for me I mean I always every


---------47:45----------
time you ask me something I want to ask


---------47:46----------
it back but I don't know if it's like


---------47:48----------
yeah yeah not right now but like in the


---------47:52----------
future I ask okay I'm glad I'm good


---------47:56----------
because I wasn't sure if I will touch


---------47:58----------
like you emotional boundaries or I don't


---------48:01----------
know ask away like I don't know good in


---------48:05----------
the future you touch my emotional


---------48:08----------
boundaries meaning if you want to ask me


---------48:09----------
like personal questions about myself


---------48:11----------
well when you ask if it personal


---------48:13----------
sometimes I feel like what do you feel


---------48:15----------
about like how do you feel about it or


---------48:16----------
do you can you did you ever experience


---------48:18----------
if like that that's like why don't when


---------48:19----------
I ask back but then I remember that I


---------48:22----------
don't know like ask go for it's it's a


---------48:25----------
different go for home hmm I'm trying to


---------48:38----------
figure out whether this is helping you


---------48:40----------
or not what do you think this our talk


---------48:46----------
yeah um okay helping is a big word I


---------48:52----------
think is a big word it's me somewhat


---------48:54----------
clarification about like things I didn't


---------48:57----------
know I needed to focus on like it's


---------49:00----------
interesting to talk about things that


---------49:02----------
never came up to my mind so it's just


---------49:04----------
very educational all of this but yeah


---------49:09----------
yeah how do you don't like the ideation


---------49:15----------
you're okay you're completely fine


---------49:17----------
focusing on something but you're really


---------49:19----------
not okay fixing something are you


---------49:21----------
uh fixing and I I mean I didn't come


---------49:28----------
here to fix something good maybe that's


---------49:31----------
why maybe that's why I'm not focus on


---------49:34----------
that right now do you think do you think


---------49:36----------
it's okay to need to be fixed yeah it's


---------49:42----------
okay


---------49:43----------
I don't know necessarily like all


---------49:45----------
together is okay to fix absolutely but


---------49:49----------
do you think you're allowed to be broken


---------49:52----------
yes good I guess I was afraid for a


---------50:00----------
moment that like you were moving away


---------50:02----------
for like it was like the same thing


---------50:03----------
where you won't let yourself be a victim


---------50:05----------
no I think it's okay okay good that


---------50:10----------
makes me think that you aren't broken


---------50:13----------
hmm really


---------50:15----------
Wow so I think the capacity to accept


---------50:18----------
that you could be broken and that it's


---------50:20----------
okay to be broken is a sign that you're


---------50:22----------
not broken that's that's actually


---------50:25----------
interesting what's interesting about


---------50:27----------
that that that's when you're broken and


---------50:31----------
you realize you're broken that


---------50:32----------
technically doesn't mean you that broken


---------50:35----------
yep


---------50:36----------
that is good to know really really free


---------50:39----------
so what I don't know why it's it's a


---------50:42----------
good feeling


---------50:42----------
yeah of course I was are your words


---------50:44----------
someone else might say something


---------50:46----------
completely different but like hearing it


---------50:47----------
from someone else's yeah cool I think we


---------50:51----------
call that acceptance yeah so when I


---------50:54----------
think about someone who's like


---------50:55----------
narcissistic you can sue poor


---------50:58----------
egotistical like they're broken on the


---------50:59----------
inside but they don't let themselves be


---------51:01----------
broken they're like no I'm fine


---------51:04----------
everything's okay I'm the best even


---------51:06----------
though they don't feel that way and then


---------51:08----------
once they start to acknowledge oh maybe


---------51:10----------
I am a little bit broken and it's okay


---------51:12----------
to be broken they can forgive themselves


---------51:14----------
for not being perfect you know they can


---------51:18----------
they can blame themselves a little bit


---------51:19----------
less for being weak and therein lies


---------51:23----------
their strength


---------51:33----------
my brain is taking so much information


---------51:37----------
right now I'm sorry I just had like a


---------51:38----------
short AFK moment just thinking yeah I


---------51:42----------
take afk I I the only difference between


---------51:44----------
me and you is I tell you I'm going FK


---------51:46----------
yeah I should do that too like by the


---------51:48----------
way I'm afk yeah let me know when you


---------51:50----------
need to go afk okay alright yeah this


---------51:55----------
how do you feel right now


---------51:57----------
like I feel like I want to know a little


---------52:00----------
bit how you feel right now at a moment


---------52:01----------
like talking to me do you like are you


---------52:02----------
feeling neutral or is there like some


---------52:05----------
kind of emotion you face I'm glad you


---------52:06----------
asked because I was just about to share


---------52:08----------
my feelings good so I was just saying


---------52:11----------
that I feel like the conversation is


---------52:12----------
like we're circling around something and


---------52:14----------
we keep on like touching and moving away


---------52:16----------
from it like we can't just get our hands


---------52:18----------
on it that's how I feel okay what do you


---------52:22----------
think yeah that's what I said pretty


---------52:25----------
much early new conversation that we jump


---------52:27----------
and jump and don't come to conclusion so


---------52:30----------
yeah yeah come a sating I'm trying to


---------52:34----------
I'm trying to grab it but I don't know


---------52:36----------
how to grab it I grabbed what exactly


---------52:40----------
like yeah so that's the problem is I


---------52:44----------
don't know what it is until we grab


---------52:48----------
inside but really I tend to share with


---------52:52----------
you what I've what I've understood so


---------52:53----------
like let me let me try to summarize and


---------52:55----------
then you let me know like what you think


---------52:57----------
is a worthwhile thing to further explore


---------52:59----------
and maybe we can talk more about what


---------53:01----------
hypersexuality is or how that works or


---------53:03----------
you know some other simple topic that


---------53:05----------
you're well-versed in so so Jade I I do


---------53:10----------
think that there's something toxic about


---------53:11----------
the way that you look at yourself and I


---------53:14----------
think that that toxicity is protective


---------53:16----------
and it kind of goes back to this thing


---------53:19----------
that like I I do think that at the end


---------53:21----------
of the day where there are things that


---------53:22----------
you did to put yourself in a bad


---------53:24----------
situation yes sure where did you do


---------53:28----------
things that are stupid sure but I don't


---------53:32----------
think that getting sexually assaulted is


---------53:35----------
really your fault mm-hmm and this is


---------53:38----------
something I'll just be blunt I don't


---------53:40----------
know if your therapists have told you


---------53:41----------
this before but usually victims of


---------53:44----------
sexual


---------53:45----------
self sexual-assault blame themselves


---------53:47----------
like that's really common like victims


---------53:50----------
of abuse blame themselves like I've


---------53:53----------
worked with you know victims of domestic


---------53:56----------
violence who will say like yeah he hit


---------53:59----------
me because I didn't like like the food


---------54:03----------
that I served him was burnt it was my


---------54:05----------
fault


---------54:07----------
right and it's like if you really try to


---------54:11----------
argue with them about that like they're


---------54:13----------
not gonna understand but it's [ __ ]


---------54:14----------
weird right they're like I did this


---------54:17----------
therefore he did this I am and I think


---------54:20----------
what it comes down to is control because


---------54:23----------
if it's their fault then they're still


---------54:25----------
in control and that can feel good but if


---------54:29----------
you are a victim you let go of control


---------54:32----------
in your life and you acknowledge that


---------54:34----------
there are people out there that can do


---------54:36----------
things to you that are not your fault


---------54:39----------
and that's actually terrifying yeah


---------54:42----------
because most people would rather live in


---------54:44----------
a world where like if bad things happen


---------54:46----------
to them it's my fault because that's


---------54:48----------
like way more easier to live with it's


---------54:50----------
really hard to live with the idea that


---------54:51----------
I'm walking down the street and I get


---------54:53----------
hit by a meteor like that's [ __ ] a


---------54:56----------
scary world live in so it bothers me a


---------55:02----------
little bit that you have difficulty


---------55:04----------
viewing yourself as a victim and that


---------55:06----------
also if you view yourself as a victim


---------55:08----------
you view yourself as weak like I don't


---------55:11----------
think that that's healthy I don't think


---------55:14----------
that that's fair I think you should


---------55:17----------
allow be allowed to be a victim and I


---------55:20----------
don't think that being a victim makes


---------55:22----------
you weak and the crazy thing and now we


---------55:25----------
get to like what I really don't like


---------55:26----------
about what you're doing to yourself is


---------55:28----------
this double standard which is you say


---------55:29----------
that it's okay for other people to be


---------55:31----------
victims and it's okay for them to be


---------55:32----------
weak but it's not okay for me to be a


---------55:34----------
victim it's not okay for me to be weak I


---------55:40----------
just don't think that that's fair to you


---------55:47----------
well it isn't I guess FK just bring it


---------55:58----------
out they're good yeah not once did I


---------56:07----------
feel that I actually have a double


---------56:10----------
standard like at all


---------56:11----------
this is completing used to me so I'm a


---------56:13----------
little bit overwhelmed with that Fahd


---------56:18----------
yeah well you can let me know when


---------56:22----------
you're back at the keyboard yeah I'm


---------56:24----------
here I'm trying I'm trying


---------56:26----------
you could take more time KPD sure it's


---------56:29----------
more like I think you should keep the


---------56:30----------
coalition maybe a little bit flowing ok


---------56:32----------
sure how I'd sure so then let me ask you


---------56:34----------
this are you kind to yourself before I


---------56:40----------
answer what kind like kind by treating


---------56:42----------
myself nice way going shopping or kind


---------56:44----------
like to me as a person trying to use a


---------56:46----------
person kind to myself no I mean the


---------57:01----------
thing is I'm saying no because I'm not


---------57:03----------
not that I do the opposite I just don't


---------57:05----------
know if I ever try to yep it's like it's


---------57:13----------
cool it's like I know I'm sorry I I


---------57:15----------
don't mean to I like it I like it thank


---------57:18----------
you so so I sometimes I say that's


---------57:21----------
because you know our conversation is


---------57:23----------
super ambiguous so I say that's the


---------57:24----------
right answer because it makes it less


---------57:25----------
ambiguous but I I do think that that's


---------57:30----------
important to think about right is I


---------57:32----------
don't think you really know how to do


---------57:34----------
that no and and I think this doesn't


---------57:36----------
even have to do the sexual trauma I


---------57:38----------
think this started at 8 apparently hmm


---------57:43----------
what do you think about that


---------57:47----------
no I did it before that I mean I don't


---------57:51----------
remember for that I wasn't really sad


---------57:55----------
do you remember is so okay now I'm gonna


---------57:59----------
try to teach you something so I'm gonna


---------58:01----------
ask you a question and I suspect that


---------58:04----------
you may have an answer but that there's


---------58:06----------
gonna be a part of your mind that says


---------58:07----------
that that is the wrong answer and


---------58:09----------
therefore you're not gonna want to share


---------58:10----------
it mm-hmm okay so prepare yourself did


---------58:14----------
something happen to you when you were


---------58:15----------
eight or before you were eight that you


---------58:18----------
remember that made you feel sad yeah at


---------58:30----------
seven I think No seven no yes okay was


---------58:36----------
seven and I was at a verge of turning


---------58:38----------
eight


---------58:39----------
and it happened like the first unkind


---------58:42----------
interaction with humans


---------58:44----------
basically like before that I didn't ever


---------58:46----------
have any negative interaction with


---------58:48----------
anyone and that one really got me like


---------58:52----------
badly what happened


---------58:55----------
uh I I got beaten up by a bunch of guys


---------58:59----------
like I mean they were like a little bit


---------59:01----------
older than me


---------59:02----------
Manoj differ children but that was like


---------59:04----------
the first and tough one like I don't


---------59:08----------
know like it usually starts like maybe


---------59:09----------
people who calling you names I didn't


---------59:11----------
even start like I would like straight on


---------59:12----------
like beating up and I just remember like


---------59:15----------
that not only dad not only day


---------59:17----------
unkindness like it was a not public area


---------59:20----------
people would pass that's like where I


---------59:22----------
first realized that humans are really


---------59:24----------
really awful and it took quite some time


---------59:27----------
till someone actually stopped them from


---------59:29----------
kicking me and beating me and I don't


---------59:32----------
know like that really had a toll on me


---------59:36----------
like changed completely after that what


---------59:42----------
did you learn I learned not to trust


---------59:48----------
I learned not to keep my waltz down ever


---------59:51----------
always up I learned that you can only


---------59:55----------
count on yourself because if you count


---------59:57----------
on others it might never happen or


---------59:58----------
happens too late um so now let me ask


---------60:03----------
you something Jade the person who


---------60:06----------
believed who counts only on themselves


---------60:09----------
if that person gets sexually assaulted


---------60:12----------
whose fault is it


---------60:19----------
well that scenario that person how do


---------60:23----------
you feel yeah hey I do so now I'm gonna


---------60:29----------
ask you a question when you say you're


---------60:31----------
partly to blame and they're partly to


---------60:33----------
blame


---------60:33----------
do you really believe that or do you


---------60:35----------
believe that you're all to blame okay go


---------60:44----------
ahead


---------60:44----------
I I think I feel that both not but I


---------61:03----------
mean I'll in my scenario I still think I


---------61:09----------
have some Fault in it in your scenario


---------61:13----------
do you think you have some fault


---------61:14----------
most of the faults are all not


---------61:17----------
oh there's to be feel like you have all


---------61:20----------
the fault and use the same time that you


---------61:23----------
have some of the fault there's a


---------61:25----------
difference between thinking and feel I I


---------61:28----------
think I do I do like again like I


---------61:32----------
mentioned I there were rules and I broke


---------61:34----------
them and I deal with the consequences in


---------61:36----------
the worst possible way that bores


---------61:39----------
possibly there's worse but yeah i yeah i


---------61:45----------
did that and i would like to say no


---------61:49----------
thank you it's enough yeah good yeah


---------61:52----------
it's good that you're honest have


---------61:53----------
yourself right yeah so I think it's


---------61:57----------
tricky because a part of what we're


---------61:59----------
doing here is


---------62:03----------
so I think you're doing really good Jade


---------62:05----------
thanks you doing really well as well


---------62:08----------
thank you because I think it's hard to


---------62:11----------
say things that we feel to be true even


---------62:14----------
when we know it doesn't make any sense


---------62:17----------
hmm and and everything that I hear from


---------62:22----------
you makes me feel or think let me think


---------62:30----------
about that yeah makes me think that you


---------62:34----------
feel like yeah you feel like everything


---------62:38----------
is your fault like you feel in a sense


---------62:41----------
control and you feel responsible and I


---------62:44----------
think it's scary to live in your life


---------62:46----------
where human beings cannot be trusted


---------62:50----------
hmm and can't be counted on and so in a


---------62:55----------
sense it doesn't surprise me at all that


---------62:57----------
your mind thinks about sexual [ __ ] all


---------62:59----------
the time with people because like that's


---------63:02----------
such a safe way to think safe in what


---------63:10----------
way cuz like sex is just sex there's no


---------63:13----------
need for trust there's no need for


---------63:15----------
connection you know it's like like you


---------63:18----------
don't have to in the basement of your


---------63:21----------
mind there's all of this [ __ ] and you


---------63:25----------
never have to go down there if you're


---------63:27----------
thinking about sex and I really wanted


---------63:31----------
to say something more graphic but then I


---------63:34----------
thought that that could be true so I


---------63:36----------
didn't say that I feel you


---------63:41----------
right but like you see when like I don't


---------63:43----------
I don't think you're hyper sexual


---------63:45----------
thinking is gonna go away unless you


---------63:47----------
have other ways of thinking about people


---------63:51----------
all right and as long as you in like you


---------63:55----------
can't think about people without


---------63:58----------
grappling with these ideas that like you


---------64:00----------
are fundamentally alone in this world


---------64:03----------
like you love your parents and I know


---------64:06----------
what you know what love means and it's


---------64:08----------
clear to me that those connections are


---------64:09----------
important to you but I do believe that


---------64:11----------
there is a parse part of you there's a


---------64:13----------
seven-year-old girl in there


---------64:14----------
is still alive and well and feels


---------64:16----------
fundamentally alone Oh are we jump you


---------64:29----------
to conclusion or is this just like


---------64:31----------
statements I don't know what do you


---------64:33----------
think it is I mean it there's a lot of


---------64:36----------
to me it sounds like facts it probably


---------64:39----------
is faxed no hypotheses maybe I did okay


---------64:43----------
better um I didn't know two words in


---------64:46----------
English yeah yeah no it's not you gotta


---------64:51----------
remember I don't know I met you like an


---------64:53----------
hour ago so yes I don't know what I'm


---------64:57----------
talking about


---------64:58----------
Yeah right no I mean I see truth the


---------65:06----------
things you say not all of it


---------65:08----------
I don't like they're a few parts where


---------65:09----------
I'm feel like I don't know if that's


---------65:11----------
really good um but I do see yeah yeah


---------65:16----------
you want me to tell you or sure if you


---------65:19----------
want to but let me let me be clear I


---------65:21----------
don't tell you truth you tell us truth


---------65:24----------
right you're the one who determines


---------65:27----------
what's right and what's wrong


---------65:28----------
my job is to generate for you hypotheses


---------65:31----------
which then you tell us what's right and


---------65:33----------
what's wrong


---------65:33----------
yeah tell Ric as a guide I don't see you


---------65:36----------
as a savior but yeah it's you guided


---------65:46----------
well so far okay there's things you said


---------65:48----------
that will stick with me for quite some


---------65:50----------
time which is good we have time we have


---------65:52----------
quarantine I have a lot of time to work


---------65:54----------
on those yeah


---------65:55----------
oh and general talked about them but


---------65:58----------
yeah sous-vide honest my mind I wouldn't


---------66:00----------
say it's blank it's just right now


---------66:02----------
there's too much you think about I


---------66:03----------
wouldn't I don't really know what to say


---------66:05----------
now to you yeah good okay so you know


---------66:15----------
maybe this is bad but you know the


---------66:17----------
session doesn't have to have a climax


---------66:19----------
okay all right we can just sort of can I


---------66:24----------
can I make sexual jokes or is that


---------66:25----------
inappropriate


---------66:26----------
go ahead that's my whole my whole life's


---------66:29----------
just you know Jade we can just go limp


---------66:32----------
and that's good yeah they got me off


---------66:47----------
guard even though I asked for it yeah


---------66:48----------
yeah yeah um that's usually how I roll


---------66:56----------
what what is on your agenda a pod for me


---------66:59----------
today like am I like the only thing


---------67:01----------
you're gonna stream today or say like


---------67:02----------
something coming afterwards yeah so I


---------67:05----------
actually spend most of my day doing


---------67:08----------
doctoring so I I saw three patients in


---------67:13----------
the morning before stream mm-hmm and


---------67:15----------
then this is all I do like I can't do


---------67:17----------
this for more than two hours because I


---------67:19----------
find it mentally exhausting like it's


---------67:20----------
good but I feel spent at the end you


---------67:23----------
know I I think kind of like yourself


---------67:24----------
like you know I get the sense you have a


---------67:26----------
lot in your head and I have lot in my


---------67:27----------
head too so I can't do anything else


---------67:29----------
I mean sometimes we'll do things


---------67:31----------
afterward but I basically do the


---------67:32----------
interview I scream for about two hours


---------67:33----------
and then and then I've got a little bit


---------67:39----------
of a break


---------67:40----------
so I usually after I scream I try to


---------67:42----------
walk around for a little bit or I'll


---------67:44----------
Drive or and I'll just like sort of sit


---------67:46----------
and not do anything and just let my


---------67:48----------
thoughts do whatever they want to do and


---------67:53----------
then I think today I have two meetings


---------67:56----------
afterward I have a meeting with the


---------67:58----------
healthy gamer team about we launched our


---------68:01----------
coaching program yesterday and so


---------68:04----------
exciting yeah so we're just gonna check


---------68:06----------
in and see how that's going and then I


---------68:08----------
have another meeting about research


---------68:10----------
because we're trying to study this and


---------68:12----------
we're collaborating we're in the process


---------68:14----------
of talking with a couple of universities


---------68:16----------
about collaborating to study what we do


---------68:19----------
and see if it like you know get real


---------68:21----------
researchers in here because I'm not a


---------68:22----------
real researcher so we do some research


---------68:24----------
on our programs to like sort of because


---------68:26----------
I'm a scientist sort of but I'm not


---------68:28----------
really a super competent researcher I


---------68:30----------
tend to be a better clinician so I'm


---------68:32----------
better at talking to people than looking


---------68:33----------
at statistics and so we have a research


---------68:36----------
meeting because I really want to know I


---------68:38----------
want to collect data and make


---------68:40----------
sure that what we're trying to do for


---------68:42----------
the community is actually helping them


---------68:45----------
that's great


---------68:46----------
yeah so I've got two meetings and then


---------68:48----------
at 5:00 p.m.


---------68:50----------
either I'll play with my kids or I'll


---------68:52----------
play video games for about half an hour


---------68:54----------
to an hour yes yes


---------68:57----------
and then from 6 p.m. on word its family


---------68:59----------
time so you're like all together your


---------69:03----------
mind never really stops apart from when


---------69:05----------
you take a walk and maybe play games


---------69:06----------
like apart from those you're like always


---------69:09----------
like when you play a few kids you put or


---------69:11----------
are you like blank when you play a few


---------69:12----------
kids


---------69:13----------
no I I'd say is where I usually get


---------69:16----------
about half an hour of and sometimes


---------69:20----------
tired at 8:00 and stuff but yeah good


---------69:22----------
okay because right now you just taught


---------69:24----------
me so many things they can feel like


---------69:25----------
when do you rest but it's good that you


---------69:28----------
meditate also you're very good at caring


---------69:31----------
for other people oh thanks um yeah right


---------69:37----------
I got you how long have you been talking


---------69:42----------
I've lost like it's been all dynamic in


---------69:45----------
our yeah how it feels in eternity not


---------69:49----------
good at I like the topics were heavy yep


---------69:53----------
um but welcome none of them make me


---------69:57----------
fundamentally uncomfortable so just a


---------70:00----------
Froude out there we'll try better next


---------70:01----------
time no all good I mean I think so far


---------70:05----------
for session yeah yeah I'm glad you feel


---------70:09----------
that way I too feel like it's been heavy


---------70:10----------
like we've been so I called this work


---------70:12----------
yes it's like work


---------70:15----------
it's like exhausting yeah take a smell a


---------70:20----------
mental brainpower but how did you even


---------70:25----------
start like with twitch like was it


---------70:26----------
something you felt like because of


---------70:27----------
gaming you're like hey I could do that


---------70:29----------
as well or did someone recommend you


---------70:31----------
know so what happened was like I was


---------70:34----------
working with gamers like so I've been


---------70:36----------
working with gamers for about five or


---------70:37----------
six years and I realized that like I'm


---------70:40----------
having the same conversations with


---------70:42----------
people like over and over and over again


---------70:44----------
then maybe there are like 35 or 40


---------70:50----------
things that I talk about with gamers and


---------70:52----------
so I wonder


---------70:54----------
and like what happened is I started to


---------70:56----------
get like more popular I started getting


---------70:58----------
more requests for help than I can manage


---------71:01----------
mm-hmm and so then I had this crazy idea


---------71:04----------
and I was like I wonder if someone


---------71:05----------
because since I'm having the same 35 or


---------71:08----------
40 like core issues with gamers that we


---------71:11----------
work on I wonder if someone if I worked


---------71:16----------
with someone and people could watch it


---------71:18----------
could they benefit from it hmm and


---------71:21----------
that's why we started streaming that's


---------71:24----------
great that's really nice of you


---------71:26----------
I think everyone appreciates your


---------71:28----------
content cuz I keep to hearing from


---------71:30----------
people on my desk or that they watch you


---------71:33----------
and it actually helps hearing and like


---------71:35----------
relating to the issues each streamer has


---------71:39----------
or even you have so yeah that's great


---------71:42----------
yeah thank you


---------71:43----------
it's nice to be appreciated I feel very


---------71:46----------
supported by like us


---------71:50----------
I don't know how yes like our people


---------71:53----------
yeah so I feel like I'm not doing it


---------71:55----------
alone anymore which for what for many


---------71:57----------
years I felt like I was doing it alone


---------72:00----------
instead it bother you not really it I


---------72:05----------
just felt like it was insufficient


---------72:08----------
because what would happen is I get you


---------72:10----------
know calls from like Singapore and Iran


---------72:13----------
and you know Palestine and like yeah


---------72:21----------
like Thailand and you're like lots of


---------72:23----------
places in Europe obviously lots of


---------72:25----------
places in the US and Canada and people


---------72:28----------
would ask me for help and I was like I


---------72:29----------
just can't do that because I would also


---------72:31----------
you know I also have like a job where I


---------72:33----------
have to make money and support my family


---------72:34----------
and stuff like that so I was working on


---------72:36----------
that stuff and then I was pretty


---------72:39----------
academically involved at the institution


---------72:41----------
that I trained and things like that so


---------72:43----------
you know I had like all these like like


---------72:45----------
I sort of felt like I had my real life


---------72:46----------
which is like job and family and also


---------72:48----------
professional ambitions I was pretty


---------72:50----------
ambitious and worked pretty hard and you


---------72:53----------
know so it was like having a career and


---------72:56----------
then like the gaming stuff was sort of


---------72:57----------
on the side it was something that I felt


---------72:59----------
you know like I wanted to help these


---------73:00----------
people because I had suffered in the


---------73:02----------
same way you suffered


---------73:04----------
yeah oh yeah so you know


---------73:08----------
so I started playing video games when I


---------73:11----------
was a kid and then basically failed out


---------73:14----------
of college or almost failed out of


---------73:15----------
college after two years I don't know if


---------73:19----------
you know what a GPA is but like from


---------73:22----------
zero to four like for being all A's and


---------73:25----------
zero being all laughs I had less than a


---------73:27----------
2.0 which means I had less than a C


---------73:29----------
average


---------73:30----------
so I basically you know got C's D's and


---------73:33----------
F's it took me five years to graduate


---------73:36----------
because I failed a bunch of classes and


---------73:40----------
so it was really struggling and that's


---------73:42----------
the reason I sort of started going


---------73:44----------
towards the monk thing because I was


---------73:45----------
failing out of school and I went to


---------73:47----------
India and I stayed there for a few


---------73:48----------
months at an ashram or a monastery and I


---------73:52----------
discovered yoga and it was amazing and I


---------73:54----------
loved it and I decided I was gonna


---------73:56----------
become a monk


---------73:57----------
and I didn't care about school and


---------74:00----------
school was beneath me and all those


---------74:01----------
people who want jobs and careers and


---------74:03----------
families like I'm gonna be better than


---------74:05----------
them I'm gonna be deeply spiritual and


---------74:07----------
I'm going to rise above all these


---------74:08----------
material things and pursue this higher


---------74:12----------
goal which made me better than all the


---------74:15----------
people who lived life better than I did


---------74:18----------
because I sucked at life and they were


---------74:20----------
good at life and I needed some way to


---------74:22----------
feel better than them hmm


---------74:25----------
so that's why I wanted to become a monk


---------74:29----------
so bad so fundamentally became a monk


---------74:34----------
for the wrong reasons


---------74:35----------
yes I didn't actually become a monk but


---------74:37----------
yeah I was trained because right your


---------74:39----------
wife and children yes it's not really a


---------74:44----------
monk lifestyle no that's really


---------74:46----------
interested any others video games right


---------74:49----------
you can't own anything that's all I know


---------74:51----------
like yeah well too bad you have like


---------74:55----------
everything yeah it's yeah sex to be you


---------75:01----------
know oh yeah that's interesting


---------75:05----------
really really interesting I could listen


---------75:07----------
to your story actually [ __ ] what so till


---------75:10----------
you don't have anything to say anymore


---------75:12----------
because it's really how does it feel to


---------75:14----------
ask me questions I mean I like it I like


---------75:18----------
to get to know at the other side


---------75:21----------
it's like an exchange I gave you a lot


---------75:23----------
of my information I might as well take a


---------75:25----------
view of yours


---------75:25----------
yep oh that's good let me can I ask you


---------75:29----------
just you know one question about that


---------75:31----------
wouldn't be okay so I understand it in


---------75:35----------
exchange and I'm with that a hundred


---------75:36----------
percent mm-hmm would you feel okay if I


---------75:40----------
helped you and you didn't give me


---------75:42----------
anything in return


---------75:43----------
yes okay good I'm happy to it's just no


---------75:49----------
right now I guess iteration I'd like to


---------75:50----------
get to know more about uterus so we've


---------75:52----------
got so I've got about 15 minutes right


---------75:56----------
and so one thing is sometimes I teach


---------75:58----------
people to meditate and if you're


---------76:00----------
interested I can teach you how to


---------76:01----------
meditate or if you prefer you can ask


---------76:03----------
questions and I love to talk about


---------76:05----------
myself cuz I'm I used to do a lot of she


---------76:07----------
gone okay good Nick she going sorry good


---------76:10----------
fits yeah I might get back to that I


---------76:12----------
just stopped doing it since I came back


---------76:13----------
to Germany but now hearing that again


---------76:16----------
makes me really want to go back see dad


---------76:17----------
yeah don't you feel like the chi-gong


---------76:19----------
helped you um I think the reason that


---------76:26----------
stopped me was my Shifu for it not


---------76:28----------
helping me I think if it's just me and


---------76:30----------
my thoughts and let's say well that I


---------76:34----------
had a Shifu amah Master Shifu and I


---------76:38----------
think sometimes his words he said well


---------76:40----------
we would do the chi gong stop me from


---------76:43----------
relaxing cuz he would see it say things


---------76:44----------
that didn't sit well with me so I wasn't


---------76:47----------
really in my space it wasn't peace but


---------76:49----------
now that I'm alone I want to try that


---------76:51----------
again what would he say that wouldn't


---------76:53----------
sit well he would say things like this


---------76:58----------
is sip example like you should stop


---------77:00----------
listening to music you should take the


---------77:02----------
world and realize what's going around


---------77:04----------
you and I was like but I like being in


---------77:07----------
my music space I mean I understand what


---------77:09----------
he means but the demo was like hmm I


---------77:11----------
don't want to hear that no oh oh dude I


---------77:16----------
mean I kind of want to know what do you


---------77:18----------
mean oh here's the problem with Shi Fu's


---------77:21----------
okay yes and gurus is so like every now


---------77:24----------
and then there's like an enlightened


---------77:26----------
master and they really understand


---------77:27----------
something and then they teach their


---------77:29----------
disciples and then the problem is that


---------77:32----------
their disciples because


---------77:34----------
the master knows what the disciple needs


---------77:37----------
they tailor their teachings to a


---------77:40----------
particular disciple the problem is that


---------77:43----------
once the disciple grows up and then sort


---------77:45----------
of becomes a master may not be a truly


---------77:47----------
enlightened master but in the tradition


---------77:49----------
he like gets promoted and then he starts


---------77:52----------
teaching the problem is that the


---------77:54----------
teachings that he offers other people


---------77:56----------
are the teachings that his master gave


---------77:58----------
him which he believes are the true


---------78:00----------
teachings because they worked for him


---------78:01----------
but they're not true they just worked


---------78:03----------
for him and then they try to tell people


---------78:06----------
to like not listen to music yeah that's


---------78:10----------
so that was his path but it's not your


---------78:14----------
path hmm and and that's I see this a lot


---------78:19----------
so I have strong feelings about it


---------78:21----------
because I think that you know a good


---------78:23----------
teacher doesn't teaches you in the way


---------78:27----------
that you need to here not in the way


---------78:29----------
that they were taught mm-hmm yeah I


---------78:32----------
agree that's like so I thought she would


---------78:34----------
but stop me from fully submitting good


---------78:39----------
yeah thank God yes I am to me as I was a


---------78:45----------
little bit biased because he's like the


---------78:47----------
he did the choreographs for eight months


---------78:49----------
movies and was like oh my god that's so


---------78:51----------
awesome I want to be with him I wouldn't


---------78:53----------
be close to him so it could be close to


---------78:54----------
that pop culture yes I was a little bit


---------78:57----------
of a groupie to be honest yeah so that's


---------78:59----------
also you know the wrong reason and if


---------79:01----------
you're not careful there's a lot of


---------79:02----------
sexual misconduct and those kinds of


---------79:04----------
relationships - uh-huh


---------79:08----------
I don't think about that ya know I mean


---------79:12----------
it's I know a lot of people don't but


---------79:14----------
it's like it's a big problem all right


---------79:16----------
yeah okay huh yeah well the more you


---------79:21----------
know but it's you can't see so you said


---------79:27----------
we have like 10 minutes left do you need


---------79:28----------
to use that do you need to say something


---------79:30----------
or no no we can also go a little bit


---------79:34----------
over if you want to I don't mean to like


---------79:36----------
just you know that's what I was kind of


---------79:38----------
thinking about doing but if you have


---------79:39----------
questions I'm happy to answer no no I


---------79:41----------
just I'm just just in case I wanted to


---------79:43----------
check if there's something that someone


---------79:44----------
you mind that you really want to throw


---------79:45----------
it now so no it's very good no


---------79:48----------
main things so it sounds like you have a


---------79:49----------
meditative practice so I think that


---------79:50----------
that's great you want to just tell


---------79:52----------
people what Qigong is do because people


---------79:54----------
might not now oh I don't really know


---------79:56----------
myself to be honest sounds really oh


---------80:02----------
right now


---------80:04----------
sure like I actually have to sit on the


---------80:06----------
floor and like that's not it's like a


---------80:14----------
really personal space I don't think I


---------80:15----------
could I mean I could try to do it on


---------80:17----------
streem some one day know if it's like


---------80:20----------
very no don't don't share it if it's a


---------80:22----------
personal practice okay sorry but you can


---------80:25----------
google Qigong you can listen tell us


---------80:28----------
about it


---------80:29----------
okay it's again it's basically a type of


---------80:31----------
meditation which is connected to might


---------80:34----------
not be connected to again my Shifu set


---------80:36----------
those swings but I actually never


---------80:37----------
researched them so if I say something


---------80:39----------
please say stop that's not true so


---------80:41----------
basically he did Wing Chun and he


---------80:43----------
connected Qigong tubing Chun Wing Chun


---------80:46----------
is a martial art right yes and we would


---------80:51----------
do it every time before we would start


---------80:53----------
class we would do that to free our minds


---------80:55----------
and we do it afterwards for free our


---------80:57----------
minds especially it just to be one of


---------80:59----------
yourself and to be one with the one next


---------81:01----------
to you because it was like a group and


---------81:03----------
it's just about like being usually with


---------81:06----------
do it outdoors and it's like about being


---------81:08----------
connected to nature and just let you


---------81:13----------
mind flow it which is a little bit hard


---------81:15----------
when you're Shifu keeps talking so I


---------81:17----------
suggest just to listen to music or no


---------81:19----------
music at all just the nature sounds and


---------81:21----------
yeah so my understanding of Qi Gong is


---------81:24----------
that like so there are two practices


---------81:27----------
that are rooted in Indian and Chinese


---------81:29----------
culture so I I tend to focus on


---------81:31----------
Tai Chi or Tai Chi yeah and and so Tai


---------81:35----------
Chi is like kind of equivalent to what


---------81:37----------
is what common people think of as yoga


---------81:39----------
right which is Foster's so there's a


---------81:41----------
physical practice which is a mind-body


---------81:44----------
practice which in according to


---------81:47----------
scientific studies outperforms exercise


---------81:49----------
in terms of it's like healing capability


---------81:52----------
and its effect on depression and anxiety


---------81:53----------
and stuff like that so yoga and Tai Chi


---------81:55----------
are sort of equivalent and then yoga and


---------81:59----------
Tai Chi or or


---------82:01----------
young have paired practices that are


---------82:07----------
usually focused around the breath which


---------82:10----------
are brown I am and Qi Gong


---------82:12----------
so Branagh and Qi both mean the same


---------82:14----------
thing they mean life energy so what


---------82:17----------
their their practices that are actually


---------82:19----------
aimed at cultivating strengthening in


---------82:22----------
facilitating the flow of your life


---------82:25----------
energy or Qi yeah so yoga and Tai Chi


---------82:29----------
are like more physical practices Qi Gong


---------82:32----------
is a more energetic practice so I think


---------82:34----------
about it almost like in the realm of


---------82:36----------
energy healing and then our brawn I am


---------82:39----------
and then


---------82:41----------
meditation is actually even different


---------82:43----------
beyond that but that's that's how I sort


---------82:46----------
of conceptualize it what is meditation


---------82:48----------
like you said it's beyond that like what


---------82:51----------
so the first thing is that meditation


---------82:52----------
gets translated with two words that are


---------82:55----------
into English and one is a verb and one


---------82:58----------
is a state of mind so that oftentimes


---------82:59----------
confuses people


---------83:00----------
so meditation is something the state of


---------83:02----------
mind a meditation is something that


---------83:04----------
happens to you it's not something that


---------83:05----------
you do you can't meditate so Dionne is a


---------83:09----------
state of mind that happens to a person


---------83:13----------
when they are in a particular like


---------83:16----------
circumstance so you can cultivate it and


---------83:18----------
then da da na is a focusing practice


---------83:21----------
that's a verb so when I say I sit down


---------83:24----------
and I meditate on let's say you know


---------83:27----------
like a candle that's a verb I can sit


---------83:30----------
and I can stare at a candle for like 20


---------83:32----------
minutes and then if I'm lucky I enter a


---------83:35----------
particular state of mind while I'm


---------83:37----------
staring at the candle so the the realist


---------83:41----------
the truest form of meditation is not


---------83:42----------
even a verb it's not something that you


---------83:43----------
can do it's something that happens to


---------83:45----------
you it's a state it's not an action and


---------83:49----------
so in Qi Gong you may enter states of


---------83:51----------
mind of meditation I don't know let me


---------83:53----------
think if I know what the Chinese word


---------83:55----------
for that is I think they actually used


---------83:58----------
this they use the Sun script or Pali I


---------84:02----------
never really got into meditation


---------84:05----------
I always connect a method


---------84:10----------
maybe so Google was translating it as


---------84:13----------
Sean's own but I don't I'm not familiar


---------84:18----------
with that but I like how your voice


---------84:20----------
changed as soon as you said it cuz it's


---------84:21----------
a foreign awards it kind of went a


---------84:24----------
little bit different that's because I


---------84:27----------
used the my tone a pretty exaggerated


---------84:30----------
but that's his best decision although


---------84:35----------
it's been a while since you know I'm


---------84:38----------
rusty my Chinese is rusty but oh you


---------84:42----------
used to speak Chinese or yeah just sort


---------84:45----------
of how many Legos do you speak I mean at


---------84:50----------
various times of my life up to six let


---------84:53----------
me think about that


---------84:54----------
oh yeah but like not too well Donald's


---------85:02----------
okay but still impressive


---------85:05----------
so wait you're native English or yeah so


---------85:08----------
I'm not bilingual and then studied


---------85:10----------
Spanish through high school in college


---------85:12----------
and there's actually really hilarious


---------85:15----------
clip of me miss speaking Spanish oh and


---------85:18----------
then I also studied Mandarin and


---------85:20----------
Japanese because I was a weeb yeah and


---------85:27----------
then learned Hindi which is another


---------85:29----------
Indian language sort of along the way


---------85:31----------
right and I say all of them poorly now


---------85:34----------
what would do you speak of language or


---------85:36----------
what guys who speak German or yeah to be


---------85:39----------
honest I didn't really grow up bilingual


---------85:41----------
because my dad who's Asian Vietnamese he


---------85:45----------
grew up German so the country would help


---------85:49----------
me like I'd never learned it


---------85:50----------
unfortunately it's just English and


---------85:52----------
German and way aboot Japanese and


---------85:54----------
doesn't go beyond that we do is that is


---------85:57----------
that what how it's pronounced that's how


---------86:00----------
I print out like weep weeaboo it's like


---------86:03----------
way past the short-form has no family


---------86:06----------
is we boys we both always say weeaboo


---------86:10----------
maybe I am bronze no I know we abou


---------86:13----------
sounds far more cultured and far more


---------86:15----------
Japanese than Weibo which sounds like


---------86:17----------
Texan did y'all see those we bows down


---------86:21----------
there


---------86:21----------
you've got to be really careful there's


---------86:23----------
a we boys in the backyard they've got


---------86:25----------
their wife who's with him oh you got


---------86:28----------
that excellent of course oh yeah you


---------86:29----------
grew up there right I heard a little bit


---------86:31----------
about your black lives matter talk


---------86:33----------
before the stream that you said you grew


---------86:34----------
up there and you got a lot of negative


---------86:37----------
treatment due to you


---------86:40----------
I love Texas though I don't want to give


---------86:42----------
people the wrong impression


---------86:43----------
no I mean oh with racism and there was


---------86:46----------
actually I mean it's terrible but that


---------86:48----------
when I was growing up there was actually


---------86:49----------
a black man who was lynched in a in the


---------86:53----------
town next to where I lived it was


---------86:55----------
terrible and it was lynched yeah like I


---------86:58----------
don't think people have understood so


---------87:00----------
you know I think a lot of people talk


---------87:01----------
about I mean obviously people talk about


---------87:03----------
black lives matter but I don't think the


---------87:06----------
common American understands how bad


---------87:11----------
racism has been for how long of a time


---------87:17----------
mm-hmm like there were there were


---------87:20----------
literally like when I was growing up I


---------87:22----------
may have been like seven or eight years


---------87:23----------
old there were a group of people that


---------87:26----------
took a black man and tied him behind a


---------87:29----------
truck and drove until he died in that


---------87:34----------
[ __ ] happening back in like the late 80s


---------87:36----------
and 90s and it's cold are you I'm 37 huh


---------87:42----------
oh wow I mean yeah I can make sense I


---------87:45----------
mean all the experience you talked about


---------87:47----------
yeah okay cuz I figured like super first


---------87:50----------
law agrees I said like as I said I


---------87:52----------
forget like beginning of Ferdie but that


---------87:54----------
is no okay I'm just my maturity is


---------87:58----------
around 30 um I'm a few years behind no


---------88:03----------
it's that's fine I think I mean yeah


---------88:06----------
wow that that's actually that's that's


---------88:09----------
tough because in Germany let's say like


---------88:13----------
this I only had like one racist


---------88:15----------
experience and the rest wrote my life


---------88:17----------
that was pretty good but I've never


---------88:19----------
really seen actively racism in Germany


---------88:22----------
like you did mm-hmm that's a I mean they


---------88:26----------
I'm pretty sure we have racism in


---------88:27----------
Germany 100% it's just I I haven't seen


---------88:30----------
it Nick that yeah I think


---------88:35----------
you know the other interesting thing is


---------88:36----------
that like I think people underestimate


---------88:38----------
how much racism there is in the rest of


---------88:41----------
the world


---------88:42----------
Asians are awful yeah like so in India


---------88:46----------
like so I think America gets a bad rap


---------88:49----------
for being a super racist country I think


---------88:51----------
and in a sense we are but like I think


---------88:54----------
the big difference between you know part


---------88:56----------
some of my experiences in India and and


---------88:59----------
experiences here in the u.s. is that


---------89:01----------
like at least in the u.s. in the u.s.


---------89:03----------
like there's a fair number of people who


---------89:06----------
acknowledge that racism is a problem and


---------89:08----------
sure there are plenty of people who


---------89:09----------
don't think it's a big deal but in India


---------89:11----------
it's just so commonplace that it's like


---------89:13----------
completely accepted no one thinks that


---------89:16----------
it's a problem there hmm and it's like I


---------89:19----------
had so I was visiting a family member of


---------89:23----------
mine back in 2006 and then she was


---------89:27----------
asking me just you know about like you


---------89:30----------
know what was i up to and I was living


---------89:32----------
in a frat house in college at that time


---------89:34----------
as I told them yeah you know I've these


---------89:36----------
roommates just like all like tell me


---------89:37----------
about your friends and I was like yeah


---------89:39----------
you know I have a friend and he's a he's


---------89:41----------
like a 7-foot tall black dude and we


---------89:43----------
watch anime together and she was like


---------89:45----------
shocked and she was like aren't you


---------89:49----------
afraid he's gonna steal your stuff I was


---------89:53----------
like no she's like oh my god he's black


---------89:57----------
and she was like and like the thing is


---------90:00----------
like in India like people haven't seen a


---------90:02----------
black person it's just like in Asia it's


---------90:06----------
like still how strong the black and


---------90:08----------
white difference it's like when they see


---------90:09----------
white people like oh my god yes white


---------90:11----------
people when I see black people they're


---------90:12----------
like looking very judgy instead it's


---------90:15----------
awful


---------90:15----------
I see like the gazes people of color get


---------90:20----------
yeah in Asia it's even they own people


---------90:23----------
like if you're an Asian person and


---------90:24----------
you're like in the darker than the rest


---------90:26----------
you being discriminated for that as well


---------90:28----------
even though you're Asian yeah so this is


---------90:30----------
kind of cool I mean and no we're talking


---------90:33----------
about but so we do this with our our


---------90:36----------
producer so he's this guy named Moses


---------90:38----------
and Moses is going to do what wait is it


---------90:43----------
the mclovin guy yes


---------90:49----------
so so Moses so we're gonna do something


---------90:51----------
called put together a bio-data mm-hmm


---------90:54----------
what I'm confused about what anyway okay


---------90:59----------
just gonna wait wait I was confused


---------91:01----------
about your reaction oh and I saw a clip


---------91:04----------
of yours and I'm not sure if it's him


---------91:05----------
but it was someone of here who was on


---------91:08----------
the stream looks like mclovin from super


---------91:10----------
bed yeah hi girly so Moses what we're


---------91:15----------
gonna do is this is one of our stretch


---------91:17----------
goals for our fundraiser but we were


---------91:18----------
gonna get Moses to go on a virtual date


---------91:21----------
and then we're gonna we're gonna comment


---------91:24----------
in the background and and we Moses and I


---------91:28----------
were talking about I've actually done


---------91:29----------
this before where you know I used to be


---------91:32----------
pretty good at talking to women so like


---------91:33----------
what I would do like back when I was in


---------91:35----------
college is I would take my friends who


---------91:38----------
are like you know text chatting on AOL


---------91:40----------
Instant Messenger with girls and I would


---------91:43----------
flirt with the girls for them so that


---------91:45----------
they can go on a date and and so we were


---------91:49----------
Moses and I were talking about you know


---------91:55----------
whether I actually want to be like


---------91:56----------
coaching during the day you tell them


---------91:58----------
what to say or if we should just comment


---------92:01----------
with twitch chat no do it


---------92:03----------
do you like the excellent commentating


---------92:05----------
that's that's fun commentating or


---------92:07----------
telling him what to say think that both


---------92:09----------
like I think the comment is also fun but


---------92:12----------
I think actually telling me what to say


---------92:13----------
when he's like looking lost it's kind of


---------92:15----------
fun no but I mean I I think it anyway so


---------92:18----------
we were just joking about that the


---------92:19----------
reason I brought up Moses is because


---------92:21----------
actually so what we're gonna do so the


---------92:23----------
way we got to this is that in Indian


---------92:25----------
culture we have like arranged marriages


---------92:27----------
in the way that you find a candidate for


---------92:29----------
an arranged marriage is something called


---------92:32----------
a bio-data so it's like a resume but


---------92:35----------
about like like it actually so bio-datas


---------92:37----------
have existed long before online dating


---------92:39----------
profiles and it's basically an online


---------92:40----------
dating profile that people in India have


---------92:43----------
been doing for thousands of years so


---------92:44----------
they like create a profile for a person


---------92:46----------
it used to be like physical pieces of


---------92:48----------
paper that would get faxed across the


---------92:50----------
world and and part of the what they


---------92:52----------
would put on the bio-data is how dark or


---------92:54----------
light your skin is right and so it was


---------92:58----------
like they would ask you you know


---------93:02----------
slurring my sister that's okay okay so


---------93:09----------
please continue


---------93:10----------
how old is she she is dank free this


---------93:14----------
yeah oh that's so cool


---------93:16----------
I happen to Emma was three year old out


---------93:18----------
there then there's another one actually


---------93:21----------
well how is how old is she


---------93:23----------
and the older one yeah she is seven okay


---------93:28----------
hi ever I have an almost three year old


---------93:30----------
and an almost five-year-old weight both


---------93:36----------
both boys girls girls oh my god I


---------93:40----------
wouldn't exhausting now I think in my


---------93:44----------
case I still could be up a ceramic


---------93:45----------
exhaust of girls I want boys like that's


---------93:48----------
my goal like being a mom and having like


---------93:50----------
boys and maybe one girl I think cuz I


---------93:53----------
have follows sister so it's that's why I


---------93:55----------
say it's exhausting maybe if it's just -


---------93:57----------
I don't know


---------93:58----------
I think Parenthood in general is


---------94:00----------
exhausting but I find that user


---------94:02----------
I mean so like I took my two year old


---------94:05----------
God they are the oldest is five the real


---------94:10----------
trouble starts at the age of ten eleven


---------94:12----------
that's what I mean


---------94:13----------
yes right now they are really nice like


---------94:15----------
that ace you have read that ODEs it's


---------94:18----------
great so I took my to do you know wall


---------94:20----------
Marta's mm-hmm okay so I like what my


---------94:24----------
two-year-old was like to maybe like two


---------94:25----------
in half so she needed a new pair of


---------94:28----------
shoes and I don't really know anything


---------94:30----------
about fashion or clothing or art or


---------94:32----------
decoration or any of that stuff and I


---------94:35----------
mean you can see my room and this is how


---------94:37----------
I would leave but if it was my choice my


---------94:39----------
lipstick yeah and so I took my two year


---------94:44----------
old to Walmart one day because she


---------94:45----------
needed a new pair of shoes and like we


---------94:47----------
were in Texas so we went to Walmart


---------94:49----------
because that's what you do when you're


---------94:50----------
in Texas and then you know we like


---------94:53----------
looked at a wall of shoes and then like


---------94:55----------
I tried to get her I tried a couple on


---------94:58----------
and she didn't like them and then I was


---------94:59----------
like because she's - right so two year


---------95:01----------
old it's like like stuff and so then I


---------95:04----------
ended up asking I was like which one do


---------95:05----------
you want again she's like I don't want


---------95:06----------
to me I was like you don't want shoes


---------95:11----------
and she's like no and then left


---------95:13----------
empty-handed and then my wife was like


---------95:15----------
what


---------95:16----------
you know why don't you she needs shoes


---------95:17----------
and I was like she didn't want any of


---------95:18----------
them I thought it was great


---------95:20----------
she's 2 years old and she already like


---------95:21----------
knows what she wants and does I don't


---------95:23----------
have to learn that [ __ ] she kind of


---------95:24----------
takes care of ourselves it's pretty cool


---------95:25----------
yeah that's what I mean like at that age


---------95:28----------
they're pretty straightforward what they


---------95:30----------
want in their life and what they don't


---------95:31----------
that's why I said like the age of 10


---------95:34----------
turn 10 periods maybe depending on hold


---------95:39----------
or like in general puberty hits


---------95:40----------
definitely 11 L 11 12 I think even 10


---------95:43----------
most girls and that's a really difficult


---------95:47----------
time like my oldest sister she's not 14


---------95:51----------
just one year ago she was they went for


---------95:54----------
three years which was unbearable to be


---------95:56----------
honest like it was tough I was even when


---------96:02----------
I was really really bad at that age I


---------96:04----------
was like you considered an angel before


---------96:06----------
it had turned like the time and then it


---------96:08----------
just went downhill


---------96:09----------
but yeah yes I've heard of saying girls


---------96:14----------
yeah I just meant that yours unsink


---------96:19----------
yeah yeah about that I don't know if


---------96:21----------
that's like scientifically true or not


---------96:23----------
no but girls like to say like oh we


---------96:25----------
don't sing that's why we're both in the


---------96:28----------
bad mood we always say things like then


---------96:30----------
yeah that's you know we'll see I'll get


---------96:33----------
I'll get back to you but walk again in


---------96:36----------
ten years five to six years if I need


---------96:39----------
advice you can I got you I got enough to


---------96:42----------

---------97:08----------
wife has two sisters mm-hmm so it's


---------97:12----------
three girls and then so far she and her


---------97:15----------
sister one of her sisters has kids so so


---------97:19----------
far their generation has produced three


---------97:21----------
girls uh-huh so like it's her and two


---------97:25----------
sisters no boys and then so far all of


---------97:27----------
their kids have been girl


---------97:28----------
oh thank you genetic like predisposition


---------97:33----------
towards breeding tourism that's


---------97:36----------
interesting cuz my my dad it's like okay


---------97:39----------
of course he's a boy so it doesn't come


---------97:41----------
but he's like one of the only ones and


---------97:44----------
the rest are all sisters and they


---------97:46----------
children are all girls except for one


---------97:47----------
boy so it's like just my dad one boy and


---------97:50----------
the rest all girls there may be some


---------97:52----------
kind of genetics like something about


---------97:54----------
the way that the egg develops or even


---------97:57----------
the spirit like there may be some kind


---------97:59----------
of I mean it could just be coincidence


---------98:01----------
because you know across the world there


---------98:02----------
gonna be millions of people who only


---------98:04----------
have girls right millions of people


---------98:06----------
whose girls only have girls just


---------98:08----------
statistically but sometimes it makes me


---------98:10----------
wonder now the more interesting thing is


---------98:13----------
that both my wife and her younger sister


---------98:16----------
are married to psychiatrists no way


---------98:20----------
there's a there's an interesting


---------98:22----------
question about whether her youngest


---------98:23----------
sister will also marry a psychiatrist


---------98:25----------
oh yeah that's actually whoa what I mean


---------98:31----------
at this point it's a really a


---------98:32----------
coincidence or it's just like a mistake


---------98:34----------
in them this is a bug query unclear oh


---------98:38----------
that's interesting


---------98:40----------
holy crap yeah I hope I have boys I hope


---------98:43----------
I break the circuit and for out some


---------98:46----------
boys yeah cool well you know yeah very


---------98:50----------
cool good luck with that you know I


---------98:55----------
would imagine that it's gonna be a


---------98:56----------
couple of years before you go down that


---------98:58----------
road but I mean in my family we all have


---------99:01----------
for every early children mmm and I've


---------99:03----------
already said to myself if everything


---------99:05----------
goes well like financially and like my


---------99:07----------
me bit because I always said like I


---------99:08----------
won't have children till I know I can


---------99:10----------
feed myself feeds to human beings and


---------99:14----------
just in case if something goes wrong


---------99:15----------
help my siblings it's like I need to


---------99:17----------
have that amount in order to say okay


---------99:19----------
now I can have children and I hope it's


---------99:20----------
like in the next 10 years yeah and yeah


---------99:24----------
that'd be great


---------99:25----------
well thanks cat yeah really don't ya


---------99:32----------
know yeah I think I think it can be good


---------99:35----------
to talk about light things and laugh


---------99:37----------
after we talk about heavy things


---------99:39----------
agreed yeah yeah it's like


---------99:42----------
after a night of drinking just having a


---------99:44----------
nice soup in the cup of tea that's how I


---------99:47----------
see it yeah yeah absolutely I haven't


---------99:51----------
done an item actually I had the most


---------99:52----------
alcohol I've had in a long time after


---------99:54----------
during one of our in one of our streams


---------99:56----------
in May I feel you


---------99:59----------
it streams and alcohol is just it's it's


---------100:02----------
dangerous what's funny


---------100:04----------
Ivan yeah yeah I definitely find us why


---------100:06----------
it's dangerous because I want to do it


---------100:07----------
all the time and yeah yeah it's hope so


---------100:12----------
Jane this has been fun great yeah I was


---------100:17----------
I think I unfortunately do have to kind


---------100:19----------
of get going but yep I know if there's


---------100:23----------
anything else that we can do to help you


---------100:25----------
or support you I'd love I'd love to hear


---------100:27----------
what you think about we've talked about


---------100:29----------
today and and you know you know down the


---------100:32----------
road like like think about it and see


---------100:34----------
what works for you and concretely one


---------100:36----------
thing I would suggest is that you really


---------100:38----------
do pay attention to the way that you


---------100:40----------
treat yourself mm-hmm and and really


---------100:44----------
think about whether you can cut yourself


---------100:46----------
a little bit of slack and whether it's


---------100:48----------
okay for you to not be perfect and


---------100:52----------
eventually for you to trust other human


---------100:54----------
beings I try yes they don't make it easy


---------100:58----------
they really don't this has been great I


---------101:04----------
am pleasantly surprised because I really


---------101:07----------
was the freight as I think so far we


---------101:09----------
also said things right nothing could be


---------101:11----------
clipped they could have been like out of


---------101:12----------
context like so I think we say from that


---------101:14----------
side as well maybe though we'll limp


---------101:17----------
limp joke don't underestimate what


---------101:19----------
twitch chat is capable of all right I


---------101:22----------
think I think one of the worst things


---------101:24----------
that you could possibly say is that we


---------101:26----------
didn't say anything that could be


---------101:27----------
clipped because now well god damn it yes


---------101:31----------
careful don't tempt them


---------101:33----------
sorry chats they're like temperamental


---------101:36----------
John's it's like as long as I respect


---------101:38----------
them they'll respect you but if you you


---------101:41----------
know if you say that Zeus doesn't can't


---------101:43----------
do [ __ ] to you then he's gonna strike


---------101:44----------
you as a lightning bolt and teach you


---------101:45----------
otherwise


---------101:46----------
well can we rewind is there like no but


---------101:54----------
yeah this has been fun yeah thank you


---------101:56----------
for having


---------101:57----------
me thank you thank you for coming and


---------101:59----------
thank you for you know sharing and being


---------102:01----------
honest and authentic and and funny and


---------102:03----------
entertaining and all that good stuff


---------102:05----------
my Beckett's you and you know good luck


---------102:08----------
seriously I mean that and if there's


---------102:10----------
some way we can support you down the


---------102:11----------
road or if you want to come back on


---------102:12----------
stream at some point let us know


---------102:14----------
stay safe obviously and and we I really


---------102:17----------
do hope you can start progressing again


---------102:20----------
yeah that would be it would be great I


---------102:23----------
just let first think and everything we


---------102:26----------
talked about and then we see further


---------102:27----------
yeah take care of Jake all right you too


---------102:30----------
bye okay


---------102:39----------
all righty guys so thank you guys very


---------102:45----------
much for coming and yeah so Jane is fun


---------102:50----------
yeah it's a lot of fun she's awesome and


---------102:53----------
I don't know if you guys saw what I was


---------102:57----------
seeing like I try to point it out to her


---------102:58----------
my hope is that y'all were able to catch


---------103:01----------
more of what I was trying to say then


---------103:04----------
maybe I could explain which I think


---------103:06----------
generally speaking twitches good at like


---------103:10----------
I think you guys I don't know if you


---------103:11----------
guys caught the subtlety of her self


---------103:14----------
judgment the subtlety of her like how


---------103:17----------
she's an island right so I think that's


---------103:19----------
the tricky thing is that like she views


---------103:21----------
herself as an island which is


---------103:23----------
understandable because when you view


---------103:25----------
yourself as an island you don't connect


---------103:27----------
to other human beings it's safe and and


---------103:31----------
you don't have to be hurt and yeah let


---------103:40----------
me just think about what else want to


---------103:42----------
say about that yeah you know I think at


---------103:48----------
some point we could talk about this sort


---------103:51----------
of hyper sexual thinking and try to


---------103:54----------
understand that a little bit better if


---------103:56----------
almost from a meditative aspect like


---------103:58----------
what's going on in terms of your mind


---------104:00----------
and how does it function and all that


---------104:03----------
kind of good stuff


---------104:04----------
Wow thanks for the you know bazillion


---------104:09----------
subs Paxton Lancaster dodged easy dodged


---------104:17----------
thanks man


---------104:18----------
thanks for the support bro I assume


---------104:21----------
you're a dude because your name is


---------104:23----------
Paxton but you never know so yeah you


---------104:29----------
know we can definitely explore that more


---------104:30----------
and try to understand the nature of the


---------104:32----------
origin of the sexual thoughts and dig


---------104:34----------
into the trauma and stuff like that but


---------104:36----------
my my my initial instinct is that like I


---------104:42----------
told her is that I think that you know


---------104:44----------
thoughts in your mind tend to serve a


---------104:46----------
particular purpose even if it's not a


---------104:48----------
healthy one like they're there for a


---------104:50----------
reason and I wonder if just the sexual


---------104:52----------
hyper sexual thinking gives her a way to


---------104:55----------
think about other people where she


---------104:57----------
doesn't have to think about them in


---------104:59----------
another way like it frees her from like


---------105:02----------
connecting and relating and like having


---------105:05----------
to trust people and oddly enough I think


---------105:07----------
what's incredibly traumatic about her


---------105:09----------
being beat up by a bunch of like when


---------105:11----------
she was seven years old


---------105:12----------
it's it's subtle but it's it's not just


---------105:15----------
that she was attacked by kids


---------105:16----------
it's that adult stood by and did nothing


---------105:18----------
and if you think about like feeling


---------105:21----------
isolated and hopeless and losing faith


---------105:23----------
in humanity it's being a child and


---------105:25----------
having adults watch as you get hurt and


---------105:30----------
and that's really devastating and I see


---------105:33----------
this a lot in terms of it's it's weird I


---------105:35----------
don't know how to say this but when I


---------105:37----------
work with people who grew up with


---------105:39----------
patients who like you know have PTSD


---------105:41----------
from like abusive households


---------105:43----------
oddly enough it's not the abusive parent


---------105:46----------
that causes them to lose faith in


---------105:48----------
humanity it's the parent who couldn't


---------105:51----------
stop or didn't try to stop the abusive


---------105:54----------
parent that's what really [ __ ] them in


---------105:57----------
terms of like you know damaging and and


---------106:02----------
to have a parent watch violet because


---------106:05----------
you know that your abusive parent is


---------106:06----------
sort of a bad parent but it's like the


---------106:10----------
other parent who loves you and like


---------106:13----------
literally will you know wipe the blood


---------106:16----------
off of your forehead and put a bandage


---------106:19----------
on


---------106:20----------
it's that parent standing by while you


---------106:23----------
get beat that can be like incredibly


---------106:26----------
devastating and I mean that overall you


---------106:31----------
know all that [ __ ] is sad but you know


---------106:33----------
so we can we can think a little bit I


---------106:34----------
really do hope that Jade starts to treat


---------106:38----------
herself better and I'm sure she maybe


---------106:41----------
she's gonna watch this but then I I


---------106:42----------
think the the reason that that really


---------106:43----------
becomes important is because you know if


---------106:47----------
you it sounds like she wants to be a mom


---------106:49----------
one day and I'm sure she's gonna be a


---------106:50----------
fantastic mom but one of the best gifts


---------106:52----------
she can give to her children is knowing


---------106:55----------
how to love herself because they're


---------106:58----------
going to learn they're gonna learn from


---------107:00----------
the way that she treats them but they're


---------107:02----------
also gonna learn from the way that she


---------107:04----------
treats herself so I really hope she gets


---------107:07----------
there because I think she's gonna be an


---------107:10----------
awesome mom and yeah so don't forget


---------107:16----------
that


---------107:19----------
don't forget that you deserve or you


---------107:22----------
should even if you care about other


---------107:24----------
people more than yourself that don't


---------107:28----------
underestimate the power of an impact of


---------107:31----------
the impact that you can make by being


---------107:34----------
healthy and caring about yourself


---------107:36----------
because you can help so much people by


---------107:38----------
just doing that you know yeah it's it's


---------107:42----------
it's really amazing what how you can


---------107:45----------
influence someone's life without without


---------107:50----------
really realizing it and I've seen all


---------107:52----------
kinds of profound impacts in my own life


---------107:54----------
and in other people's lives from you


---------107:56----------
know is something as simple as holding


---------107:57----------
the door or helping someone you know


---------108:00----------
like who's moving on the street like if


---------108:02----------
you just help them take a box up it's


---------108:04----------
like night and day and so and so you


---------108:06----------
really do deserve to treat yourself


---------108:07----------
better and and think about yourself in a


---------108:10----------
healthy way and don't underestimate the


---------108:13----------
impact that you'll have on other people


---------108:15----------
when you start loving yourself yeah so


---------108:21----------
thank you guys very much for supporting


---------108:22----------
what we do here I'm all up Kanodia I'm a


---------108:27----------
psychiatrist but really here I'm just


---------108:29----------
here as a person and our coaching


---------108:32----------
program launched yesterday and hopefully


---------108:34----------
it's working well I'll find out in about


---------108:36----------
an hour whether people are able to sign


---------108:38----------
up and actually like get connected and


---------108:40----------
all that kind of stuff because if we


---------108:41----------
vote those stuff with like just a lot of


---------108:44----------
brilliant people from our community with


---------108:47----------
very limited resources and thank you


---------108:50----------
guys for all of the support because now


---------108:52----------
we have more resources and we want to do


---------108:54----------
better for you guys because the system


---------108:57----------
right now doesn't do enough and so you


---------109:00----------
know that we can rage at the system all


---------109:02----------
we want to but it's been always been my


---------109:04----------
belief that you know Mahatma Gandhi sort


---------109:08----------
of used these words and that's be the


---------109:10----------
change that you want to see in the world


---------109:11----------
and so that's what we're here to do


---------109:14----------
we're here to you know tackle what we


---------109:16----------
can as individuals and I guess as a


---------109:18----------
group but really I just show up and I


---------109:19----------
try to do the best that I can and don't


---------109:22----------
underestimate the power of what you're


---------109:24----------
capable of if you just show up and try


---------109:26----------
to do the best that you can and no


---------109:28----------
amount of shame or being a piece of [ __ ]


---------109:30----------
or a fan


---------109:31----------
in life will ever take away the power


---------109:33----------
that you bring to the table when you


---------109:35----------
show up and you do the best that you can


---------109:37----------
and I think a lot of people across


---------109:40----------
America are doing that right now and I


---------109:41----------
think that that counts for a lot


---------109:44----------
so yeah Gandhi wasn't perfect


---------109:55----------
yeah I know Gandhi's flaws so I'll say


---------109:59----------
one last thing about Gandhi I think that


---------110:01----------
just because a person wasn't good


---------110:03----------
doesn't mean that you can't learn from


---------110:06----------
them and I try to look for knowledge


---------110:09----------
wherever I can find it and yeah


---------110:13----------
it's a pet oh I don't think he was a pet


---------110:15----------
of dad I haven't heard he was incredibly


---------110:16----------
racist


---------110:17----------
so that pet you know but anyway oh yeah


---------110:26----------
are studying DLC do we have time for


---------110:31----------
that
