---------00:55----------
I'm going to use it so you must learn to


---------00:58----------

---------01:00----------
I want to take the thumb block the right


---------01:02----------
nostril and breathe in


---------01:10----------
switch and breathe out


---------01:16----------

---------01:47----------
switch out


---------01:53----------
you


---------01:55----------
you shouldn't be smelling anything okay


---------01:58----------
so let me just


---------02:01----------
okay so what you want to do is block one


---------02:02----------
also breathe in through one switch


---------02:04----------
breathe out through the other and then


---------02:06----------
breathe in through the same nostril


---------02:08----------

---------02:11----------
I'm gonna start demonstrating one yeah


---------02:14----------
like so you guys need to stop [ __ ]


---------02:16----------

---------02:18----------
actually do it because I mean watching


---------02:20----------
people meditate isn't gonna do [ __ ] for


---------02:22----------
you like you have to actually have to


---------02:24----------
meditate right like that's why we're


---------02:25----------
here so


---------02:28----------
yeah so one of your nostrils is going to


---------02:30----------
be blocked


---------02:32----------
right and it's okay if you do this you


---------02:34----------
can do pinky if you need to so one of


---------02:36----------
your nostrils is going to be more


---------02:37----------
blocked than the other


---------02:39----------
that's completely normal if you have a


---------02:41----------
deviated septum you shouldn't do this


---------02:43----------
case in point yeah if you have a


---------02:45----------
deviated septum don't do this practice


---------02:47----------
so


---------02:50----------
I'm gonna I'm gonna demonstrate I'm


---------02:52----------
gonna close my eyes so I want you guys


---------02:53----------
to make sure you get the rhythm so it's


---------02:55----------
in switch out in switch out in switch


---------02:59----------
out in switch out it's not in switch out


---------03:04----------
switch in switch out you see that that's


---------03:08----------
the same one every time


---------03:12----------
so your spine needs to be straight


---------03:15----------
that's the only important requirement


---------03:16----------
you can stand or said it doesn't matter


---------03:17----------
so now we're gonna practice so block the


---------03:20----------
right nostril


---------03:21----------
that's okay you get it so G you can just


---------03:23----------
use the pinky


---------03:32----------
you


---------05:22----------
go ahead and finish the round that


---------05:24----------
you're on


---------05:26----------
let your eyes remain closed


---------05:34----------
and just sit with the natural slowing of


---------05:37----------
your thoughts


---------05:43----------
you


---------05:47----------
EAL the slowness of your breath


---------05:54----------
you


---------05:59----------
now put your palms together in front of


---------06:01----------
you


---------06:03----------
to rub them together rub rub rub rub rub


---------06:05----------
rub feel the warmth the friction and


---------06:07----------
then cut them over your eyes


---------06:12----------
now I want you to take a deep breath in


---------06:16----------
and as you exhale


---------06:17----------
slowly open your eyes


---------06:21----------
let your hands come down


---------06:28----------
you


---------06:32----------
you


---------06:34----------
okay


---------06:36----------
so we'll pick back up I think on Friday


---------06:40----------
so I'm going to be Co swimming with


---------06:43----------
Devin Nash on Friday from three to five


---------06:47----------
Eastern


---------06:49----------
and okay could you explain what we just


---------06:52----------
did


---------06:55----------
yeah okay so I guess I guess we're not


---------06:58----------
done streaming okay so let me explain a


---------07:00----------
little bit about meditation so the first


---------07:03----------
thing is yeah you should let your mind


---------07:07----------
go wherever it wants to but the whole


---------07:09----------
goal of switching the fingers is


---------07:15----------
is that it returns your attention to the


---------07:18----------
present so as your mind starts to wander


---------07:20----------
like this is what happens with your mind


---------07:22----------
your mind has a thought and then you


---------07:24----------
feed into that thought and it begets


---------07:25----------
another thought and then the thoughts in


---------07:28----------
your mind start breeding right and then


---------07:30----------
soon you have like an infestation of


---------07:32----------
thoughts and that's what anxiety is like


---------07:35----------
if you think about people who suffer


---------07:36----------
from anxiety they worry about one thing


---------07:38----------
they're like oh my god like I was


---------07:40----------
walking and like one of my shoes is


---------07:41----------
muddy and then like what are people


---------07:43----------
gonna think are they going to think that


---------07:44----------
I don't know how to dress myself are


---------07:46----------
they gonna think I'm dirty like one


---------07:47----------
thought leads to another thought leads


---------07:49----------
to another thought leads to another


---------07:50----------
thought and so the thoughts will start


---------07:52----------
to breed


---------07:53----------
now thoughts are gonna have a certain


---------07:55----------
energy or momentum they're kind of like


---------07:57----------
you know if I if I like roll a tire down


---------07:59----------
the street like the tire is gonna fall


---------08:01----------
over at some point but it has some


---------08:03----------
momentum and if I keep feeding the


---------08:06----------
thoughts the tire is gonna keep going


---------08:08----------
and my mind is gonna keep going that's


---------08:10----------
what happens in anxiety and then the


---------08:12----------
thoughts become overwhelming when we


---------08:14----------
meditate the momentum of your thoughts


---------08:17----------
is still gonna be there but the


---------08:19----------
advantage of doing a practice like this


---------08:21----------
is that you have to return to the


---------08:23----------
present and like you have to pay


---------08:25----------
attention and every time you pay


---------08:27----------
attention to switching your breath and


---------08:29----------
focusing on your breath you stop paying


---------08:31----------
attention to your thoughts and you start


---------08:33----------
to stop feeding them so even though a


---------08:35----------
thought may pop up if you return to the


---------08:37----------
practice that thought will just drift


---------08:39----------
away and you'll be back to square one


---------08:40----------
and the longer you do the practice the


---------08:43----------
fewer thoughts are gonna pop up and so


---------08:46----------
the goal of this practice is to enter a


---------08:48----------
no mind state which is consciousness


---------08:50----------
without mental activity so we it's like


---------08:53----------
a hard state of mind to really think


---------08:55----------
about but it's it's like a very


---------09:00----------
important


---------09:02----------
like it's just a really simple principle


---------09:04----------
which is that you know you you want to


---------09:06----------
focus your attention on the present and


---------09:07----------
let the thoughts go and the more you let


---------09:09----------
the thoughts go the more you're gonna


---------09:11----------
enter closer to a state of mind where


---------09:13----------
your consciousness without thinking so


---------09:15----------
all you are is pure awareness and that's


---------09:18----------
the growth goal


---------09:21----------
now people ask me like what does this do


---------09:24----------
that's the most fundamental thing there


---------09:27----------
are a lot of there are a lot of specific


---------09:30----------
attributes to the meditation that I


---------09:31----------
teach and I can't really go into that


---------09:33----------
but maybe what we can do is have a have


---------09:35----------
a stream exclusively about like the


---------09:37----------
science and theory behind meditation so


---------09:40----------
we can cover like from a neuroscience


---------09:42----------
and physiologic perspective like what


---------09:44----------
does it do to your brain what does it do


---------09:46----------
to your hormones what does it do to your


---------09:48----------
cortisol level what does it do to your


---------09:49----------
adrenaline what does it do to your


---------09:50----------
sympathetic nervous system and the other


---------09:55----------
side of that is like what are the Yogi's


---------09:57----------
in India like say like why do they say


---------09:58----------
this is good because they started doing


---------10:00----------
this stuff before we had MRI scanners


---------10:02----------
and before we had heart rate monitors so


---------10:05----------
what is their theory behind why this


---------10:06----------
stuff works so let me just focus on


---------10:10----------
meditation for a second so you want to


---------10:11----------
do this for 3 to 5 minutes at a time and


---------10:13----------
then you ideally want to do it every day


---------10:18----------
but let's start with 3 to 5 minutes a


---------10:20----------
day for 3 days a week and how do you


---------10:23----------
keep track of time so there - what you


---------10:25----------
can set a timer if you want to but the


---------10:27----------
other thing that you can do is just do


---------10:28----------
it until you're done doing it which I


---------10:30----------
know sounds weird but you just start the


---------10:32----------
practice you can count like a certain


---------10:34----------
number of breaths like you can do nine


---------10:35----------
breaths or 18 breaths or just like do it


---------10:38----------
until you're done and I know that sounds


---------10:40----------
weird but you'll be surprised you'll


---------10:41----------
know when you're done for the day and


---------10:42----------
that's ok don't be judgmental for


---------10:44----------
yourself just just focus on on doing it
