to manage confidence and doubt and all


---------01:25----------
that kind of stuff

---------01:36----------
and uh hang out with chat some


---------01:39----------
so yeah


---------01:41----------
a couple of other uh


---------01:44----------
a couple of other


---------01:46----------
notes um so next week we're not gonna be


---------01:49----------
on a regular stream schedule


---------01:51----------
we've got um


---------01:53----------
we've got another project super secret


---------01:55----------
project that we're working on at hg


---------01:57----------
which uh hopefully we may stream so i


---------02:00----------
think we're gonna be around on monday


---------02:01----------
for austin show and then after that


---------02:02----------
we're gonna be


---------02:03----------
out probably for the rest of the week


---------02:05----------
and then we'll resume a regular sleep a


---------02:08----------
streaming schedule starting in november


---------02:11----------
a couple of other things that people are


---------02:13----------
kind of curious about


---------02:15----------
so um here at healthy gamer we do a lot


---------02:17----------
of stuff for gamers but then we also do


---------02:19----------
a lot of stuff for parents of gamers so


---------02:22----------
uh you know we'll sometimes get requests


---------02:24----------
from parents who are like hey my son is


---------02:25----------
like oh like they're having problems and


---------02:27----------
you know they're not doing things and


---------02:29----------
um


---------02:31----------
you know like they play too many video


---------02:32----------
games and then they'll be like they'll


---------02:35----------
ask us like hey can you like can i


---------02:37----------
enroll my son in your coaching program


---------02:39----------
and we'll be like well if he wants to


---------02:40----------
come he's more than welcome to


---------02:42----------
but you can't enroll him what you can do


---------02:44----------
is enroll yourself in our parent


---------02:46----------
coaching program


---------02:47----------
and then they say well no i'm not the


---------02:49----------
one with the problem my kid is the one


---------02:50----------
with the problem and that's where we're


---------02:51----------
like well we're not so sure we agree


---------02:53----------
with that


---------02:54----------
so we are actually going to be um


---------02:57----------
launching more parent coaching spots on


---------02:59----------
november 11th so some of that we may


---------03:02----------
actually try to do like some content uh


---------03:05----------
around parents


---------03:07----------
and so be prepared for that so like we


---------03:09----------
may have some parent and family related


---------03:11----------
questions people who are in


---------03:13----------
relationships with gamers and things


---------03:14----------
like that


---------03:16----------
so um you know we're i i think it's


---------03:19----------
actually something that we don't really


---------03:21----------
do a whole lot on stream which is


---------03:22----------
actually a lot of fun i really enjoy


---------03:24----------
working with parents i really enjoy


---------03:26----------
helping parents sort of better


---------03:27----------
communicate and understand their kids


---------03:29----------
and also helping like parents work on


---------03:31----------
themselves because a lot of times the


---------03:33----------
the problems that children have will be


---------03:35----------
like related to like parents


---------03:37----------
um so you know hopefully we'll we'll


---------03:41----------
do a little bit more of that and kind of


---------03:42----------
support


---------03:43----------
um you know parent-child relationships


---------03:46----------
in terms of like communicating but


---------03:48----------
understanding each other and things like


---------03:49----------
that


---------03:51----------
i need to enroll yeah so good luck with


---------03:53----------
my mom i need to enroll my wife exactly


---------03:55----------
so that's what we try to do so i know


---------03:57----------
it's kind of unorthodox i know it's a


---------03:59----------
little bit uh weird right because like


---------04:01----------
we're healthy gamer but i do think that


---------04:04----------
um


---------04:05----------
a big part of


---------04:08----------
what you all struggle with as gay or


---------04:10----------
what we struggle with as gamers like


---------04:11----------
it's not just us right there's a lot of


---------04:13----------
things in our lives there are a lot of


---------04:15----------
relationships that we have


---------04:17----------
sometimes we have toxic influences and


---------04:19----------
like working on that side is like really


---------04:21----------
important too


---------04:23----------
you can enroll joe mama that's the one


---------04:25----------
exception


---------04:27----------
um


---------04:30----------
dr k's guide to secret projects okay so


---------04:32----------
let's start talking about ti


---------04:36----------
all right so for those of you that don't


---------04:37----------
know there is an esport called dota 2


---------04:41----------
and every year they have or most years


---------04:43----------
anyway


---------04:44----------
they have a major tournament called the


---------04:46----------
international and the international is


---------04:48----------
the largest esports prize pool like


---------04:51----------
basically every year so this year it was


---------04:53----------
like a 45 million dollar prize pool and


---------04:55----------
you've got 16 to 18 teams i think that


---------04:58----------
are competing


---------04:59----------
um every year


---------05:02----------
and so i had uh the honor of


---------05:04----------
accompanying evil geniuses


---------05:06----------
um


---------05:07----------
to the international and we had been


---------05:08----------
working together for actually the whole


---------05:10----------
year so we'll talk about that in a


---------05:12----------
second


---------05:13----------
but here's like the first thing so i've


---------05:14----------
done a lot of work in esports but i have


---------05:16----------
never accompanied an actual team and


---------05:19----------
like you know


---------05:21----------
been with them


---------05:23----------
intensively for


---------05:24----------
such a large tournament i mean i guess


---------05:26----------
theoretically it's you know ti's the


---------05:28----------
biggest tournament of the year in


---------05:29----------
esports in general


---------05:31----------
and boy like the experience is like


---------05:33----------
absolutely wild so the first thing that


---------05:34----------
like i was very surprised about is i've


---------05:37----------
had i've been in a lot of like stressful


---------05:39----------
situations so like there's this slight


---------05:41----------
trigger warning around physical stuff


---------05:43----------
i'm like like people being sick but so i


---------05:46----------
remember when i was an intern in


---------05:48----------
residency we had one code and if you


---------05:51----------
guys don't know what a code is a code is


---------05:52----------
like what you guys see on tv when people


---------05:54----------
pull out the paddles and stuff it's like


---------05:55----------
basically when someone's like


---------05:57----------
you know like in kind of some kind of


---------05:59----------
like uh ventricular fibrillation or


---------06:01----------
something like that so like their heart


---------06:03----------
isn't working


---------06:04----------
and or their heart stops beating and


---------06:06----------
then you have to like do chest


---------06:07----------
compressions and stuff


---------06:09----------
so these are like really stressful


---------06:10----------
things like you get you know like the


---------06:12----------
the pa over in the hospital is like code


---------06:14----------
blue code blue room whatever and then


---------06:16----------
there's like a swarm of people that run


---------06:17----------
into the room and i remember there was


---------06:19----------
this one particular code where there was


---------06:21----------
someone who had a problem with their


---------06:23----------
heart and i was doing like chest


---------06:24----------
compressions and like you know the the


---------06:26----------
movies don't show you this but like a


---------06:28----------
very common thing that happens when


---------06:29----------
people like or you know you're doing


---------06:31----------
chest compressions on people is you'll


---------06:33----------
do like in like


---------06:34----------
you have to


---------06:36----------
cause the heart to beat right or not


---------06:37----------
beat but you're like squeezing blood out


---------06:39----------
of the heart that's literally what


---------06:40----------
you're doing so sometimes like you know


---------06:42----------
what they would tell us in residency is


---------06:44----------
it's okay to crack a rib to like save a


---------06:46----------
life so you have to like push down


---------06:47----------
really hard


---------06:49----------
the other thing that they don't really


---------06:50----------
tell you is that oftentimes when you're


---------06:52----------
doing chest compressions people will


---------06:54----------
start to vomit


---------06:55----------
i'm not sure why but so i remember like


---------06:58----------
very distinctly probably the most


---------07:00----------
intensive code that i ever had ever been


---------07:02----------
a part of


---------07:03----------
um was like one where i was doing chest


---------07:05----------
compressions like the person was like


---------07:06----------
vomiting on me and it was like just


---------07:08----------
awful and disgusting very very high


---------07:10----------
stress i've been in other stressful


---------07:12----------
situations like


---------07:13----------
you know


---------07:14----------
acute suicidality um my wife giving


---------07:17----------
birth to kids like just really high


---------07:20----------
stress stuff


---------07:21----------
and


---------07:22----------
nothing compare like that doesn't even


---------07:25----------
compare at all to the experience of like


---------07:28----------
being a ti the amount of stress and


---------07:30----------
pressure i'm not even playing


---------07:33----------
and like the amount of stress and


---------07:35----------
pressure that these people deal with


---------07:36----------
like on a daily and hourly basis is


---------07:39----------
absurd


---------07:40----------
like it's hard to describe but you can


---------07:43----------
feel like the pressure in the air and


---------07:45----------
i've been in tense situations like i've


---------07:47----------
been in you know board rooms where


---------07:49----------
people are like arguing and like ceos


---------07:51----------
are about to get fired and like super


---------07:53----------
awkward stuff right like very


---------07:55----------
challenging things like being yelled at


---------07:58----------
in the emergency room when someone who's


---------08:00----------
like rich and powerful is going to sue


---------08:02----------
you because


---------08:03----------
you know their son relapsed again or


---------08:05----------
whatever like there have been a lot of


---------08:06----------
stressful situations i've been in but


---------08:08----------
like ti is just a whole different


---------08:10----------
experience it is hands down the most


---------08:12----------
stressful experience of my life


---------08:14----------
and i wasn't even playing


---------08:16----------
so and the first thing that i kind of


---------08:17----------
want to like say is like it's absurd so


---------08:20----------
what i would describe the feeling as is


---------08:22----------
any time that your team is playing right


---------08:24----------
so i'm in in like a separate room with


---------08:27----------
um you know eg's coach and and we're


---------08:29----------
watching the game


---------08:30----------
and like when you're watching them play


---------08:32----------
the other thing that i was kind of


---------08:33----------
surprised about is like ti wasn't fun i


---------08:35----------
was expecting to have fun like i went


---------08:37----------
and and watched ti live in in at ti-8 so


---------08:40----------
this was like three years ago and it was


---------08:42----------
like a blast it was like one of the most


---------08:44----------
enjoyable experiences of my life but


---------08:46----------
being a part of the tournament is just


---------08:48----------
so incredibly nerve-wracking it's like


---------08:50----------
it's it's terrible like it the pressure


---------08:53----------
is so bad so what i would describe it


---------08:55----------
the closest feeling that i've ever had


---------08:57----------
is i remember a couple of weeks ago one


---------09:00----------
of my kids was um playing on a


---------09:02----------
trampoline and they fell off the


---------09:04----------
trampoline and so as a parent like i'm


---------09:06----------
15 feet away and i see her like falling


---------09:08----------
and i see her like you know because the


---------09:10----------
trampoline's elevated right so she falls


---------09:12----------
off


---------09:12----------
and then there's this moment where like


---------09:14----------
as a parent you're not sure if they're


---------09:16----------
okay or not you see the fall happen time


---------09:18----------
kind of slows down you run over to the


---------09:20----------
kid


---------09:21----------
and then like you know when they get up


---------09:23----------
and they're they're like you know


---------09:24----------
they're not hurt and nothing's bleeding


---------09:26----------
and or whatever like you feel this


---------09:28----------
immense amount of relief it's like this


---------09:30----------
very intense tension where you don't


---------09:33----------
know like oh my god did my kid really


---------09:34----------
just hurt themselves or are they okay


---------09:36----------
then you run over and then you see them


---------09:38----------
like and they're fine and then you get


---------09:39----------
like this relief that washes through you


---------09:41----------
that whole experience lasts like two


---------09:43----------
seconds like literally it lasts like two


---------09:45----------
seconds right they fall you can cross 15


---------09:48----------
feet like pretty damn quick and you can


---------09:50----------
see like they they get up and they're


---------09:51----------
not crying or whatever right it's like


---------09:53----------
two to three seconds


---------09:54----------
being a ti is like that two to three


---------09:57----------
seconds for like hours at a time because


---------09:59----------
when you're actually watching a game


---------10:01----------
like you never know right like someone


---------10:03----------
could throw someone could like


---------10:06----------
these people like because you can see


---------10:08----------
the whole map and like you know that


---------10:09----------
your players can't and so you know what


---------10:12----------
the other team is doing you know they're


---------10:13----------
like smoke ganking or you know that like


---------10:15----------
like someone's farming under a ward or


---------10:17----------
you you realize like oh my god like the


---------10:19----------
enemy's sneaking roche is the team gonna


---------10:21----------
realize it are they gonna are they gonna


---------10:23----------
figure it out are they not gonna figure


---------10:24----------
it out like you know someone screwed up


---------10:26----------
and they they spent one of their


---------10:28----------
cooldowns like how are they gonna take


---------10:29----------
the fight like now is the time that they


---------10:30----------
need to take the fight because the stuff


---------10:32----------
is on cooldown for the enemy team like


---------10:34----------
it's just this constant feeling of like


---------10:36----------
you don't know what's gonna happen


---------10:38----------
it's like watching like it's you just


---------10:41----------
don't know


---------10:42----------
and when you win like you're not happy


---------10:45----------
like that was the other thing that was


---------10:46----------
really really surprising like sometimes


---------10:48----------
people are happy when they win


---------10:50----------
but


---------10:51----------
most of the time it's not like happy


---------10:52----------
it's just relief it's like there's no


---------10:55----------
there's no positive emotion it's just


---------10:57----------
tons and tons of pressure and negative


---------10:59----------
emotion followed by like oh thank god we


---------11:02----------
didn't screw it up


---------11:03----------
right and and so it's like it's just


---------11:07----------
mind-numbingly stressful


---------11:09----------
so i i think that was like really


---------11:11----------
educational for me in terms of you know


---------11:13----------
just not wrecking like the pressure is


---------11:16----------
just overwhelming


---------11:18----------
so the other thing that i want to say is


---------11:20----------
like the players are absolutely amazing


---------11:23----------
so these are some of the most resilient


---------11:26----------
individuals i have ever met and i i


---------11:28----------
think especially about some of these


---------11:30----------
folks like um because they do this right


---------11:34----------
game after game tournament after


---------11:35----------
tournament like year after year they


---------11:37----------
sign themselves up for you know you


---------11:39----------
practice for like


---------11:41----------
hours weeks months right you're playing


---------11:44----------
pubs you're scrimming you're you're you


---------11:46----------
know even like doing stuff with dr k


---------11:48----------
like you're doing everything you can


---------11:50----------
you're talking about the game you're


---------11:51----------
thinking about the game


---------11:52----------
and then in a moment like it could all


---------11:55----------
like it could be for nothing because you


---------11:56----------
just lose right and like then the game


---------11:58----------
is over


---------12:00----------
and so what these people do is they like


---------12:02----------
sign up for this experience like game


---------12:04----------
after game


---------12:05----------
tournament after tournament like year


---------12:06----------
after year i i think uh isis ice has


---------12:09----------
been to nine tis and like just the


---------12:12----------
amount of resilience


---------12:14----------
you have to have to go to wake up every


---------12:16----------
day and like do this over and over and


---------12:18----------
over again


---------12:19----------
when success is


---------12:22----------
not only not guaranteed it is


---------12:23----------
statistically unlikely


---------12:25----------
right because at the end of the day


---------12:27----------
90 players go to ti and five of them win


---------12:31----------
and 85 of them lose


---------12:33----------
it's the way that the game is designed


---------12:35----------
to be ti is designed not to make winners


---------12:38----------
but to make losers


---------12:40----------
and this is something that i think


---------12:41----------
people like especially fans like when


---------12:43----------
you you know you criticize and stuff


---------12:45----------
which we'll get to that in a second


---------12:47----------
i don't think people really appreciate


---------12:49----------
that this is a game that year after year


---------12:52----------
these players are signing up for and


---------12:54----------
like


---------12:55----------
loss is almost certain


---------12:57----------
right it's crazy you have you have like


---------13:00----------
a 90 chance of losing like that's just


---------13:04----------
what it is


---------13:05----------
and and it it's it's the amount of


---------13:08----------
strength and internal fortitude that it


---------13:11----------
takes to


---------13:12----------
show up and play this game like over and


---------13:14----------
over and over again is like it's it's


---------13:17----------
amazing like these are some of the most


---------13:20----------
resilient people i've ever played with


---------13:22----------
or i've not played with but like work


---------13:23----------
with


---------13:25----------
um


---------13:26----------
so like what i mean by resilience is if


---------13:29----------
you kind of think about it like you know


---------13:30----------
every time you go to a tournament like


---------13:32----------
you just don't know what's gonna happen


---------13:34----------
and the amount of like faith that you


---------13:36----------
have to develop in yourself the amount


---------13:38----------
of uncertainty that you have to deal


---------13:39----------
with


---------13:40----------
you know it's just it's so crushing


---------13:43----------
and like you just have to develop such a


---------13:46----------
core of internal strength


---------13:48----------
to like tolerate that you know it's kind


---------13:50----------
of hard but


---------13:52----------
in real life like chances are you're


---------13:54----------
gonna end up okay if you keep trying


---------13:57----------
right if you think about like


---------13:58----------
relationships for example so sure like


---------14:01----------
any individual relationship may have a


---------14:03----------
small amount of chance of like like


---------14:05----------
working out but at the end of the day


---------14:07----------
like most human beings end up in


---------14:09----------
somewhat of healthy happy relationships


---------14:12----------
most human beings end up with some


---------14:14----------
amount of like you know success within


---------14:16----------
their career in their job most human


---------14:18----------
beings end up like you know if you play


---------14:20----------
a video game like if you purchase a


---------14:22----------
video game you're gonna like have some


---------14:24----------
fun playing it right like most of normal


---------14:27----------
life


---------14:28----------
is like


---------14:29----------
is like leans towards success i know we


---------14:31----------
kind of talk a lot about how people


---------14:33----------
struggle with failure and things like


---------14:34----------
that but at the end of the day like most


---------14:36----------
human beings are like doing okay


---------14:38----------
when you get up and you go to work


---------14:40----------
there's not like a 90 chance that you're


---------14:42----------
gonna be fired at the end of the day


---------14:43----------
right when you go out on a date or let's


---------14:46----------
say you're dating someone like 90 of


---------14:47----------
marriages don't end up in divorce right


---------14:50----------
so i think it's just really it's


---------14:53----------
it was very eye-opening to see how


---------14:55----------
incredibly resilient these people are


---------14:58----------
and how much the deck is actually


---------14:59----------
stacked against them because it


---------15:01----------
absolutely is


---------15:03----------
so


---------15:03----------
the next thing that i kind of want to


---------15:05----------
talk about is that so i'm going to talk


---------15:06----------
for a second about eg's performance over


---------15:09----------
the year


---------15:10----------
and i think there's like a lot of


---------15:12----------
lessons to be learned i learned a lot so


---------15:14----------
it was a very educational experience to


---------15:16----------
me and i think it was interesting to see


---------15:18----------
you know what principles do i personally


---------15:20----------
try to live by do i advocate that sort


---------15:22----------
of apply to ti what amount of you know


---------15:25----------
psychology or like principles of like


---------15:28----------
how to live your life like apply to ti


---------15:31----------
and so i think um the next thing that i


---------15:33----------
want to talk about is just the season as


---------15:35----------
a whole so i worked with eg over the


---------15:36----------
course of the year which you know a lot


---------15:38----------
of people don't know


---------15:40----------
and i think overall like i'm i'm really


---------15:42----------
proud of the team so i think that


---------15:44----------
the team is super


---------15:46----------
is understandably like disappointed in


---------15:48----------
their ti performance and i think people


---------15:49----------
are disappointed in eg and things like


---------15:51----------
that and i also felt some degree of


---------15:53----------
disappointment


---------15:55----------
but i think this is like really


---------15:56----------
important in life is that like you know


---------15:58----------
if you really look at their season like


---------15:59----------
they had a good season right so they


---------16:01----------
they made it to uh you know they


---------16:04----------
made it to the grand finals of two


---------16:05----------
majors


---------16:06----------
you can also say oh they didn't win a


---------16:08----------
single major but i think they were


---------16:09----------
number one in the dpc league which means


---------16:12----------
that if you look at their performance


---------16:13----------
across the year it was like very very


---------16:15----------
strong


---------16:16----------
and this is kind of the problem with ti


---------16:18----------
is that ti is an esport where the only


---------16:21----------
thing that matters is or dota is an


---------16:23----------
esport where the only thing that matters


---------16:24----------
is ti so i'm going to give you guys just


---------16:26----------
how an analogy to illustrate like how


---------16:29----------
bizarre of a situation this actually is


---------16:31----------
so let's say i'm a surgeon and i'm


---------16:33----------
operating on like the president of the


---------16:34----------
united states or like the prime minister


---------16:36----------
of you know my country or whatever


---------16:38----------
and if like if that patient dies on the


---------16:41----------
surgery table like is that bad


---------16:43----------
absolutely


---------16:45----------
but it doesn't invalidate the thousand


---------16:47----------
lives that i saved before that one


---------16:50----------
experience right


---------16:51----------
it's certainly bad and it's certainly


---------16:52----------
important you can even argue that like


---------16:54----------
that person who's on the table in that


---------16:56----------
moment is more important than people who


---------16:59----------
have come before it


---------17:00----------
but esports and especially dota is the


---------17:03----------
one place where it doesn't matter how


---------17:06----------
good of a job you do prior to ti


---------17:09----------
it just doesn't matter


---------17:10----------
it's it's an


---------17:12----------
eggs in one like all of your eggs in one


---------17:14----------
basket like


---------17:15----------
in it to an absurd level so i think one


---------17:18----------
of the key things that i kind of took


---------17:19----------
away from this experience and what i


---------17:21----------
tried to you know help the players


---------17:23----------
understand which they may not they may


---------17:25----------
not understand and it may not be an


---------17:27----------
issue of understanding right because


---------17:28----------
this is their life


---------17:30----------
um but i think it's important to be like


---------17:32----------
okay at being disappointed in yourself


---------17:35----------
and also like to be able to feel pride


---------17:37----------
at the same time


---------17:39----------
so you know the way that i feel about my


---------17:41----------
ti experience is overwhelmingly i'm


---------17:43----------
proud of eg i'm proud of what they've


---------17:45----------
accomplished and i understand that


---------17:46----------
they're disappointed i felt some


---------17:48----------
disappointment too


---------17:49----------
but it's like it's really important in


---------17:51----------
life to recognize that even when you


---------17:53----------
don't do something that you really


---------17:55----------
wanted to do or the results that you


---------17:57----------
were shooting for are disappointed that


---------17:59----------
you be able to take pride in like other


---------18:02----------
stuff as well because the truth is is


---------18:04----------
that eg has a lot to be proud of right i


---------18:06----------
mean they they had generally speaking a


---------18:08----------
stellar season if you look at it by any


---------18:10----------
objective measure


---------18:12----------
any sort of like truly rational measure


---------18:14----------
they did fantastic


---------18:16----------
so they made it to ti which you know


---------18:18----------
let's remember that like a lot of good


---------18:19----------
teams actually didn't make it to ti this


---------18:21----------
year


---------18:22----------
um you know they had a disappointing


---------18:24----------
performance at ti sure


---------18:27----------
but at the end of the day like they


---------18:28----------
played some really really awesome dota


---------18:31----------
and so i think it's important that like


---------18:33----------
you know in life like it's okay to be


---------18:35----------
disappointed in what you do it's okay to


---------18:38----------
be like not happy with your performance


---------18:41----------
but be careful and remember that just


---------18:43----------
because you're not happy or it's okay to


---------18:45----------
be disappointed in like the most recent


---------18:47----------
thing doesn't mean that you don't


---------18:49----------
deserve to feel some amount of pride in


---------18:52----------
like what you've done prior to that day


---------18:54----------
and and like i said i respect these


---------18:56----------
players so much because you know a lot


---------18:58----------
of people


---------18:59----------
say that eg sort of has disappointing


---------19:01----------
performances


---------19:02----------
that they kind of i think if you look at


---------19:04----------
it statistically maybe lgd or eg


---------19:08----------
is the most


---------19:09----------
is the winningest team in in maybe the


---------19:12----------
history of dota so if you look at like


---------19:14----------
the average placement that eg has had


---------19:16----------
over the last like three or four years i


---------19:18----------
think they could be number one or number


---------19:20----------
two so they have very very consistent


---------19:22----------
results they play really really solid


---------19:25----------
dota year after year tournament after


---------19:27----------
tournament


---------19:28----------
and game after game


---------19:30----------
and at the end of the day


---------19:31----------
that's not enough right because the dota


---------19:33----------
is an esport where the only thing that


---------19:35----------
matters is one tournament so it's kind


---------19:37----------
of interesting because people will also


---------19:39----------
complain about the prize pool and


---------19:40----------
they'll say like you know the prize pool


---------19:41----------
for the majors is like tiny it's like


---------19:43----------
five hundred thousand dollars and the


---------19:44----------
like the the prize pool for ti is 45


---------19:47----------
million dollars and you can you can


---------19:49----------
complain about that if you want to but


---------19:51----------
let's remember that


---------19:53----------
you know it's it's kind of interesting


---------19:54----------
because it's like it's just an esport


---------19:56----------
that is designed to create tons and tons


---------19:58----------
of losers and like one huge winner


---------20:02----------
so in when you're faced with those kinds


---------20:04----------
of circumstances it can be really really


---------20:05----------
hard to have faith in yourself it can be


---------20:08----------
really really hard to persevere


---------20:11----------
you know giving up is very easy to do


---------20:13----------
when there's basically one tournament


---------20:14----------
that matters


---------20:16----------
it also makes it really really hard to


---------20:18----------
practice throughout the year right


---------20:20----------
because at the end of the day like who


---------20:21----------
the hell cares if you made it to the


---------20:24----------
grand finals of like two


---------20:26----------
majors in a row and like if you guys


---------20:28----------
look at ig's performance for example so


---------20:30----------
they won the first major and then i


---------20:32----------
think they got like knocked out pretty


---------20:34----------
early in the second major and then lgd


---------20:36----------
won the second major and they made it to


---------20:37----------
the grand finals


---------20:39----------
of the ti


---------20:41----------
and then like you know the amount of


---------20:43----------
flames and hate that lgd is getting is


---------20:46----------
like astronomical


---------20:48----------
and so that's just the nature of the


---------20:50----------
beast and so what i respect so much


---------20:52----------
about the players is to like step into


---------20:54----------
this arena which is like not designed


---------20:57----------
for victory it's an arena that's


---------20:59----------
designed for failure


---------21:01----------
and so that's tough


---------21:02----------
um and it can be very very hard to be


---------21:05----------
proud and feel some degree of like pride


---------21:07----------
in your accomplishments because you


---------21:09----------
genuinely do have a lot to be


---------21:11----------
proud of i think eg has a lot to be


---------21:13----------
proud of i'm very proud of it


---------21:15----------
but it's hard


---------21:17----------
and


---------21:18----------
i think you know for those of you at


---------21:20----------
home like i encourage you to think a


---------21:21----------
little bit about that as well like it's


---------21:23----------
okay to be disappointed in yourself


---------21:25----------
but there are things that you can


---------21:27----------
probably still be proud of and it's very


---------21:29----------
hard to feel that pride right it's not


---------21:32----------
easy it's like because you're so


---------21:34----------
overwhelmed by the disappointment of the


---------21:35----------
moment that it becomes hard to be


---------21:38----------
objective


---------21:40----------
so that's kind of


---------21:43----------
you know because i i think the other


---------21:45----------
thing that i'd kind of say is that like


---------21:49----------
in this way dota is like real life


---------21:50----------
because if you look at it like you know


---------21:52----------
there are a handful of billionaires


---------21:53----------
right those are like the ti winners


---------21:56----------
and for every billionaire out there


---------21:58----------
there's like you know millions or tens


---------22:00----------
of millions of people who


---------22:02----------
[Music]


---------22:03----------
you know


---------22:04----------
don't have a whole lot of money


---------22:07----------
and so in life you can also say that


---------22:09----------
like for every one winner there's like


---------22:10----------
10 000 losers


---------22:12----------
i think for every you know one winner


---------22:14----------
for every


---------22:15----------
one team that wins ti like 18 teams lose


---------22:18----------
ti and not to mention the 60 somewhat


---------22:21----------
teams that are like tier two and like


---------22:23----------
competing in tournaments and like didn't


---------22:24----------
make it to ti and all that kind of stuff


---------22:27----------
right so there are tons of teams out


---------22:28----------
there that are sort of destined to lose


---------22:31----------
because that's just the nature of the


---------22:32----------
beast


---------22:34----------
so


---------22:35----------
you know it's it's tough but that's what


---------22:37----------
it is and i think what what the real


---------22:39----------
testament to strength is and what i


---------22:40----------
really respect eg for is like picking


---------22:42----------
themselves off the mat and like trying


---------22:44----------
again and trying again and trying again


---------22:47----------
uh that doesn't even mention you know


---------22:49----------
not even to think a little bit about the


---------22:50----------
toxicity that a lot of the players face


---------22:53----------
right so i know that especially like you


---------22:55----------
know reddit and stuff like that we're


---------22:56----------
going to talk about this in a second


---------22:58----------
everyone likes to analyze like what


---------23:00----------
happens at ti so let's talk about that


---------23:03----------
so


---------23:05----------
oh man there's so much to say okay


---------23:08----------
so i want you guys to think about this


---------23:10----------
for a second okay


---------23:11----------
what determines whether


---------23:14----------
a team wins or loses a particular game


---------23:17----------
of dota


---------23:18----------
right like what goes into it like what


---------23:20----------
do you think actually like goes into it


---------23:23----------
and the really shocking thing is that if


---------23:25----------
you look at these actual games and like


---------23:27----------
i'll ask y'all i'm gonna assume that you


---------23:28----------
guys know about you know what happened


---------23:30----------
at ti and stuff


---------23:32----------
but if you guys think like if lgd and


---------23:34----------
let's say that lgdm team spirit there's


---------23:37----------
like a thousand alternate universes


---------23:39----------
what percentage of the time do you think


---------23:42----------
in those thousand alternate universes


---------23:45----------
what what number like what's the


---------23:47----------
percentage that you guys think team


---------23:48----------
spirit would have won and what's the


---------23:50----------
percentage that you think lgd would have


---------23:52----------
won


---------23:55----------
right so people are saying like 75 lgd


---------23:58----------
90 lgd 50 50 20 lgd so here's the the


---------24:03----------
first thing to understand about like


---------24:04----------
dota 2 tournaments dota 2 tournaments


---------24:07----------
are not designed to have the best team


---------24:10----------
win


---------24:10----------
and you can definitely argue i mean


---------24:12----------
there's a lot of good arguments against


---------24:14----------
that right like you could say well


---------24:15----------
clearly like the team that has the


---------24:17----------
mindset and whatever they're the ones


---------24:18----------
that that win the best and i'm not


---------24:20----------
saying that the teams that


---------24:22----------
one don't deserve to win what i'm saying


---------24:24----------
is that the the tournament is designed


---------24:26----------
for entertainment not to actually like


---------24:29----------
scientifically assess which team is the


---------24:31----------
most superior


---------24:32----------
do you guys get that like that's why


---------24:34----------
they have best of ones


---------24:36----------
so i'm not saying eg is the best team by


---------24:38----------
the way and it's not copio i'm just


---------24:39----------
saying it like you know in science when


---------24:41----------
we're trying to find a particular answer


---------24:45----------
what we'll do is like we'll do a


---------24:46----------
randomized controlled trial with like 10


---------24:48----------
000 subjects so that we can really


---------24:50----------
figure out what is responsible and what


---------24:52----------
isn't


---------24:53----------
so dota is a is a game that's designed


---------24:55----------
or at least tournaments are designed to


---------24:57----------
be spectator sports and if you think


---------24:58----------
about all of the alternate universes


---------25:00----------
that it exists


---------25:02----------
what percentage of the time would you


---------25:04----------
guys say that team spirit would win and


---------25:05----------
what percentage of the time would you


---------25:07----------
say that lgd would win


---------25:08----------
and we're seeing a variety of answers my


---------25:11----------
point is you know my point first and


---------25:12----------
foremost is that it's complicated


---------25:15----------
so one thing i came to understand about


---------25:17----------
dota 2 is it is way way way more


---------25:20----------
complicated than i ever understood


---------25:23----------
and so like i think the biggest thing


---------25:24----------
about dota is that it


---------25:26----------
it seems very easy to understand when


---------25:29----------
you're watching a game like


---------25:31----------
why you lose a game and if you guys want


---------25:33----------
to understand this like you know have a


---------25:35----------
2k mmr player like myself analyze a


---------25:38----------
replay and then like you know we can say


---------25:40----------
oh like you know this we lost because


---------25:42----------
this person fed we lost because mid


---------25:44----------
didn't rotate we lost because of this


---------25:46----------
and then if you take like a 6k mmr


---------25:48----------
player and then you have them analyze


---------25:50----------
the replay the answers that they're


---------25:51----------
going to come up with are going to be


---------25:53----------
different from the 2k mmr players and


---------25:55----------
then if you have a 10k mmr player like


---------25:56----------
when they


---------25:57----------
analyze a 6k mmr player like they're


---------26:00----------
gonna come up with different answers and


---------26:01----------
then you have 12 kmr players who are


---------26:04----------
going to come up with even more


---------26:05----------
different answers and so i think if you


---------26:07----------
look at like you know what goes into


---------26:08----------
winning or losing a game of dota this is


---------26:11----------
the super fascinating thing about it


---------26:14----------
dota is one of these things where


---------26:15----------
hindsight is anything but 2020.


---------26:19----------
so we have this saying right we toss


---------26:21----------
around the same lot which i'm gonna


---------26:22----------
dispute in a second that hindsight is 20


---------26:24----------
20.


---------26:25----------
i don't think hindsight is 20 20 in dota


---------26:28----------
so if you look at like if you really


---------26:29----------
talked to and this is one of the


---------26:30----------
privileges i had right so i i had the


---------26:32----------
option to talk to some of the best


---------26:35----------
dota players in the world


---------26:37----------
and like ask them why did you win this


---------26:39----------
game or why did you lose this game


---------26:42----------
and the truth is that like it's very


---------26:44----------
hard to tell


---------26:45----------
right it's like it's it's so hard to


---------26:47----------
tell and and i know for example like i


---------26:50----------
you know being able to watch ti with top


---------26:54----------
tier players was also like very very


---------26:56----------
educational because there are a bunch of


---------26:58----------
people who have you know been knocked


---------26:59----------
out who are still really good at the


---------27:00----------
game and so being able to like you know


---------27:02----------
watch games with them and talk to them


---------27:04----------
about who do you think is gonna win and


---------27:06----------
also like you'll get two two players


---------27:08----------
that are like both very very good and i


---------27:11----------
can ask them the same question based on


---------27:13----------
the draft and like you know the skills


---------27:14----------
of the team and things like that and


---------27:16----------
like who do you think is gonna win is


---------27:18----------
like it's still like up in the air


---------27:20----------
so there are so many factors that go


---------27:22----------
into you know a game of dota that it's


---------27:25----------
really really hard to tell because


---------27:27----------
neither team is going to play perfectly


---------27:28----------
right so like they're not open ai


---------27:31----------
so you know why did you win there are


---------27:33----------
some games that you should win which you


---------27:35----------
end up losing in some games that you


---------27:36----------
should lose that you end up winning


---------27:38----------
and so there's so many things that go


---------27:40----------
into it the draft the timings you know


---------27:42----------
rotations


---------27:43----------
the the macro strategy


---------27:46----------
part of what i really love about dota is


---------27:47----------
that there isn't a right answer when it


---------27:50----------
comes to dota it's it's truly like a


---------27:52----------
clash of ideas and philosophies so it's


---------27:54----------
really interesting to see you know how


---------27:56----------
different teams will play like their


---------27:58----------
macro strategy and what they believe in


---------28:00----------
they're going to be like meta heroes and


---------28:02----------
non-meta heroes and things like that but


---------28:03----------
like it was really interesting i mean i


---------28:06----------
really loved it because one of the


---------28:07----------
things that i came to understand which i


---------28:08----------
don't see anyone really talking about


---------28:10----------
like when i read dota 2


---------28:12----------
threads about you know why people are


---------28:14----------
winning or losing is like the high level


---------28:16----------
strategic thinking that goes into


---------28:20----------
the draft so i think like 99 of posts


---------28:24----------
that i've i've looked at like don't have


---------28:25----------
a clue how people actually draft and


---------28:28----------
what they draft around um and and so you


---------28:31----------
know a lot of people can kind of say


---------28:32----------
like just ban magnus against ts so let


---------28:35----------
me just give you guys an example so i'm


---------28:37----------
in that camp by the way for the record


---------28:39----------
but


---------28:40----------
let me give you guys so let me ask you a


---------28:42----------
question okay


---------28:44----------
so


---------28:45----------
what do you think gives you a greater


---------28:47----------
chance of beating ts


---------28:53----------
is it banning magnus


---------28:56----------
or having a a strategy that successfully


---------28:59----------
counters magnus


---------29:01----------
what do y'all think


---------29:06----------
see this is the really interesting thing


---------29:09----------
right because if a team


---------29:11----------
has a bedrock like a foundation


---------29:16----------
and you have figured out a way to


---------29:18----------
counter that foundation letting them


---------29:20----------
pick it


---------29:21----------
and then countering it could give you a


---------29:23----------
better option at actually winning the


---------29:25----------
game


---------29:27----------
right so so and this is where like if


---------29:29----------
you look at everyone kind of saying this


---------29:31----------
is exactly my point so some people are


---------29:33----------
saying ban it some people are saying


---------29:35----------
counter it some people are saying you


---------29:36----------
can't counter it


---------29:37----------
and so this is like this question


---------29:40----------
is impossible to answer


---------29:42----------
so you can have lots of opinions about


---------29:44----------
it and so like like this is just the one


---------29:46----------
example of you know you'll see like


---------29:48----------
different philosophies so i think like


---------29:50----------
secret is a good team that


---------29:54----------
has faith in itself to be able to


---------29:56----------
counter strategies and if you kind of


---------29:58----------
think about it like what they'll do is


---------29:59----------
they'll say like uh


---------30:01----------
yeah so lg did did counter at game three


---------30:03----------
and four exactly right so so this is


---------30:05----------
what happens like if you're lgd like in


---------30:07----------
game three you know what you decide to


---------30:09----------
do is you're like okay go ahead and pick


---------30:11----------
magnus and then like you know what


---------30:12----------
they're gonna do you know what their


---------30:14----------
play is gonna be and if you're


---------30:15----------
successful in countering it you're


---------30:16----------
actually at it


---------30:18----------
at an advantage compared to if you just


---------30:20----------
ban it and don't let them play it right


---------30:22----------
you kind of draw them into their


---------30:24----------
strategy that they're comfortable with


---------30:25----------
and then you smash them because you have


---------30:26----------
the appropriate counter that's just one


---------30:29----------
example


---------30:30----------
okay of like you know one hero


---------30:33----------
where it's like arguably speaking like a


---------30:35----------
pretty simple sort of thing like because


---------30:37----------
collapse is really good at magnus


---------30:39----------
but the thing is when you're really


---------30:41----------
looking at dota that's just one example


---------30:43----------
there's


---------30:44----------
hundreds there's like over 100 heroes


---------30:46----------
there are tons of different players do


---------30:48----------
you play your dota or do you try to


---------30:50----------
counter their dota and in that sense


---------30:51----------
that too from a drafting perspective


---------30:53----------
it's like how do you want to draft do


---------30:55----------
you want a draft for your game or do you


---------30:57----------
want a draft to counter pick their game


---------30:59----------
do you go first pick or do you go second


---------31:01----------
pick you know so many of these different


---------31:03----------
factors come in and then once again


---------31:05----------
like it's not just about the draft right


---------31:07----------
because like you'll see


---------31:09----------
um


---------31:11----------
you know once you actually get into the


---------31:13----------
game


---------31:14----------
and then like let's say you drafted what


---------31:16----------
you thought was a good theoretical


---------31:18----------
counter and it doesn't end up succeeding


---------31:21----------
so then the question is like did you not


---------31:23----------
execute it properly because you know the


---------31:25----------
player who's let's say playing rubik was


---------31:27----------
rusty and hadn't played rubik in a while


---------31:29----------
like was your strategy the problem was


---------31:31----------
was were you is or is your


---------31:34----------
execution the problem and that's another


---------31:36----------
example of like an impossible question


---------31:37----------
to answer


---------31:38----------
so dota is one of these things where the


---------31:40----------
more i learned about the game i realized


---------31:43----------
that there's like a massive amount of


---------31:44----------
like dunning krueger going on where


---------31:46----------
everyone can look at the last five


---------31:48----------
minutes of the game and say like oh they


---------31:50----------
should have you know like the carrie


---------31:51----------
just got too farmed it's gg but how did


---------31:53----------
the carry get farmed when did the carry


---------31:55----------
get farmed why weren't they ganked were


---------31:56----------
they ganked or was it that like you know


---------31:58----------
the the team did a good job of


---------32:00----------
protecting them or like what are all of


---------32:01----------
the reasons that go into it


---------32:03----------
you know and so hindsight is anything


---------32:05----------
but 2020. and i would sit there for you


---------32:08----------
know hours and hours and hours and talk


---------32:10----------
to


---------32:11----------
dota players about specifically eg right


---------32:13----------
like you know when you guys lose a game


---------32:15----------
or win a game like what are the reasons


---------32:17----------
for your win and what are the reasons


---------32:18----------
for your loss


---------32:20----------
and at the end of the day people can


---------32:21----------
come up with opinions and you have to


---------32:23----------
have faith in those opinions


---------32:25----------
but i think that like it's staggering


---------32:27----------
because there's no gold standard in dota


---------32:30----------
and that's what's really bizarre is that


---------32:32----------
in in the rest of the world like we tend


---------32:34----------
to have objective answers right when you


---------32:36----------
take a test there's an answer key so you


---------32:38----------
can know objectively whether you're


---------32:40----------
right or wrong


---------32:41----------
like even in medicine if i suspect


---------32:43----------
someone has covid i can do a test and


---------32:45----------
determine objectively whether i'm right


---------32:47----------
or wrong


---------32:48----------
in dota there's just so much uncertainty


---------32:51----------
you never know what the right answer is


---------32:53----------
you just all you have is your judgment


---------32:55----------
but there's no such thing as an answer


---------32:56----------
key there's no such thing as a biopsy


---------32:59----------
sure you can watch the replay and you


---------33:00----------
can come up with conclusions but at the


---------33:02----------
end of the day hindsight is anything but


---------33:04----------
2020.


---------33:06----------
and this is also where i think like for


---------33:07----------
those of you all at home i think it's


---------33:09----------
really important to understand this


---------33:10----------
principle because i think most human


---------33:12----------
beings will go around believing that


---------33:15----------
hindsight is 20 20 when in truth it's


---------33:17----------
anything but


---------33:18----------
so i'll give you guys just one example


---------33:20----------
so i was working with someone who was


---------33:22----------
interested in getting married


---------33:24----------
and so they were dating this one person


---------33:26----------
for a while and that you know the


---------33:27----------
relationship fell apart dating a second


---------33:29----------
person for a while and the relationship


---------33:31----------
fell apart third person fourth person so


---------33:33----------
they had four sort of serious


---------33:34----------
relationships over the course of let's


---------33:36----------
say three or four years


---------33:38----------
and every everyone every time something


---------33:41----------
falls apart and i would ask the person


---------33:42----------
okay why did your relationship fall


---------33:44----------
apart and they said okay well you know


---------33:46----------
the person just prioritized their career


---------33:47----------
like they weren't willing to you know


---------33:49----------
their career was more important than the


---------33:50----------
relationship so we decided to break up


---------33:52----------
okay totally fine


---------33:53----------
um what happened with the second person


---------33:55----------
well the second person had daddy issues


---------33:58----------
so you know they just like


---------34:00----------
you know had daddy issues and it was


---------34:02----------
like a problem and and so like you know


---------34:04----------
they had to work on themselves before


---------34:05----------
they were ready for a relationship


---------34:06----------
completely reasonable


---------34:08----------
third relationship why did the


---------34:09----------
relationship fall apart well this person


---------34:10----------
had a problem like they were they they


---------34:12----------
were an alcoholic and like the drinking


---------34:14----------
was just super out of control


---------34:16----------
and so like you know


---------34:17----------
that's the reason the relationship fell


---------34:19----------
apart and what's the fourth reason the


---------34:20----------
relationship fell apart well i don't


---------34:22----------
know like we just kind of drifted apart


---------34:24----------
um you know they got kind of busy with


---------34:26----------
work i kind of got busy with work and


---------34:27----------
things just kind of drifted apart


---------34:30----------
and so you can look at a situation and


---------34:32----------
you can like really say that you know


---------34:34----------
you can answer with confidence but at


---------34:36----------
some point like you don't actually know


---------34:38----------
if any of those things are correct


---------34:40----------
and so at some point you know what i


---------34:42----------
what i do with that person is to you


---------34:44----------
know ask them like well okay like what


---------34:46----------
do you think your contribution is right


---------34:47----------
because there's a common denominator


---------34:49----------
here there's like a common denominator


---------34:51----------
of like well maybe like you're actually


---------34:53----------
the problem and it's not any one of


---------34:54----------
those things


---------34:55----------
and so this absolutely applies in dota


---------34:58----------
and in real life where like a lot of


---------35:00----------
times you know people will believe they


---------35:02----------
understand why things happen why you


---------35:04----------
can't get a job why you're you know


---------35:07----------
you're lazy why you self-sabotage why


---------35:09----------
you're forever alone why you get passed


---------35:11----------
over for promotions


---------35:13----------
um


---------35:14----------
why you wind up with like you know


---------35:16----------
friends who don't respect your


---------35:17----------
boundaries there are all kinds of things


---------35:19----------
and you can say like oh this person


---------35:21----------
doesn't respect my boundaries my in-laws


---------35:23----------
are a pain in the ass you can attribute


---------35:25----------
reasons to all kinds of things in life


---------35:27----------
because that's what our brain is


---------35:28----------
designed to do our brain is designed to


---------35:31----------
formulate patterns from uncertainty like


---------35:33----------
that's like the biggest goal of the


---------35:35----------
brain


---------35:36----------
right it's it's how we're able to tell


---------35:38----------
that clouds lead to rain because our


---------35:40----------
brain is really good at associating


---------35:44----------
coral taking correlation and attributing


---------35:46----------
causation from correlations


---------35:49----------
so for example in this how people will


---------35:51----------
even come up with little rituals right


---------35:52----------
like i have my lucky underwear well like


---------35:54----------
what's up with that it's just i don't


---------35:56----------
know like


---------35:57----------
my lucky underwear like i the reason i


---------35:58----------
failed the test is because i didn't have


---------36:00----------
the lucky underwear right so there's all


---------36:02----------
kinds of things that's what our brain


---------36:03----------
does is it tries to take


---------36:05----------
it tries to make sense of chaos


---------36:08----------
the problem is that oftentimes it


---------36:11----------
doesn't do it correctly oftentimes it


---------36:13----------
does do it correctly right because we


---------36:14----------
are pretty good we as human beings


---------36:16----------
figure things out we've sent people into


---------36:17----------
space


---------36:18----------
you know we figured out how to


---------36:20----------
develop a vaccine against covid


---------36:22----------
um i figured out how to adjust camera


---------36:25----------
and things like that and and you know i


---------36:26----------
figured things out


---------36:28----------
relating to stream


---------36:31----------
and and so it's really tricky but like


---------36:33----------
in dota hindsight is not 2020 and for


---------36:35----------
those of you like who really think


---------36:37----------
you've figured everything out in your


---------36:38----------
life


---------36:39----------
i'd strongly encourage you to question


---------36:41----------
your hindsight as well because chances


---------36:43----------
are your hindsight really isn't 20 20.


---------36:45----------
if you really think about it objectively


---------36:47----------
there's no


---------36:48----------
right answer to why you you and someone


---------36:51----------
else managed to break up right there's


---------36:53----------
no like there's no like actual objective


---------36:55----------
answer there's just opinion but that's


---------36:57----------
not what our brain tries to tell us


---------37:01----------
because the truth is that you know in a


---------37:02----------
game of dota there are so many factors


---------37:04----------
that go into it and you never really


---------37:05----------
know


---------37:06----------
which is the other reason that i respect


---------37:08----------
these guys a lot because like


---------37:09----------
in the face of never really knowing you


---------37:11----------
have to develop confidence and like


---------37:14----------
transmit that confidence to your team


---------37:16----------
and try to play this game that you will


---------37:17----------
never know if you are adequately


---------37:19----------
prepared for


---------37:20----------
right so you you prep the draft and you


---------37:22----------
kind of think about what you're going to


---------37:24----------
play and you practice and you scrim and


---------37:25----------
all this kind of stuff and at the end of


---------37:27----------
the day you never know whether you're


---------37:29----------
actually going to like succeed or not


---------37:31----------
and this is really different from most


---------37:33----------
other dimensions of life because like


---------37:35----------
you know for example for a test like if


---------37:37----------
you study enough


---------37:38----------
right and assuming that you have some


---------37:40----------
you know basic level of iq and you can


---------37:42----------
handle the course work and things like


---------37:43----------
that


---------37:44----------
you can basically work your way to


---------37:47----------
getting an a like the a is there if you


---------37:49----------
work hard enough right maybe you've got


---------37:51----------
adhd and that needs to be treated and


---------37:53----------
things like that but generally speaking


---------37:54----------
you can work your way to an a generally


---------37:57----------
speaking in life like you can work your


---------37:58----------
way to a particular goal like if you try


---------38:00----------
hard enough i think most people will end


---------38:02----------
up in a relationship if that's what they


---------38:04----------
want right like you can try really hard


---------38:06----------
and you can work on a bunch of things


---------38:07----------
and you can get there in dota like i


---------38:09----------
don't know that you can ever get there


---------38:12----------
because at the end of the day like


---------38:13----------
there's someone on the other side of the


---------38:14----------
table who could be working just as hard


---------38:16----------
as you are


---------38:17----------
and so even though you put in all this


---------38:19----------
work like it could be luck it could be


---------38:22----------
rng it could be that they had a better


---------38:24----------
idea than you did it could be that


---------38:26----------
their ideas happen to align with the


---------38:29----------
current meta


---------38:31----------
so even though your ideas are superior


---------38:33----------
that like the meta favors their ideas


---------38:35----------
over your ideas


---------38:37----------
um


---------38:38----------
you can certainly also argue that you


---------38:40----------
know the good teams are the ones that


---------38:42----------
adapt their ideas to the meta and things


---------38:44----------
like that so like the point is that you


---------38:46----------
can make a point and counterpoint for


---------38:48----------
any given thing and like you can


---------38:51----------
and you'll never know what the right


---------38:52----------
answer is


---------38:54----------
so it's just incredibly complex


---------38:57----------
and the the really shocking thing is


---------38:59----------
that you don't ever have like a a real


---------39:02----------
answer to


---------39:04----------
base things on


---------39:05----------
right so like even in in the rest of


---------39:07----------
life like we'll have like if you're at


---------39:09----------
your job you have a performance review


---------39:11----------
where people will sit down and will tell


---------39:12----------
you hey we think you need to like work


---------39:14----------
on a b and c and they may not be a


---------39:16----------
hundred percent correct but like there's


---------39:18----------
nothing like that in dota right it's not


---------39:19----------
like


---------39:20----------
you know lgd a team spirit is gonna sit


---------39:23----------
down with lgd after the tournament


---------39:24----------
they're gonna be like hey here's the


---------39:26----------
reason we think you lost we think you


---------39:27----------
need to work on like a b and c


---------39:29----------
like professional teams are not gonna


---------39:30----------
give each other like feedback


---------39:33----------
to help them improve so it's like how


---------39:35----------
the hell do you improve how the hell do


---------39:36----------
you know what works and what doesn't


---------39:38----------
work it's just it's just a mind-numbing


---------39:41----------
amount of like uncertainty and poor


---------39:43----------
quality information it blows my mind


---------39:47----------
and so then also like if we talk about


---------39:49----------
you know now there's the ti shuffle


---------39:51----------
season right so everyone's like rumoring


---------39:53----------
about what's gonna happen what's not


---------39:54----------
gonna happen by the way i know a lot


---------39:56----------
about what's gonna happen but i can't


---------39:57----------
say


---------39:58----------
um


---------39:59----------
so you know do you kick a particular


---------40:01----------
player that's another great example of


---------40:03----------
like uh


---------40:05----------
you never know


---------40:06----------
right


---------40:07----------
you never know like so like let's say


---------40:09----------
you have a poor performance at ti do you


---------40:11----------
replace someone or do you not replace


---------40:12----------
someone


---------40:13----------
is that person the reason that you lost


---------40:20----------
okay


---------40:21----------
uh is that person the reason that you


---------40:22----------
lost you you never know right like so


---------40:25----------
you can kick someone you can replace i


---------40:26----------
have theories about why people get


---------40:28----------
kicked and why teams are successful


---------40:30----------
there's so much i've learned chat


---------40:33----------
um


---------40:34----------
but it's it's like challenging right so


---------40:36----------
like just think about that question like


---------40:37----------
how do you know that kicking someone is


---------40:39----------
going to lead to success you don't


---------40:41----------
how do you know that that person was


---------40:43----------
really the problem you actually don't


---------40:44----------
like you can assess and you can make a


---------40:46----------
judgment right but you never really know


---------40:53----------
i actually don't know what eg is gonna


---------40:54----------
do i know about other teams


---------40:57----------
um


---------41:03----------
yeah


---------41:05----------
so


---------41:10----------
yeah so let me just share with you guys


---------41:12----------
like something that i did sort of notice


---------41:13----------
so here's an example of like what's hard


---------41:15----------
about dota


---------41:17----------
so i'm going to talk for a second about


---------41:19----------
doubt and confidence and regression


---------41:22----------
so if we kind of think about


---------41:26----------
um so i kind of have a hypothesis as to


---------41:29----------
why


---------41:30----------
teams


---------41:34----------
consistently


---------41:35----------
underperform


---------41:37----------
okay so like what tends to happen is


---------41:40----------
like you know at some point in the


---------41:41----------
tournament you're gonna start to doubt


---------41:43----------
your strategies unless you just dominate


---------41:45----------
everyone which is generally speaking not


---------41:46----------
gonna happen


---------41:47----------
and even if you if you do you know win


---------41:50----------
games like sometimes there are games


---------41:51----------
that you win where you're filled with


---------41:52----------
doubt and other games that you win that


---------41:55----------
you're you know other games that you


---------41:57----------
lose where you're actually not doubting


---------41:58----------
at all so that's the other really


---------42:00----------
interesting thing is that like you know


---------42:01----------
you can win a game and you can be like


---------42:02----------
we really had no idea what we were doing


---------42:04----------
and they just threw so does that mean


---------42:06----------
that your strategy is good or like


---------42:08----------
or what you know


---------42:10----------
um


---------42:11----------
but i think that one of the things


---------42:13----------
that's important to remember is that


---------42:14----------
when people doubt


---------42:16----------
uh so i'll just share with you guys like


---------42:17----------
one example of something that i kind of


---------42:19----------
notice from like understanding


---------42:20----------
psychology in the human mind


---------42:23----------
so generally speaking what will happen


---------42:25----------
is people will um


---------42:27----------
you know people will develop a game plan


---------42:29----------
as a team right and so we're going to


---------42:30----------
say like okay this is what our game plan


---------42:32----------
is we're going to do this we're going to


---------42:33----------
do this we're going to do this


---------42:34----------
and then as the game starts to fall


---------42:37----------
apart or as people begin to doubt and


---------42:40----------
you because you have to sometimes you


---------42:42----------
have to adapt too right so if your game


---------42:43----------
plan isn't working


---------42:45----------
that's also tricky like there's times


---------42:46----------
where doubting your game plan is like


---------42:49----------
really important because


---------42:51----------
doubt and adaptation kind of go hand in


---------42:53----------
hand so the person who never doubts will


---------42:55----------
never adapt because if i'm i'm sure i'm


---------42:57----------
right then like there's no reason to


---------42:59----------
change what i'm doing and so then you're


---------43:01----------
dooming yourself to a life without


---------43:02----------
adaptation


---------43:04----------
so that that's kind of interesting


---------43:05----------
because people sort of think a little


---------43:06----------
bit about like you know confidence is


---------43:08----------
like really good but it's been my


---------43:09----------
experience that actually doubting is


---------43:10----------
actually super healthy as well


---------43:12----------
and then what happens when we sort of


---------43:14----------
get into a period of doubt is i notice


---------43:15----------
that a lot of teams will actually


---------43:17----------
regress and what i mean by regress is


---------43:19----------
that you have to remember that these


---------43:20----------
players have played dota for like ten


---------43:22----------
thousand twenty thousand thirty thousand


---------43:24----------
forty thousand hours and they've


---------43:26----------
developed their own particular style and


---------43:28----------
as a team you can put together you know


---------43:30----------
a game plan but as the game plan starts


---------43:33----------
to fall apart


---------43:35----------
and you can't stick to that game plan


---------43:37----------
what tends to happen is that players


---------43:39----------
will sort of regress back to what they


---------43:42----------
know so they'll sort of go to like


---------43:44----------
defaulting to like their particular play


---------43:46----------
style and they won't necessarily play as


---------43:48----------
a team anymore


---------43:50----------
and so this is also something that we


---------43:51----------
kind of see in relationships for example


---------43:54----------
so generally speaking when relationships


---------43:55----------
are under a period of stress what will


---------43:57----------
happen is like the people in the


---------43:59----------
relationship will regress to their own


---------44:01----------
style of like how they manage conflict


---------44:04----------
right so we may be able to communicate


---------44:06----------
healthily while everything is going well


---------44:08----------
but when there's stress under the


---------44:10----------
relationship i'm gonna regress and what


---------44:12----------
i'm gonna do is like i'm gonna shut down


---------44:14----------
whereas my partner may turn to


---------44:16----------
you know talking to their mom


---------44:19----------
all the time about like complaining


---------44:21----------
about the relationship so whereas i may


---------44:23----------
sort of withdraw into myself like my


---------44:24----------
apartment partner may do something else


---------44:26----------
and so then we sort of start to get on


---------44:28----------
different pages


---------44:30----------
once the initial game plan or once like


---------44:32----------
things start to fall apart and there's a


---------44:33----------
period of stress


---------44:35----------
and so i think one of the things that i


---------44:36----------
see a lot in teams is that you know


---------44:38----------
sometimes they'll play coordinated but i


---------44:40----------
think what what sort of happens is as


---------44:42----------
things don't go their way


---------44:44----------
the way if you have to adapt on the fly


---------44:47----------
the way in which you adapt is based on


---------44:49----------
your own experience and what you've


---------44:50----------
trained and so what can happen in an


---------44:52----------
individual game of dota is you can have


---------44:54----------
five people adapting in their own way


---------44:57----------
and so when they start to adapt in their


---------44:59----------
own way because they're not all thinking


---------45:00----------
exactly the same because once again


---------45:02----------
they're not open ai


---------45:03----------
they start to become uncoordinated so


---------45:06----------
working on these kinds of things is a


---------45:07----------
lot of like what i was kind of doing um


---------45:10----------
right so helping people like coordinate


---------45:12----------
communicate helping people recognize


---------45:14----------
some of these kinds of things i think


---------45:15----------
it's just an interesting like example of


---------45:18----------
um


---------45:20----------
you know how complex esports actually is


---------45:26----------
anyway


---------45:27----------
i'm kind of all over the place today


---------45:29----------
just sharing thoughts


---------45:39----------
i don't know do people not have forty


---------45:41----------
thousand hours in dota


---------45:43----------
do pros not have that


---------45:48----------
well so some people are saying dr k


---------45:50----------
equals best coach so that that's


---------45:52----------
so there's


---------45:54----------
two ways to look at that right one way


---------45:55----------
to look at that is that eg had a good


---------45:57----------
season the other way to look at that is


---------45:59----------
eg placed 9th to 12th at ti


---------46:02----------
so what do y'all think


---------46:04----------
is it dr k or dr kw


---------46:09----------
could be either one right it depends on


---------46:10----------
your standard of judgment


---------46:26----------
what is this uh what is this man


---------46:30----------
the keck w that's the that's the spanish


---------46:33----------
dude right


---------46:45----------
that's this guy right


---------46:50----------
yeah that guy's great


---------46:53----------
okay


---------46:54----------
so next thing that i want to do is i'm


---------46:55----------
going to share with you all just a


---------46:56----------
couple of takeaways


---------46:59----------
so here's what i'd say is like some of


---------47:00----------
the most important stuff that i learned


---------47:02----------
from


---------47:03----------
uh


---------47:04----------
being at ti


---------47:06----------
so the first kind of takeaway is that


---------47:08----------
really like the only choice you truly


---------47:10----------
have in life is to move forward or not


---------47:13----------
move forward so as i just kind of said


---------47:15----------
you know you never really know


---------47:19----------
why you may have won or why you may have


---------47:22----------
lost right you get disappointed


---------47:25----------
you don't really know like maybe the job


---------47:26----------
market is bad maybe you know she's just


---------47:29----------
not that into you maybe he's still


---------47:31----------
getting out of a relationship


---------47:33----------
you never really know why things don't


---------47:35----------
go in your favor


---------47:37----------
you can hypothesize and by all means you


---------47:39----------
should hypothesize it's healthy to


---------47:40----------
hypothesize so that you can adapt


---------47:43----------
you know work on yourself etc


---------47:45----------
but at the end of the day you never


---------47:46----------
really know what you did wrong or what


---------47:49----------
you did right there's no perfect source


---------47:50----------
of information so if you guys have


---------47:52----------
setbacks in life i think the first thing


---------47:54----------
to understand is it's not about


---------47:57----------
necessarily figuring out the right


---------47:59----------
answer it's about deciding to


---------48:01----------
deciding am i going to try again or not


---------48:04----------
try again


---------48:05----------
and it's it's certainly my you know it's


---------48:07----------
been my experience and i thought about


---------48:08----------
this a lot too where people were sort of


---------48:10----------
asking me like you know i remember


---------48:11----------
ruthie was sort of asking me do you


---------48:13----------
think it was like worth your time to go


---------48:15----------
and i think it was absolutely worth my


---------48:17----------
time i mean would have been night would


---------48:18----------
it have been nice if eg won ti like


---------48:20----------
absolutely would that have made me happy


---------48:22----------
but i don't think that the experience


---------48:23----------
was a failure


---------48:25----------
just because eg didn't win ti


---------48:27----------
i think there's a lot to learn from you


---------48:30----------
know i mean i learned so much like like


---------48:32----------
it's just i'm i haven't been


---------48:35----------
this clueless about something and


---------48:37----------
learned so much in many many years so it


---------48:39----------
was one of the most educational


---------48:41----------
experiences of my life


---------48:43----------
and i think the first and only real


---------48:45----------
question is like do you move forward


---------48:46----------
like jeremy


---------48:48----------
um the second thing to understand is


---------48:50----------
that in life despite all of your best


---------48:52----------
efforts


---------48:53----------
winning is not guaranteed


---------48:56----------
and i know it's it's kind of interesting


---------48:57----------
but like we don't really view it that


---------48:59----------
way right like i think at the end of the


---------49:01----------
day you can try your best you can try to


---------49:04----------
get in shape you can clean up your


---------49:06----------
wardrobe you can get a nice haircut you


---------49:08----------
can have a makeover and you can ask out


---------49:10----------
your crush and they may still


---------49:13----------
say no


---------49:14----------
so you can and you don't have to be


---------49:16----------
participating in ti to understand this


---------49:18----------
right any game of dota you can show up


---------49:20----------
in any game of dota a pub game


---------49:24----------
um you know a ti tournament game


---------49:27----------
and like


---------49:28----------
you can be you can give it everything


---------49:30----------
you've got it doesn't matter like you


---------49:32----------
can give it everything you've got and


---------49:33----------
you may not win so the one one of the


---------49:35----------
hardest things about life is that


---------49:38----------
no matter how much effort you put in


---------49:41----------
you are never guaranteed to be


---------49:43----------
successful


---------49:45----------
[Music]


---------49:46----------
so the next thing is that


---------49:48----------
speaking about you know how to be


---------49:49----------
successful


---------49:51----------
is i want you all to understand that


---------49:52----------
like even though you can never guarantee


---------49:55----------
success there are very very concrete


---------49:58----------
things you can do to improve your


---------49:59----------
chances of success and this is sort of


---------50:02----------
the attitude that i advocate in life is


---------50:04----------
that you may not be able to get someone


---------50:06----------
to fall in love with you but you can


---------50:07----------
absolutely do a lot of things to


---------50:09----------
increase your chances


---------50:11----------
and so i think a lot of times what


---------50:12----------
happens is we get emotionally caught up


---------50:14----------
in a particular result right so like for


---------50:17----------
example


---------50:18----------
not winning ti


---------50:20----------
and that result can be so devastating


---------50:22----------
that it actually like shatters us and we


---------50:25----------
feel like not moving forward we feel


---------50:27----------
like practicing is a waste of time we


---------50:28----------
feel like you know we never really know


---------50:30----------
like i'm saying hindsight isn't 20 20.


---------50:32----------
so what's the point in trying despair


---------50:34----------
can set in all kinds of like bad stuff


---------50:36----------
can happen


---------50:37----------
but at the end of the day i think the


---------50:38----------
success the formula for success is about


---------50:41----------
working on what you can work it work on


---------50:43----------
and increasing the probability of


---------50:45----------
success as much as you can


---------50:47----------
even though you may not ever be able to


---------50:49----------
hit 100 chance of success there are very


---------50:52----------
concrete things that you can do to


---------50:53----------
improve


---------50:54----------
right so if we look at something like


---------50:56----------
dota let's forget about professional


---------50:57----------
players but like myself like i'm a 2k


---------50:59----------
player there are things that i can


---------51:00----------
improve


---------51:01----------
and so i can look at a particular game


---------51:03----------
of dota and i can say there's no way i


---------51:04----------
could have won that game and that could


---------51:05----------
have been absolutely true


---------51:07----------
but you have to be able to hold the


---------51:08----------
dialectic which means hold kind of


---------51:10----------
contrary things at the same time which


---------51:12----------
is that


---------51:13----------
it was impossible for me to win this


---------51:15----------
game


---------51:16----------
and at the same time there are a lot of


---------51:18----------
things i could do to get better


---------51:21----------
and so if you guys are feeling stuck in


---------51:23----------
life and you don't really like you know


---------51:26----------
even though you may never be able to get


---------51:28----------
to 100 chance of success it doesn't mean


---------51:31----------
that you are powerless in the face of


---------51:33----------
your circumstances there are absolutely


---------51:35----------
things that you can improve right so if


---------51:37----------
you're stuck


---------51:38----------
you know


---------51:40----------
like i'll just share like you know i


---------51:41----------
applied to medical school 120 times


---------51:44----------
and


---------51:46----------
even though i got rejected 120 times


---------51:48----------
like each time i got rejected it was


---------51:50----------
three application cycles so really three


---------51:52----------
times like i applied for to 40 medical


---------51:53----------
schools and you know each time i i


---------51:56----------
applied for the application cycle the


---------51:58----------
next year


---------51:59----------
like


---------52:01----------
i can work on that application i can


---------52:02----------
improve it and i can try to apply again


---------52:05----------
so i think if you want to be successful


---------52:06----------
in life


---------52:08----------
you know even though it's kind of


---------52:09----------
bizarre but don't shoot for a guaranteed


---------52:11----------
success just try to increase your odds


---------52:13----------
of success as much as possible


---------52:17----------
and this is kind of the last thing that


---------52:19----------
i sort of learned is that it's really


---------52:20----------
important to stay detached


---------52:22----------
and i i know that this is a big


---------52:24----------
philosophy that we have at healthy gamer


---------52:26----------
right so we we kind of advocate for


---------52:29----------
devoting yourself to your actions and


---------52:31----------
being detached from the outcomes of your


---------52:33----------
actions


---------52:34----------
and what i mean by that is that like you


---------52:36----------
know you can the most you can never win


---------52:38----------
a game of dota


---------52:39----------
all you can do is play a game of dota to


---------52:41----------
the best of your ability and if you lose


---------52:44----------
that game of dota all you can do is try


---------52:46----------
to learn from that from the best of your


---------52:48----------
ability so you can watch replays you can


---------52:50----------
practice last hitting you can think


---------52:51----------
about item builds you can talk to other


---------52:53----------
people about it you can try to improve


---------52:55----------
your odds of success and then the second


---------52:57----------
game that you go into you're still not


---------52:58----------
guaranteed success right there's there's


---------53:01----------
nothing you can do to guarantee that you


---------53:03----------
will win a particular game of dota


---------53:06----------
and so this is something that's really


---------53:08----------
really hard to do in dota and in life


---------53:10----------
but i think that this is where like you


---------53:12----------
know i'll share this but like i know


---------53:14----------
it's kind of weird but


---------53:16----------
you know dota is the same game


---------53:17----------
whether you're playing it in a pub


---------53:19----------
whether i'm playing it or artesi's


---------53:21----------
playing it or you know ame is playing it


---------53:23----------
or collapses playing it


---------53:25----------
it's the same game the heroes are the


---------53:26----------
same the items are the same the timings


---------53:28----------
are the same runes spawn every two


---------53:30----------
minutes bounty runes spawn every three


---------53:32----------
minutes the game is exactly the same


---------53:34----------
whether you're playing a pub or you're


---------53:35----------
playing in the grand finals of ti


---------53:38----------
it's exactly the same


---------53:40----------
so what is it that makes your ability to


---------53:43----------
play it so different


---------53:45----------
right what is the difference between a


---------53:47----------
pub and being in the grand finals at ti


---------53:50----------
it's all up here


---------53:51----------
and so this is the big thing that i


---------53:53----------
think a lot of people miss is that most


---------53:55----------
of life


---------53:56----------
is just what it is


---------53:58----------
but your ability to succeed at life or


---------54:00----------
crack under the pressure all comes from


---------54:03----------
here


---------54:04----------
right because what is the pressure the


---------54:05----------
game is exactly the same


---------54:07----------
right like last hitting mechanics are


---------54:09----------
exactly the same like the patches you


---------54:11----------
know for the duration of this ti is


---------54:12----------
exactly the same the items are the same


---------54:15----------
everything's the same


---------54:16----------
and in life like what we do on a daily


---------54:18----------
basis is sort of exactly the same


---------54:21----------
you have to wake up you have to decide


---------54:22----------
okay am i gonna am i gonna study today


---------54:25----------
or not study today or you know


---------54:27----------
it's all the same


---------54:30----------
where the pressure comes from where the


---------54:32----------
confusion comes from where the doubt


---------54:33----------
comes from and where the confidence


---------54:35----------
comes from is all up here and too often


---------54:38----------
in life when something doesn't go our


---------54:40----------
way what we try to do is find some


---------54:43----------
external thing to blame


---------54:44----------
right like oh like


---------54:48----------
you know the reason i don't get it i


---------54:49----------
didn't get promoted is because of like


---------54:51----------
politics at the workplace


---------54:53----------
and you can sort of say something like


---------54:54----------
that you can say okay like so gg i'm


---------54:56----------
done


---------54:57----------
but then like you know there's first of


---------54:59----------
all that may not even be true you may be


---------55:00----------
attributing a lack of poor performance


---------55:03----------
to politics in the workplace maybe you


---------55:04----------
just are not as good at your job


---------55:06----------
in someone else's


---------55:08----------
maybe you call that politics or the


---------55:10----------
other way the other thing to think about


---------55:12----------
is if it's politics at the workplace why


---------55:14----------
can't you learn politics at the


---------55:16----------
workplace why can't you learn how to be


---------55:18----------
a political animal at the workplace


---------55:20----------
so the key thing is that you know


---------55:25----------
the game of life tends to be pretty


---------55:27----------
consistent


---------55:29----------
the game of dota tends to be pretty


---------55:30----------
consistent


---------55:32----------
the big difference in terms of whether


---------55:34----------
you succeed or fail has to do with the


---------55:36----------
player


---------55:37----------
right it has to do them with the mindset


---------55:38----------
of the player it has to do with the


---------55:40----------
person who you're the player of your


---------55:42----------
life so the question is what's going on


---------55:44----------
up here


---------55:45----------
because this is what you need to work on


---------55:47----------
because generally speaking like the


---------55:49----------
rules of life are like


---------55:50----------
like kind of the same right you can work


---------55:52----------
on your resume you can apply for a job


---------55:54----------
you can get in shape you can do all


---------55:56----------
those things


---------55:57----------
it's just how you play the game


---------55:59----------
so it's all it all kind of comes down to


---------56:01----------
you


---------56:09----------
so overall it's been fantastic


---------56:12----------
you know it was an amazing opportunity


---------56:14----------
to


---------56:15----------
be able to go to ti i'm honestly like


---------56:17----------
honored


---------56:18----------
and um


---------56:20----------
you know i said as much to all the


---------56:22----------
players like you know the day after they


---------56:23----------
got knocked out of the tournament like i


---------56:25----------
was kind of telling them kind of tearing


---------56:26----------
up a little bit that it's been amazing


---------56:28----------
to like work with them over the last


---------56:29----------
year i'm really grateful for the


---------56:31----------
opportunity like i'm proud of them


---------56:33----------
i'm proud of what they've accomplished


---------56:35----------
like i understand that it's okay to be


---------56:36----------
disappointed


---------56:38----------
but just personally like it's been an


---------56:40----------
amazing opportunity and i'm so grateful


---------56:42----------
because as someone who has been playing


---------56:44----------
dota since it was a warcraft 3 mod


---------56:47----------
the ability to go to actual like go to


---------56:50----------
ti was amazing in and of itself this


---------56:51----------
year


---------56:52----------
uh because of covet and all that right


---------56:54----------
so i was like super lucky there and to


---------56:56----------
actually be able to sit down and like


---------56:58----------
talk to players right so like i've been


---------57:00----------
watching arteezy stream for years


---------57:02----------
and to be able to sit down and like have


---------57:04----------
lunch with him it's like it's amazing


---------57:06----------
um i'm so lucky i'm so lucky that i was


---------57:08----------
able to be a part of their journey even


---------57:10----------
if it is a little bit disappointing you


---------57:12----------
know it doesn't i don't i don't view the


---------57:14----------
value of my life or my time based on the


---------57:17----------
results of what happens


---------57:19----------
so sometimes people would even ask me


---------57:21----------
they'd ask like you know are you like


---------57:22----------
disappointed


---------57:24----------
right like are you disappointed in like


---------57:26----------
how the tournament went and stuff like


---------57:27----------
that


---------57:29----------
and and no i'm i'm not right because i


---------57:31----------
think or i mean like i'm somewhat i'm


---------57:32----------
not disappointed in in the team


---------57:35----------
the result is disappointing but that's


---------57:37----------
just life right like you can't tie


---------57:39----------
yourself to your results


---------57:41----------
you have to focus on like the people


---------57:43----------
involved and the effort that you put in


---------57:45----------
and what comes next that's the real test


---------57:48----------
and so you know


---------57:51----------
i i feel like this is what i'm about to


---------57:52----------
say is a little bit idiotic i was going


---------57:54----------
to say that you know the real test comes


---------57:56----------
after you lose ti


---------57:58----------
because i think that's really what what


---------58:00----------
makes us who we are in life it's not


---------58:01----------
about how we win it's about how we lose


---------58:04----------
right so if you if you think about you


---------58:06----------
know people who i respect


---------58:08----------
they're not the ones who had it really


---------58:10----------
easy had a 90 chance of success and then


---------58:12----------
like ended up getting the promotion it's


---------58:15----------
the person who failed once and then


---------58:17----------
picks themselves up off the mat and


---------58:19----------
tries to do better and decides to apply


---------58:21----------
again


---------58:22----------
and so i think this is something that


---------58:23----------
that i encourage all you all to take to


---------58:25----------
heart to and i learned i saw this lesson


---------58:28----------
being lived out and hopefully it'll


---------58:30----------
continue to be lived out


---------58:32----------
which is you know in life you can't


---------58:34----------
control what's gonna happen so the the


---------58:36----------
only thing that you really have within


---------58:38----------
your power to control as a human being


---------58:40----------
is what you do with the loss


---------58:42----------
and like i said earlier you know ti is a


---------58:45----------
tournament where there are five winners


---------58:46----------
and 85 losers it's like literally how


---------58:48----------
it's designed it's designed for the vast


---------58:51----------
majority of people to be losers


---------58:54----------
and unfortunately in life i think this


---------58:56----------
is also true that most people are the


---------58:58----------
losers


---------59:00----------
the winners are few and far between


---------59:03----------
there there are very few of us i mean


---------59:04----------
and i


---------59:06----------
you know who really have the opportunity


---------59:08----------
for success are lucky enough


---------59:11----------
to succeed


---------59:12----------
um sure is there hard work but like you


---------59:15----------
know if i think about myself it's like


---------59:17----------
did i work hard yeah some people will


---------59:19----------
say like oh you know you deserve your


---------59:20----------
success i don't know that any i don't


---------59:22----------
know that i do deserve my success


---------59:25----------
because it's not like i work any harder


---------59:27----------
than


---------59:28----------
let's say a single mother of two who's


---------59:30----------
like working two and a half jobs


---------59:33----------
right i remember having patients like


---------59:35----------
that who work actually way harder than i


---------59:37----------
do


---------59:38----------
um you know they they try so hard


---------59:40----------
they're like in a single parent


---------59:41----------
household do so much for their kids


---------59:43----------
work super hard sacrifice all of their


---------59:46----------
like personal time for the benefit of


---------59:48----------
their children


---------59:49----------
and why do i deserve more than that


---------59:51----------
person i don't


---------59:54----------
so i i don't know i mean i think in life


---------59:56----------
you know you don't necessarily get what


---------59:58----------
you deserve and i don't know what


---------59:59----------
determines what you deserve


---------60:01----------
but i all i know is that


---------60:03----------
you know


---------60:05----------
what you're worth and what i respect


---------60:06----------
people for is how you


---------60:09----------
manage what you're given whether that's


---------60:11----------
a win or a loss whether you're gracious


---------60:13----------
as a winner


---------60:15----------
and you try to support other people if


---------60:16----------
you're one of the lucky ones or as a


---------60:18----------
loser whether you pick yourself up off


---------60:20----------
the mat and decide to try again


---------60:23----------
so at the end of the day i'd say focus


---------60:24----------
on your actions and focus on yourselves


---------60:27----------
and it's okay to be a loser the truth is


---------60:29----------
that the vast majority of people on the


---------60:30----------
planet are like losers


---------60:32----------
right the number of people who are in


---------60:34----------
poverty


---------60:35----------
far outweighs the number of people who


---------60:37----------
have ultra high net worth wealth


---------60:39----------
inequality is getting worse


---------60:41----------
that's just life


---------60:43----------
so that's the that's the the life that


---------60:45----------
we you know that's the hand that we've


---------60:47----------
been dealt in life and the goal is to


---------60:49----------
try to do what you can with it


---------60:56----------
questions


---------61:15----------
will you be attending the next year bro


---------61:17----------
i attended this ti the team that i


---------61:19----------
worked with got 9th to 12th


---------61:21----------
will i be attending the next ti let's


---------61:23----------
start by asking the team


---------61:25----------
whether they want me there


---------61:29----------
you guys are making it sound like i've


---------61:31----------
got an invitation


---------61:44----------
uh


---------61:45----------
i'm kind of trolling so my relationship


---------61:47----------
with eg is fantastic


---------61:50----------
as far as i can tell anyway so i i think


---------61:52----------
we got to be really close and it was


---------61:53----------
really awesome i really loved going


---------61:56----------
really loved getting i think


---------61:58----------
irrespective of whether i go to ti or


---------62:00----------
don't go to ti or you know whatever


---------62:01----------
happens i i think hopefully we'll be


---------62:03----------
friends


---------62:04----------
for you know a long time


---------62:09----------
i i i love the players like just as


---------62:11----------
people they're just such amazing


---------62:12----------
individuals each and every one of them


---------62:15----------
you know they each have their own


---------62:16----------
particular style and and like manner


---------62:19----------
but they're all fantastic


---------62:30----------
so someone's asking do you think rtz


---------62:32----------
will ever win a ti and then i see the


---------62:35----------
next question the question right after


---------62:37----------
it is how do you focus on the process


---------62:39----------
so you focus on the process by not


---------62:41----------
asking that question


---------62:43----------
right so i have no idea if rtz will ever


---------62:44----------
win a ti statistically most professional


---------62:47----------
dota players will never win a ti


---------62:49----------
but here's what i'd say


---------62:52----------
your chances of winning ti are a lot


---------62:54----------
greater the more that you accept that


---------62:56----------
it's just a game of dota


---------62:58----------
and so one thing that i really loved was


---------63:01----------
uh ts's if you guys like listen to their


---------63:04----------
coach i think the attitude that they had


---------63:06----------
for game five was perfect


---------63:08----------
someone asked them what's your strategy


---------63:10----------
and he's like my strategy is luck


---------63:12----------
our strategy is luck


---------63:14----------
and that's honestly like when i heard


---------63:15----------
that i i was watching the game with some


---------63:17----------
people and i was like i think these guys


---------63:19----------
are gonna win


---------63:20----------
like it's it's an acknowledgement that


---------63:22----------
there's only so much you can do


---------63:25----------
right there's no strategy that's gonna


---------63:27----------
guarantee you success


---------63:29----------
it's just you show up and you play the


---------63:30----------
best god damn dota of your life and you


---------63:33----------
hope that gaben is on your side


---------63:35----------
that's the ultimate strategy to nti


---------63:39----------
i'm not kidding


---------63:42----------
like


---------63:43----------
that's why what i was you know what i


---------63:44----------
explained to people is like


---------63:47----------
you know i know it sounds bizarre but


---------63:49----------
the game of dota is exactly the same


---------63:50----------
whether you're playing a pub or game


---------63:52----------
five of the grand finals it's the same


---------63:53----------
damn game


---------63:55----------
it's just getting psyched out in your


---------63:56----------
head because it's game five of ti grand


---------63:59----------
finals that's what that's what screws


---------64:01----------
you over


---------64:10----------
so people are asking specifics about eg


---------64:12----------
i'm not gonna comment specifically on


---------64:14----------
players and like what's going on so i


---------64:16----------
think that like all of my other clients


---------64:18----------
so the relationship is public obviously


---------64:19----------
but um i think they're all they're all


---------64:22----------
entitled to privacy so i'm not gonna


---------64:24----------
answer any specific questions about


---------64:26----------
the players


---------64:29----------
i apologize


---------64:35----------
i'm happy to share my experience well


---------64:36----------
working with bulb is great dude working


---------64:38----------
with all the players was a lot of fun


---------64:43----------
um


---------64:45----------
yeah i've talked to a lot of other teams


---------64:47----------
i've worked with more teams than eg


---------64:49----------
in a manner of speaking


---------64:52----------
um


---------65:00----------
uh so just a little bit about romania so


---------65:03----------
i know that like


---------65:04----------
i mean we probably jumped on this this


---------65:06----------
bandwagon a little bit too so like we


---------65:08----------
sent out some pictures of like you know


---------65:10----------
the quarantine food and stuff like that


---------65:12----------
so here's what i'd say i think valve


---------65:14----------
gets a lot of crap


---------65:15----------
right they said like valve should do


---------65:17----------
this and valve should do that and i


---------65:19----------
think pgl also like got some crap i


---------65:21----------
think you all have to understand so i i


---------65:23----------
mean i think this is once against the


---------65:25----------
internet being judgmental like


---------65:26----------
organizing a tournament during kovid is


---------65:29----------
not easy


---------65:31----------
there are so many things that go into


---------65:33----------
like organizing a major esports event


---------65:36----------
um i mean it's hard like there's like


---------65:38----------
visas and flights and like daily covet


---------65:40----------
tests they did a lot of stuff that i


---------65:42----------
think that was actually really cool so


---------65:43----------
they gave us these little bluetooth


---------65:45----------
trackers


---------65:46----------
that sort of track


---------65:48----------
which people you're around so that if


---------65:50----------
one person tests positive they know who


---------65:53----------
that person has been exposed to


---------65:55----------
uh because they know based on your


---------65:57----------
bluetooth data so it does it's not like


---------65:59----------
a gps tracker that like tracks your


---------66:01----------
location it just knows like okay which


---------66:03----------
tracker has had contact with like which


---------66:05----------
other trackers


---------66:07----------
and so it's i think that it's like


---------66:10----------
you know like it's very very hard to


---------66:12----------
organize a tournament of this magnitude


---------66:15----------
in these kinds of circumstances


---------66:17----------
so even though there were some things


---------66:19----------
that you know i i certainly think the


---------66:20----------
tournament could have done better or


---------66:21----------
valve could have done better i mean


---------66:23----------
obviously there's room for improvement


---------66:24----------
all the time


---------66:25----------
i i think it's important to remember


---------66:27----------
that like


---------66:29----------
pulling it off is not easy to do like


---------66:31----------
sure there are problems but just the


---------66:33----------
fact that the tournament even happened


---------66:35----------
that we had a ti this year


---------66:36----------
right because like sweden basically was


---------66:38----------
like yeah that's not gonna happen and


---------66:39----------
then valve is like what do you do with


---------66:41----------
your valve


---------66:43----------
you know it's tough


---------66:45----------
it's really tough


---------66:46----------
how do you organize something on such


---------66:48----------
short notice like all the con like the


---------66:50----------
country governments are like concerned


---------66:51----------
about kovid players are coming from all


---------66:53----------
over the world


---------66:55----------
you know different countries have


---------66:56----------
different levels of like coveted


---------66:57----------
restrictions


---------66:59----------
so you know can you hold ti in a country


---------67:02----------
and like what if that country decides


---------67:04----------
like oh by the way we're not going to


---------67:05----------
allow anyone from you know


---------67:08----------
malaysia


---------67:10----------
then what


---------67:11----------
like how do you manage all that it's so


---------67:12----------
hard


---------67:28----------
um


---------67:33----------
student florida


---------67:35----------
yeah


---------67:40----------
i'm just reading questions


---------67:45----------
uh so


---------67:47----------
i if you guys i thought the seb and no


---------67:49----------
tail casts were excellent if you guys


---------67:51----------
didn't see those


---------67:53----------
like i think really listening to their


---------67:54----------
view


---------67:55----------
i think they shared a lot of information


---------67:57----------
so i'm not sure i think sam said he was


---------67:59----------
retiring right


---------68:04----------
you see i don't know


---------68:06----------
but yeah the draft panel was brilliant


---------68:08----------
i also think um


---------68:12----------
uh so did i get some dope ti merch i did


---------68:14----------
get some ti merch it was really nice and


---------68:16----------
i was also a little bit disappointed


---------68:18----------
because of all the covered restrictions


---------68:19----------
so the people who are gonna bring all


---------68:20----------
the merch like couldn't


---------68:23----------
so the other neat thing technically chat


---------68:26----------
technically


---------68:28----------
okay there's one story i can tell you


---------68:29----------
guys okay


---------68:30----------
so when we first got to ti


---------68:33----------
we got to romania


---------68:36----------
it turned out that ig and astor had


---------68:38----------
players who had gotten kovid


---------68:40----------
so


---------68:41----------
you know like


---------68:43----------
i was kind of asking people i was


---------68:44----------
talking to fly


---------68:46----------
and so i was like you know fly wow so


---------68:47----------
like that's crazy that you know these


---------68:49----------
people you know people got covered and


---------68:50----------
stuff what you know uh what happens if


---------68:53----------
one of y'all gets coveted like do you


---------68:54----------
guys play with a stand-in or what and


---------68:56----------
he's like no no no like there aren't


---------68:57----------
stand-ins like you the the tournament


---------68:59----------
rules are such that


---------69:01----------
um you can't play like you can't like


---------69:04----------
pull another player from a different


---------69:05----------
team or something like that so i i kind


---------69:08----------
of asked him you know if a team gets


---------69:09----------
eliminated and you guys like it someone


---------69:11----------
gets coveted like mid tournament can you


---------69:13----------
like pull someone from a different team


---------69:15----------
and he's like no


---------69:16----------
and he's like the the stand-ins have to


---------69:18----------
be from your pod of eight so each team


---------69:20----------
gets eight people


---------69:22----------
and so he's like


---------69:23----------
and so he was like you know if we get if


---------69:25----------
one person gets kovin then bulba's gonna


---------69:27----------
have to play if another person gets


---------69:29----------
covid then wilson's gonna be second


---------69:31----------
standing


---------69:32----------
and then if three people on the team get


---------69:34----------
to go big it looks like it's gonna be dr


---------69:36----------
k playing


---------69:40----------
and i gotta say that is the scariest


---------69:43----------
moment in my life like i've been with a


---------69:46----------
lot of scary boats and i was like tal


---------69:48----------
you're joking right and he's like no i'm


---------69:49----------
not joking he's like if we three people


---------69:51----------
get sick like you're gonna have to play


---------69:52----------
at ti i was like oh my god


---------69:56----------
and so i was so terrified


---------69:59----------
i was like oh my god that's good that's


---------70:03----------
so scary dude


---------70:06----------
but technically


---------70:07----------
technically i was on a team at ti i was


---------70:10----------
the third stand-in for evil geniuses


---------70:15----------
2k


---------70:16----------
2k mmr boys


---------70:20----------
i just got to say i'm glad i was like


---------70:22----------
man i'm glad i streamed dota like a few


---------70:23----------
weeks ago because i actually played a


---------70:25----------
little bit of dota


---------70:34----------
probably lowest lowest mmr to ever


---------70:37----------
participate at ti


---------70:41----------
i mean i imagine there may have been


---------70:42----------
people there from other teams who had


---------70:44----------
lower mmr than i did but maybe not


---------70:46----------
maybe the pod was all because like some


---------70:48----------
people had like videographers and stuff


---------70:49----------
and it's possible they've never even


---------70:50----------
played a game


---------71:12----------
someone's asking me which champion would


---------71:14----------
i play are we talking about law


---------71:19----------
yeah i hear uh train is like close like


---------71:21----------
he's like homies with a lot of these


---------71:23----------
people


---------71:24----------
yeah so a lot of people are asking am i


---------71:26----------
going to do it again so i was meaning


---------71:28----------
earlier but you know the short answer is


---------71:29----------
i don't know um so i think one of the


---------71:31----------
things that does concern me a little bit


---------71:33----------
is that


---------71:35----------
you know i was there so


---------71:36----------
you know the yearly commitment wasn't


---------71:38----------
that bad in terms of


---------71:40----------
time but i do think it


---------71:42----------
i i sometimes think a little bit about


---------71:44----------
like what i'm here for


---------71:46----------
you know like what what is my purpose on


---------71:48----------
the earth


---------71:49----------
and as personally gratifying and as hype


---------71:52----------
as it is for me to


---------71:54----------
coach a team at ti for like mental stuff


---------71:57----------
and performance


---------71:58----------
i do wonder a little bit about what the


---------72:00----------
cost is to y'all


---------72:02----------
uh you know we started healthy gamer


---------72:04----------
ultimately to help y'all


---------72:06----------
and even though it's great for me


---------72:09----------
um and a lot of fun and very educational


---------72:13----------
you know we miss three weeks of streams


---------72:15----------
um i wonder you know sometimes we'll get


---------72:17----------
posts on on the subreddit


---------72:19----------
about you know people saying like oh


---------72:21----------
like healthy gamers helped me a lot one


---------72:23----------
of my favorite ones is dr k has ruined


---------72:24----------
my life


---------72:25----------
i don't know if you guys saw this post a


---------72:27----------
while back but some dude was like dr k


---------72:29----------
has ruined my life i used to wake up


---------72:30----------
every day and like play games all day


---------72:32----------
and then like go to bed angry and sad at


---------72:34----------
myself


---------72:35----------
and then now i wake up and i exercise


---------72:37----------
and i do yoga and i go for a run and i


---------72:39----------
like try to eat healthy and not every


---------72:41----------
everything isn't perfect yet but i'm


---------72:43----------
it's ruined my old life


---------72:45----------
and so i i think a little bit about you


---------72:47----------
know what


---------72:48----------
what did peop


---------72:50----------
what could i have done with that time


---------72:51----------
instead so i i did have an amazing


---------72:54----------
opportunity to try to help


---------72:56----------
six people in an organization


---------72:59----------
um


---------73:00----------
you know do the best that they possibly


---------73:02----------
could at an


---------73:03----------
event that's very important for their


---------73:05----------
lives


---------73:06----------
i don't i'm glad for the opportunity i'm


---------73:08----------
grateful


---------73:10----------
but i do sometimes wonder you know if i


---------73:12----------
because one of the pieces of feedback


---------73:14----------
that i got is that so i joined at the


---------73:16----------
end of the boot camp and some people


---------73:17----------
felt like


---------73:18----------
you know i should have come at the


---------73:19----------
beginning to really be very effective


---------73:22----------
and so where you know if the boot camp


---------73:24----------
so could i take five weeks off like i


---------73:27----------
don't know


---------73:28----------
right


---------73:29----------
i don't know


---------73:30----------
so that i i just worry a little bit


---------73:32----------
about that kind of stuff and really


---------73:34----------
what's my so i think what it comes down


---------73:35----------
to is dharma


---------73:37----------
what's my dharma in this case


---------73:39----------
is it to help eg


---------73:41----------
to try to win ti next year or is it to


---------73:43----------
help y'all


---------73:45----------
can i do both can you guys get help


---------73:47----------
elsewhere


---------73:48----------
which is part of the reason by the way


---------73:49----------
that we started the coaching program


---------73:50----------
because like you know


---------73:52----------
that way at least


---------73:54----------
hg stuff was ongoing people continued to


---------73:56----------
be so i i wouldn't have done i wouldn't


---------73:59----------
even have even done this


---------74:01----------
if we didn't have a coaching program


---------74:03----------
because i i sort of because at the end


---------74:04----------
of the day people are so the coaches are


---------74:05----------
still helping people right


---------74:18----------
uh but dr k doesn't your mental health


---------74:20----------
matter don't you get to need to live


---------74:22----------
your life we get help the other 49 weeks


---------74:24----------
of the year yeah so i do i mean i do


---------74:26----------
live my life right i'm not like


---------74:28----------
streaming and working


---------74:29----------
100 hours a week so i do take care of


---------74:32----------
myself the sentiment is really nice i


---------74:33----------
appreciate it but the other thing that i


---------74:35----------
i frankly have to say is that


---------74:37----------
in a sense not really so i do live my


---------74:39----------
life but i think that like i had my 20s


---------74:42----------
to dick around and play video games that


---------74:43----------
was in my mind my time to


---------74:47----------
you know for myself


---------74:49----------
and um


---------74:52----------
then i had the opportunity to like


---------74:54----------
train at a couple of amazing


---------74:56----------
institutions


---------74:57----------
and so i don't know i mean i think also


---------74:59----------
getting covert earlier this year


---------75:01----------
you know life is short you never know


---------75:03----------
how long you're going to be around


---------75:05----------
so


---------75:06----------
i kind of feel like now is my time to to


---------75:08----------
give back to the world because i've


---------75:10----------
gotten a lot from it


---------75:13----------
so i do sort of feel somewhat of a


---------75:16----------
crunch in terms of trying to do as much


---------75:19----------
as i can as quickly as i can because i


---------75:22----------
really don't know i mean who knows what


---------75:23----------
what's going to happen right there's so


---------75:24----------
much uncertainty in the world


---------75:26----------
and the other thing to think a little


---------75:28----------
bit about the other thing that kind of


---------75:29----------
bothers me is


---------75:31----------
the understanding that


---------75:35----------
you could say that okay like i have many


---------75:38----------
years to help people


---------75:39----------
but one of the things part of the reason


---------75:41----------
we started healthy gamers so i'll tell


---------75:43----------
you guys just a quick story so


---------75:45----------
when i was finishing up training i got a


---------75:47----------
couple of very good job offers


---------75:49----------
and awesome awesome people awesome


---------75:52----------
places to work


---------75:53----------
um and people who are very supportive


---------75:55----------
and they said you know like hey like if


---------75:57----------
you want to


---------75:58----------
be like the expert in video game


---------76:00----------
addiction like we'll help you we'll help


---------76:02----------
you start a rehab so like create like a


---------76:04----------
rehab center for video game addiction


---------76:06----------
where people can come and like you know


---------76:08----------
you can help people like your way like


---------76:09----------
we think the work that you're doing is


---------76:10----------
awesome we want to support you in doing


---------76:12----------
it and we'll make it happen


---------76:15----------
and but the the path to that was long so


---------76:18----------
it was sort of like a 10-year plan of


---------76:21----------
like doing research and really


---------76:22----------
understanding what was effective and


---------76:23----------
what isn't effective and then


---------76:25----------
you know scoping out a site and things


---------76:27----------
like that


---------76:30----------
and so part of the reason that i turned


---------76:32----------
that down is like what worried me is


---------76:34----------
that in the 10 years that it takes to


---------76:37----------
open the door to the rehab


---------76:39----------
what happens to like all of the people


---------76:43----------
like sure like once let's say it's


---------76:45----------
probably probably would have been 10


---------76:46----------
years let's say like five years or three


---------76:48----------
years or whatever so like let's say four


---------76:50----------
years from the start of that job offer


---------76:52----------
like we open the doors and we help like


---------76:54----------
30 people a month


---------76:57----------
what happens to all the people who need


---------76:59----------
help in the four years prior to opening


---------77:02----------
the doors


---------77:04----------
and so i think the tricky thing there is


---------77:06----------
that what concerns me about taking kind


---------77:08----------
of time off from a healthy gamer's work


---------77:09----------
is i i mean i imagine you all understand


---------77:12----------
this but like there are real


---------77:13----------
consequences


---------77:15----------
if i take a year off and pick this up


---------77:17----------
again like i see we see this a lot in


---------77:19----------
our coaching program


---------77:21----------
where you know people are like on


---------77:22----------
academic probation like they're the way


---------77:24----------
that


---------77:25----------
you know i remember hearing a case a


---------77:26----------
couple weeks ago where someone was like


---------77:29----------
um is on a visa from before like it's on


---------77:31----------
a student visa


---------77:33----------
and so if they fail like one more


---------77:35----------
semester like they're like their future


---------77:37----------
is closed off


---------77:39----------
like they get kicked out of school since


---------77:41----------
they're no longer in school


---------77:43----------
they don't get to stay in the country


---------77:44----------
that they're in and they have to like


---------77:46----------
move back home and they have like no job


---------77:47----------
prospects


---------77:48----------
their family has taken out a lot of


---------77:50----------
loans so that they can come to the us i


---------77:52----------
think it was the u.s


---------77:54----------
to study


---------77:56----------
and so what happens to those people so


---------77:59----------
they're real consequences to not doing


---------78:01----------
things quickly enough


---------78:03----------
um


---------78:04----------
you know it's tough


---------78:06----------
it's tough i mean people's lives are


---------78:08----------
being made or ruined


---------78:10----------
every week and so i think our first


---------78:13----------
commitment is to y'all


---------78:15----------
[Music]


---------78:17----------
it's tough


---------78:21----------
and so once again i don't know that we


---------78:23----------
can necessarily help that person i don't


---------78:24----------
know that we can guarantee that that


---------78:26----------
person is not gonna


---------78:28----------
you know do poorly on their tests and


---------78:30----------
stuff like who knows but we're here to


---------78:32----------
try to help


---------78:33----------
and our i think our first responsibility


---------78:36----------
our primary dharma is to y'all the


---------78:37----------
esports stuff is great i think there's


---------78:38----------
to be a lot of good stuff that comes out


---------78:40----------
of it for sure


---------78:41----------
i think like i said i learned a lot i


---------78:43----------
like pages and pages and pages of notes


---------78:45----------
and things like that


---------78:46----------
we'll probably uh put together some more


---------78:49----------
concrete lectures for y'all


---------78:52----------
in terms of like key takeaways from what


---------78:54----------
i learned you know you can say whatever


---------78:55----------
you want to about the ti performance but


---------78:57----------
at the end of the day eg is a top tier


---------79:00----------
esports organization


---------79:02----------
and just their just how they work is


---------79:04----------
like quite remarkable like they are just


---------79:06----------
amazing workers


---------79:08----------
you know they think a lot they plan a


---------79:10----------
lot they communicate a lot they practice


---------79:12----------
a lot


---------79:13----------
um


---------79:14----------
and so i think that there's a lot to be


---------79:16----------
learned and a lot that you can kind of


---------79:18----------
like apply from the way that they


---------79:19----------
approach dota to your own life
