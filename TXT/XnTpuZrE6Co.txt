- I said I'm good to be here I'm good


---------00:03----------
wait my cameras like flickering okay I'm


---------00:04----------
not gonna lie to you I'm like I'm


---------00:06----------
definitely really nervous okay but I'm


---------00:08----------
also excited at the same time because


---------00:10----------
I've really never spoken to like someone


---------00:13----------
who is qualified ever okay well so help


---------00:19----------
me understand what you're nervous about


---------00:21----------
well um I don't know man a lot of things


---------00:26----------
a lot of things um just more so like I


---------00:30----------
know like these type of situations will


---------00:33----------
definitely make me vulnerable all right


---------00:35----------
and it's like being vulnerable is a kind


---------00:37----------
of scary you know absolutely being


---------00:40----------
vulnerable is terrifying yeah sure and


---------00:43----------
when you say these kinds of situations


---------00:45----------
what what is that what help me


---------00:47----------
understand no just talking talking to


---------00:49----------
someone like truthfully rather than it


---------00:51----------
just being like some you know like like


---------00:53----------
most time I scream it's more of just


---------00:55----------
like it's a show you know it's like


---------00:56----------
we're just having fun constant whatever


---------00:58----------
but this is like a like a more real


---------01:00----------
setting if that makes sense even though


---------01:02----------
there is still chat spamming you know


---------01:04----------
Kappas and stuff so yeah I'd like to


---------01:06----------
swear as well right yeah I think so okay


---------01:09----------
like if you don't want me to lie if


---------01:11----------
you'll just asking you like like how you


---------01:14----------
want the setting to be you know am I


---------01:15----------
allowed to like be uh I'm very uh I like


---------01:19----------
to swear so I'm just I think if you want


---------01:21----------
a sweater that's okay man okay cool [ __ ]


---------01:24----------
alright we're good alright so um can you


---------01:27----------
you said you haven't talked to someone


---------01:29----------
who is like like you've never spoken to


---------01:32----------
a professional about your feelings is


---------01:34----------
that what you mean yeah I've never


---------01:35----------
really spoken to anyone man I've uh well


---------01:37----------
I've spoken like friends and stuff


---------01:39----------
obviously like I have friends that know


---------01:40----------
me pretty well but I definitely have


---------01:43----------
never spoken to a professional before


---------01:45----------
and there well that's not true one time


---------01:46----------
I did speak to or tried to speak to a


---------01:48----------
psychologist like two years ago but I


---------01:51----------
remember they were having a very hard


---------01:52----------
time relating to anything I was really


---------01:54----------
saying I was trying to like help them


---------01:55----------
understand like my life and like what's


---------01:58----------
like bothering me and like my job and


---------02:00----------
twitch ad and all this and like getting


---------02:02----------
you know getting backlash and hate and


---------02:03----------
all these things and they can't like


---------02:05----------
it's almost like when you get like a


---------02:06----------
Boomer therapist they just don't they


---------02:08----------
don't quite understand any of those like


---------02:09----------
dynamics right so they pretty much just


---------02:10----------
say hey yo take this pill you'll be good


---------02:12----------
you know so that's like is that what


---------02:14----------
this all just said uh well mostly


---------02:17----------
everyone I've gone to is tried to put me


---------02:18----------
on some plate but some type of like drug


---------02:20----------
yeah like whether it be a SSRIs


---------02:23----------
or for depression anxiety just like


---------02:25----------
random [ __ ] like you know whatever D are


---------02:28----------
you depressed or anxious well I've


---------02:31----------
definitely had my uh I definitely had my


---------02:33----------
run-ins with anxiety and depression


---------02:35----------
definitely a hundred percent I used to


---------02:37----------
be very very anxious but recently it's


---------02:40----------
been better it's definitely been better


---------02:41----------
recently okay


---------02:43----------
what's been better recently what's


---------02:44----------
what's changed well I don't know I moved


---------02:47----------
to Austin like eight months ago where's


---------02:50----------
my camera flickering for you is that


---------02:51----------
just my son it's it know what's good to


---------02:53----------
me man okay there's my son okay so I


---------02:56----------
moved to Austin eight months ago right I


---------02:57----------
was like doing this I did this whole


---------02:59----------
streamer house with a bunch of uh with a


---------03:01----------
bunch of streamers there's like a lot of


---------03:02----------
girls we had like a big mansion or


---------03:04----------
whatever and we were all streaming


---------03:05----------
everything was going good I don't know


---------03:07----------
it's like when I'm streaming and like


---------03:09----------
when I'm like like popping off on Twitch


---------03:11----------
it almost feels as though my problems


---------03:14----------
like it's like I'm distracting myself


---------03:16----------
from my own mind and I'm just like


---------03:18----------
grinding if that makes sense but then as


---------03:20----------
soon as I ditch and the cameras off and


---------03:22----------
I'm just Mitch and whatever David in the


---------03:24----------
mirror then I have to like truly see


---------03:26----------
myself for who I am and and it's like I


---------03:28----------
have a lot of baggage inside that just


---------03:29----------
like sits there you know and like sure I


---------03:31----------
I haven't really found a good way of


---------03:33----------
releasing those things even though I've


---------03:35----------
been looking for those looking for those


---------03:37----------
releases like for a long time now you


---------03:39----------
know I took like a year off - ish like


---------03:40----------
two years ago to just kind of try and


---------03:42----------
find myself and all I really found was a


---------03:44----------
bunch of pain and I was just like super


---------03:45----------
[ __ ] up and I kept trying all these


---------03:47----------
like weird diets like I well I was like


---------03:49----------
the skinniest like I I lost so much


---------03:51----------
weight and I was just trying all this


---------03:52----------
crazy [ __ ] to see how if I could like


---------03:54----------
fix my mind or whatever and it's just


---------03:57----------
like I don't know I feel like go ahead


---------03:59----------
sorry no I mean it sounds like you've


---------04:01----------
got a lot to say man keep going Oh trust


---------04:03----------
me man yeah there is a yes yeah there's


---------04:06----------
a lot to talk about how help me


---------04:08----------
understand so help me understand when


---------04:10----------
you when when the cameras often you look


---------04:13----------
in the mirror and you see this guy David


---------04:14----------
is your name that's you yeah yeah my


---------04:16----------
name is yeah yeah my birth name is David


---------04:18----------
yeah okay so when you see David tell me


---------04:20----------
tell me what you see in the mirror


---------04:22----------
uh well you know I just see a man who's


---------04:26----------
been literally like trying so hard to


---------04:30----------
just like play this like twitch like


---------04:33----------
weird circus game for like ten years you


---------04:35----------
know I've been doing this forever right


---------04:36----------
like I've been on Twitch before it was


---------04:38----------
like a YouTube cloud chasing reacting


---------04:41----------
[ __ ] hole that it is today you know I


---------04:43----------
feel like twitch like seven years ago


---------04:45----------
was actually just gamers chillin and it


---------04:48----------
was way different now than this like


---------04:49----------
cloud chasing boomer or whatever Zoomer


---------04:51----------
[ __ ] platform that it's become and


---------04:53----------
not only that not only the Zoomers


---------04:55----------
infiltrating it's also gotten a lot more


---------04:56----------
strict right since Amazon and all that


---------04:58----------
bought it out blah blah blah like you


---------05:00----------
know it was kind of like the Wild West


---------05:01----------
back in the day you could just like do


---------05:02----------
your thing and like that was it you know


---------05:04----------
and it's just it's changed a lot so um


---------05:07----------
tell me what you see when you look in


---------05:08----------
the mirror when I look in the mirror I


---------05:11----------
see a broken human being that has been


---------05:13----------
living up or Sona for 10 years and like


---------05:17----------
I've always been real and tried to be


---------05:19----------
real with my viewers but that also like


---------05:21----------
I I think opens me up to a lot of


---------05:22----------
scrutiny and truthfully like I think


---------05:25----------
that I'm very [ __ ] broken of a human


---------05:27----------
but I like I I don't really like to show


---------05:30----------
well I do show that part of me but


---------05:31----------
nobody really wants to listen to that


---------05:32----------
right like nobody wants to go like


---------05:35----------
listen to somebody bitching about their


---------05:37----------
broken self you know whatever what about


---------05:40----------
you is broken


---------05:42----------
pretty much everything my identity like


---------05:45----------
I've everything I've done has been a


---------05:47----------
[ __ ] lie man like that's how I view


---------05:48----------
it anyway right like like cool I was


---------05:51----------
famous I was making hella money like


---------05:53----------
whatever right like I had some hot girls


---------05:54----------
like I did all the things you would


---------05:55----------
think would make you feel like like


---------05:57----------
complete or whatever the [ __ ] but truly


---------05:59----------
I felt so dead inside and like I still


---------06:02----------
like um I don't know like I just still


---------06:05----------
feel that way but I know that like I


---------06:07----------
can't really let that person win like I


---------06:09----------
kind of just have to keep going on with


---------06:11----------
the circus you know wait hold on but how


---------06:14----------
is that strategy working for you so far


---------06:16----------
you know I I really don't I really don't


---------06:19----------
know I really don't know man satisfy


---------06:22----------
honestly don't sounds like grinding is


---------06:24----------
not working for you but like I have no


---------06:27----------
other option you know like if I don't


---------06:28----------
make twitch work like I'm truly screwed


---------06:30----------
so


---------06:32----------
yeah man so so I don't think that I


---------06:35----------
don't think you have to quit twitch I'm


---------06:36----------
just saying that it sounds like you're


---------06:37----------
not taking care of yourself so it sounds


---------06:40----------
like like you're thinking in terms of


---------06:41----------
black and white like either you you quit


---------06:43----------
twitch and then that means that like


---------06:45----------
this the other part of you wins or you


---------06:49----------
keep doing what you're doing like it


---------06:50----------
seems like very like black and white to


---------06:51----------
me yeah that's kind of I'm let's just


---------06:54----------
tell I am I'm kind of like all or


---------06:55----------
nothing you know


---------06:56----------
yeah it's always been no way but what do


---------06:58----------
you think about that I don't know I


---------07:01----------
think that that's just like hardwired in


---------07:03----------
me like I'm either in or I'm out you


---------07:05----------
know like I can't do this like like what


---------07:08----------
do you call it when you like good at


---------07:09----------
everything uh like you're good at


---------07:11----------
balance I'm terrible at that like like


---------07:13----------
I'm pretty much just like in one thing


---------07:15----------
and that's all I think about and I just


---------07:16----------
grind that forever or I'm out and I'm


---------07:18----------
doing something else right like


---------07:19----------
balancing I suck at like keeping a


---------07:21----------
schedule maintaining like if you suck at


---------07:24----------
something what is that what does that


---------07:26----------
mean for you like does that is you're


---------07:28----------
just you are this way you're hardwired


---------07:31----------
it's it's not possible to change or is


---------07:34----------
it like help me understand well it could


---------07:36----------
be possible to change I've I've


---------07:38----------
definitely tried I swear it sounds like


---------07:41----------
you've tried a lot oh I've tried so hard


---------07:43----------
so [ __ ] hard man like that I swear I


---------07:45----------
see them wrong with me I have like an


---------07:47----------
action deficit disorder where like I


---------07:49----------
cannot act on the things that I


---------07:51----------
understand because like a lot of people


---------07:53----------
think that I'm just like stupid but like


---------07:55----------
I kind of understand most social


---------07:58----------
dynamics and like like the things I need


---------08:00----------
to do I understand them it just it's


---------08:02----------
very hard for me to act on those things


---------08:04----------
and like I don't know no matter how hard


---------08:07----------
I want to do it I just have trouble


---------08:10----------
doing it you know and I'm so messed up


---------08:12----------
over it's so hard so okay buddy now


---------08:15----------
we're getting somewhere okay so if you


---------08:18----------
want to do something and you're unable


---------08:20----------
to do it how the [ __ ] does that work I I


---------08:24----------
don't know you tell me I have no idea


---------08:26----------
like what do you think man like so if I


---------08:28----------
have an intention if I'm a human being


---------08:30----------
and I have an intention what are the


---------08:33----------
things that influence my behavior right


---------08:37----------
so if I want to do something like let's


---------08:38----------
say I want to get out of bed in the


---------08:39----------
morning what are the things that


---------08:41----------
influence whether I get out of bed


---------08:43----------
because what happens is sometimes it


---------08:45----------
sounds like you


---------08:46----------
your behaviors are not aligned with your


---------08:48----------
intentions that is very true yes and


---------08:51----------
recently I've tried to like I have this


---------08:54----------
thing where like one day I'll wake up


---------08:55----------
and I'm like all right I'm gonna fix it


---------08:57----------
all right and then I'll like go hard for


---------08:58----------
a month and I'll really like be normal


---------09:00----------
like I'll be really making progress


---------09:02----------
toward my life for like one month and


---------09:04----------
then something happens and I'm just I'm


---------09:06----------
just off and it's all progress that is


---------09:09----------
that is a terrible strategy my friend so


---------09:12----------
let me because I think what you're doing


---------09:13----------
is so I think you're using you're just


---------09:15----------
using vast reserves of willpower to


---------09:18----------
overcome things within you and then you


---------09:20----------
just run out of steam oh yeah no the


---------09:23----------
burnout is real 100 percent yeah yeah so


---------09:25----------
like you burnout is not a sustainable


---------09:27----------
way to change your life right like like


---------09:30----------
a you're overcoming stuff in order to


---------09:33----------
try to is you I mean you're using a lot


---------09:34----------
of this like language like grind right


---------09:37----------
like so we're grinding to me is this


---------09:39----------
like streaming every day and trying to


---------09:41----------
like you know be trying good you know


---------09:43----------
yeah yeah so you just you just you just


---------09:46----------
use like vast amounts of just willpower


---------09:48----------
and raw energy to overcome whatever kind


---------09:51----------
of like tornado of [ __ ] is going on


---------09:54----------
inside you oh yeah yeah I like to just


---------09:57----------
push all that away and just focus on the


---------09:59----------
goal you know yeah so I don't think that


---------10:02----------
that's like I think that strategy can be


---------10:05----------
very successful but I think it's gonna


---------10:08----------
leave you tortured and broken well I've


---------10:11----------
been that way my whole life so I really


---------10:12----------
don't know what it's like to be whole


---------10:14----------
and not broken like yeah truthfully like


---------10:16----------
I'm not saying that to like you know


---------10:18----------
boohoo me but like I have had a weird a


---------10:21----------
weird life like I've had a great life


---------10:23----------
but also we're coming at your life uh


---------10:26----------
where do you want me to start I don't


---------10:29----------
know


---------10:29----------
well there's a lot there there's truly a


---------10:33----------
lot like like there's a lot of things


---------10:35----------
that we could talk about man like I


---------10:36----------
don't know if you know the history of


---------10:37----------
like twitch tell me about like about me


---------10:42----------
and my twitch stuff or like me just me


---------10:44----------
just tell me about you you okay well I'm


---------10:47----------
a dude I was born in Baltimore Maryland


---------10:50----------
okay um yeah I'm 27 years old now so I'm


---------10:55----------
you know again till the late bloomer


---------10:56----------
stages


---------10:57----------
um I went to I have like a weird family


---------11:03----------
situation very strange family situation


---------11:05----------
my uh my mother was diagnosed with brain


---------11:08----------
cancer when I was like 16 and she had


---------11:11----------
like a stroke and multiple surgeries and


---------11:13----------
she's like paralyzed on her left side


---------11:14----------
and you know she it's done it's oh it's


---------11:18----------
it's been the worst thing ever because


---------11:20----------
my mom was truly like the one person


---------11:22----------
that I actually loved me for like Who I


---------11:24----------
am you know what I mean like I truly


---------11:26----------
loved my mom unconditionally and I


---------11:28----------
pretty much lost her like eight years


---------11:30----------
ago like lost her mentally she's still


---------11:32----------
she's still doing great and fighting


---------11:34----------
cancer but she lost a huge piece of


---------11:36----------
herself because they had to remove like


---------11:38----------
I think I think it was like 20% of her


---------11:40----------
frontal cortex to keep her alive so she


---------11:42----------
lost like a lot of her personality and


---------11:44----------
uh you know what I mean like it yeah


---------11:46----------
it's almost like an Alzheimer's thing


---------11:48----------
like don't remember and she's just not


---------11:49----------
she's not all there at all there yeah


---------11:53----------
all there anymore yeah and I've had to


---------11:54----------
watch her to terior it over the last


---------11:56----------
like eight years or so and I someone oh


---------11:58----------
it's killed me honestly because I've had


---------12:01----------
nowhere to turn like my father has


---------12:03----------
always been kind of like a hard-ass like


---------12:05----------
my dad's like a very successful like


---------12:07----------
lawyer businessman whatever like he's


---------12:10----------
just been that kind of guy like I he


---------12:11----------
sent me to private school my whole life


---------12:12----------
like I've been spoiled in that regard


---------12:14----------
like money and whatever like I come from


---------12:16----------
a pretty wealthy family but my dad never


---------12:19----------
gave me like uh like the like he never


---------12:23----------
filled the shoes of my mom if that makes


---------12:24----------
sense


---------12:24----------
sure of course yeah he never did and I


---------12:27----------
never felt like me and my dad have never


---------12:29----------
like hug or so I love you or any that


---------12:31----------
like there's none of that like I don't


---------12:32----------
feel like I had that relationship with


---------12:34----------
my father


---------12:34----------
I don't feel like I've ever had that


---------12:36----------
relationship with my father and there's


---------12:38----------
actually some really deep things I could


---------12:40----------
get into you about about like like


---------12:42----------
there's a lot of [ __ ] up things I've


---------12:43----------
gone on in my family but honestly I


---------12:45----------
don't want to like err that on the


---------12:46----------
internet if you want to join talk like


---------12:48----------
privately about that that's [ __ ] let's


---------12:49----------
talk about whatever you're comfortable


---------12:50----------
with me yeah yeah no I mean I'm normally


---------12:53----------
comfortable with telling uh I'm not


---------12:55----------
comfortable with like talking openly I


---------12:57----------
just don't want to like say something


---------12:59----------
you know I mean sure yeah so that that's


---------13:01----------
pretty much my family situation I have a


---------13:02----------
brother as well I have a brother yeah I


---------13:04----------
do brother


---------13:05----------
yeah he he was uh he has Asperger's


---------13:08----------
syndrome he's like pretty autistic and


---------13:11----------
he was also born with a face deformation


---------13:16----------
like he his jaw never grew properly so


---------13:19----------
it grew like very crooked and he used to


---------13:22----------
get like made fun of in school and like


---------13:23----------
older younger he's an older brother


---------13:26----------
older brother


---------13:27----------
yeah and he's he's very different very


---------13:29----------
different you know like you've met


---------13:31----------
people with autism right like they're


---------13:32----------
they have very troubled like a lot of


---------13:34----------
trouble socially and my brother's very


---------13:37----------
smart honestly he's very good at art he


---------13:39----------
used to kick my ass and halo back in the


---------13:41----------
day like like straight he was just


---------13:43----------
amazing at everything he did like and it


---------13:45----------
just sucks the heat when my mom got sick


---------13:47----------
he never really got that support anymore


---------13:49----------
and he kind of went down the deep end


---------13:51----------
and he now lives him like assisted


---------13:53----------
living and and I feel really bad for him


---------13:54----------
man like I really do I feel really bad


---------13:57----------
for him


---------13:57----------
the last time I saw him I think he's


---------13:59----------
doing okay but let's just say if I had


---------14:01----------
ever if I was actually good enough to


---------14:04----------
get my [ __ ] together and I didn't really


---------14:05----------
lose everything that I that I had going


---------14:07----------
for me I probably would have like you


---------14:09----------
know taking care of him and maybe my mom


---------14:11----------
as well which is a lot of burden for me


---------14:13----------
but I felt like that was the right play


---------14:15----------
and I truly regret that I [ __ ] up this


---------14:17----------
whole twitch thing because I really


---------14:19----------
could have been in a position to help my


---------14:20----------
family and I feel like I let that I just


---------14:23----------
[ __ ] up man for my own selfish reasons


---------14:25----------
cuz I wanted to you know whatever [ __ ]


---------14:27----------
around and be an idiot you know no I


---------14:29----------
don't what does that mean it means that


---------14:32----------
I got so carried away in this [ __ ] when


---------14:37----------
I could have just looked at it as a


---------14:38----------
means to help my family instead I looked


---------14:41----------
at it as a means to feed my own ego and


---------14:43----------
you know date hot girls and whatever


---------14:46----------
spend a lot of money on [ __ ] I don't


---------14:48----------
need and you know what I mean like that


---------14:49----------
kind of stuff like meet a bunch of fake


---------14:51----------
friends that tell me I'm through and


---------14:52----------
really they they don't give a [ __ ] and I


---------14:54----------
just you know whatever they wanted was


---------14:56----------
just not so you you myself for that Oh


---------14:59----------
hundred percent I blame myself for that


---------15:00----------
I'm stupid it's not that I'm even stupid


---------15:02----------
it's that I was being selfish and I


---------15:04----------
always knew the right play and it's just


---------15:08----------
it's it's easier said than done you know


---------15:10----------
yeah so so help me understand that I'm a


---------15:13----------
little bit confused if it's easier said


---------15:14----------
than done then why so much blame


---------15:18----------
because I could have done it man you


---------15:21----------
know why do you think that why do I


---------15:24----------
think I could have done it yeah


---------15:26----------
because I could I do what III know I


---------15:29----------
could have I could have actually switch


---------15:32----------
a positive thing for me and helped my


---------15:34----------
family and you know been a support I


---------15:37----------
could have done but how do why do you


---------15:40----------
think that I just think I could have


---------15:43----------
done it how do I understand I understand


---------15:46----------
you think you could have done it that


---------15:47----------
much is clear to me what I'm


---------15:49----------
understanding is where did you get the


---------15:50----------
idea that you could have done that I


---------15:53----------
don't know I guess when I thought about


---------15:56----------
it long enough I realized I was chasing


---------15:59----------
the wrong things and maybe I couldn't


---------16:03----------
have done it yeah or maybe right maybe


---------16:04----------
maybe I needed to go through the [ __ ]


---------16:06----------
that I went through or something yeah I


---------16:08----------
mean this I was just about to say cuz it


---------16:10----------
sounds like you know you spent some time


---------16:12----------
reflecting and thinking about the


---------16:14----------
choices yeah yeah yeah like I said sure


---------16:16----------
go but you're doing I learned a lot a


---------16:20----------
year ago I like I said I stopped I


---------16:22----------
stopped streaming and I actually moved


---------16:23----------
in with my mom for a while and I was


---------16:25----------
just like they are taking care of her


---------16:26----------
and I was living a very slow life for a


---------16:28----------
while like I pretty much took a step


---------16:30----------
back from all of twitch all of that for


---------16:31----------
a long time and I was like doing like I


---------16:34----------
was meditating every day I was trying


---------16:35----------
all these new diets I was doing whatever


---------16:37----------
I could to fix my broken self like


---------16:38----------
straight up I was trying everything you


---------16:40----------
name it I was on the internet constant


---------16:42----------
like self-improvement blah blah blah


---------16:44----------
like meditation exercise sleep schedule


---------16:46----------
this that eat these vegetables you'll be


---------16:48----------
good eat this [ __ ] multivitamin


---------16:50----------
you'll be good right and I just realized


---------16:53----------
that like there's so much deep down pain


---------16:55----------
inside of myself that to get to that


---------16:57----------
sense of like enlightenment and feeling


---------16:59----------
light and free it's gonna take years and


---------17:01----------
years and years of work in my opinion


---------17:03----------
which I really don't have right now


---------17:04----------
because quite frankly like I put myself


---------17:07----------
in a position where I am pretty much


---------17:10----------
screwed unless I continue to grind like


---------17:12----------
you know I recently it's gonna take


---------17:14----------
years and years and years for you to be


---------17:16----------
so you can be fixed let's start but I


---------17:18----------
can be fixed but what I would need it is


---------17:20----------
a stress-free environment where I can


---------17:22----------
actually work on myself right


---------17:24----------
I that's one way to do it but I think


---------17:26----------
that too is once again your black and


---------17:28----------
white thinking right so you think that


---------17:30----------
that fixing yourself is a full-time job


---------17:32----------
that you can't do anything else during


---------17:34----------
either you're grinding or you're fixing


---------17:36----------
yourself yeah well yeah that's true I


---------17:41----------
think that I I wish I could balance


---------17:45----------
things man I really do yeah so if some


---------17:48----------
like someone doesn't know how to balance


---------17:49----------
things what do we do for them like so


---------17:52----------
let's say that I'm time working with a


---------17:53----------
15 year old kid who has trouble


---------17:55----------
balancing playing games and and like


---------17:57----------
study mm-hmm tell him to stop playing


---------18:00----------
games right do you think that works well


---------18:04----------
I mean if they're not gonna be the next


---------18:05----------
ninja they should probably quit anyway


---------18:06----------
right yeah I mean do you think that


---------18:09----------
that's that's do you think that's an


---------18:10----------
effective way to teach I mean I've I


---------18:14----------
would tell my kid like if they're going


---------18:16----------
to like try to be as good as they


---------18:19----------
possibly can be at the game and make a


---------18:20----------
career out of it [ __ ] it keep playing


---------18:22----------
but if you're just playing to like jerk


---------18:23----------
off then like stop like that's how


---------18:25----------
that's that's how I would make it I


---------18:27----------
completely I completely are that makes a


---------18:30----------
lot of sense to me because that is


---------18:31----------
exactly the way that you approach life


---------18:32----------
right so it's like black and white it's


---------18:34----------
either/or it's like either you be the


---------18:37----------
next ninja or you [ __ ] stop


---------18:39----------
there's no middle red well not even the


---------18:41----------
next ninja I mean [ __ ] you could even be


---------18:43----------
cool with my son being a shroud you know


---------18:45----------
like I mean anything


---------18:46----------
I'm just I'm just messing around but


---------18:49----------
yeah yeah like I think black and white


---------18:51----------
like that yeah like I wouldn't it's just


---------18:53----------
it's like if you're not gonna make


---------18:55----------
something of it why waste your time


---------18:56----------
doing it like you know yeah I mean I


---------19:00----------
think that's a good question


---------19:01----------
why do something if you're not going to


---------19:03----------
be the best


---------19:05----------
yeah and a lot of people do know I'm


---------19:07----------
actually asking you well I don't know


---------19:10----------
the thing is like why do something if


---------19:12----------
you don't want to be I guess for fun


---------19:13----------
right sure


---------19:15----------
yeah it's enjoyable I'm not saying


---------19:17----------
everything has to be I'm just saying


---------19:18----------
people should have their like main focus


---------19:21----------
and they should really focus on that and


---------19:23----------
that should be what they love doing


---------19:24----------
right so like if you love video games I


---------19:27----------
truly think that you should strive to be


---------19:29----------
the best at what you love and try and


---------19:32----------
make something out of it so you don't


---------19:34----------
have to do the other shady things in


---------19:36----------
life and you can actually work on your


---------19:37----------
passion and some someday that might


---------19:39----------
actually make you you know you can make


---------19:41----------
a career out of it right like that's I


---------19:42----------
think it's a good plan like doing what


---------19:44----------
you love


---------19:45----------
shouldn't trying to make a career out of


---------19:46----------
it that's why I would tell my son like


---------19:47----------
if you wants to play games then play but


---------19:51----------
be better than everyone else


---------19:52----------
you know okay so I'm a little bit


---------19:54----------
confused like does so if I if I have you


---------19:57----------
know so I am careful about how my kids


---------20:01----------
spend time in front of the screen and so


---------20:04----------
when I try to teach them as some degree


---------20:06----------
of restraint so I don't tell them that


---------20:08----------
they have to you know I tell them that


---------20:09----------
you have to do the things that you have


---------20:11----------
to do and then you can also spend some


---------20:13----------
time doing fun stuff but that is not


---------20:16----------
like an either/or that you can actually


---------20:17----------
do both what do you think about that


---------20:19----------
like what if what if like your 15 year


---------20:21----------
old comes home and then studies for a


---------20:23----------
couple of hours and does their homework


---------20:24----------
and between 6 & 8 p.m. they get to like


---------20:27----------
play whatever they want to and then


---------20:28----------
after bad if they've been a good kid


---------20:30----------
they get to play for a couple more hours


---------20:31----------
what do you think about that I mean if


---------20:36----------
they're 15 they're growing out there


---------20:37----------
they're living life there they're


---------20:39----------
playing with their friends I think


---------20:39----------
that's fine right but like you know I


---------20:42----------
think as people get older they need to


---------20:44----------
really Zone in on what they want to do


---------20:46----------
you know like rather than like [ __ ]


---------20:49----------
around and like doing things for fun I


---------20:51----------
feel like that kind of ends at some


---------20:53----------
point it definitely did for me you know


---------20:55----------
like I used to skateboard and like do


---------20:57----------
all these things for fun or whatever but


---------20:59----------
I knew that they weren't leading


---------21:00----------
anywhere right like like I used to play


---------21:02----------
[ __ ] League for fun and I would play


---------21:03----------
in silver [ __ ] too and it's just like


---------21:06----------
it was never gonna get me anywhere I'm


---------21:07----------
never gonna be an LCS League player


---------21:09----------
nobody's ever gonna watch my stream when


---------21:11----------
I play league right sorry why the


---------21:13----------
[ __ ] my time why do you have to be


---------21:15----------
somewhere why do you have to be


---------21:16----------
somewhere


---------21:18----------
so like no because like for some reason


---------21:21----------
it's something deep inside of me just


---------21:22----------
like urns for this like acceptance and


---------21:24----------
like it like tits is just doing


---------21:26----------
something and like making something of


---------21:28----------
myself right like I don't know something


---------21:30----------
deep inside me feels as though I've


---------21:31----------
failed and like I have to do something


---------21:33----------
more you know yeah so let's just pause


---------21:36----------
for a second now we're getting somewhere


---------21:38----------
right so understand that a lot of your


---------21:42----------
worldview is being informed by this


---------21:44----------
thing doesn't mean it's [ __ ] logical


---------21:47----------
doesn't mean it's rational you have a


---------21:50----------
sense that you need to accomplish


---------21:52----------
something and the older you get the


---------21:55----------
greater that sense grows the more behind


---------21:58----------
you feel the more you need to make up


---------22:00----------
for lost time hmm right the more the


---------22:04----------
less time you have to take care of


---------22:05----------
yourself and the harder you need to


---------22:07----------
grind because something within you says


---------22:09----------
that mitch is not good enough yeah


---------22:12----------
something whoever me says that inside of


---------22:14----------
myself have you ever been able to


---------22:16----------
satisfy it no well actually for like


---------22:20----------
maybe like one or two weeks at a time


---------22:21----------
like let's say I have some crazy stream


---------22:23----------
by like 20,000 viewers and made a lot of


---------22:25----------
money or whatever I feel like if I could


---------22:27----------
kept that keep that going and like I


---------22:30----------
could like make a living for myself and


---------22:32----------
it's Mitch pause for a second okay I I


---------22:35----------
know what you're gonna say so just think


---------22:38----------
about this okay so you have something


---------22:40----------
within you that even if you knock it out


---------22:42----------
of the park for a week or two and you


---------22:44----------
make a ton of money and everyone really


---------22:46----------
loves it that just sets a whole new bar


---------22:48----------
you can't be satisfied with it you you


---------22:51----------
feel satisfied for like one week and


---------22:53----------
then the hunger returns yeah yeah I


---------22:57----------
guess that's true so what do you think


---------22:59----------
about living a life that is structured


---------23:02----------
around this hunger inside you that


---------23:04----------
you've told me has never really been


---------23:06----------
satisfied like it will be satisfied


---------23:09----------
temporarily but then it all goes back to


---------23:11----------
the same [ __ ] and I truly sink I truly


---------23:15----------
think that the reason it's not satisfied


---------23:16----------
is not because I never got like where I


---------23:18----------
wanted to get it's cuz I never continued


---------23:21----------
like it's almost like this right like I


---------23:24----------
would get to where I want to be and then


---------23:26----------
I would quit and I would get to where I


---------23:27----------
want to be and I quit and then I get to


---------23:29----------
where I want to be in the neck Y never


---------23:30----------
consistently


---------23:32----------
they're like I've had so many


---------23:33----------
opportunities had I have just stayed


---------23:34----------
consistent to be you know one of the


---------23:37----------
biggest streamers on the platform like


---------23:39----------
years ago you know like in 2014 and [ __ ]


---------23:41----------
and I would just like take it for


---------23:42----------
granted and I would just play league


---------23:44----------
with my with my stoner friend all day


---------23:46----------
and I would just say well like [ __ ] it


---------23:48----------
like I've already I don't know like I


---------23:49----------
just never had the willpower to stay


---------23:51----------
consistent you know yeah that's because


---------23:53----------
mothers no willpower is not how people


---------23:55----------
are consistent willpower is not how


---------23:57----------
people are consistent so I think you're


---------23:59----------
adopting a losing strategy because yeah


---------24:01----------
you so I want you to try to do something


---------24:04----------
Mitch this is gonna be hard okay I want


---------24:06----------
you to try to I want you to try to look


---------24:09----------
at your thoughts the way that I see them


---------24:11----------
so you have you have a really good


---------24:15----------
reason to believe all the things that


---------24:17----------
you want to that you believe they're


---------24:19----------
very logical but I want you to try to


---------24:20----------
look at them from the outside mm-hmm


---------24:23----------
okay so I am hearing that you have


---------24:26----------
something within you that feels like


---------24:27----------
you're not good enough and that is what


---------24:30----------
really motivates you to success it


---------24:32----------
motivates you to grind right yes but can


---------24:35----------
I can i elaborate a bit yeah sure I


---------24:37----------
think that why I don't feel good enough


---------24:39----------
is because I've let so many


---------24:41----------
opportunities go you know what I mean


---------24:43----------
it's the fact that I could be somewhere


---------24:45----------
if I just wasn't so goddamn stupid


---------24:48----------
that's what bothers me the most it's not


---------24:51----------
that I you know it's not that I'm like


---------24:53----------
oh I need to be successful it's that I


---------24:54----------
had the opportunity and I [ __ ] it up


---------24:57----------
ten times in a row it bothers me so much


---------25:00----------
that's what so why do people [ __ ] up


---------25:03----------
good things I don't know why did I [ __ ]


---------25:07----------
it up cuz I thought it would be there


---------25:08----------
forever I thought I was good you know I


---------25:10----------
thought I thought I thought I would see


---------25:12----------
it what do you think about someone who


---------25:13----------
blames themself for something that they


---------25:15----------
don't understand


---------25:19----------
they're lost sure do you think they're


---------25:23----------
deserving of blame if they don't


---------25:24----------
understand what the [ __ ] is going on


---------25:27----------
yeah really yeah because I think


---------25:32----------
everyone can it depends on the situation


---------25:34----------
obviously but I think you can get to a


---------25:38----------
place where you understand right like


---------25:39----------
just saying I don't understand is like


---------25:41----------
almost playing like dumb right sure but


---------25:43----------
do you understand at this point I do


---------25:46----------
understand the mistakes I made in the


---------25:48----------
past yeah I do I don't think you do I


---------25:50----------
don't understand yourself at all because


---------25:52----------
you're telling me that you have


---------25:53----------
opportunity after opportunity after


---------25:55----------
opportunity and you you squander it and


---------25:58----------
squander it and squander it yes and you


---------26:01----------
don't seem like a stupid person to me so


---------26:03----------
I think that there's there are large


---------26:06----------
tectonic forces within you that caused


---------26:09----------
you to do things that you beat yourself


---------26:11----------
up for but you don't understand why the


---------26:13----------
[ __ ] you how you work like it's like


---------26:16----------
I've always noticed that I've always had


---------26:18----------
the that's true you blame yourself for


---------26:21----------
not understanding it's like it's like


---------26:22----------
you're you know you don't understand why


---------26:26----------
this why David isn't functioning


---------26:29----------
properly but sure as hell will blame


---------26:31----------
yourself for it


---------26:32----------
even though you don't understand so it's


---------26:34----------
like like I I mean what if you like but


---------26:36----------
that's dumb I don't think you can blame


---------26:37----------
yourself like you can blame yourself if


---------26:39----------
you understand what's actually happening


---------26:41----------
mm-hmm I think it's dumb to blame


---------26:45----------
yourself if you don't understand you


---------26:47----------
know it's like if this is gonna sound


---------26:49----------
kind of completely crazy but you know


---------26:50----------
like so kids blame themselves for stupid


---------26:53----------
[ __ ] all the time and it's not their


---------26:55----------
fault like they'll blame themselves for


---------26:56----------
like really crazy things like their


---------26:57----------
parents getting cancer somehow kids will


---------27:00----------
like they don't understand how things


---------27:01----------
work but that doesn't stop them from


---------27:03----------
blaming themselves does that make sense


---------27:04----------
to you that makes perfect sense yeah see


---------27:07----------
that was an analogy I understood I got


---------27:08----------
yeah that makes perfect sense


---------27:10----------
I don't know I don't know how I can


---------27:11----------
relate that to myself like I'm not you


---------27:13----------
know I can relate it as a tad to myself


---------27:16----------
but I truly think that my problems were


---------27:18----------
created by me not by cancer or something


---------27:21----------
out of my control


---------27:21----------
you know yeah so if you can control them


---------27:24----------
why aren't you


---------27:25----------
well I'm working on taking steps to


---------27:27----------
doing that I think I think I wasn't self


---------27:29----------
liar why don't you give yourself any


---------27:31----------
slack for that that's what I don't


---------27:33----------
understand like I see I don't know I


---------27:37----------
just don't


---------27:38----------
so that just don't change my friend and


---------27:40----------
also it doesn't help that twitchchat it


---------27:42----------
reminds me every [ __ ] day you know


---------27:44----------
what I mean like they twitch a is very


---------27:47----------
you know they are I mean they're very


---------27:48----------
like whatever and they're gonna remind


---------27:50----------
me of all my fuck-ups so like I have to


---------27:52----------
be aware of them I have to like soak in


---------27:55----------
I don't think I don't think you


---------27:56----------
understand what your fuck-ups really are


---------27:58----------
because I I think all you I just tell


---------28:00----------
you all of them trust no no no what's


---------28:02----------
the etiquette - I'm sure that you can


---------28:04----------
point to lots of things externally about


---------28:06----------
your life that you think you made


---------28:08----------
mistakes about but I don't think you're


---------28:10----------
appreciating that what that a human


---------28:13----------
being has all kinds of forces within


---------28:15----------
them that cause them to do things that


---------28:17----------
they don't understand


---------28:18----------
like when I see someone who screws up


---------28:20----------
time and time and time again I don't


---------28:23----------
think that the person is deficient


---------28:25----------
because generally speaking I think most


---------28:26----------
human beings are like not just Domon


---------28:28----------
crappy at life I think that there are


---------28:31----------
real psychological spiritual whatever


---------28:34----------
you want to call it there are forces


---------28:35----------
within you that shape your behavior


---------28:37----------
which most people are ignorant to I


---------28:39----------
agree with that 100% it's almost like


---------28:42----------
there's like two people or something


---------28:43----------
right there's like you and there's the


---------28:44----------
there's that like dry that like makes


---------28:47----------
you you know whatever yes so so I think


---------28:49----------
you're trying to live life like you're


---------28:51----------
trying to drive a car but you're blind


---------28:54----------
you're like driving blind and you're


---------28:56----------
like how do they how do I see perfect


---------28:59----------
that's the question oh I would like to


---------29:02----------
see so it starts with this okay okay


---------29:06----------
yeah so when you sets yours so actually


---------29:09----------
let me just think for a second how can I


---------29:11----------
just answer it for you let's start with


---------29:13----------
this


---------29:14----------
how long have you felt like you're a


---------29:15----------
failure um ever since probably like 2016


---------29:23----------
that's when I got really bad that's when


---------29:25----------
it got really bad tell me when it


---------29:27----------
started


---------29:30----------
it started around that time honestly


---------29:32----------
before all of that [ __ ] I really didn't


---------29:35----------
even think about life the way I think


---------29:37----------
about it now like how did you think I


---------29:39----------
used to I used to just like wake up play


---------29:42----------
World of Warcraft she don't ever run and


---------29:44----------
go to bed and I was completely content


---------29:47----------
with that life I loved every second of


---------29:49----------
it and I truly didn't think the way I


---------29:51----------
think now I really didn't have any I


---------29:53----------
didn't think I was a failure if I lost


---------29:54----------
the game I would just be like okay I'm


---------29:56----------
gonna [ __ ] on them tomorrow whatever you


---------29:58----------
know like I never had that attitude of


---------29:59----------
like I [ __ ] up everything you know


---------30:02----------
that only really really started after


---------30:04----------
like twitch how old are you playing


---------30:06----------
World of Warcraft like that well I


---------30:09----------
played from like 18 to like 23 I'd say


---------30:11----------
like pretty religiously and that's also


---------30:13----------
how I became straight like a streamer on


---------30:15----------
Twitch ones tell me a little bit about


---------30:17----------
what middle school was like for you all


---------30:18----------
middle school was amazing man I


---------30:20----------
literally love middle school everyone Oh


---------30:23----------
middle school is [ __ ] great dude I


---------30:25----------
have so many stories I probably can't


---------30:27----------
say here but yeah like let's just say I


---------30:29----------
was pretty cool in middle school and I


---------30:32----------
had a very good social life I wasn't the


---------30:35----------
best in school but like I just started


---------30:37----------
you know experimenting with like women


---------30:39----------
you know my penis started working etc


---------30:40----------
and like it was it was nice okay so you


---------30:43----------
you had fun and you didn't think you


---------30:45----------
were a failure and you felt good about


---------30:46----------
yourself yes yes yes I I felt great


---------30:50----------
about myself in middle school but this


---------30:51----------
was also when my mom was still good you


---------30:52----------
know yeah so tell me about your school


---------30:55----------
high school was uh okay so my my


---------30:59----------
freshman year I was kind of like


---------31:01----------
transitioning I actually went to an all


---------31:03----------
guys high school I had to it was like a


---------31:06----------
private school I had to wear like a tie


---------31:07----------
every day was very strict school right


---------31:09----------
and that was different than what I was


---------31:10----------
used to so I'd like a uniform and all


---------31:13----------
dudes in blah blah blah and my dad


---------31:14----------
really wanted me to succeed you know


---------31:16----------
like my dad's always been giving me this


---------31:18----------
like hard-ass attitude like you have to


---------31:20----------
make something of yourself like you know


---------31:22----------
like so my freshman year I was really


---------31:24----------
focused and I would try my best to like


---------31:26----------
you know be on time do all my schoolwork


---------31:28----------
I actually did pretty well my freshman


---------31:29----------
and sophomore year and then my sophomore


---------31:32----------
year


---------31:33----------
I think it was happy yeah I really think


---------31:35----------
that was the time in my life where my


---------31:37----------
dad was probably the most like proud of


---------31:39----------
me yeah you know I was playing sports


---------31:40----------
and I I mean it felt as though I was


---------31:44----------
living I was living to please my father


---------31:47----------
you know like it didn't it's not


---------31:50----------
particularly I didn't particularly enjoy


---------31:53----------
doing those things you know like I


---------31:55----------
didn't feel like a grind yeah did it


---------31:59----------
feel like everyday you know like school


---------32:01----------
is my the school I went to was was hard


---------32:02----------
man like it was it was a difficult


---------32:04----------
school and my first two years I was


---------32:08----------
doing very very well and then and then


---------32:11----------
my mother got sick my sophomore year or


---------32:13----------
like that and myself pause for a second


---------32:15----------
but I just want to just understand what


---------32:19----------
was going on within you during your


---------32:20----------
freshman and sophomore years so sounds


---------32:23----------
like like you were working really hard


---------32:25----------
you were also delaying a lot of


---------32:27----------
gratification yes you were being very


---------32:32----------
conscientious and diligent yes you were


---------32:35----------
grinding yeah grinding yeah what


---------32:38----------
happened to the fun middle school kid


---------32:41----------
III I just I had to grow like my dad


---------32:45----------
made me know like I remember the summer


---------32:47----------
going into my and into high school my


---------32:49----------
dad told me like shit's gonna be


---------32:50----------
different you need to focus like you


---------32:53----------
have to make something you have to do


---------32:54----------
this like I want you to go to a good


---------32:56----------
college like you need to focus this is a


---------32:58----------
very important time in your life and my


---------33:00----------
dad instilled that in me like super


---------33:01----------
heavily and that's what we're instilling


---------33:04----------
just the fact that I had to stop you


---------33:07----------
know because in middle school I'ma be


---------33:08----------
honest my grades were trash like I was


---------33:10----------
just I was having a good time sure and I


---------33:12----------
didn't really care about school I was


---------33:14----------
kind of just like doing my thing and


---------33:15----------
whatever you know making friends having


---------33:17----------
a good time and then my dad told me


---------33:19----------
that's not gonna fly anymore like you


---------33:21----------
can't keep doing that like you have to


---------33:22----------
he said when he said that to you do you


---------33:24----------
remember how you felt I felt as though I


---------33:29----------
had to I I really I really accepted it


---------33:33----------
you know I felt as though I had to


---------33:34----------
change I remember thinking about it


---------33:35----------
about yourself


---------33:37----------
um honestly it didn't really matter to


---------33:41----------
me anyway like like I didn't feel any


---------33:42----------
type of way I was more of just like I


---------33:44----------
like doing I would have rather have


---------33:46----------
jerked off and [ __ ] around and and


---------33:47----------
trust me later on in high school I


---------33:49----------
started doing that but like sure uh yeah


---------33:52----------
like it didn't it didn't I was just


---------33:54----------
happy that I was making my dad proud


---------33:56----------
that made that did that did make me feel


---------33:57----------
good you know


---------33:58----------
yeah so you you enjoyed you enjoyed


---------34:00----------
making him proud you also did it feel


---------34:03----------
like you were kind of getting your like


---------34:04----------
did what he said sort of sink in with


---------34:06----------
you like you felt like okay I'm kind of


---------34:07----------
a little bit of a [ __ ] so maybe I do


---------34:11----------
need to get my [ __ ] in gear yeah oh I


---------34:13----------
definitely I definitely thought that way


---------34:15----------
yeah like I went through a rough phase


---------34:18----------
from when I switched I switched from


---------34:19----------
like a public school to private school


---------34:22----------
in actually in middle school and I


---------34:25----------
remember it was a rough transition for


---------34:27----------
me because I was like moving away from


---------34:28----------
all my other friends blah blah blah like


---------34:29----------
I used to I I used to get my mom hell


---------34:32----------
man like I would I would just go to


---------34:34----------
school and I wouldn't even put my


---------34:35----------
clothes on cuz I told him I wasn't gonna


---------34:37----------
go there so I Lily get in the car naked


---------34:39----------
and just just I'm not going I'm not


---------34:42----------

---------34:55----------

---------35:21----------
never felt the same connection with


---------35:23----------

---------35:28----------
feel that way again with anyone I've had


---------35:30----------
major trust issues since since since all


---------35:34----------
of that like major major major trust


---------35:36----------

---------36:37----------
it that way cuz you know whatever but


---------36:38----------
that's that's definitely true I've


---------36:40----------
definitely had my moments of feeling


---------36:43----------
that way yeah yeah why can't you say


---------36:47----------
that to her honestly when I see her


---------36:51----------
nowadays I I just can't I I so hard for


---------36:57----------
me to deal with like I use in a


---------36:59----------
wheelchair and she's yeah it's just so


---------37:01----------
[ __ ] hard I can't explain it man I


---------37:03----------
break down every time I see her dude


---------37:04----------
like I went back east actually a couple


---------37:06----------
months ago and you know my life's been


---------37:08----------
pretty rough the last four months or so


---------37:10----------
I actually lost my partnership with


---------37:12----------
twitch I don't know if you knew about


---------37:13----------
this but I lost my partnership with


---------37:16----------
twitch like four months ago I'm a boob


---------37:18----------
and uh okay well yeah I lost my


---------37:20----------
partnership with twitch four months ago


---------37:21----------
and pretty much a lot of my income has


---------37:23----------
been taken away from me which kind of


---------37:25----------
sucks it actually really [ __ ] sucks


---------37:27----------
not it's my fault


---------37:29----------
I made a I made a huge mistake I [ __ ]


---------37:32----------
up but but yeah I've definitely I've


---------37:34----------
definitely felt the repercussions of


---------37:36----------
that I mean [ __ ] like I I when I first


---------37:39----------
got I don't know where I'm kind of going


---------37:41----------
all over the place but that's okay yeah


---------37:43----------
I don't mean to like it off topic or


---------37:44----------
anything


---------37:45----------
I just okay on top of yeah that's okay


---------37:48----------
yeah that'd just be what's that talking


---------37:50----------
is it okay if I interrupt and direct you


---------37:52----------
from


---------37:52----------
time oh yeah there's no problem with


---------37:54----------
that yeah I'm just asking you if you


---------37:55----------
because I'll go off on tangents a longer


---------37:57----------
because there's a lot of there's a lot


---------37:58----------
of ground to make free for you you know


---------38:00----------
for us yeah no kappapride white what do


---------38:04----------
you think why do you think that there's


---------38:05----------
a lot of ground to cover


---------38:08----------
I just think there is there's a lot


---------38:10----------
there's really is a lot my life has been


---------38:12----------
very eventful full of like ups and downs


---------38:15----------
and craziness right so there's nothing a


---------38:17----------
lot for sure yeah how much of how much


---------38:20----------
of what do you think we've covered so


---------38:22----------
far do you think we've covered a lot I


---------38:24----------
think we've covered about yeah I'd say


---------38:27----------
we covered a good amount for sure yeah


---------38:29----------
definitely but a lot of the things


---------38:32----------
there's still a lot we haven't covered


---------38:33----------
as well but true is definitely stuff


---------38:36----------
again you tell me how you feel when you


---------38:38----------
see your mom


---------38:39----------
yeah I feel helpless I feel helpless I


---------38:43----------
feel I can't help her and it eats away


---------38:45----------
at me inside and I would honestly rather


---------38:47----------
just avoid it like I'll go and see her


---------38:50----------
but I just put out this like mental wall


---------38:51----------
where I'm just like alright I'm not I'm


---------38:53----------
not gonna feel anything


---------38:54----------
you know what I mean yeah very well


---------38:55----------
right yeah I'll put up this wall where


---------38:58----------
I'm just like whatever you need mom I


---------38:59----------
got you you need food I'll get it for


---------39:01----------
you you need this I'll get it for you


---------39:02----------
like I'll do anything for you know what


---------39:03----------
I mean what's pretty behind the wall I


---------39:07----------
would just break down constantly man I I


---------39:10----------
can't deal with it I can't I can't deal


---------39:12----------
with it when I see her and in this state


---------39:13----------
that she's in it breaks my [ __ ] heart


---------39:15----------
to the point where I


---------39:17----------
I just can't function man like I would I


---------39:21----------
just can't like I break down III I was


---------39:24----------
freaking out like I remember you know


---------39:27----------
recently I was there and I was just like


---------39:29----------
it was just everyday I was just crying


---------39:32----------
and lashing out and just unstable you


---------39:36----------
know what I mean sure so what do you


---------39:38----------
think happens to all those feelings when


---------39:39----------
you're not with her I try and suppress


---------39:42----------
all of them and just focus on my job


---------39:44----------
yeah and how do you think that they


---------39:46----------
continue to like so like let's say that


---------39:48----------
someone has you know what just let's


---------39:51----------
talk about someone else for a second


---------39:52----------
okay so now I'm gonna ask you to step


---------39:53----------
outside of your shoes like this is gonna


---------39:55----------
be hard for you but I want you to try


---------39:56----------
okay so let's say that there's someone


---------39:59----------
who has you know all these emotions that


---------40:01----------
cause them to like lash out at people


---------40:03----------
and break down


---------40:05----------
and stuff like that and then you know


---------40:07----------
that those emotions kind of get


---------40:10----------
triggered or come out in a particular


---------40:12----------
situation and then once they leave that


---------40:16----------
situation they're kind of like they


---------40:18----------
appear to be functioning normally and


---------40:20----------
and yeah do you think that that person


---------40:23----------
would be functioning normally I think


---------40:26----------
that they can put on the mask that


---------40:29----------
they're functioning normally even though


---------40:30----------
they might be very much so in pain


---------40:32----------
inside but that's kind of like how do


---------40:34----------
you think how do you think that that


---------40:35----------
affects what they try to like do you


---------40:38----------
think that that person will be very


---------40:40----------
successful


---------40:40----------
I think some some some types of people


---------40:45----------
in those situations could be and others


---------40:46----------
the weights too much and they crack


---------40:48----------
right I think that's yeah how does that


---------40:50----------
what does that look like what is well


---------40:53----------
what's crack to look like like how would


---------40:54----------
you know when someone cracking cracking


---------40:57----------
is just like throwing in the towel and


---------40:59----------
just saying [ __ ] and giving in to


---------41:00----------
your emotions you know that's cracking


---------41:02----------
cracking is what I have done the last


---------41:03----------
four months man


---------41:04----------
like that's cracking you know I got


---------41:07----------
banned on Twitch


---------41:08----------
I lost my partnership I [ __ ] up I


---------41:10----------
literally became like a [ __ ] gambling


---------41:13----------
addict for a while like I had a lot of


---------41:15----------
money saved up and I pretty much lost


---------41:17----------
like every dollar gambling when I went


---------41:19----------
back east like there's a lot of casinos


---------41:21----------
where I'm from in Maryland and I've


---------41:23----------
always had a problem with like poker and


---------41:24----------
like blackjack and stuff like that and I


---------41:27----------
went back home and I just I was at the


---------41:28----------
casino 16 hours a day I don't know why I


---------41:30----------
just didn't want to deal with my home


---------41:31----------
life because I knew I had to go back


---------41:33----------
home and deal with it and like I was


---------41:35----------
like [ __ ] like I'll just maybe I'll


---------41:36----------
get lucky gambling and I won't have the


---------41:38----------
stream and or something like yeah


---------41:39----------
there's something stupid and irrational


---------41:41----------
came inside of me but recently I


---------41:43----------
actually put myself in a super financial


---------41:45----------
hole that I've never been in in my life


---------41:46----------
you know I've never been in this


---------41:48----------
situation and I I did I did this I did


---------41:50----------
this to myself recently a hundred


---------41:52----------
percent like I [ __ ] up


---------41:55----------
yeah so that's not something I entirely


---------41:58----------
agree with so it look can I help you out


---------42:00----------
can I share a little bit about what I


---------42:02----------
see and what I think is going on oh yeah


---------42:04----------
sure


---------42:05----------
so like you're I don't think this really


---------42:07----------
happens anymore but you know like wow


---------42:10----------
you used to have like a resurrection


---------42:12----------
debuff yes and like when you had the res


---------42:16----------
debuff like do you remember like what


---------42:18----------
happened to your stats and stuff yeah


---------42:20----------
they they got they got reduced by a lot


---------42:22----------
like a [ __ ] ton right like 90% yeah not


---------42:26----------
yeah and and so what happens if you like


---------42:28----------
try to do like a raid and you have the


---------42:31----------
rez debuff you feed and you lose okay so


---------42:37----------
what I think is going on with you Mitch


---------42:39----------
is that you were playing the game of


---------42:40----------
life and you're losing catastrophic Lee


---------42:43----------
over and over and over again and you


---------42:45----------
basically have a rez debuff that you're


---------42:48----------
not aware of oh that's a good analogy


---------42:53----------
what do you think about that I think I


---------42:58----------
gotta wait 10 minutes and queue up again


---------43:00----------
yeah but that's the thing right so you


---------43:02----------
don't do so 10 minutes is not how you


---------43:04----------
actually get rid of the residue buff in


---------43:06----------
real life you actually have to get rid


---------43:08----------
of that debuff and I think I think so so


---------43:11----------
let me tell you what I'm hearing right


---------43:12----------
so I hear a guy who's pretty intelligent


---------43:14----------
and pretty driven and when they put


---------43:15----------
their mind to something they can really


---------43:17----------
accomplish a lot and I also hear that


---------43:19----------
you have this wall within you behind


---------43:22----------
which is all kinds of just bizarre


---------43:24----------
abject feelings of of loss grief


---------43:27----------
loneliness brokenness that you're a


---------43:30----------
failure


---------43:31----------
and somehow you're actually functioning


---------43:34----------
in life with all that [ __ ] behind the


---------43:36----------
wall and then that's fair and then


---------43:39----------
you're you're confused when like you


---------43:41----------
don't understand why when your mind when


---------43:44----------
you try to put your mind to something it


---------43:45----------
doesn't happen properly and it's like


---------43:47----------
yeah because you have this [ __ ] res


---------43:49----------
debuff on you and and I just don't I


---------43:52----------
think you grossly like underestimate


---------43:55----------
what you're capable of not because


---------43:58----------
you're and this is the thing about the


---------43:59----------
res debuff it's not like your stats are


---------44:01----------
actually bad right like your stats are


---------44:03----------
good you're high level you have good


---------44:04----------
gear all of it like alt meat you went


---------44:06----------
when you look at someone who's got a res


---------44:07----------
debuff and you look at their


---------44:09----------
everything looks normal and so that


---------44:12----------
person if I just took like a screenshot


---------44:14----------
of someone's like gear in their level


---------44:16----------
and they're like like hotkeys and stuff


---------44:18----------
like that and I looked at that that Wow


---------44:20----------
character I said okay this person should


---------44:22----------
be able to down this raid boss mm-hmm


---------44:25----------
then it's just one tiny little icon


---------44:27----------
right because that's what the rez debuff


---------44:29----------
looks like it's a tiny tiny tiny icon


---------44:31----------
but boy is it worth a lot and you don't


---------44:34----------
see it on the character sheet and I


---------44:36----------
think you're going through life in


---------44:37----------
you're blaming yourself because you've


---------44:39----------
got this rez debuff that's like off in


---------44:41----------
the corner of your screen and you look


---------44:42----------
at yourself you say oh I have all this


---------44:43----------
gear I'm max level I have this I have


---------44:45----------
this I'm capable of this


---------44:47----------
and then sometimes heroically the


---------44:49----------
[ __ ] crazy thing is that sometimes


---------44:51----------
you actually down the raid boss with the


---------44:53----------
[ __ ] rez debuff sometimes you're able


---------44:56----------
to do it for like a month


---------45:01----------
okay I can I can really really tall


---------45:04----------
you're saying this analogies yeah I


---------45:06----------
totally go we're saying right cuz you


---------45:09----------
feel that rez debuff it's there within


---------45:11----------
you the sense of you being [ __ ]


---------45:12----------
broken what do you think that is that's


---------45:14----------
the rez debuff yeah how on earth do you


---------45:17----------
think you're gonna be successful when


---------45:18----------
that [ __ ] is eating you alive from the


---------45:20----------
inside it's definitely a lot harder yeah


---------45:26----------
it's like it's amazing that you've done


---------45:29----------
what you've done I think it's it's


---------45:31----------
amazing people will think you're a


---------45:33----------
[ __ ] hacker if you're like downing


---------45:35----------
bosses with the rest debuff they're like


---------45:37----------
this guy's [ __ ] hacker that's


---------45:39----------
actually that's a it's a great analogy


---------45:42----------
man it helps me really - yeah I get what


---------45:46----------
you're saying


---------45:46----------
that's what am I saying you're saying


---------45:49----------
that I'm pretty much living life with


---------45:51----------
[ __ ] balls on my ankles and I'm


---------45:53----------
somehow still doing [ __ ] right yeah so


---------45:56----------
what do you think what does that person


---------45:59----------
deserve right so if we're gonna judge


---------46:01----------
that person do we do we judge them and


---------46:04----------
do we say oh this person [ __ ] sucks


---------46:06----------
at life or do we actually respect them


---------46:09----------
well if your twitch at you would just


---------46:11----------
don't worry about it okay if you're a


---------46:13----------
human yeah


---------46:15----------
okay so twitch chess not humans don't


---------46:18----------
worry about twitch chat we're not gonna


---------46:19----------
skate okay okay okay okay don't twitch


---------46:21----------
that alright so sorry can you it's can


---------46:23----------
you a happy what do you think that


---------46:25----------
person deserves from us what should we


---------46:28----------
think about that person I mean they did


---------46:30----------
I I think help honestly I don't know


---------46:33----------
there's anything that people can do to


---------46:34----------
help I can't help like when I see people


---------46:38----------
that are as broken as me I I gravitate


---------46:41----------
towards that for some reason like it


---------46:44----------
makes me feel like I'm not alone you


---------46:46----------
know so like I like to help those type


---------46:48----------
of people in any way that I can yeah I


---------46:52----------
do like to help people do you try to


---------46:54----------
help yourself oh yeah yeah I say i I


---------46:59----------
mean I have in the past yeah like I said


---------47:02----------
I took a year off twitch to try to find


---------47:03----------
myself and all I found was trash so I


---------47:06----------
don't know I've definitely had my


---------47:09----------
moments of trying to help myself yes but


---------47:11----------
then I put those on hold and try and


---------47:13----------
help my you know my job or other people


---------47:16----------
or whatever you know I'm happy to hear


---------47:19----------
you say that I'm also a little bit


---------47:20----------
surprised I think you treat yourself


---------47:23----------
very differently from other people with


---------47:25----------
the res debuffs wait why is that I think


---------47:29----------
you blame yours I mean I think you you


---------47:31----------
judge yourself for I don't think you


---------47:32----------
treat I don't think you treat yourself


---------47:35----------
well yeah I definitely don't


---------47:37----------
I definitely don't and I I try to like


---------47:40----------
well I try to do like the health stuff


---------47:41----------
like I try and eat well and you know I


---------47:43----------
try and keep the bare minimum to say ah


---------47:45----------
very good so so be not now now we get to


---------47:48----------
the crux of it right so I'm not saying


---------47:50----------
that you don't try to do things to make


---------47:51----------
your life better I just don't think you


---------47:54----------
treat yourself well I think you do a lot


---------47:58----------
of things to try to improve your life


---------47:59----------
and one may assume that just because


---------48:02----------
you're trying to improve your life that


---------48:03----------
you feel like compassion towards


---------48:05----------
yourself but I don't think you do I


---------48:07----------
think you try to just improve your life


---------48:09----------
because your life has to change but I


---------48:12----------
don't think you actually treat yourself


---------48:13----------
very kindly yeah I don't


---------48:17----------
yeah that's true I do yeah I don't like


---------48:20----------
myself I don't like where I'm at


---------48:22----------
I don't like what I've become and


---------48:24----------
honestly if I could do it all over I


---------48:25----------
would I wouldn't do what I've done


---------48:27----------
that's honestly how I feel yeah so what


---------48:30----------
what are we what emotion is that do you


---------48:32----------
know like regret and like absolutely


---------48:37----------
yeah


---------48:38----------
so speaking of grief um I mean do you


---------48:44----------
feel like you're grieving right now I


---------48:47----------
truly think that I'm grieving every day


---------48:50----------
of my life and you I know honey


---------48:53----------
and I know how to put a smile on my face


---------48:55----------
and I know how to be [ __ ] Mitch Jones


---------48:57----------
on twitch you know but when I'm all


---------49:00----------
alone and the cameras are off it's it's


---------49:02----------
not good yeah I guess so I think so let


---------49:05----------
me tell you something Mitch I think I


---------49:06----------
think you can get better so by the way


---------49:08----------
for some reason people are calling you


---------49:10----------
the raid boss apparently when it comes


---------49:12----------
to with your the your my raid boss yeah


---------49:15----------
yeah yeah you can't you can't you can't


---------49:18----------
fix me dude I'm a hard boss bro I mean


---------49:21----------
IFIF this is a raid boss its I am Mitch


---------49:24----------
I think you can be I think you can get


---------49:25----------
better I'm I'm more hopeful about you


---------49:28----------
than I am about many many people that I


---------49:30----------
talk to and I think it's just because


---------49:32----------
you've got such it so it's hard to fix


---------49:34----------
someone who doesn't have a res debuff


---------49:36----------
right like yeah because they're just


---------49:39----------
lost in their own yeah like if you just


---------49:41----------
[ __ ] suck it Wow and you like don't


---------49:43----------
know how to like push buttons then I


---------49:45----------
can't help you


---------49:46----------
yeah but the thing is you don't suck I


---------49:50----------
think I think what's going on with you


---------49:51----------
is that you have so let me just take a


---------49:53----------
step back so if we think about behavior


---------49:55----------
I'm gonna just say a couple of random


---------49:57----------
things okay so my turn to be kind of


---------49:59----------
tangential and all over the place yeah


---------50:01----------
you know first thing is we think about


---------50:03----------
behavior your mind and your brain has a


---------50:05----------
lot of stuff that goes into whether you


---------50:08----------
engage in a behavior yes right so like


---------50:11----------
if I want to drink this water for


---------50:12----------
example like I can have an internal


---------50:14----------
sense of thirst I can have some like


---------50:17----------
logical part of me that says oh I should


---------50:19----------
drink eight glasses of water and I


---------50:20----------
should stay hydrated there can also be


---------50:22----------
things like availability like so if the


---------50:24----------
water is right in front of me I'm much


---------50:25----------
more likely to drink it then if the


---------50:27----------
water was like in the next room right


---------50:31----------
mm-hmm


---------50:32----------
so there are a lot of things that go


---------50:33----------
into behavior


---------50:35----------
and I think a big thing that goes into


---------50:36----------
behavior that people don't understand is


---------50:38----------
like emotions so generally speaking if


---------50:41----------
we want to do something like delay


---------50:43----------
gratification and control our impulses


---------50:45----------
and like all the stuff that we think


---------50:48----------
about is maturity like would you


---------50:50----------
describe yourself as immature in some


---------50:54----------
ways yes yes it depends on which aspects


---------50:57----------
I'd say 90% of aspects yes I'm immature


---------51:00----------
believes that 10% of me that is very


---------51:02----------
aware and mature yeah so I think so I


---------51:05----------
think when I think about people who view


---------51:08----------
themselves as immature the number one


---------51:10----------
the reason they we call it immaturity is


---------51:12----------
because there's a part of your brain


---------51:13----------
called your frontal lobes which does


---------51:15----------
things like delay gratification and


---------51:17----------
plans tasks over long periods of time


---------51:20----------
and execute them in a consistent manner


---------51:22----------
so that's like maturity it's like [ __ ]


---------51:24----------
like paying a mortgage that's your


---------51:25----------
frontal lobes so when I when I think


---------51:29----------
about things that interfere with the


---------51:31----------
function of the frontal lobes suppress


---------51:33----------
emotion is at the top of the list hmm so


---------51:36----------
generally speaking when I work with


---------51:37----------
people who's like frontal lobes are just


---------51:39----------
not working properly ie they're behaving


---------51:41----------
immaturely like they're just not able to


---------51:43----------
be consistent in life they can do things


---------51:46----------
they can use willpower for brief periods


---------51:49----------
of time or even days or weeks at a time


---------51:52----------
to suppress all of their negative


---------51:53----------
emotion but at some point that negative


---------51:56----------
emotion comes up and actually like


---------51:57----------
starts affecting you yeah you get up


---------52:00----------
I've noticed that person yeah sometimes


---------52:03----------
I'm just [ __ ] like I used to have a


---------52:04----------
panic disorder and I swear that was


---------52:06----------
related to this like I used to have a


---------52:07----------
very bad anxiety very very bad yeah like


---------52:10----------
I was the biggest hypochondriac you


---------52:12----------
would ever know like literally like I


---------52:14----------
was I was [ __ ] bad and so that that


---------52:16----------
anxiety and panic disorder has now


---------52:18----------
started to manifest in different ways


---------52:21----------
yeah in the chats gone yeah


---------52:24----------
so I anxiety for me is like weirdly like


---------52:26----------
just like vanished instead it's more of


---------52:28----------
just like yeah go ahead anyways yeah so


---------52:31----------
I think that whatever it was that showed


---------52:33----------
up as an anxiety problem for you is now


---------52:36----------
showing up in other ways the problem is


---------52:38----------
that those ways are subtle and you don't


---------52:41----------
see them but you [ __ ] blame yourself


---------52:43----------
for them right so like you don't you


---------52:45----------
don't see like you don't understand why


---------52:48----------
you do so


---------52:48----------
and things but you sure as hell will


---------52:51----------
beat yourself up for it but I think the


---------52:52----------
problem is that you've got like you know


---------52:54----------
cuz you're in trying to engage in a


---------52:56----------
particular behavior or you engage in


---------52:57----------
like gambling or something like that


---------52:59----------
because you've got the idea


---------53:00----------
gambling was my vice man gambling I


---------53:02----------
swear to god when I was gambling all of


---------53:04----------
it goes away and I'm just in the moment


---------53:06----------
you know what I mean


---------53:07----------
yep so this is what we've got to do


---------53:08----------
buddy so like all this [ __ ] is pent up


---------53:10----------
inside you and I think the reason that


---------53:12----------
you're sucking it life for lack of a


---------53:14----------
better term is because of this stuff I


---------53:15----------
don't think it's because you actually


---------53:16----------
just suck it like I think this is the


---------53:18----------
rez debuff and I think you can see it


---------53:21----------
there are times when you notice it but


---------53:22----------
just think about this for a second okay


---------53:23----------
just think about this if you like walk


---------53:25----------
into a room and you see your mom and you


---------53:27----------
become overwhelmed with emotion like


---------53:29----------
where the [ __ ] do you think that goes


---------53:31----------
when you leave the room I don't know I


---------53:34----------
just think like does it just disappear


---------53:37----------
is that how we work no it probably just


---------53:41----------
goes somewhere inside of me and some


---------53:43----------
weird muscle and then yeah something


---------53:45----------
yeah something that and then what it


---------53:47----------
does is it it turns in so in when you're


---------53:49----------
in the room with her it's like not a


---------53:53----------
tiny deep off in the corner of your


---------53:54----------
screen that's affecting all of your


---------53:56----------
stats


---------53:56----------
it's like front and center and then when


---------53:59----------
you leave the room all of that front and


---------54:01----------
center stuff becomes a tiny little


---------54:02----------
debuff in the corner of your screen that


---------54:04----------
reduces your SATs by 90% and then you go


---------54:06----------
on living life and then you fail


---------54:08----------
willpower check after willpower check


---------54:10----------
because like you're just debuffed


---------54:13----------
like really really bad yeah no I know


---------54:15----------
that feeling I mean I'm exhausted a lot


---------54:17----------
of the time like just like [ __ ]


---------54:19----------
exhausted so this is important because


---------54:21----------
now I'm gonna tell you something so the


---------54:23----------
mind


---------54:24----------
maintaining that wall it's not a


---------54:27----------
permanent wall it's like a spell that


---------54:30----------
you have to cast over and over and over


---------54:32----------
and over and over again so you maintain


---------54:34----------
a mana all the time boom dude you're


---------54:39----------
you're and you've got a res debuff and


---------54:41----------
you're trying to live life like this


---------54:42----------
because like no wonder you're exhausting


---------54:44----------
because keeping that [ __ ] at bay like


---------54:46----------
you realize how much of like that's like


---------54:48----------
it's like a burning hot Sun of emotion


---------54:51----------
there's so much of it just think about


---------54:53----------
how much your subconscious mind is like


---------54:55----------
spending mana like keeping that [ __ ] at


---------54:58----------
bay


---------54:59----------
yeah like that's crazy man mm-hmm


---------55:04----------
but you get that so how how do I stop


---------55:08----------
living life boom yeah great so you got


---------55:11----------
to actually deal with the feelings


---------55:13----------
underneath right so you've got actually


---------55:14----------
Clint so I want you to think about the


---------55:16----------
debuff is a pile of emotion that is just


---------55:19----------
on your back


---------55:20----------
it's like baggage like literally like


---------55:22----------
you're just you're not only out of em


---------55:24----------
you like I have all this inventory space


---------55:26----------
like you can't loot anything because all


---------55:29----------
of your inventory is filled with this


---------55:30----------
crap question though yesin good is it


---------55:34----------
possible to just like reroll and like


---------55:36----------
play like a warrior no mana just rain oh


---------55:43----------
no I mean I


---------55:44----------
whatever the resources I mean so it's


---------55:46----------
not okay I mean ruling in theory in


---------55:50----------
theory that's possible in some ways but


---------55:52----------
no Kay not beyond the scope of this


---------55:55----------
conversation we're not gonna have Yuri


---------55:56----------
roll all right nobody rolling because


---------55:58----------
you're not still enough yeah you're


---------56:00----------
you're we're not done with you yet Mitch


---------56:02----------
all right sounds good so what you've got


---------56:06----------
to do is actually like process that


---------56:07----------
stuff man so like like this is the thing


---------56:10----------
where it's so painful to process that


---------56:12----------
[ __ ] like you it's I think you probably


---------56:15----------
do get it like there it's just so it's


---------56:18----------
so like when I process those things I'm


---------56:20----------
broken as [ __ ] and if I'm trying to also


---------56:22----------
stream at the same time twitch chat sees


---------56:24----------
that I'm unstable and they feed off of


---------56:26----------
it yeah yeah so you can try can do this


---------56:28----------
on door chat yeah but like how am I


---------56:31----------
gonna continue streaming while at the


---------56:33----------
same time I'm leaking emotional baggage


---------56:34----------
less than Errol so you don't wanna you


---------56:36----------
don't you don't want to leak emotional


---------56:39----------
baggage left and right you want to take


---------56:41----------
some time and effort and take time out


---------56:43----------
of your day right so this is where we


---------56:45----------
learn some work/life balance where


---------56:47----------
you've got to start like like cleansing


---------56:49----------
those debuffs and cleaning out that


---------56:51----------
inventory space and yeah you know


---------56:53----------
drinking your crystal water or whatever


---------56:54----------
to get your mana back like you've oh I


---------56:57----------
do that attitude I I swear without my


---------56:59----------
regimens of like my weird health


---------57:01----------
regimens I'd be [ __ ] just because of


---------57:03----------
the amount of like [ __ ] yeah like dude I


---------57:05----------
have these weird-ass regimens where I


---------57:07----------
drink like veggie juice every day I


---------57:08----------
drink these massive smoothies of just


---------57:10----------
like massive em


---------57:11----------
vegetables like I swear if I was eating


---------57:13----------
a trash diet and living I would be


---------57:15----------
[ __ ] dead like right yeah so this is


---------57:17----------
this is how you're able to function well


---------57:19----------
so let's just think about this you can


---------57:20----------
down the raid boss because you have the


---------57:22----------
res debuff but then you also have like


---------57:24----------
all these food buffs and then like


---------57:26----------
you've got people who are brewing you


---------57:27----------
potions and then you get like you know


---------57:29----------
arcane intellect and like all that other


---------57:31----------
crap so like you're by yourself every


---------57:33----------
day and if you stop but what this is the


---------57:35----------
thing that's just a [ __ ] hard way to


---------57:37----------
live life [ __ ] like you you get that


---------57:38----------
like you can't live a normal life


---------57:40----------
because you have to you do all of these


---------57:42----------
things like veggie juices and stuff


---------57:43----------
because you have this gigantic pile of


---------57:45----------
[ __ ] on your back yeah that's like my


---------57:48----------
mana pots and like without them yeah


---------57:50----------
you're like Kane chugging and like


---------57:52----------
you're buffing yourself to be like


---------57:54----------
functional yeah right but like the the


---------57:57----------
problem here the root of the problem is


---------57:59----------
that we have to deal with that negative


---------58:00----------
emotion we've got to digest and


---------58:03----------
metabolize that and free you of that but


---------58:06----------
there's so many different like the


---------58:07----------
negative emotion is almost consuming to


---------58:09----------
where I truly have a negative outlook on


---------58:11----------
the world like ice actually believe that


---------58:13----------
like people especially on Twitch like


---------58:15----------
the friends I made here etc I don't


---------58:17----------
trust and I like hardly any of them


---------58:19----------
yeah no each of these things has to be


---------58:21----------
dealt with right so the first one


---------58:22----------
there's one that I've been trying to


---------58:24----------
hammer into you over and over and over


---------58:26----------
again today the first of your cognitive


---------58:28----------
biases that needs to be addressed do you


---------58:30----------
know what it is yeah the Resik miss


---------58:36----------
right no no yeah so that that's more of


---------58:38----------
a deeper sense but there's a subtle


---------58:40----------
cognitive I so I keep on talking about


---------58:41----------
black and white thinking okay so that's


---------58:44----------
ready to work on is my black and white


---------58:45----------
thinking you need to work on a lot of


---------58:46----------
stuff but yeah so what the first thing


---------58:48----------
is that the world isn't black and white


---------58:50----------
right like it's not I believe


---------58:52----------
III truly believe it is I believe I know


---------58:55----------
you there yeah like I do really think


---------58:58----------
the world has like it's just bad and


---------59:02----------
then there's some good and it's just


---------59:04----------
like most people are just selfish and


---------59:06----------
out for themselves it's just the way I


---------59:08----------
view life yeah so so that that's got it


---------59:12----------
so Mitch this is this is gonna take time


---------59:14----------
okay but I think that there's a lot here


---------59:17----------
there's the sense of failure so that


---------59:18----------
needs to be addressed


---------59:20----------
there's just the fact that you view


---------59:22----------
things in black and white and that's a


---------59:23----------
real problem because the


---------59:25----------
prevents that that walls off your


---------59:29----------
solution space as long as you see the


---------59:31----------
world is black and white and as long as


---------59:32----------
you blame yourself for example which I


---------59:34----------
think you've made some progress on do


---------59:36----------
you see that do you feel like you're I


---------59:37----------
do yeah I do see that yeah what's


---------59:39----------
different between now and when we


---------59:41----------
started talking in terms of your self


---------59:42----------
flame well I can recognize it better


---------59:46----------
very good


---------59:47----------
is anything else just hmm no I'll


---------59:52----------
probably still blame myself for a lot of


---------59:54----------
[ __ ] I shouldn't but I definitely will


---------59:56----------
recognize I'm doing that but I don't


---------59:57----------
know if that matters being self-aware is


---------59:59----------
something I've always I've I've always


---------60:01----------
like had a like I wouldn't say gift but


---------60:05----------
I've always been self-aware like yeah


---------60:06----------
say that like I've always known so I


---------60:09----------
want you to listen I want you to listen


---------60:11----------
to this [ __ ] stop this okay okay so


---------60:24----------
you see you just said a statement I


---------60:27----------
blame myself for a lot of stuff that I


---------60:29----------
shouldn't yes think about that for a


---------60:33----------
second but I also blame myself for a lot


---------60:35----------
of things that I should as well yeah but


---------60:37----------
so don't just jump off the thought think


---------60:40----------
about the thought I blame myself for a


---------60:41----------
lot of stuff that I shouldn't that said


---------60:44----------
it sounds weird to me mm-hmm


---------60:47----------
do you have any idea what I think is


---------60:48----------
weird about it


---------60:53----------
honestly I don't I think I I think if


---------60:58----------
you recognize that you shouldn't blame


---------61:00----------
yourself for it that's a huge step


---------61:03----------
forward mm-hmm right because at the


---------61:07----------
beginning you it was in like like you


---------61:09----------
just said your mind tried to go there


---------61:11----------
right and I blame myself for a lot of


---------61:12----------
stuff that I should by the way mm-hmm so


---------61:14----------
your mind very quickly goes to things


---------61:16----------
like because you're comfortable with


---------61:18----------
blaming yourself but the fact that you


---------61:19----------
can say I blame myself for a lot of


---------61:22----------
stuff that I shouldn't is actually huge


---------61:25----------
mm-hmm because you do blame yourself and


---------61:28----------
now you're able to see that you are


---------61:30----------
actually not very kind to yourself


---------61:33----------
that what you really should do is cut


---------61:35----------
yourself a little bit more slack right


---------61:38----------
I'm not asking you to absolve yourself


---------61:40----------
of all responsibility but can we can we


---------61:44----------
agree that you should cut yourself like


---------61:46----------
a little bit more slack yeah yeah we can


---------61:52----------
do that how does that feel to you feels


---------61:57----------
like feels like it's gonna be difficult


---------62:00----------
to start but once I implement the


---------62:03----------
changes and if I can do them


---------62:04----------
consistently it could have a big impact


---------62:07----------
on me wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong


---------62:09----------
wrong wrong on that also future its


---------62:12----------
future oriented thinking if I can be


---------62:13----------
consistent if I can do this then one day


---------62:16----------
I will be the way that I want to be like


---------62:19----------
do you see that it's all at


---------62:20----------
future-oriented consistent you're


---------62:22----------
setting yourself up for failure right


---------62:25----------
there the goal is not to be forgiving


---------62:30----------
towards yourself tomorrow and the next


---------62:32----------
day and the next day and every day


---------62:33----------
because that's where your mind jumps to


---------62:35----------
the goal is to be free forgive yourself


---------62:38----------
and be kind to yourself when right now


---------62:41----------
that's it nothing more nothing less


---------62:45----------
in the moment right now forgiving myself


---------62:48----------
how do you feel about that how do you


---------62:51----------
feel about just doing something in the


---------62:52----------
moment and not worrying about tomorrow I


---------62:55----------
feel as though that's a recipe for


---------62:57----------
disaster


---------62:58----------
very good so that also we need to change


---------63:01----------
right because tomorrow tomorrow is just


---------63:05----------
now there is no thing except for the now


---------63:09----------
yes true in the moment is always ever


---------63:12----------
it's all we have and so now I'm gonna


---------63:15----------
ask you again if you can get good at


---------63:16----------
doing something in the moment what does


---------63:18----------
that mean for your future


---------63:22----------
I don't know that's a tough question


---------63:25----------
good so think about it right so now


---------63:29----------
we're headed somewhere so we got to


---------63:31----------
retain we got to reshape the way that


---------63:33----------
you view the world and the way that you


---------63:35----------
view yourself and your perception of


---------63:37----------
time and all this good [ __ ] but this is


---------63:39----------
what I want you go ahead sorry no no no


---------63:43----------
I just yeah I agree with that heavily


---------63:45----------
yeah yeah so we got to start by having


---------63:48----------
you so like like how are you like we got


---------63:51----------
to teach you how to be nice to yourself


---------63:52----------
like now not tomorrow not consistently


---------63:55----------
not for the rest of your life just right


---------63:58----------
now just right now can you do that I


---------64:00----------
mean sure I can try I can definitely try


---------64:03----------
to do that what is what is being nice to


---------64:05----------
yourself what the [ __ ] does that even


---------64:06----------
mean how do you do that help me out


---------64:09----------
having a good spank I don't know doing


---------64:14----------
something you enjoy to do like right


---------64:18----------
actually that's not what I'm looking for


---------64:20----------
so I think when you do something that


---------64:22----------
you enjoy doing that is actually gonna


---------64:25----------
step away from the emotions right it's


---------64:27----------
gonna be it's gonna help you step out a


---------64:29----------
distraction so that's a spank is just


---------64:33----------
gonna be a distraction and like it like


---------64:36----------
sometimes you're feeling down and hurt


---------64:38----------
on the inside and then you have yourself


---------64:39----------
a good wink and then as soon as you're


---------64:41----------
done what happens to the feelings of


---------64:43----------
loneliness and dejection they're just


---------64:46----------
still there yeah absolutely


---------64:47----------
right so that we don't want to do a good


---------64:49----------
spank that's not what we're looking for


---------64:51----------
true okay okay so good so nice Biggs


---------64:54----------
okay all right so what I want you to do


---------64:58----------
is is try to be okay I'm just gonna


---------65:04----------
think about how to say this so if


---------65:08----------
there's no distractions because you said


---------65:10----------
what do you know what do you do to


---------65:12----------
reward yourself not reward when you're


---------65:16----------
feeling when you're beating yourself up


---------65:17----------
you know when you're beating yourself up


---------65:19----------
yeah I do yeah yeah okay so I want you


---------65:24----------
to imagine what your mom would say to


---------65:26----------
you


---------65:28----------
hmm you know I I honestly don't know


---------65:41----------
anymore man like ii-i've lost that I've


---------65:43----------
lost haven't I think you know what I


---------65:47----------
don't say you [ __ ] up before what did


---------65:51----------
she say to you when you [ __ ] up what


---------65:53----------
did she say to you when you showed up


---------65:55----------
naked in your car ready for something


---------65:58----------
she would just say that you know she was


---------66:02----------
just saying the nicest way possible


---------66:04----------
loving way possible about you know how


---------66:06----------
to go forward right make she would just


---------66:08----------
be like and that's what you need to do


---------66:10----------
for yourself because that's the [ __ ]


---------66:12----------
exact opposite of what you do yourself


---------66:16----------
hmm because you don't say to yourself in


---------66:21----------
the nicest possible way how to move


---------66:23----------
forward you do the exact [ __ ]


---------66:24----------
opposite you call yourself a [ __ ]


---------66:25----------
[ __ ] and you blame yourself yeah


---------66:32----------
that's yeah that's what you need to


---------66:34----------
learn how to do in the moment in the


---------66:39----------
nicest way possible in the most loving


---------66:41----------
and patient way possible encourage


---------66:44----------
yourself to move forward because you're


---------66:48----------
the here's the amazing thing about that


---------66:50----------
your mom never asked you to like be


---------66:53----------
consistent about wearing clothes for the


---------66:55----------
rest of your life right didn't care


---------66:58----------
about that what did she care about she


---------67:01----------
just cared about that moment absolutely


---------67:04----------
helping me understand that moment


---------67:07----------
absolutely right she didn't say oh and


---------67:10----------
you've got to get dressed


---------67:11----------
every day for the rest of your life no


---------67:12----------
she was like how can we just get some


---------67:14----------
[ __ ] clothes on you for now yeah yeah


---------67:16----------
for right now just to go to school yep


---------67:18----------
yeah and that's what's got to change and


---------67:22----------
the thing is Mitch she's she's she's


---------67:24----------
helping you out way more than you even


---------67:27----------
realize you just have to let yourself be


---------67:28----------
helped by her right now yeah so I think


---------67:33----------
she's taught you what you need to do for


---------67:37----------
yourself you just haven't learned it


---------67:41----------
mm-hmm that's yeah yeah okay yeah man


---------67:52----------
I've been distracting myself for so long


---------67:55----------
you know very good no wonder you haven't


---------67:59----------
been getting better yeah but there was


---------68:03----------
like one year where I stopped


---------68:04----------
distracting myself and really looked


---------68:06----------
with inside myself and you don't


---------68:07----------
understand like oh yeah


---------68:09----------
I don't mean to make it seem like bigger


---------68:11----------
than any most his problems but it just


---------68:13----------
to me it was like it was very difficult


---------68:16----------
you know oh I completely very difficult


---------68:19----------
so yeah like every day was hard man like


---------68:23----------
I had I don't know like I was definitely


---------68:26----------
getting somewhere with healing myself


---------68:27----------
for sure but it almost felt like to do


---------68:32----------
that I have to go through hell to get to


---------68:34----------
the other side you know yeah so I think


---------68:35----------
the big mistake you're making the big


---------68:37----------
strategic make mistake you're making is


---------68:39----------
that you spent a year trying to fix


---------68:40----------
yourself and who was helping you no one


---------68:44----------
no this is me that's the problem


---------68:46----------
I was alone that whole year and I liked


---------68:48----------
it I liked it so I liked it but but let


---------68:51----------
me tell you something when it comes to


---------68:53----------
problems of this magnitude you need help


---------68:56----------
you can do it on your own and I agree


---------68:59----------
with you it'll take years but the thing


---------69:01----------
is the thing is dr. K let me let me


---------69:03----------
explain to you another recurring problem


---------69:04----------
I have okay so I understand what you're


---------69:07----------
saying and I understand exactly that


---------69:09----------
that is true I do need help but the


---------69:10----------
another issue that I do have is I will


---------69:13----------
find these people in my life that will


---------69:15----------
paint themselves as the perfect help for


---------69:18----------
me right


---------69:19----------
and instead of actually giving a [ __ ]


---------69:21----------
about trying to help me it will almost


---------69:23----------
always be them being selfish and trying


---------69:25----------
to get something from me and I always


---------69:27----------
feel betrayed afterwards and it makes me


---------69:30----------
literally feel like humans [ __ ] suck


---------69:33----------
and I just I just [ __ ] give up you


---------69:36----------
understand like I have had a [ __ ]


---------69:38----------
issue with like trusting people that


---------69:41----------
paint themselves as this almighty Savior


---------69:44----------
for me and like it just [ __ ] me time


---------69:46----------
and time again like it's an issue I have


---------69:50----------
because I always look for the easy way


---------69:51----------
out right and when somebody paints you


---------69:53----------
the picture of the easy way out it's


---------69:55----------
almost like hell yeah let's do it


---------69:57----------
you know and I fall for this every time


---------69:59----------
dr. K every single time yes so I think


---------70:03----------
you're doing the first step right which


---------70:05----------
is that you're you see it was


---------70:06----------
interesting I wish I could I wish you


---------70:10----------
could hear things through my ears


---------70:13----------
because I see so many solutions to that


---------70:16----------
problem in the way that you describe it


---------70:19----------
because you recognize that there is a


---------70:21----------
part of you that always looks for the


---------70:22----------
easy way out


---------70:23----------
and yes and I latch onto like other


---------70:25----------
people so now we get back to the that


---------70:28----------
you don't understand what's going on in


---------70:29----------
your mind right so there are forces and


---------70:31----------
influences that eat despite this


---------70:33----------
happening time and time and time again


---------70:36----------
someone offers you a salvation and the


---------70:39----------
easy road out and there is something


---------70:41----------
within you that is just so [ __ ]


---------70:43----------
hungry for it that you can't help


---------70:44----------
yourself


---------70:45----------
I really can't that's very true


---------70:48----------
and even though even it even if I'm


---------70:50----------
super aware that it could be a negative


---------70:53----------
situation I still am like [ __ ] it like


---------70:56----------
maybe this will work it's like one of


---------70:58----------
those like get-rich-quick schemes you


---------71:00----------
don't mean yeah so then I I don't think


---------71:02----------
you're you're fully aware because that


---------71:04----------
[ __ ] it maybe this will work is once


---------71:07----------
again something within you that is


---------71:08----------
hungry that I don't think you fully


---------71:09----------
understand okay because like like it so


---------71:13----------
this is the thing you're not dumb but


---------71:15----------
you keep on making this mistake so in


---------71:17----------
Alaia


---------71:18----------
it's like a self repeating prophecies


---------71:21----------
yes I'll send you a paper called the


---------71:23----------
repetition compulsion very well


---------71:24----------
characterized within the field of


---------71:26----------
psychology and psychiatry okay so like


---------71:28----------
that people basically repeat something


---------71:30----------
over and over and over again


---------71:32----------
despite the fact that it's dumb because


---------71:35----------
there's like a powerful psychological


---------71:36----------
driver the more stupid your behaviors


---------71:39----------
are Mitch I want you to understand this


---------71:41----------
the more powerful the psychological togs


---------71:45----------
are does that make sense because in


---------71:47----------
order to get you to do something dumb


---------71:49----------
over and over and over again there has


---------71:51----------
to be something really really strong


---------71:53----------
within you that's pushing you to do that


---------71:55----------
thing that's fair right instead of


---------72:00----------
blaming yourself I think what you need


---------72:02----------
to understand is that you have some


---------72:03----------
gigantic things within you mm-hmm


---------72:06----------
and and you're you're and those things


---------72:08----------
are driving you to repeat behaviors over


---------72:11----------
and over and over again


---------72:13----------
that kind of screw you over and then


---------72:14----------
what happens is like you're so busy you


---------72:16----------
like judging yourself for [ __ ] it up


---------72:18----------
again that you never stop in or like


---------72:20----------
curious about why you did this in the


---------72:21----------
first place mm-hmm and when you are


---------72:24----------
curious because you are curious from


---------72:25----------
time to time you take time and you


---------72:27----------
reflect on things it's clear to me that


---------72:28----------
you're very intelligent you reflect a


---------72:30----------
lot which is awesome you just need some


---------72:32----------
is that also bad to reflect too much is


---------72:35----------
that no no it's nothing


---------72:37----------
not if you're reflecting properly now


---------72:40----------
sometimes people will get into thought


---------72:41----------
loops which are unproductive so they'll


---------72:43----------
think the same thing over and over and


---------72:45----------
over again and they'll think that that


---------72:47----------
is reflection that is not reflection but


---------72:49----------
yeah that's been calling those mental


---------72:50----------
Lucifer yeah so I think generally


---------72:53----------
speaking I mean I don't think you can


---------72:54----------
reflect too much if you're really doing


---------72:55----------
productive reflection I think you just


---------72:57----------
understand more and more about yourself


---------72:58----------
and eventually you become enlightened


---------73:00----------
yeah but in your case like oh my god to


---------73:05----------
feel not heavy every day would be


---------73:07----------
[ __ ] amazing yeah so that starts so


---------73:09----------
enlightenment is it you can do it now so


---------73:11----------
just close your eyes close your eyes


---------73:15----------
okay closing my others wait can I pee


---------73:19----------
first


---------73:19----------
yeah go pee okay thank you okay


---------73:22----------
I'm gonna okay we're gonna take a


---------73:25----------
bathroom break and then let me see I got


---------73:31----------
to get more tea okay also guys


---------73:37----------
this is the final boss is that


---------73:44----------
okay hold on [ __ ] midgets gonna be


---------73:49----------
he's gonna be I think he's gonna do okay


---------73:52----------
like we just need some time with him


---------73:56----------
I'm gonna take a quick ad break I've


---------73:59----------
been trying to not read chat so much


---------74:01----------
just to have a genuine experience that's


---------74:04----------
all so I didn't win a stream on my


---------74:05----------
channel as well because I know that I


---------74:07----------
get carried away with like you know Chad


---------74:09----------
stuff I'm trying to just really take


---------74:10----------
this serious and uh you know you don't I


---------74:13----------
mean so I think it's the best plan of


---------74:16----------
action hi feel enriched I'm feeling good


---------74:31----------
I'm feeling good I'm feeling you know


---------74:34----------
I'm feeling like what am I going to


---------74:36----------
understand some things more so than I


---------74:38----------
did and I feel as though uh I I feel as


---------74:45----------
though I'm almost like locked like I'm


---------74:49----------
like hard stuck and like I need to fix


---------74:51----------
that


---------74:51----------
yep that's what I've gone to yeah so so


---------74:55----------
so this is so you gotta once again be


---------74:57----------
careful because you can't fix it you're


---------74:59----------
not gonna think so okay you're just


---------75:01----------
gonna do different today okay what's the


---------75:05----------
difference the difference is right now


---------75:09----------
in the moment I'm gonna try to work on


---------75:12----------
things you've said and not be myself up


---------75:14----------
as much and there's something else


---------75:19----------
yeah good yeah it was not blaming myself


---------75:25----------
as much and try and work on it now and


---------75:28----------
put my clothes on and go to school


---------75:30----------
beautiful okay God so and then we're


---------75:33----------
gonna teach you how to meditate so you


---------75:35----------
are you have some experience in


---------75:36----------
meditation oh yeah yeah I've I've and


---------75:39----------
quite frankly when I meditate I just


---------75:41----------
really feel as though like


---------75:45----------
it's almost like a negative experience


---------75:47----------
for me


---------75:48----------
like I don't know how to explain it like


---------75:50----------
yeah tell me about it I like well I if I


---------75:53----------
meditate before sleep I almost always


---------75:54----------
have nightmares if I meditation for me


---------75:59----------
like I have like cried and it just it


---------76:02----------
brings out a lot of pain you know all


---------76:04----------
I'm trying to say like when I'm just


---------76:06----------
there alone in my thoughts even when I


---------76:07----------
try and tell my thoughts to shut up like


---------76:11----------
for some reason emotion comes out


---------76:13----------
instead it's so it's so hard to explain


---------76:15----------
yeah makes perfect sense okay it's not


---------76:18----------
hard to know it yeah so I'm gonna teach


---------76:21----------
you a different kind of meditation


---------76:22----------
technique that it's not going to quite


---------76:24----------
have the same effect I think it'll be


---------76:26----------
more pleasant for you but I think what's


---------76:28----------
happening in your case is any time you


---------76:30----------
try to meditate what essentially happens


---------76:34----------
is you stop casting your wall spells and


---------76:37----------
so the [ __ ] comes flooding out so


---------76:39----------
oftentimes in meditation whatever is


---------76:42----------
buried comes up okay because you're just


---------76:45----------
you're you're like unraveling your mind


---------76:47----------
mm-hmm


---------76:49----------
first thing is you got to sit up


---------76:50----------

feel feel I feel good breathing is


---------78:57----------
better easier yeah yeah weird huh yeah


---------79:01----------
it's very strange so just sit with that


---------79:04----------
lightness for a second just sit with


---------79:06----------
that just sit with the way you feel


---------79:10----------
right this is you you're not so bad yeah


---------79:17----------
I'm not so bad


---------79:18----------
I'm not so bad right okay so notice


---------79:22----------
those thoughts of you being and you


---------79:24----------
started to slouch again so no slouching


---------79:26----------
okay good just maintain your your


---------79:30----------
posture and then you know they're there


---------79:32----------
it's okay for thoughts to be self


---------79:34----------
judgmental it's okay for you to think


---------79:36----------
that you're bad and that you're broken


---------79:37----------
and you're never gonna get better and


---------79:39----------
just notice those things and then return


---------79:41----------
to the sensation of your body right that


---------79:44----------
all that stuff is kind of there but that


---------79:46----------
stuff too can kind of be walled off if


---------79:48----------
you want it to and it's not so much that


---------79:51----------
you're walling it off it's just that


---------79:52----------
you're not letting it take center stage


---------79:54----------
we're gonna just let it we're gonna let


---------79:56----------
it exist in our mind it's just gonna be


---------79:58----------
off to the side a little bit and we're


---------80:00----------
gonna put go see look at the way you're


---------80:01----------
breathing beautiful feel that just yeah


---------80:05----------
breathe man okay okay what is that what


---------80:10----------
just happened I just feel weird I


---------80:13----------
what was that sensation tell me I don't


---------80:17----------
know it's like I wanted to like be happy


---------80:18----------
but then I style myself and being happy


---------80:20----------
because I can't do that right now cuz


---------80:21----------
I'm I don't even [ __ ] know what it


---------80:23----------
was I don't know very good good good


---------80:25----------
right so just think about that when was


---------80:28----------
the last time you wanted to be happy


---------80:29----------
like that when was the last time you


---------80:31----------
felt the buoyancy which you felt right


---------80:34----------
there was buoyancy does that make sense


---------80:36----------
yeah I feel uncomfortable feeling that


---------80:39----------
way absolutely that's your [ __ ]


---------80:41----------
problem man in a nutshell all right we


---------80:45----------
got to help you be buoyant when you feel


---------80:48----------
naturally like being buoyant eyes closed


---------80:51----------
okay does that make sense


---------80:56----------
you felt that buoyancy it's just like


---------80:57----------
just a spark of it and you knock it down


---------80:59----------
yeah I immediately just I didn't want


---------81:02----------
that feeling yeah yeah which is weird


---------81:05----------
right because I feel like it's nice it


---------81:07----------
is nice it's yeah it's why the [ __ ]


---------81:09----------
don't I want those I don't want that


---------81:11----------
yeah why because you don't think you


---------81:15----------
deserve it really what do you think I


---------81:20----------
don't know it's like a subconscious


---------81:22----------
thing with me whenever I start feeling


---------81:23----------
some type of way or I'm about to smile I


---------81:25----------
immediately stop myself okay so well


---------81:27----------
maybe we'll dig into that but for now


---------81:30----------
we're gonna just it's good so if you had


---------81:32----------
a feeling of buoyancy we're gonna start


---------81:35----------
to train you to like be able to just sit


---------81:39----------
with that feeling the next time it comes


---------81:41----------
up okay and even if you have to suppress


---------81:44----------
it that's okay


---------81:45----------
but just notice that you're suppressing


---------81:46----------
it okay and don't judge yourself for it


---------81:50----------
good now how do you feel tell me what


---------81:55----------
you feel actually


---------81:58----------
I feel loser good I feel loose okay so


---------82:07----------
now we're gonna begin the practice okay


---------82:09----------
okay okay so I'm gonna teach you


---------82:13----------
something called ohm chanting and this


---------82:15----------
is gonna be hard yeah I know this is


---------82:17----------

---------82:19----------

---------86:50----------
chest the belly yeah that's why I feel


---------86:55----------
the anxiety good notice it yeah it's


---------87:00----------
strange it's almost like it's just I


---------87:03----------
feel tighter and like it's like coming


---------87:05----------
out or something yeah so in the post


---------87:13----------
meditative period the anxiety feels


---------87:15----------
greater no I feel I feel okay I could


---------87:21----------
just feel that there's something that


---------87:23----------
wants to express itself and I'm


---------87:26----------
suppressing it still okay I feel so


---------87:29----------
we're gonna chant three more times and I


---------87:32----------
want you to really open your mouth and


---------87:33----------
make an O for that first sound okay okay


---------87:37----------
okay let's go yeah okay


---------87:47----------
Oh


---------87:53----------
[Music]


---------88:00----------
with your next two breaths let whatever


---------88:03----------
it is that's in there let it out


---------88:18----------
beautiful shilling my heart's racing now


---------88:22----------
it's weird


---------88:23----------
yeah last one okay


---------88:29----------
you can do it I'm with you okay


---------88:49----------
okay open your eyes


---------88:52----------
okay all right


---------88:56----------
I feel very different how do you feel


---------89:02----------
like I just woke up yeah I feel I feel


---------89:10----------
like it's easier to breathe a bit it's


---------89:13----------
just strange cuz like during that


---------89:14----------
process I felt like chest pressure and I


---------89:19----------
felt as though like I can't explain I


---------89:22----------
just felt anxiety which yeah I've been


---------89:24----------
good at suppressing it I'm very good at


---------89:27----------
dealing with my anxiety and yeah I feel


---------89:29----------
like so I I don't I don't think this


---------89:32----------
means your anxiety is coming back I just


---------89:34----------
think that remember how he's saying that


---------89:35----------
you're a something within you was


---------89:37----------
manifesting his anxiety and now it is it


---------89:40----------
on dormant or manifested in other ways


---------89:44----------
and I think as you let that stuff out


---------89:47----------
it's manifesting in some ways as like


---------89:49----------
anxiety again but that'll pass over time


---------89:51----------
okay okay yeah yeah I think if I were to


---------89:56----------
practice more more often I could really


---------89:59----------
make headway on expressing these things


---------90:02----------
subconsciously right can't can't


---------90:04----------
practice more often oh I can't do it


---------90:08----------
more often


---------90:08----------
nope you can only do it today okay only


---------90:11----------
today and then you can do tomorrow


---------90:14----------
once tomorrow becomes today but more


---------90:16----------
often is of the future do you see that


---------90:18----------
just thinking that now yeah and and be


---------90:21----------
careful so Mitch I think you've got so


---------90:24----------
just a couple of things so there are


---------90:25----------
case reports of meditation induced


---------90:27----------
psychosis


---------90:27----------
so if feelings of you know like if the


---------90:32----------
feelings become dangerous or scary or


---------90:34----------
things like that you don't have to


---------90:35----------
meditate I'm very surprised that you had


---------90:37----------
this reaction because generally speaking


---------90:38----------
people don't have this reaction with


---------90:40----------
chanting


---------90:41----------
so oh yeah I felt I felt like rage


---------90:45----------
during it was more like anger just like


---------90:48----------
expressing itself in a way I couldn't


---------90:49----------
quite understand yeah man


---------90:51----------
so dude yeah you're like so it's not


---------90:58----------
gonna take you years to get better you


---------91:00----------
just have to keep working at it okay cuz


---------91:03----------
what is within you wants to come out so


---------91:05----------
[ __ ] bad and once it's out it's gonna


---------91:08----------
be out what you've just suppressed so


---------91:11----------
much it's just it's like you're it's


---------91:13----------
like leaking from the seams oh yeah man


---------91:16----------
sometimes I just randomly cry I don't


---------91:18----------
know why I just did crying so so we just


---------91:20----------
got to let so we need to give your brain


---------91:23----------
in your body a time and space to let


---------91:27----------
some of that emotion out and once your


---------91:29----------
body gets used to that it's gonna be


---------91:31----------
like almost like a dog that gets trained


---------91:33----------
to like pee in a particular place so I


---------91:36----------
would highly highly recommend that you


---------91:37----------
see a therapist because I think I'm


---------91:40----------
going to celebrate this process and it's


---------91:41----------
good that you're meditating and and all


---------91:43----------
this other stuff because well right now


---------91:45----------
wait there appease pretty expensive yeah


---------91:47----------
yeah so do you have insurance no I have


---------91:51----------
no insurance I like pretty much what I


---------91:53----------
have to do is just I need to stream and


---------91:54----------
make some money and then I can possibly


---------91:56----------
think about doing that but I have a lot


---------91:57----------
of uh like I said I gambled myself into


---------92:00----------
a financial hole where I probably can't


---------92:02----------
do that right now okay that makes sense


---------92:04----------
so okay so so we'll let me just think


---------92:10----------
about that for a second because I think


---------92:11----------
you could really benefit from therapy


---------92:12----------
yeah and and and so in the meantime I


---------92:16----------
think continue drinking your veggie


---------92:17----------
juices and stuff like that


---------92:18----------
how are your bowel movements well it


---------92:22----------
depends on my sleep schedule but if my


---------92:23----------
suit schedules consistent III [ __ ] very


---------92:25----------
well yeah I got some good shits okay


---------92:27----------
good um so another that shits are always


---------92:30----------
there always blueberry color because I


---------92:31----------
eat a lot of blueberries okay


---------92:33----------
okay yep so how are you feeling about


---------92:37----------
today I'm alright you know I mean I know


---------92:41----------
I was I'm good I'm feeling good about


---------92:46----------
today I there's I'm a little bit still


---------92:48----------
hungover from two days ago but other


---------92:50----------
than that I'm good you know I drank a


---------92:51----------
lot two days ago I don't even know why I


---------92:53----------
did I never drink either but


---------92:55----------
I was with my buddy and I just decided


---------92:57----------
to get hammered for some reason and that


---------92:58----------
never goes well with me I don't know why


---------93:00----------
drinking and me just don't really mix


---------93:02----------
well sure yeah so but I mean do you do


---------93:04----------
you think that so you were nervous when


---------93:06----------
we started how did you think we've been


---------93:08----------
talking now for almost two hours yeah


---------93:11----------
how do you how do you feel like this


---------93:12----------
went like are you were you comfortable


---------93:14----------
with what we talked about today oh yeah


---------93:16----------
yeah I felt I feel as though it went


---------93:18----------
good I feel as though we definitely we


---------93:21----------
definitely got somewhere hundred percent


---------93:23----------
I helped me understand that where did we


---------93:26----------
get we got I think you understand me a


---------93:29----------
little more and I think I understand


---------93:31----------
myself a little more and I think that's


---------93:33----------
what we did today what do you understand


---------93:35----------
about yourself that I'm always looking


---------93:40----------
forward or back I'm never really like


---------93:43----------
just in the now trying to accept


---------93:46----------
responsibility for what's going on right


---------93:48----------
now and instead I'm always living in


---------93:51----------
some somewhere else than right now and


---------93:55----------
and then I beat myself up over something


---------93:56----------
that either happened in the past or have


---------93:58----------
or I think will happen in the future and


---------94:00----------
it's of doing that I just need to live


---------94:04----------
in right now and do what I can to heal


---------94:08----------
or get better yeah wow I didn't realize


---------94:12----------
we talked about that but it seems like


---------94:14----------
that's new right chat yeah that's just


---------94:18----------
how I feel though I feel as though that


---------94:20----------
was the that was like what I learned you


---------94:22----------
know okay yeah no I think I think you've


---------94:24----------
learned a lot it's just news to me


---------94:26----------
because I think you really tied things


---------94:28----------
together I think you you tied together a


---------94:30----------
lot of the stuff that I thought we'd


---------94:32----------
covered some ground and I think you


---------94:33----------
really tied it together beautifully yeah


---------94:34----------
so I you know so I think you know we


---------94:37----------
talked a little bit about regret and


---------94:39----------
things like that as well and I think


---------94:40----------
regret is about the past anxieties about


---------94:43----------
the future and I I do believe Mitch that


---------94:46----------
you know I can understand why you think


---------94:48----------
that your unfixable or you're so broken


---------94:50----------
because you've lived a long time being


---------94:53----------
the same level of broken yeah so it can


---------94:57----------
logically you can conclude that this is


---------94:59----------
never gonna get better but I don't think


---------95:00----------
that that's the case I think you're


---------95:01----------
gonna get better


---------95:02----------
I think if yes if you work at it and and


---------95:05----------
you try to channel so I want you to


---------95:07----------
really think about this


---------95:08----------
I don't mean to make things emotional or


---------95:10----------
stuff like that right before we stop but


---------95:12----------
I want you to think about what your mom


---------95:14----------
would tell you when you're feeling down


---------95:17----------
on yourself because I think she's


---------95:20----------
already taught you like the kind of


---------95:22----------
dialog like the way that you need to


---------95:24----------
treat yourself is the way that she


---------95:25----------
treated you yeah and I don't know why


---------95:30----------
whatever you mentioned my mom I get it


---------95:32----------
[ __ ] sad it's like I get this like


---------95:33----------
feeling in my nose I got to sneeze it's


---------95:35----------
weird yeah because you have pent up


---------95:37----------
emotion about your mom and I also think


---------95:40----------
yeah anyway we can talk more but I I I


---------95:43----------
really think that she did it just an


---------95:46----------
amazing job of treating you with


---------95:48----------
unconditional love and that's actually


---------95:50----------
something you need to learn how to do


---------95:52----------
for yourself


---------95:56----------
yeah and if we're talk


---------95:59----------
about like why something doesn't healing


---------96:01----------
it's because you like generally speaking


---------96:03----------
unconditional love goes a long way


---------96:05----------
clearing res debuffs and if you have


---------96:08----------
never I've never felt that with anyone


---------96:12----------
else I don't know if it's possible yeah


---------96:16----------
with expect especially with the res


---------96:18----------
debuff I it's hard to like yeah love and


---------96:21----------
receive love you know absolutely I'm not


---------96:23----------
it's it's very difficult and it's


---------96:26----------
absolutely impossible and even though I


---------96:29----------
I know you you feel like you're old and


---------96:34----------
by twitch standards you maybe maybe the


---------96:36----------
old man average but you know 27 is not


---------96:41----------
battled I mean there's still a lot of


---------96:43----------
life left to live there's a lot of


---------96:45----------
opportunity for love and relationships


---------96:47----------
you're ever gonna have the same


---------96:48----------
relationship that you did with your mom


---------96:50----------
no but doesn't mean that you can't have


---------96:52----------
relationships that are in the same


---------96:55----------
ballpark and can still be wonderful and


---------96:59----------
can be filled with unconditional love


---------97:01----------
too yeah that's the questions before we


---------97:06----------
wrap up for the day I don't know


---------97:16----------
yeah I need a second hold oh okay


---------97:24----------
questions um nah man I'm Mitch Jones you


---------97:28----------
know we're good bro I'm good


---------97:29----------
everything's good okay good it's nice to


---------97:32----------
see you smile


---------97:33----------
is it a genuine smile yeah we're chillin


---------97:36----------
man um I'll be RIT are you Nabire right


---------97:40----------
now I'm good yeah I'm good I'm good I


---------97:43----------
just I'm good man I'm just [ __ ] high I


---------97:47----------
don't know like you talk about love I


---------97:49----------
don't know man it's like I think about


---------97:51----------
love and like people and I truly I don't


---------97:54----------
feel that way like yes something weird


---------97:56----------
just happened you were in a way better


---------97:59----------
place like 60 seconds ago so sorry for


---------98:01----------
disrupting your nuts quit no it's


---------98:03----------
totally cool it's not your fault it's me


---------98:05----------
it's like I you just made me think about


---------98:06----------
love and my mom and how she


---------98:08----------
unconditionally loved me and then I


---------98:09----------
realized that the world is will never be


---------98:12----------
that way again for me you know that's I


---------98:14----------
just had a moment of thinking like you


---------98:17----------
know I just don't I don't think I'll


---------98:18----------
ever find that again I truly hate I have


---------98:21----------
a lot of hate inside of me you know and


---------98:23----------
like it's like coming out right now and


---------98:25----------
um I apologize


---------98:27----------
no no don't apologize I I think it's it


---------98:29----------
I think that's why I was a little bit


---------98:30----------
hesitant because I think it is somewhat


---------98:33----------
of an open wound for you for me to bring


---------98:35----------
it up but I really am I really do


---------98:37----------
believe that you should learn how to


---------98:39----------
talk to yourself the way that she talked


---------98:40----------
to you and I think ya know was like


---------98:44----------
about when we talked about you know what


---------98:46----------
can you do in the moment that is like


---------98:48----------
the best example I can think of yeah


---------98:50----------
yeah and I honestly think I I'm


---------98:54----------
subconsciously recasting that spell


---------98:56----------
again


---------98:56----------
you know mmm like right now yeah it was


---------98:58----------
almost like time for a half a second and


---------99:00----------
then it's just yep like I felt


---------99:02----------
vulnerable and then I just put it back


---------99:04----------
up you know I mean yeah when you said


---------99:05----------
this weird like I've never I didn't


---------99:07----------
understand what the [ __ ] you were saying


---------99:08----------
you said yeah man I'm Mitch Jones we


---------99:10----------
good I was like what just that was you


---------99:12----------
recasting the spell yeah I think it was


---------99:14----------
yeah it was me putting the mask back on


---------99:16----------
like everything's fine you know like


---------99:17----------
yeah no no no no


---------99:19----------
you so he's so notice that like things


---------99:23----------
were actually fine before that yeah and


---------99:27----------
then things became like bad again and


---------99:30----------
then you put on the mask


---------99:32----------
but actually I say five minutes ago you


---------99:35----------
actually felt pretty good yeah I did


---------99:37----------
yeah I felt I felt yeah and now you can


---------99:40----------

---------100:20----------
goal of meditation to cultivate within


---------100:22----------
yourself the capacity to go back to this


---------100:25----------
place and suddenly if you're in this


---------100:28----------

---------100:40----------
so much yeah yeah thank you I appreciate


---------100:43----------

---------100:45----------
I guess that very uh nervous and then


---------100:48----------
under I just didn't understand what we


---------100:50----------
were gonna do but I feel like we did a


---------100:51----------
lot and I didn't yeah we did a lot for


---------100:54----------
sure I think is I don't know if you


---------100:56----------
would like to speak again but I believe


---------100:58----------
there's there's so much man I would just


---------101:01----------
I would just love to tell you my whole


---------101:02----------
story man like I don't know I got I got


---------101:06----------
lots of stuff that I could just lots of


---------101:08----------
stuff inside of me that I would love to


---------101:10----------
just get off my chest you know sure so


---------101:12----------
let's let's set up another time sorry my


---------101:18----------
voice is really going out but Mitchell


---------101:20----------
look I think you did a fantastic job


---------101:21----------
today really strong work and I'm really


---------101:24----------
I I don't think yeah I don't I think


---------101:29----------
you're deserving of respect for what


---------101:31----------
you've accomplished


---------101:32----------
not thank you thanks a lot to me I


---------101:35----------
hardly ever hear that and I really that


---------101:37----------
means a lot to me thank you yeah because


---------101:38----------
I think just because you've been living


---------101:40----------
life with a residue buff like that's


---------101:41----------
actually pretty [ __ ] amazing that


---------101:43----------
you're able to do anything at all and I


---------101:45----------
uh I think that you'll yeah so good luck


---------101:48----------
with everything dude and we'll set up


---------101:50----------
another time to talk okay yeah sounds


---------101:53----------
good man okay take care bye all right


---------101:55----------
have a great day you too okay so he's a


---------102:06----------
good guy man I and you know he's like


---------102:12----------
listen guys so I've talked to a couple


---------102:14----------
people now he like on twitch who feel


---------102:16----------
like they're unfixable so this is


---------102:19----------
probably just cuz I'm naive and


---------102:20----------
optimistic but like I just don't think


---------102:22----------
that's the case man he's like he can get


---------102:25----------
so much better so so fast so fast and


---------102:30----------
and it's I know that it can feel really


---------102:34----------
hopeless like because and it's not it's


---------102:36----------
not that it it's logical right that's


---------102:39----------
the really crazy thing is that it's


---------102:41----------
logical because if you have felt the


---------102:43----------
same way for like a decade he started


---------102:46----------
feeling bad he said around 2011 or 1 or


---------102:49----------
something like that like something had


---------102:50----------
happened with twitch a year ago a couple


---------102:52----------
years ago but you know I think it


---------102:54----------
started with him something changed like


---------102:55----------
something got busted when his mom was


---------102:57----------
diagnosed with cancer and then for the


---------103:00----------
next 10 years if you're a smart guy like


---------103:02----------
Mitch's you're gonna think that like


---------103:05----------
this is aren't not repairable because


---------103:07----------
for 10 years it hasn't gotten fixed so


---------103:09----------
it's completely logical and it happens


---------103:12----------
to be wrong so if you guys are feeling


---------103:14----------
hopeless about life it's not that you're


---------103:18----------
stupid it's it's you're actually like


---------103:20----------
you're smart and logical too it's it's


---------103:22----------
that because you don't see your life


---------103:24----------
moving forward so you're gonna you're a


---------103:26----------
smart person you're gonna conclude that


---------103:27----------
it's not gonna move forward but I just


---------103:29----------
don't accept that because I think that


---------103:31----------
life can be drastically different very


---------103:34----------
quickly in terms of getting help from


---------103:36----------
people in terms of just one person


---------103:38----------
entering your life in terms of learning


---------103:41----------
how to meditate in terms of learning how


---------103:42----------
to take care of yourself getting a pet


---------103:44----------
like I don't know what it is but it life


---------103:47----------
can become so drastically different with


---------103:50----------
such a subtle and what seems like a


---------103:53----------
small change like one person enter into


---------103:55----------
your life so in my case I was


---------103:57----------
directionless and hopeless and failing


---------103:59----------
out of college and playing too many


---------104:00----------
video games and stuff like that and then


---------104:01----------
like I met one of my teachers in India


---------104:03----------
which just like blew my mind it changed


---------104:05----------
my life completely and I felt like there


---------104:08----------
was someone who understood me and could


---------104:10----------
teach me how to understand myself and


---------104:11----------
then it's like it's like life is hard


---------104:14----------
when you're blind like it's hard to


---------104:16----------
drive a car if you can't see but you


---------104:19----------
would be amazed at what you're capable


---------104:20----------
of if you just take the blindfold off


---------104:23----------
right and then it's like wow this [ __ ]


---------104:24----------
like sight is Opie it's like the world


---------104:27----------
is being navigated everyone is driving


---------104:30----------
around is wearing a blindfold and then


---------104:33----------
there's some people who've discovered


---------104:34----------
how to take off the blindfold they're


---------104:35----------
like the [ __ ] so P like site is so P man


---------104:38----------
it's like I can drive around wherever I


---------104:40----------
want to it I don't have to bump into


---------104:41----------
anything ever and it seems so


---------104:44----------
mind-blowing ly different because that's


---------104:46----------
just the way that we live like we've


---------104:47----------
lost touch with understanding who we are


---------104:50----------
and how we function like that part of


---------104:53----------
knowledge which was I mean I use yoga


---------104:56----------
and that tradition because that's where


---------104:57----------
I learned it but there are traditions of


---------105:00----------
like not just psychology but Yoga is


---------105:02----------
about understanding yourself right so


---------105:04----------
like how do you as a human being work


---------105:06----------
like what are the ways in which your


---------105:08----------
mind works what is it what are the ways


---------105:10----------
in which the food that you put into your


---------105:11----------
body affects your mind


---------105:14----------
why can't I do the things that I want to


---------105:16----------
do like what are the things that if I


---------105:19----------
think about the equation of behavior and


---------105:21----------
engaging in a behavior what are all the


---------105:24----------
things that go into that equation we


---------105:25----------
don't know we don't we don't know but


---------105:28----------
you can learn you can study you can


---------105:29----------
become aware and progress can happen way


---------105:32----------
faster than you realize like the good


---------105:34----------
news guys is that it doesn't actually


---------105:36----------
take like a decade to you know start the


---------105:38----------
path of like transforming your life sure


---------105:41----------
like a decade later like you're gonna be


---------105:43----------
in a very different place and it takes


---------105:44----------
time right so I started when I'm 21 when


---------105:47----------
I was 21 and then started med school


---------105:50----------
when I was 27


---------105:51----------
so that was six years and that was just


---------105:54----------
starting med school and then it took me


---------105:55----------
another like eight years to really


---------105:57----------
become confident in Who I am so that was


---------105:59----------
what like 2018 2017 so like a 16 year


---------106:06----------
process for me but it starts getting way


---------106:08----------
better before it's not like at the end


---------106:09----------
of the 16 years you're like oh like now


---------106:11----------
everything's real like it starts getting


---------106:12----------
way better way before that so start I'm


---------106:15----------
37 okay so yeah you guys over 22 and you


---------106:21----------
can feel old as [ __ ] like I don't think


---------106:22----------
you guys get this like you're gonna be


---------106:24----------
around for 60 more years right


---------106:27----------
like if you're 22 and you feel old as


---------106:29----------
[ __ ] imagine where you were five years


---------106:32----------
ago


---------106:32----------
like gigantic right the difference


---------106:36----------
between the 17-year old you and the


---------106:38----------
22-year old you is like huge and so you


---------106:42----------
just give yourself that amount of time


---------106:43----------
like that's so much time five years is


---------106:46----------
such a long time and then you're just


---------106:48----------
gonna be 27 like you're not a like B 30


---------106:51----------
yet so so it you have a lot of time and


---------106:57----------
there's and it doesn't take that long to


---------106:59----------
start getting on the on the right track


---------107:01----------
again and with Mitch I'm hopeful like I


---------107:04----------
think you know I know he's supposed to


---------107:05----------
be the raid boss and everything but like


---------107:06----------

---------107:10----------

---------107:12----------

---------107:15----------

like and he wants to get better like


---------107:20----------

---------107:49----------

---------107:51----------
fighter and if he's like he's doing this


---------107:54----------
