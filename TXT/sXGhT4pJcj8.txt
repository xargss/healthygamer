---------00:00----------
part of the reason that we're excited


---------00:01----------
about sort of talking about imposter


---------00:02----------
syndrome today it's something that


---------00:03----------
affects a lot of content creators


---------00:05----------
but we recently launched uh like a beta


---------00:07----------
program for like people


---------00:08----------
like high potential and high performance


---------00:11----------
folks from our community


---------00:12----------
and it seems like imposter syndrome kind


---------00:14----------
of crops up


---------00:15----------
a lot in that group so for those of you


---------00:18----------
who don't know we have a


---------00:20----------
we're running like a beta program for


---------00:22----------
group coaching for people who are like


---------00:24----------
what we call hypos or hypers


---------00:26----------
so hypo stands for high potential if we


---------00:29----------
look at our community there's a


---------00:31----------
there's kind of like different themes


---------00:33----------
that different people need some people


---------00:34----------
need to learn self-compassion some


---------00:36----------
people need to learn


---------00:37----------
how to forgive some people need to learn


---------00:38----------
how to overcome procrastination


---------00:41----------
and so we have this high potential group


---------00:42----------
which there are about 13 spots left in


---------00:44----------
our beta


---------00:45----------
and the group is geared towards helping


---------00:47----------
people who are like sort of lacking


---------00:48----------
life purpose lacking discipline feeling


---------00:51----------
isolated feeling like they have low


---------00:52----------
self-esteem and confidence


---------00:54----------
like this is sort of geared towards the


---------00:56----------
student population so a lot of times


---------00:57----------
these people are actually like quite


---------00:59----------
functional and quite successful


---------01:00----------
academically and so we're trying to sort


---------01:03----------
of serve that population a little bit


---------01:04----------
better


---------01:05----------
so if you guys are interested y'all can


---------01:07----------
sign up we've got 13 spots left in our


---------01:08----------
beta


---------01:09----------
you know another thing that comes up we


---------01:11----------
see this a lot especially for like the


---------01:13----------
ivy league students and stuff that we


---------01:14----------
have in our community is that they've


---------01:15----------
got some imposter syndrome so hopefully


---------01:17----------
we'll dig into that try to understand it


---------01:19----------
a little bit better


---------01:24----------
how you doing man i'm doing good how are


---------01:26----------
you


---------01:27----------
i'm doing well i had a little bit of a


---------01:29----------
rough night my kid woke up randomly like


---------01:31----------
super early in the morning and came and


---------01:33----------
woke me up


---------01:34----------
so didn't get quite a full night's sleep


---------01:36----------
but part of being a parent you know


---------01:38----------
yeah how old is your kid i have a


---------01:42----------
five-year-old and a three-year-old oh


---------01:44----------
those are those are definitely waking up


---------01:47----------
early ages


---------01:48----------
yeah it's it's it can be fun


---------01:51----------
but yeah it's very very fun and and what


---------01:54----------
do you go by


---------01:56----------
uh usually just by ethan ethan okay um


---------01:59----------
yeah and yeah man so um


---------02:02----------
you want to talk about something in


---------02:04----------
particular today or


---------02:06----------
um i mean yes and no


---------02:10----------
like kind of down to just go with the


---------02:12----------
flow but


---------02:13----------
um yeah the main thing uh i guess was


---------02:16----------
just


---------02:17----------
uh imposter syndrome was a big thing


---------02:20----------
uh and uh yeah just sort of the


---------02:24----------
pressures of


---------02:25----------
being a content creator and a person


---------02:29----------
online absolutely i just took a month


---------02:32----------
off of youtube


---------02:34----------
uh which was really huge and sort of


---------02:36----------
like very


---------02:37----------
eye-opening for me um yeah so


---------02:41----------
you want to just actually start off by


---------02:42----------
telling us a little bit about where


---------02:44----------
people can find you and


---------02:45----------
and what kind of content you make yeah


---------02:48----------
uh so i do


---------02:49----------
mostly youtube and and streaming stuff


---------02:51----------
just crank game plays


---------02:52----------
everywhere i've been doing it for


---------02:56----------
it'll be nine years in august


---------02:59----------
i started when i was 15. um


---------03:03----------
yeah and uh it's been a it's been a


---------03:06----------
crazy little


---------03:07----------
little journey yeah sounds like a little


---------03:10----------
bit longer than a little journey


---------03:12----------
yeah yeah it's it's been a long time


---------03:15----------
which is weird because it both


---------03:16----------
seems like it hasn't i haven't been


---------03:18----------
doing this for a long time and i've been


---------03:20----------
doing it for


---------03:20----------
an eternity wow incredible


---------03:25----------
and so what what kind of um so crank


---------03:27----------
game plans i assume you play games


---------03:30----------
yeah mostly gaming stuff i'm trying to


---------03:32----------
now branch out a little bit more


---------03:34----------
uh just because again i've been doing it


---------03:36----------
for almost nine years


---------03:37----------
and i want to do something uh i want to


---------03:41----------
make more content that's a little more


---------03:43----------
like creatively


---------03:44----------
fulfilling um just because after doing


---------03:48----------
it for so long it's not as much of a


---------03:49----------
challenge anymore and i do really like


---------03:52----------
figuring things out and


---------03:54----------
you know being a little bit more


---------03:55----------
creative um


---------03:57----------
yeah and i just uh i just finished doing


---------04:00----------
a channel


---------04:01----------
with a friend of mine for a year we made


---------04:04----------
we made videos for a year


---------04:06----------
and then deleted everything um


---------04:09----------
and that was all we made a video every


---------04:11----------
single day


---------04:13----------
doing just like random [ __ ]


---------04:16----------
for most of the time


---------04:19----------
so it sort of adds i guess there's sort


---------04:21----------
of this timeless quality to youtube


---------04:23----------
videos


---------04:24----------
and um and and then you guys i guess


---------04:28----------
made it i guess


---------04:29----------
what would did you guys want to delete


---------04:31----------
everything like


---------04:32----------
yeah yeah that was frustration no that


---------04:35----------
was that was the goal from the beginning


---------04:37----------
the channel was called unis honest which


---------04:39----------
means one year in latin and so we were


---------04:42----------
every video started with a timer of how


---------04:45----------
much time was left


---------04:46----------
uh and so we did a year's worth of


---------04:49----------
videos and then we ended it with


---------04:51----------
a 12 hour live stream where at the end


---------04:53----------
of the live stream we deleted the


---------04:55----------
channel


---------04:55----------
while we were streaming from it and wow


---------04:58----------
everything went away


---------05:00----------
that sounds like quite creatively


---------05:02----------
fulfilling


---------05:03----------
yeah it was it was really really awesome


---------05:06----------
um it was super stressful but


---------05:09----------
uh it was like definitely


---------05:12----------
an awakening i think for both of us


---------05:14----------
being like oh wow like


---------05:16----------
doing this kind of stuff is really


---------05:17----------
really fun and also we don't just have


---------05:20----------
to do


---------05:20----------
gaming stuff like we can do other things


---------05:23----------
that sounds really great man i'm


---------05:26----------
you know it's interesting because you


---------05:27----------
were saying you want to creatively


---------05:28----------
branch out but that sounds like i've


---------05:29----------
never heard of anyone doing anything


---------05:31----------
like that before


---------05:33----------
yeah i think that's why i want to branch


---------05:35----------
out more just because that was so


---------05:37----------
fulfilling


---------05:37----------
in every single day was something


---------05:39----------
different um


---------05:41----------
and so yeah it just it helped


---------05:44----------
my brain a lot actually


---------05:48----------
can i think for a second yeah


---------05:53----------
so ethan i'm noticing sort of like an


---------05:55----------
interesting branch point already


---------05:57----------
whereas i i know so i know a lot of


---------05:59----------
times like people come on here and


---------06:01----------
and the idea is that we're going to talk


---------06:02----------
about something negative like imposter


---------06:04----------
syndrome and bad emotions


---------06:06----------
and burnout but um honestly like half


---------06:10----------
the work that i do is


---------06:11----------
is literally has nothing to do with the


---------06:12----------
negative it's sort of like bridging


---------06:14----------
people from


---------06:15----------
let's say like the journey from being


---------06:17----------
like depressed and then like one day


---------06:19----------
people will come into my office and then


---------06:20----------
we'll sort of have this conversation


---------06:22----------
about


---------06:22----------
you're not depressed anymore you're just


---------06:24----------
unhappy


---------06:25----------
and that there's a difference oh thanks


---------06:27----------
son


---------06:28----------
um and there's a difference between


---------06:31----------
being unhappy


---------06:32----------
and being depressed and so when i think


---------06:35----------
a little bit about like you know you


---------06:36----------
said you took a month off and that was


---------06:38----------
you know it sounds like it was


---------06:39----------
rejuvenating and maybe there's some


---------06:40----------
amount of imposter syndrome


---------06:42----------
there's also this sort of like personal


---------06:44----------
development arc


---------06:45----------
or like personal growth arc finding


---------06:47----------
fulfillment what is the nature of


---------06:49----------
suffering


---------06:50----------
what is the nature of happiness what is


---------06:52----------
the nature of contentment


---------06:53----------
when when we sort of have those kinds of


---------06:55----------
conversations we can still draw a little


---------06:57----------
bit


---------06:57----------
on science so we can talk about like


---------06:59----------
maslow or there's a psychologist named


---------07:01----------
eric erickson


---------07:03----------
so you know in the west we have a lot of


---------07:04----------
this stuff but we also can draw a lot on


---------07:07----------
kind of eastern principles of


---------07:08----------
spirituality


---------07:09----------
stoicism um almost take a slightly more


---------07:13----------
philosophical approach


---------07:15----------
and and it's odd ethan but like when i'm


---------07:17----------
sitting across from you


---------07:18----------
there's a part of me that just kind of


---------07:20----------
like feels like maybe that's the


---------07:22----------
direction we need to go at some point in


---------07:24----------
the conversation


---------07:25----------
yeah yeah for anything


---------07:32----------
that's the other thing is like i don't


---------07:34----------
even really know what i want to talk


---------07:36----------
about


---------07:36----------
necessarily um which is also like


---------07:40----------
another thing that i


---------07:41----------
have a hard time with like my adhd is


---------07:44----------
pretty bad uh and so like


---------07:47----------
having having conversations and me


---------07:50----------
having coherent thoughts


---------07:51----------
is also something that i struggle with


---------07:53----------
um


---------07:54----------
yeah so if i ever get lost in the


---------07:56----------
conversation


---------07:58----------
um that's why yeah so


---------08:03----------
okay so why don't can you just start


---------08:05----------
with telling us a little bit about like


---------08:06----------
how you started on


---------08:07----------
on youtube and what kind of inspired you


---------08:10----------
to


---------08:11----------
create content uh yeah it was basically


---------08:14----------
boredom um me and my best friend from


---------08:17----------
back home


---------08:18----------
one summer in august of 2012


---------08:22----------
uh we were just bored one night and we


---------08:25----------
had been watching a bunch of different


---------08:26----------
youtubers it was


---------08:27----------
mainly like pewdiepie and the game


---------08:29----------
grumps and we were like


---------08:31----------
huh like you have a computer and we like


---------08:35----------
messing around on camera like let's just


---------08:38----------
do this because


---------08:39----------
they do it and we like video games so


---------08:41----------
why not


---------08:42----------
uh and that's that's how it started and


---------08:44----------
then eventually i just went off on my


---------08:46----------
own and


---------08:46----------
and made videos and um yeah it mainly


---------08:50----------
stemmed from


---------08:51----------
boredom and then it grew into this


---------08:52----------
passion um


---------08:54----------
in this thing that i really really love


---------08:56----------
to do and i had been making


---------08:58----------
random videos uh since i was a kid like


---------09:01----------
just like home videos


---------09:02----------
my brother and then once youtube came


---------09:04----------
out just like random youtube videos here


---------09:06----------
and there with some friends


---------09:08----------
um and that's what i wanted to do when i


---------09:10----------
was a kid


---------09:11----------
not specifically be a youtuber but i


---------09:13----------
wanted to be an


---------09:14----------
entertainer in some sense like i wanted


---------09:16----------
to be an actor for a really long time


---------09:18----------
um and then i found youtube and it was


---------09:20----------
like oh it's sort of like this new


---------09:22----------
wave of entertainment or whatever


---------09:24----------
absolutely and then it just kind of


---------09:26----------
happened


---------09:27----------
and so what was it that appealed to you


---------09:29----------
about being an actor or entertainer


---------09:32----------
uh probably at the time when i was a kid


---------09:35----------
it was being the center


---------09:36----------
of attention i was always just pining


---------09:39----------
for people's attention


---------09:40----------
all the time um and that's something


---------09:43----------
that i'm even


---------09:44----------
like really insecure about because


---------09:46----------
looking back


---------09:47----------
at like home videos and stuff like that


---------09:50----------
or even my older videos from when i


---------09:51----------
first started


---------09:52----------
i feel super embarrassed by them and


---------09:54----------
like i'll show them to people because i


---------09:56----------
know that's


---------09:57----------
part of it like that's part of like hey


---------09:59----------
look where i came from


---------10:01----------
blah blah but it is kind of embarrassing


---------10:04----------
uh


---------10:05----------
just seeing that kid and being like oh


---------10:07----------
you're trying so hard


---------10:09----------
what's embarrassing about that um


---------10:12----------
i think it's i think it's that thing of


---------10:14----------
like oh you're trying


---------10:15----------
so hard to like be the center of


---------10:17----------
attention and


---------10:19----------
you're being like too much


---------10:22----------
um and like too bombastic and crazy and


---------10:26----------
stuff like that


---------10:27----------
um and that's that's also kind of what i


---------10:30----------
was being told


---------10:31----------
when i was a kid too sure not


---------10:33----------
necessarily by


---------10:34----------
my family sometimes by my family um


---------10:38----------
but like i didn't do well in school and


---------10:40----------
my teachers


---------10:41----------
were always like hey like you need to


---------10:43----------
settle down


---------10:45----------
um blah blah and it was also back in a


---------10:47----------
time where


---------10:48----------
um you know adhd was still not really


---------10:52----------
understood that much sure um and it was


---------10:54----------
just like oh you


---------10:56----------
don't have an actual mental thing going


---------10:57----------
on you just have too much energy and


---------10:59----------
your disruption to the class


---------11:01----------
um yeah you know ethan it's it's so


---------11:05----------
it's sometimes so sad like how


---------11:09----------
kids with adhd like we place value


---------11:11----------
judgments on them


---------11:12----------
right like you're being a bad kid yeah


---------11:15----------
and


---------11:15----------
and and it's it's actually quite


---------11:17----------
devastating like i i've seen this a lot


---------11:19----------
where it's like


---------11:20----------
a lot of people with adhd just feel they


---------11:23----------
carry around


---------11:24----------
so much like shame from early in their


---------11:26----------
life that they don't even understand


---------11:27----------
because it's it's been so normal to them


---------11:30----------
yeah you know that they're they're being


---------11:31----------
told to function in an environment that


---------11:33----------
their brain just isn't suited for


---------11:36----------
um and and it can be really rough so i'm


---------11:39----------
sorry you were in that


---------11:40----------
situation and it sounds like you know


---------11:43----------
people weren't happy with you


---------11:45----------
yeah no and that's that's something that


---------11:47----------
i've struggled with


---------11:48----------
for a really long time not only like


---------11:51----------
the thought of like oh i was a bad kid


---------11:54----------
and i know that i wasn't


---------11:55----------
a bad kid or anything um but i've always


---------11:58----------
felt stupid


---------11:59----------
like my entire life um and that's


---------12:02----------
something that i'd still struggle with


---------12:03----------
now


---------12:05----------
and i think it really comes from that


---------12:07----------
and come


---------12:08----------
comes from me being in school and not


---------12:11----------
being able to learn


---------12:12----------
the way that everybody else learned um


---------12:15----------
and so i just thought i was stupid


---------12:17----------
because i just didn't


---------12:18----------
i just didn't get it and you know


---------12:20----------
obviously like i went to a public school


---------12:22----------
so it was


---------12:23----------
you know 170 or 140 kids in my grade and


---------12:28----------
so it's not like the teachers can


---------12:30----------
individually teach kids in the way that


---------12:33----------
they learn


---------12:33----------
like it's just not realistic but yeah my


---------12:36----------
whole life i've sort of dealt with that


---------12:37----------
with


---------12:38----------
and i know that i'm not stupid but


---------12:40----------
that's always been a thing in the back


---------12:41----------
of my mind like i feel dumb


---------12:43----------
all the time okay


---------12:48----------
which i think also contributes to my


---------12:50----------
imposters intro


---------12:51----------
sure so we can talk about


---------12:54----------
hmm


---------12:59----------
so i i'm finding so many different forks


---------13:01----------
in the road ethan


---------13:02----------
and i don't know what direction to take


---------13:04----------
things so i'm gonna need your help


---------13:06----------
yeah and we can go we can go anywhere


---------13:09----------
so i think it's actually incredibly


---------13:11----------
insightful for you to say


---------13:12----------
i know i'm not stupid but i carry this


---------13:16----------
feeling around


---------13:18----------
and there's a part of me that's like


---------13:20----------
wants to just


---------13:21----------
explain to you or like ask you like how


---------13:23----------
does that work


---------13:25----------
and then even explain to you like this


---------13:27----------
is where we go into a little bit more of


---------13:28----------
like teaching mode


---------13:30----------
where you know i i can i can because a


---------13:32----------
lot of people don't understand that it


---------13:34----------
can be really confusing that like i know


---------13:35----------
i'm not stupid


---------13:36----------
and it's kind of weird right because


---------13:38----------
even when you show home videos to people


---------13:40----------
you're kind of owning that insecurity


---------13:42----------
you're kind of saying i'm not going to


---------13:43----------
let the insecurity like i'm i actually


---------13:44----------
am confident in myself i'm confident


---------13:46----------
with how far i've come and so showing


---------13:48----------
people like


---------13:49----------
home videos of the blunder years if you


---------13:52----------
really think about it is actually a sign


---------13:53----------
of like confidence


---------13:55----------
and at the same time you feel insecure


---------13:58----------
doing it even though there's a part of


---------13:59----------
you that's like yeah this is where i


---------14:01----------
came from i should be proud of it like


---------14:02----------
i've come a long way like


---------14:03----------
wow like i really didn't you know know


---------14:05----------
much back then


---------14:07----------
and so it's almost like you have these


---------14:09----------
two opposite poles that exist within you


---------14:11----------
at the same time does that make sense


---------14:14----------
yeah


---------14:15----------
um and and i think that there's some


---------14:17----------
value to be gained a little bit about


---------14:19----------
you know understanding like how how does


---------14:21----------
that work because like no one teaches us


---------14:23----------
like


---------14:24----------
why does my mind do these things yeah um


---------14:27----------
and if you want to we can kind of go


---------14:28----------
down that route


---------14:29----------
uh we can also talk a little bit about


---------14:31----------
imposter syndrome which i think it has


---------14:32----------
maybe something to do with that but but


---------14:34----------
i think there's more to it than that


---------14:36----------
usually


---------14:37----------
um or what we can do is you know i can


---------14:40----------
ask you questions about how you felt


---------14:41----------
stupid and then


---------14:42----------
you can end up becoming emotional on


---------14:44----------
stream


---------14:46----------
if that's the right because that


---------14:47----------
sometimes that's what people are looking


---------14:48----------
for they're looking for like


---------14:50----------
emotional catharsis as opposed to


---------14:51----------
teaching and yeah and it really


---------14:54----------
it's like what are you in the mood for


---------14:55----------
bro i'm


---------14:57----------
i'm down for anything um i'll cry on


---------15:00----------
stream if you want me to


---------15:02----------
it's not about what i want man it's


---------15:04----------
about what you want uh


---------15:06----------
let's let's explore that that first path


---------15:08----------
a little bit


---------15:09----------
okay so how do you understand


---------15:14----------
no like okay i'm gonna ask you a


---------15:15----------
question okay are you stupid


---------15:18----------
no i'm not stupid why do you feel that


---------15:20----------
way


---------15:22----------
um oh now that's a good question


---------15:30----------
um i mean it's just something that i


---------15:34----------
know


---------15:34----------
i know i'm not stupid um i


---------15:38----------
i i'm aware that my brain just works in


---------15:42----------
in different ways than other than other


---------15:44----------
people's do


---------15:45----------
yeah and when i get into the i think i


---------15:48----------
know i'm not stupid because i've proved


---------15:50----------
to myself that i'm not stupid


---------15:52----------
because in the right environment i can


---------15:54----------
thrive


---------15:55----------
um and that even happened in school


---------15:57----------
where


---------15:58----------
specifically um in physics


---------16:01----------
i did really well in that class because


---------16:04----------
we did a lot of hands-on stuff


---------16:06----------
where like the teacher showed actual


---------16:08----------
examples of the way that things worked


---------16:10----------
and it was like oh like this is this is


---------16:13----------
something that


---------16:14----------
that's being shown right in front of me


---------16:16----------
and also we're doing like hands-on stuff


---------16:18----------
and so like i could figure out how it


---------16:20----------
worked


---------16:20----------
and i did really well in that class


---------16:22----------
because i was in the correct environment


---------16:25----------
and so there have been a lot of things


---------16:27----------
like that where it's like oh i know i'm


---------16:29----------
not stupid because i


---------16:30----------
i'm actually doing well at this thing i


---------16:32----------
just learn differently


---------16:34----------
yeah so so now i'm gonna i'm gonna you


---------16:37----------
know


---------16:37----------
this is gonna be tough for you ethan so


---------16:39----------
i'm gonna press you okay because i think


---------16:40----------
you're not stupid at all


---------16:41----------
i think you're incredibly insightful i


---------16:43----------
think you're a smart guy


---------16:45----------
so i'm gonna ask you hard questions is


---------16:47----------
that okay


---------16:48----------
yeah are you feeling anxious if i say


---------16:50----------
something like that


---------16:52----------
no i i don't feel anxious about it at


---------16:54----------
all i'm down for anything


---------16:55----------
okay so so if you have proven to


---------16:58----------
yourself


---------16:58----------
that you're not stupid why do you still


---------17:02----------
sometimes feel stupid


---------17:04----------
um i think i feel that way because


---------17:08----------
most of the time i'm not in


---------17:12----------
that kind of environment where i do feel


---------17:16----------
where i feel comfortable like a lot of


---------17:18----------
times if


---------17:19----------
if there's like a large discussion going


---------17:20----------
on in a room i'll just stay completely


---------17:22----------
silent


---------17:23----------
because i


---------17:27----------
i'm afraid of well there's a few things


---------17:31----------
that i'm afraid of


---------17:32----------
one like i don't want to like embarrass


---------17:34----------
myself and say something that like


---------17:36----------
i don't know anything about um but two


---------17:39----------
it's another thing of like with my adhd


---------17:41----------
like it's


---------17:42----------
so hard for me to follow along


---------17:43----------
especially in group settings


---------17:45----------
and so i just like hang back and i just


---------17:48----------
am sort of like a fly on the wall


---------17:50----------
um i forget your original question yep


---------17:54----------
no i think it was so that's also


---------17:56----------
incredibly insightful right so i i don't


---------17:57----------
think that that was as anything with


---------17:59----------
adhd


---------18:00----------
i think i asked you a question and your


---------18:01----------
mind went to a place where you were like


---------18:03----------
oh


---------18:04----------
when i'm in group settings i asked you


---------18:06----------
like why do you sometimes feel stupid


---------18:08----------
and then you started talking about group


---------18:09----------
settings


---------18:10----------
and then you also talked about how


---------18:11----------
you've essentially adapted


---------18:13----------
to survive in group settings yeah does


---------18:16----------
that make sense like that's how i


---------18:17----------
interpreted what you said


---------18:18----------
but then the question still remains in a


---------18:20----------
group setting do you feel stupid


---------18:23----------
um a lot of times i do yeah because


---------18:26----------
i i feel like i don't have anything to


---------18:29----------
contribute


---------18:30----------
most of the time uh because i'm afraid


---------18:33----------
and like anxious of


---------18:35----------
saying something that i don't know uh


---------18:39----------
about or you know not following along


---------18:42----------
correctly whatever so


---------18:43----------
let's be a little bit precise here okay


---------18:45----------
so you're saying that you feel


---------18:47----------
afraid or anxious because you don't have


---------18:49----------
something to contribute


---------18:51----------
yeah okay so i'm gonna toss a hypothesis


---------18:54----------
to you that it's the other way around


---------18:57----------
okay it is your fear and anxiety and


---------19:00----------
insecurity


---------19:01----------
that causes you to conclude that you


---------19:04----------
don't have anything to contribute


---------19:06----------
what do you think about that that makes


---------19:08----------
a lot of sense


---------19:09----------
it's interesting right because we say


---------19:11----------
like oh i have nothing worth saying


---------19:13----------
therefore i am afraid or anxious or i


---------19:15----------
shouldn't speak up but it's actually the


---------19:16----------
other way around it's really tricky


---------19:18----------
subtle yeah because our mind always


---------19:20----------
makes us think that it's logical


---------19:23----------
but i actually think the root of that is


---------19:24----------
your insecurity i guess that you have a


---------19:26----------
lot to contribute


---------19:28----------
i don't think that you randomly become


---------19:30----------
stupid in groups of people


---------19:31----------
now there may be like a certain amount


---------19:33----------
of adhd where you're not able to attend


---------19:35----------
to what everyone is saying like that's


---------19:36----------
totally fine


---------19:38----------
um but i i think that you probably have


---------19:40----------
a lot to contribute but it's that your


---------19:41----------
insecurity becomes


---------19:43----------
active in that situation what do you


---------19:45----------
think about that


---------19:47----------
yeah that that makes a lot of sense and


---------19:50----------
that


---------19:50----------
that's something that i've sort of


---------19:52----------
realized in the past like


---------19:54----------
year or so is that um and i think


---------19:59----------
me being on youtube has actually made it


---------20:01----------
a lot worse


---------20:02----------
but i've realized that i'm way more of


---------20:04----------
an insecure person than


---------20:06----------
i thought i was um and there's like a


---------20:09----------
lot that i


---------20:12----------
that i like hold back and there's a lot


---------20:14----------
that i


---------20:15----------
like i don't uh open up to


---------20:19----------
a ton of people uh i think like


---------20:23----------
for me to like truly open up and talk


---------20:25----------
about stuff


---------20:26----------
um that i am insecure about like that's


---------20:29----------
a really hard thing for me to do


---------20:31----------
and like a lot of times i will just hold


---------20:34----------
back


---------20:34----------
because yeah because i'm insecure about


---------20:36----------
it


---------20:40----------
okay ethan i'm gonna need a minute can i


---------20:42----------
have a minute oh yeah i just love what


---------20:44----------
like oh man okay i think i think i'm


---------20:46----------
finally getting a sense of maybe how we


---------20:48----------
can take this conversation today okay


---------20:50----------
i just need a second to make sure we can


---------20:52----------
you know i can try to tie this together


---------20:54----------
okay


---------20:55----------
cool so


---------21:05----------
okay


---------21:10----------
i'm excited to get into it oh buddy


---------21:14----------
it's gonna be walking a tightrope


---------21:16----------
[Laughter]


---------21:21----------
oh yeah


---------21:30----------
okay here's my proposal


---------21:33----------
now the downside is going to be that i


---------21:35----------
may be talking more than you so you got


---------21:36----------
to let me know if that rubs you the


---------21:38----------
wrong way


---------21:38----------
okay we're going to start with your


---------21:41----------
insecurity we're going to start by


---------21:43----------
understanding what is like


---------21:44----------
like so you know when we say the


---------21:46----------
insecurity activates in a particular


---------21:48----------
environment


---------21:48----------
it's going to start very very simple


---------21:50----------
with principles of not quite psychology


---------21:52----------
this is really more of like yoga and


---------21:54----------
meditation


---------21:55----------
about the way that the mind works so


---------21:57----------
what i want to


---------21:58----------
hypothesize to you and we'll explain


---------22:00----------
this in more detail is that you're like


---------22:02----------
a confident secure person generally


---------22:04----------
speaking okay


---------22:06----------
but that in some circumstances your mind


---------22:09----------
activates insecurity.exe


---------22:12----------
and then like you become like this


---------22:14----------
person that you used to be


---------22:17----------
and like you know even though you're


---------22:19----------
successful and people like you have


---------22:20----------
these like


---------22:21----------
you know really risky broad creative


---------22:23----------
pursuits like i've


---------22:24----------
you are the first content creator i've


---------22:26----------
ever ever heard of


---------22:27----------
that intentionally deletes a year of


---------22:30----------
their life


---------22:31----------
and what they put in it is so incredibly


---------22:34----------
wild and courageous


---------22:36----------
it's so authentic and it's so ballsy


---------22:38----------
right that's like look at the


---------22:40----------
scrotum on that guy so we know that


---------22:43----------
there's this huge like we know that


---------22:45----------
there's this you who's like grown a lot


---------22:47----------
the problem is that like you have this


---------22:49----------
thing that you carry with you


---------22:52----------
this insecurity that like is always at


---------22:53----------
the back of your mind you're stupid and


---------22:55----------
sometimes it becomes more active


---------22:57----------
and when it becomes active it shapes


---------22:59----------
your thoughts it says oh like i


---------23:01----------
shouldn't speak up here


---------23:02----------
so we're going to start by sort of


---------23:03----------
explaining how that works in the mind


---------23:05----------
the second thing that we're going to do


---------23:07----------
is segue that into youtube and imposter


---------23:10----------
syndrome


---------23:10----------
so once we understand what that


---------23:12----------
insecurity thing is


---------23:14----------
we're gonna take a look at sort of like


---------23:16----------
science and social media and things like


---------23:18----------
that


---------23:18----------
and see what youtube and social media


---------23:20----------
does to this basic psychology you have


---------23:23----------
and how that results in imposter


---------23:24----------
syndrome


---------23:25----------
then we're going to talk a little bit


---------23:26----------
about how opening up is difficult


---------23:28----------
and the crux here and i'm you know i'm


---------23:30----------
really building a house of cards that


---------23:32----------
could come


---------23:33----------
tumbling down okay so bear with me so


---------23:36----------
this is where like we're going to talk a


---------23:37----------
little bit about like the more that


---------23:39----------
that essentially youtube inflates


---------23:44----------
both your success and your insecurity


---------23:46----------
because they both rise together which i


---------23:48----------
know is weird


---------23:49----------
but that's really what we see that makes


---------23:51----------
opening up difficult


---------23:52----------
because like as you start to become a


---------23:54----------
youtuber


---------23:55----------
and you start to see that there's two


---------23:57----------
ethans right there's the ethan who's


---------23:59----------
like a badass who's been


---------24:01----------
youtubing for nine years and is


---------24:02----------
confident and knows that they're they're


---------24:04----------
worth their weight in gold and then


---------24:06----------
there's like this other ethan that's


---------24:08----------
like well what if everyone just thinks


---------24:09----------
i'm an idiot and if i open my mouth


---------24:10----------
they're gonna think i'm stupid and it's


---------24:11----------
all gonna come crumbling down


---------24:13----------
yeah and and it's that it's that


---------24:16----------
dichotomy which makes it hard for you to


---------24:18----------
open up because like what if they see


---------24:20----------
the other one


---------24:21----------
what if it actually is that ethan like


---------24:23----------
then what


---------24:25----------
and so then what happens is you start to


---------24:27----------
like be inauthentic you start to hide


---------24:30----------
yourself


---------24:31----------
you start to you know like you're doing


---------24:34----------
the


---------24:34----------
like when you were a little kid and you


---------24:36----------
wanted to be loud and you wanted people


---------24:38----------
to like see who you are i don't think


---------24:39----------
that's like


---------24:40----------
quite you know attention is one thing i


---------24:42----------
think you have another way to think


---------24:44----------
about is i think you genuinely have


---------24:45----------
something that you want to share with


---------24:46----------
the world


---------24:48----------
and so the more you it makes opening up


---------24:51----------
difficult


---------24:51----------
the more you're closing yourself off


---------24:53----------
with like what you show to the world


---------24:56----------
and this is where we get to the personal


---------24:57----------
growth part which is like we sort of end


---------24:59----------
the journey with sort of understanding


---------25:01----------
that like


---------25:02----------
if you want to grow as a person and if


---------25:05----------
you want the courage to take those


---------25:06----------
creative pursuits


---------25:08----------
you have to show people the ugly side of


---------25:10----------
you you have to show


---------25:11----------
be willing to show everything that you


---------25:14----------
have to like the world


---------25:16----------
and if you can do that then i think


---------25:17----------
you're going to find co like you're


---------25:18----------
going to start creating more content


---------25:20----------
that's creatively fulfilling


---------25:21----------
yeah how does that sound this sounds


---------25:25----------
like a


---------25:25----------
a great plan okay all right so let's


---------25:28----------
start with the insecurity okay


---------25:30----------
so let's start by understanding this


---------25:32----------
kind of thing so


---------25:33----------
we're going to start with the insecurity


---------25:35----------
so


---------25:37----------
when you feel so does it kind of make


---------25:39----------
sense


---------25:40----------
that the insecurity is like a program


---------25:42----------
that activates in your mind and kind of


---------25:44----------
takes over your thought process


---------25:47----------
yeah so can you give me an example of


---------25:50----------
like what


---------25:51----------
situation like can you give us like


---------25:53----------
share a specific


---------25:54----------
example of like when you felt like you


---------25:56----------
know stupid.exe was activating


---------26:03----------
there's so many examples


---------26:06----------
um yeah i mean


---------26:12----------
like


---------26:16----------
i like any conversation honestly


---------26:19----------
um there's so many times where


---------26:22----------
where it happens um you know if somebody


---------26:26----------
is uh


---------26:29----------
i don't know basically if somebody's


---------26:31----------
talking about anything other than


---------26:33----------
like youtube stuff or


---------26:37----------
um like cameras or gymnastics


---------26:41----------
i used to be a gymnast anything other


---------26:43----------
than that


---------26:44----------
i it's pretty much like out of my


---------26:46----------
wheelhouse from being


---------26:47----------
if i'm being honest and so there's a lot


---------26:49----------
of times where i feel like


---------26:50----------
i i can't weigh in on stuff and to give


---------26:53----------
you


---------26:54----------
some history like i was


---------26:58----------
uh i was a gymnast from when i was eight


---------27:00----------
until 17.


---------27:02----------
i worked out five days a week three and


---------27:04----------
a half to four hours a day


---------27:06----------
um and then when i was 15 i started


---------27:09----------
youtube


---------27:10----------
um and so splitting my my time between


---------27:13----------
youtube


---------27:14----------
school and gymnastics and i


---------27:17----------
didn't really have any social life at


---------27:18----------
all um and then


---------27:20----------
i got really shitty grades and my mom


---------27:22----------
was like you have to stop gymnastics or


---------27:24----------
school


---------27:24----------
or sorry gymnastics or youtube um and so


---------27:27----------
i chose to continue youtube


---------27:29----------
and so can you tell me about that


---------27:31----------
conversation


---------27:33----------
yeah um it was


---------27:37----------
my sophomore year


---------27:40----------
i think um yeah end of sophomore year


---------27:44----------
my mom found out that i got


---------27:48----------
two d's on my finals i got like


---------27:51----------
i got like a b multiple c's and two d's


---------27:55----------
on my finals um and she like freaked out


---------27:58----------
about it


---------27:59----------
um because basically all i cared about


---------28:02----------
was youtube and


---------28:03----------
and gymnastics i didn't care about


---------28:04----------
school which


---------28:06----------
looking back like why should i have


---------28:08----------
cared about school because


---------28:09----------
it wasn't it was an environment that


---------28:11----------
made me feel uncomfortable


---------28:13----------
in so many different ways um and so she


---------28:16----------
she got really upset about it and she


---------28:18----------
was like okay


---------28:20----------
you have to take school more seriously


---------28:22----------
you can't be doing all this stuff you're


---------28:24----------
juggling way too much


---------28:26----------
you have to pick two of these one of


---------28:27----------
them has to be school


---------28:29----------
um and how did you feel


---------28:32----------
that was the first time i ever had a


---------28:34----------
panic attack um


---------28:36----------
i like completely broke down


---------28:39----------
like i was like like


---------28:45----------
it was really really bad like i was like


---------28:48----------
screaming like


---------28:49----------
screaming crying uh because i just


---------28:51----------
didn't know how to handle that because


---------28:53----------
that


---------28:54----------
uh i think it was a couple things one


---------28:57----------
because i loved both of these things


---------28:59----------
so much but in the back of my mind i


---------29:01----------
knew that i was


---------29:02----------
about to choose youtube and gymnastics


---------29:04----------
was


---------29:05----------
like this huge thing like it


---------29:08----------
really shaped who i am as a person


---------29:12----------
and knowing that i was about to give


---------29:13----------
that up just like completely


---------29:15----------
like shattered me


---------29:24----------
okay


---------29:26----------
so what what was so devastating about


---------29:30----------
because i'm going to use the word


---------29:31----------
sentence yes it sounds like sentencing


---------29:34----------
to me


---------29:35----------
yeah like i'm envisioning you like


---------29:37----------
almost


---------29:38----------
being like in a courtroom where there's


---------29:40----------
like your mom with a gavel and she's


---------29:41----------
like


---------29:42----------
yeah that's kind of what it was like


---------29:45----------
which child will you execute yeah


---------29:51----------
what was that what was what


---------29:55----------
caused the panic attack for lack of a


---------29:57----------
better term i know it's kind of a weird


---------29:58----------
question because


---------29:59----------
i i think that you just phrased it


---------30:01----------
really well it was like i'm


---------30:02----------
killing one of i'm killing myself off


---------30:05----------
like this version of myself


---------30:06----------
and i have to choose which person to put


---------30:10----------
the


---------30:10----------
to point the gun at and like that


---------30:14----------
that was something especially at that


---------30:16----------
age too


---------30:17----------
like i just didn't know how to


---------30:21----------
how to handle that um


---------30:25----------
and i like looking back i


---------30:29----------
i solved that problem um


---------30:32----------
really well i think i was like okay well


---------30:35----------
let's look at my future like


---------30:37----------
if you're going to be like a career


---------30:39----------
gymnast like


---------30:40----------
your career kind of stops when you're


---------30:42----------
like 25


---------30:43----------
26 because your body can't handle it


---------30:45----------
anymore so really like


---------30:47----------
where can you go from there after that


---------30:49----------
like maybe you get some sponsorships but


---------30:50----------
then you kind of like become a coach and


---------30:52----------
that's kind of it


---------30:53----------
and then i was like but with this other


---------30:54----------
thing like maybe i could go more into


---------30:56----------
film


---------30:56----------
and like blah blah so i was like okay


---------30:59----------
this one's better for my future


---------31:01----------
okay beautifully set okay so this is


---------31:03----------
what oh crap


---------31:04----------
so i would love ethan boy man this is


---------31:07----------
one of those interviews where i really


---------31:08----------
wish we had like


---------31:09----------
five hours because there's so much to


---------31:11----------
dig into here


---------31:12----------
because i think there's there's more to


---------31:14----------
it so i'm gonna just like jump to the


---------31:15----------
punch line here and the punch line is a


---------31:16----------
hypothesis because we don't really know


---------31:18----------
but


---------31:18----------
i think there's another element right


---------31:20----------
it's not just which


---------31:22----------
where do you point the gun it's also


---------31:24----------
like


---------31:25----------
what you are like who is your mom


---------31:28----------
so so what i i want you to think about


---------31:30----------
for a second


---------31:31----------
is what is your mom


---------31:34----------
so your mom is asking you to point the


---------31:37----------
gun


---------31:38----------
but she's also asking you to not only


---------31:41----------
kill off a part of yourself


---------31:43----------
what is she asking you to become


---------31:48----------
yeah so she wants me to become a good


---------31:51----------
student


---------31:52----------
is at the end of the day that's what she


---------31:54----------
wants you to become


---------31:55----------
so she's asking you to become a student


---------31:58----------
what is she


---------31:59----------
sentencing you to


---------32:02----------
i mean


---------32:05----------
she's


---------32:10----------
she's basically asking me to like choose


---------32:13----------
the version of myself


---------32:17----------
to pick the version of myself that i


---------32:19----------
want to be i guess


---------32:20----------
and then nope she's not


---------32:23----------
she's not no she's asking you to make


---------32:27----------
the choice that you don't want to be


---------32:30----------
she sent it because are you going to be


---------32:31----------
a good student


---------32:33----------
no i still was not a good student after


---------32:35----------
that right and i think you understood


---------32:37----------
that


---------32:38----------
and so it's not just like getting rid of


---------32:40----------
gymnastics or youtube it's like


---------32:42----------
forcing you to like here's like so


---------32:44----------
there's two ethan's right there's the


---------32:46----------
ethan who can be proud of what they


---------32:47----------
accomplish


---------32:49----------
there's like the youtube ethan and the


---------32:51----------
gymnast ethan


---------32:52----------
and i like those are those are good


---------32:54----------
ethans


---------32:55----------
yeah tell me about ethan the student


---------32:59----------
i mean i just didn't care


---------33:03----------
at all so there was


---------33:06----------
there was a few reasons why i didn't


---------33:08----------
care so number one reason was because


---------33:11----------
youtube and gymnastics was just


---------33:13----------
everything


---------33:14----------
um that's where my passion was i wasn't


---------33:17----------
passionate about anything in school like


---------33:19----------
i wasn't learning anything that i was


---------33:21----------
interested in


---------33:22----------
um and then the the environment that i


---------33:24----------
was in


---------33:26----------
was i went to like the best


---------33:29----------
public school in the area or whatever


---------33:32----------
and so they


---------33:34----------
they were really proud of the people


---------33:37----------
that went to their school and it was


---------33:38----------
always


---------33:39----------
like oh like all 99.9


---------33:42----------
of our students going to college and


---------33:44----------
like blah blah blah and like


---------33:47----------
being in that environment and knowing


---------33:49----------
that so many people


---------33:51----------
around me were these like grade a


---------33:54----------
students


---------33:55----------
and like we're going on to these big


---------33:57----------
universities


---------33:58----------
and then and again me being like


---------34:02----------
well [ __ ] like i feel stupid all the


---------34:05----------
time and i'm getting bad grades and i'm


---------34:08----------
like i i didn't feel like and i i think


---------34:11----------
that this is true for a lot of kids


---------34:13----------
like i didn't feel like i was a part of


---------34:15----------
the school in a lot of ways because


---------34:18----------
i i didn't do anything at school like i


---------34:21----------
wasn't a part of any clubs i didn't do


---------34:23----------
any sports through the school


---------34:25----------
i went to school when i had to


---------34:28----------
i left immediately i didn't hang out


---------34:30----------
with anybody


---------34:32----------
because i didn't have time because i was


---------34:34----------
too busy doing


---------34:35----------
youtube and gymnastics um which


---------34:38----------
also looking back is like i was a really


---------34:42----------
really


---------34:42----------
passionate and dedicated kid to what i


---------34:45----------
cared about


---------34:46----------
um and i think that in the environment


---------34:49----------
that i was in like that was kind of hard


---------34:51----------
to find


---------34:52----------
actually um and i remember


---------34:55----------
one of the proudest moments i think


---------34:58----------
was a couple years after i


---------35:02----------
i graduated and i was doing youtube and


---------35:04----------
i was working full-time


---------35:06----------
as a manager at a restaurant and i was


---------35:08----------
making two videos every day


---------35:10----------
and my dad told me that he's never met


---------35:12----------
somebody that works as hard as i do


---------35:14----------
and like that that like


---------35:19----------
that made me just like explode


---------35:22----------
um what does that mean just like


---------35:26----------
hearing that hearing that


---------35:30----------
one at all after i just kind of felt


---------35:33----------
like i was a [ __ ] up for a really long


---------35:34----------
time


---------35:35----------
because i wasn't traditionally


---------35:38----------
doing well because i got shitty grades


---------35:41----------
and i didn't participate in school


---------35:43----------
and hearing somebody be like seeing


---------35:46----------
somebody


---------35:46----------
recognize how hard i worked um


---------35:50----------
and especially that being my dad was


---------35:52----------
just like really


---------35:53----------
really huge and my dad and i have a


---------35:55----------
really great relationship and


---------35:56----------
he's someone that i really really really


---------35:58----------
look up to and so hearing that come from


---------36:00----------
him


---------36:02----------
just it was really really big for me


---------36:06----------
big in what way


---------36:10----------
just really validating that like


---------36:13----------
the the time that i had spent working as


---------36:16----------
hard as i did because i


---------36:17----------
at the time i was working full time at


---------36:20----------
the restaurant so 40 plus hours a week


---------36:22----------
i was waking up at like 4 30 or 5


---------36:26----------
a.m every day to record videos before


---------36:28----------
work


---------36:29----------
and then i would get back it was very


---------36:31----------
unhealthy at the time but i would get


---------36:33----------
back from work


---------36:34----------
uh and then be editing until like


---------36:37----------
midnight or one


---------36:38----------
and i would do that like almost every


---------36:40----------
day for a really long time


---------36:41----------
and so just having somebody validate


---------36:43----------
that and say like hey i recognize how


---------36:45----------
hard you're working but


---------36:46----------
also on top of that like you are one of


---------36:49----------
the hardest working people


---------36:51----------
that i know and it was also i don't


---------36:54----------
remember if he actually did say it but i


---------36:56----------
mean


---------36:56----------
it kind of goes along with what he said


---------36:59----------
anyway it was just like


---------37:01----------
having somebody say i'm proud of you was


---------37:04----------
just like really


---------37:05----------
really big for me and i don't know


---------37:09----------
um i think everybody loves that having


---------37:12----------
somebody validate


---------37:13----------
you know what they're doing and have


---------37:15----------
having somebody say hey i'm proud of you


---------37:17----------
don't uh ethan don't do the mistake of


---------37:20----------
you know


---------37:23----------
i didn't like it when you compared


---------37:24----------
yourself to everyone there i think don't


---------37:26----------
don't cheapen your experience and how


---------37:28----------
significant it was for you by just


---------37:30----------
saying


---------37:31----------
you know everyone likes to be told


---------37:33----------
they're proud like i don't think that's


---------37:34----------
what happened there you didn't just get


---------37:36----------
told you were proud


---------37:37----------
so here's here's how i i'd understand


---------37:39----------
your situation


---------37:41----------
so like your mom like was tell like like


---------37:44----------
so there's two ethans right there's the


---------37:46----------
ethan who's like passionate


---------37:47----------
and like good at stuff and then there's


---------37:50----------
the ethernet ethan who's like sort of a


---------37:51----------
failure


---------37:53----------
and you say that you didn't care about


---------37:55----------
school and that's why you did bad


---------37:57----------
that's another thing where i would


---------37:58----------
encourage you to see if it's the other


---------38:00----------
way around


---------38:02----------
because it's really hard to be a kid who


---------38:04----------
feels like you're stupid


---------38:06----------
who's surrounded by and you're giving us


---------38:07----------
a lot here right so like let's just


---------38:09----------
think about


---------38:10----------
i'm just gonna tell you what i heard


---------38:11----------
like you're a kid who knows like you


---------38:13----------
don't know you've got adhd but like


---------38:15----------
you just know that this is the best


---------38:16----------
public school and that people are going


---------38:19----------
to go off to college and they get all


---------38:20----------
a's and then there's you


---------38:22----------
and what's wrong with you ethan why


---------38:24----------
can't you get good grades


---------38:27----------
because you're stupid you're a stupid


---------38:29----------
kid


---------38:31----------
and that's and so like it's hard to be


---------38:33----------
invested in something that you don't


---------38:35----------
believe that you can do


---------38:37----------
yeah i don't think that the care like i


---------38:39----------
don't think you did bad because you


---------38:40----------
didn't care i think you probably when


---------38:42----------
you were five and six and seven


---------38:43----------
you tried really really hard and your


---------38:45----------
mind did not comply


---------38:48----------
yeah and so to pre like it's it's one


---------38:50----------
thing to


---------38:51----------
like so it's almost protective to stop


---------38:53----------
caring because if you did care about


---------38:55----------
school


---------38:57----------
what would that mean for you


---------39:01----------
i think that that if i did care like


---------39:05----------
that probably would have [ __ ] me up


---------39:06----------
way more absolutely


---------39:08----------
right so not caring is not the reason


---------39:11----------
you didn't do good at school


---------39:13----------
not caring is the adaptation for not


---------39:15----------
doing good at school


---------39:17----------
and then here is your mom and she's


---------39:18----------
saying here's the gun you pick


---------39:21----------
which one goes but it's more than that


---------39:24----------
because it's not that you're just


---------39:25----------
getting rid of one it's that she's


---------39:28----------
forcing you to be stupid ethan she's


---------39:31----------
like here's this kid


---------39:33----------
that is like bright and talented and is


---------39:36----------
a good gymnast and is doing well on


---------39:38----------
youtube


---------39:39----------
and is passionate about this stuff and


---------39:40----------
she's like i'm gonna take one of those


---------39:41----------
away


---------39:42----------
and i'm gonna force you to be crappy


---------39:44----------
ethan 50 of the time


---------39:46----------
and now we get to the story with your


---------39:48----------
dad because it's not just like oh like


---------39:50----------
everyone enjoys being validated oh yeah


---------39:52----------
my dad tells me i'm proud makes me feel


---------39:53----------
good


---------39:54----------
like i completely agree like you know


---------39:55----------
everyone feels good but i think it's


---------39:57----------
actually like it's so much like it


---------39:58----------
brings me to tears man like


---------40:00----------
you know like that kid is like you know


---------40:02----------
they're struggling hard right like it's


---------40:04----------
it hasn't been easy for you


---------40:06----------
and to have like your dad recognize that


---------40:08----------
like you're not dumb like it's just


---------40:10----------
you're like working so hard it's like


---------40:13----------
immense


---------40:14----------
it becomes incredibly powerful it's not


---------40:16----------
just being told sorry i'm getting myself


---------40:21----------
i'm just thinking about it i was gonna


---------40:22----------
be the one crying


---------40:25----------
i told you i was gonna talk a lot today


---------40:26----------
so i'm gonna do the crying too


---------40:30----------
um but i i think i think it's like it


---------40:32----------
feels really significant to me because


---------40:34----------
it's this moment where you were seen


---------40:37----------
right it's this moment where you were


---------40:38----------
like appreciated and this is going to


---------40:40----------
all tie back in the imposter syndrome


---------40:42----------
and like what i was saying at the


---------40:43----------
beginning about not beginning but


---------40:45----------
earlier where like


---------40:46----------
i think what you need to do to create is


---------40:48----------
to like let people see you


---------40:51----------
you know like you need to give people


---------40:52----------
the chance to like do what your dad like


---------40:54----------
you need to put yourself out there right


---------40:56----------
and let people see you


---------40:58----------
um and then in terms of imposter


---------40:59----------
syndrome there's also something very


---------41:00----------
clear about you know being in this


---------41:01----------
straight a school or whatever and being


---------41:03----------
the one kid with d's and whatnot so like


---------41:05----------
maybe you felt like an imposter's in


---------41:06----------
there


---------41:06----------
i think there are a couple of themes


---------41:07----------
which we can touch on and does that make


---------41:10----------
sense


---------41:11----------
yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense


---------41:15----------
um


---------41:18----------
yeah okay i'm just thinking about it


---------41:24----------
yeah why don't you just take a second


---------41:25----------
and then let me know when we're ready to


---------41:26----------
move on or if you have questions or want


---------41:28----------
to try to recap


---------41:31----------
i it's it's very interesting


---------41:35----------
thinking about it in the in the way that


---------41:37----------
you presented it


---------41:38----------
of like my mom forcing me to


---------41:42----------
to kill off a version of myself and like


---------41:46----------
i also recognized that it was like


---------41:48----------
my mom having to make a really hard


---------41:50----------
decision too


---------41:51----------
sure because like because i it was bad


---------41:54----------
for me like to be juggling all of


---------41:56----------
all of that stuff and like i looking


---------41:59----------
back


---------42:00----------
i don't think like my mom was the bad


---------42:02----------
guy or anything like that but


---------42:04----------
but it was it really was her being like


---------42:07----------
all right


---------42:08----------
like i almost in a way wish


---------42:11----------
she would have just said okay no no more


---------42:13----------
gymnastics or


---------42:14----------
no more youtube because i feel like


---------42:18----------
not having a choice in that


---------42:22----------
circumstance like


---------42:26----------
me having having the weight of the


---------42:27----------
decision not be on me


---------42:30----------
i think would have been so much easier


---------42:32----------
and like i


---------42:33----------
and again i think that's why i freaked


---------42:35----------
out was like


---------42:36----------
i have to make this choice


---------42:39----------
yeah absolutely right so when you talk


---------42:42----------
about a panic attack i think it like


---------42:44----------
it's not


---------42:44----------
surprising because i think that like in


---------42:48----------
that moment your mind


---------42:49----------
understood like what future


---------42:52----------
like there's a door the door to your


---------42:54----------
bright future is being closed and you're


---------42:57----------
being like


---------42:58----------
put on this path of like academia


---------43:02----------
and like failure and like it makes


---------43:04----------
perfect sense that you had a panic


---------43:05----------
attack


---------43:07----------
and i also want to say like as a


---------43:08----------
disclaimer here so sometimes when we


---------43:10----------
talk about parents


---------43:12----------
we make it seem like they're evil i


---------43:13----------
don't think your mom was evil or bad by


---------43:15----------
any means


---------43:16----------
i think like parents do what they think


---------43:18----------
is best for their kids


---------43:20----------
and sometimes it's inevitable but like


---------43:22----------
we're gonna psychologically traumatize


---------43:24----------
our children no matter how much we love


---------43:25----------
them and that's just the nature of life


---------43:26----------
it's the nature of our mind seriously


---------43:28----------
i'm not kidding yeah


---------43:29----------
yeah you know and and so the parents did


---------43:31----------
the best that they could and they also


---------43:32----------
i'm sure that your mom


---------43:34----------
did a lot of wonderful stuff for you too


---------43:35----------
and yeah so you know i just want to be


---------43:37----------
clear that i don't think she was a bad


---------43:38----------
person or anything it's just like


---------43:40----------
you know her kid is doing too much and


---------43:41----------
they're failing out of school and like


---------43:43----------
no one know like you know you being a


---------43:44----------
youtuber wasn't a thing back then


---------43:46----------
yeah so it's not like there's actually


---------43:48----------
you know so your mom was just doing what


---------43:49----------
she thought was best


---------43:52----------
and sometimes it's the little things


---------43:53----------
that can actually be like


---------43:54----------
psychologically very difficult


---------43:57----------
so now i'm going to


---------44:00----------
we're going to go to can we move on


---------44:02----------
phase two okay


---------44:04----------
so we talked a little bit about feelings


---------44:07----------
so here's ethan okay


---------44:10----------
and then so here's like there's like


---------44:13----------
this whole


---------44:14----------
complex of gymnast oh [ __ ]


---------44:17----------
so you have to excuse me so i i don't


---------44:19----------
know if you know this but i'm a


---------44:20----------
physician


---------44:22----------
which means that i have terrible


---------44:23----------
handwriting


---------44:25----------
um all right okay so there's this is the


---------44:28----------
ethan right so


---------44:29----------
and then there's school so here here you


---------44:31----------
are at the age of sophomore year and


---------44:33----------
then your mom has this conversation then


---------44:34----------
you have this panic attack


---------44:36----------
yeah okay so


---------44:39----------
and then what is like what are you


---------44:41----------
feeling in the panic attack do you


---------44:43----------
remember


---------44:45----------
um yeah it was the first time that i'd


---------44:47----------
ever felt like overwhelming emotions


---------44:49----------
like


---------44:50----------
like that yeah i remember i i grabbed on


---------44:54----------
to


---------44:55----------
a lamp that we had that


---------44:58----------
had like three three sort of prongs that


---------45:02----------
that went out to hold the uh the


---------45:04----------
lampshade and i just grabbed that and i


---------45:07----------
just


---------45:07----------
squeezed it as hard as i could and it


---------45:10----------
was


---------45:10----------
metal um and like that's all i could do


---------45:13----------
was just like squeeze the lamp while i


---------45:15----------
was lying on the floor um


---------45:19----------
okay and then that's kind of all i


---------45:21----------
remember yep


---------45:22----------
and then you you remember like do you


---------45:24----------
remember when you kind of reconstituted


---------45:28----------
like you said like you made this


---------45:29----------
calculated decision and you kind of


---------45:31----------
calmed down


---------45:32----------
quickly was that the same day or next


---------45:34----------
day or what


---------45:36----------
it was the same day it was over the


---------45:38----------
course of like a couple hours i think


---------45:40----------
of like actually calming down because i


---------45:43----------
just kind of like laid on the floor and


---------45:44----------
like hyperventilated for a while and i


---------45:46----------
remember my mom


---------45:47----------
uh my dad was at work and she called my


---------45:50----------
dad and she was in the other room but i


---------45:52----------
could hear her and she was like hey i


---------45:54----------
need you to come home


---------45:56----------
like i just had this conversation with


---------45:57----------
ethan and he's freaking out and like


---------45:59----------
it's really


---------46:00----------
really bad and i need you to come home


---------46:02----------
okay and i remember


---------46:04----------
like by the time that my dad got home


---------46:07----------
i was like winding down i was still


---------46:10----------
probably like


---------46:11----------
hyperventilating and like sobbing a


---------46:12----------
little bit but like the main part of it


---------46:14----------
was


---------46:15----------
was sort of over yeah so as you start to


---------46:17----------
rationalize


---------46:18----------
where does that emotion go


---------46:22----------
[Music]


---------46:26----------
um


---------46:31----------
i mean it sort of went into


---------46:34----------
um it was more like analytical in me


---------46:38----------
being like


---------46:39----------
okay here here are my options and


---------46:43----------
just sort of like in my brain sort of


---------46:44----------
lining everything out of like


---------46:46----------
i was kind of doing like like the doctor


---------46:50----------
strange


---------46:50----------
like infinite universe kind of thing


---------46:53----------
where i was just like all right


---------46:54----------
how how many circumstances can i make in


---------46:57----------
my


---------46:57----------
brain with the options that i have and


---------47:00----------
what is the best


---------47:01----------
outcome okay i'm going to choose this


---------47:02----------
outcome um i was sort of doing that kind


---------47:05----------
of thing


---------47:06----------
and so i i think rationalizing it


---------47:08----------
actually probably helped me calm


---------47:10----------
down a lot as soon as i started to think


---------47:12----------
about it that way


---------47:13----------
sure makes perfect sense okay so i'm


---------47:15----------
going to give you a quick scenario


---------47:17----------
normally i run through this in a little


---------47:18----------
bit more detail but we're just going to


---------47:20----------
get to that


---------47:21----------
so like this is the example that i like


---------47:22----------
to use so let's say i'm walking down the


---------47:24----------
street with my five-year-old


---------47:25----------
and she sees a dog and she tries to pet


---------47:28----------
it


---------47:29----------
and the dog bites her what happens to


---------47:32----------
her


---------47:32----------
emotionally uh


---------47:35----------
she's gonna be traumatized and she's


---------47:37----------
probably gonna cry


---------47:39----------
yep right so she's crying and then i


---------47:41----------
kind of calm her down a little bit


---------47:44----------
and then i ask her if she wants ice


---------47:45----------
cream


---------47:47----------
right so i distract her hey do you want


---------47:50----------
ice cream


---------47:51----------
and she's like yes definitely five


---------47:54----------
minutes later


---------47:55----------
she's eating ice cream and she's happily


---------47:57----------
talking to me about


---------47:58----------
princesses make sense yeah


---------48:02----------
crying emotion is gone right what


---------48:05----------
happens the next time she sees a dog


---------48:08----------
she's gonna probably get afraid that


---------48:10----------
she's gonna get bitten again


---------48:12----------
okay so where is that emotion coming


---------48:15----------
from


---------48:17----------
it's coming from the trauma that she had


---------48:20----------
with the dog


---------48:21----------
perfect right so now i want you to


---------48:24----------
understand this


---------48:25----------
so now why is that emotion so i want you


---------48:28----------
to think about it this way so this


---------48:30----------
this emotion gets stored into our


---------48:32----------
unconscious mind


---------48:36----------
does that make sense and then


---------48:39----------
what causes the emotion to like cross


---------48:42----------
over


---------48:42----------
into the conscious mind uh


---------48:47----------
by seeing the thing that made her feel


---------48:49----------
that feeling


---------48:50----------
very good so let's think about


---------48:55----------
um like a triggering environment


---------48:58----------
does that make sense yep


---------49:02----------
and so like i know this sounds kind of


---------49:03----------
weird i i keep on insisting on using


---------49:05----------
this example but


---------49:07----------
if you go to let's say a hotel let's say


---------49:09----------
you're traveling ethan


---------49:10----------
and you walk into the public restroom


---------49:13----------
of the hotel and how do you know


---------49:17----------
how to operate a toilet that you've


---------49:19----------
never seen before


---------49:21----------
because most toilets are the same


---------49:24----------
exactly so where does that knowledge


---------49:26----------
about the toilet come from


---------49:28----------
my past absolutely and what causes you


---------49:32----------
like so


---------49:32----------
so i know this sounds kind of weird but


---------49:34----------
like are you thinking about flushing the


---------49:35----------
toilet before you see the toilet


---------49:38----------
no right so so like there's this very


---------49:41----------
simple principle of the mind


---------49:43----------
that it scans and this is something that


---------49:45----------
the intellect does or the buddhi


---------49:48----------
it scans your environment and it kind of


---------49:50----------
says like okay what is the appropriate


---------49:52----------
experience that we need to activate to


---------49:55----------
help us deal with the situation


---------49:57----------
does that make sense yeah works for


---------50:00----------
toilets


---------50:00----------
works for trauma


---------50:03----------
it's the same thing it's a very


---------50:05----------
fundamental idea of mind


---------50:06----------
so then the question becomes you know so


---------50:08----------
now you say to yourself so now we're


---------50:10----------
going to kind of like reconceptualize


---------50:12----------
this a little bit okay so you say to


---------50:14----------
yourself i know i'm smart


---------50:18----------
right damn it


---------50:22----------
can i do this or okay looks like i just


---------50:24----------
can't do this okay whatever


---------50:26----------
um so you know you're smart and yet


---------50:29----------
there are times where you feel stupid


---------50:31----------
so how does that work so we have


---------50:34----------
our manus which is our emotional mind


---------50:37----------
our ahamkara which is our ego


---------50:39----------
and our buddhi which is our intellect


---------50:41----------
and there are certain


---------50:42----------
environments so you essentially have a


---------50:45----------
stored emotion of stupidness


---------50:49----------
and like it like even though it's not


---------50:51----------
active most of the time


---------50:53----------
like you know you're smart like you know


---------50:55----------
like logically like your intellect has


---------50:57----------
concluded that you're a worthwhile dude


---------50:59----------
but essentially you have this thing


---------51:01----------
called a some scar


---------51:03----------
which is essentially that balled up


---------51:05----------
undigested and emotional energy of


---------51:07----------
feeling stupid


---------51:08----------
and there are certain times in your life


---------51:11----------
where your brain is scanning the


---------51:13----------
environment like when you're with a


---------51:14----------
group of people and it's like oh [ __ ]


---------51:17----------
yeah this is when we're stupid because


---------51:20----------
if i had to guess


---------51:21----------
i'm sure we could find lots of instances


---------51:24----------
of you sitting in a classroom with lots


---------51:26----------
of people talking about stuff that you


---------51:28----------
may not know what they're talking about


---------51:29----------
and the teacher calls on you and you


---------51:31----------
feel really really dumb


---------51:33----------
yeah and like when you feel really


---------51:37----------
really dumb


---------51:37----------
like where does that feeling go


---------51:41----------
how long do you feel dumb for when


---------51:43----------
you're in that classroom


---------51:46----------
uh i mean that


---------51:50----------
i think that that feeling was just kind


---------51:53----------
of always there


---------51:54----------
like the the dread of being called on


---------51:58----------
because i was like nine times out of ten


---------52:01----------
i'm not gonna know what we're talking


---------52:02----------
about and


---------52:04----------
i'm i'm not going to be able to


---------52:06----------
contribute so it just kind of was


---------52:08----------
constantly there let me ask you


---------52:12----------
ethan when you are in a group of people


---------52:15----------
who are talking about something does


---------52:17----------
your mind tell you


---------52:19----------
i don't really know what we're talking


---------52:20----------
about i'm not going to be able to


---------52:22----------
contribute


---------52:25----------
um yeah it kind of does a lot of so like


---------52:29----------
it's weird right it's like the same damn


---------52:31----------
thoughts that you used to have


---------52:33----------
in the classroom you now have in groups


---------52:36----------
of people


---------52:37----------
is that why i still have nightmares


---------52:40----------
about uh


---------52:41----------
high school so yes yes


---------52:44----------
yes absolutely so nightmares


---------52:48----------
so so now we get to okay great great


---------52:50----------
point because we have


---------52:51----------
this is a deviation that we haven't


---------52:53----------
talked about so this is what i want you


---------52:54----------
to understand okay


---------52:56----------
so in our emotional mind you have this


---------52:58----------
experience of sadness


---------53:00----------
feeling stupid actually let's call it


---------53:02----------
feeling stupid not sadness okay


---------53:04----------
and then what happens is that like your


---------53:06----------
mind distracts yourself in some way


---------53:08----------
or you use rationalization and then


---------53:12----------
this thing goes dormant okay let's say


---------53:14----------
this is the line of your


---------53:16----------
conscious mind okay and it gets


---------53:20----------
stored as this thing called a sumscar


---------53:21----------
which is like this ball of


---------53:23----------
undigested emotional energy which then


---------53:27----------
gets recalled


---------53:28----------
at particular times you with me so far


---------53:32----------
yeah okay and so now the question is


---------53:34----------
like then how do we ever get rid of this


---------53:38----------
right because like like it's kind of


---------53:40----------
interesting so this is where


---------53:41----------
you know now if you were to if you were


---------53:44----------
to be in an experience where you felt


---------53:46----------
stupid


---------53:47----------
what would you do with like what would


---------53:49----------
you do


---------53:50----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but we've


---------53:52----------
talked about when you were 15 and when


---------53:54----------
you were like


---------53:55----------
eight but like now if something bad


---------53:57----------
happens to you like what's something bad


---------53:59----------
that's happened to you recently


---------54:00----------
can you do you mind sharing anything it


---------54:02----------
can be anything


---------54:04----------
uh anything


---------54:07----------
bad it could be even a tiny thing like


---------54:10----------
any negative emotion that you've had


---------54:11----------
recently


---------54:13----------
uh i mean does being sick count


---------54:16----------
not really um


---------54:20----------
i'm tr i'm trying to think of of any


---------54:24----------
and yeah i know i'm kind of putting you


---------54:25----------
on the spot no it's totally fine


---------54:28----------
i just fell apart but oh uh i was


---------54:32----------
i was moving out of my my old apartment


---------54:36----------
and uh because i just moved kind of


---------54:39----------
recently


---------54:40----------
and i still had a bunch of [ __ ] there


---------54:41----------
that i had to deal with


---------54:43----------
and it was just super super stressful


---------54:45----------
for me to have to like


---------54:47----------
go back there and deal with stuff that


---------54:49----------
was still there


---------54:50----------
and and what did you do with those


---------54:51----------
emotions i know it sounds like kind of a


---------54:53----------
weird question because we don't even


---------54:54----------
realize what we do with the emotions but


---------54:56----------
like


---------54:59----------
um i


---------55:02----------
i tend to just kind of like


---------55:06----------
on to them and not not like i'm going to


---------55:08----------
be upset


---------55:09----------
all day but i just kind of like it's


---------55:12----------
almost


---------55:12----------
like i'm absorbing them and just like


---------55:15----------
yeah okay that's okay so we're gonna


---------55:18----------
have to teach you a different


---------55:20----------
way yeah okay so so here's here's what


---------55:23----------
tends to happen as we get older so if we


---------55:25----------
look at like


---------55:25----------
the psychiatry and psychology right most


---------55:28----------
of the time like the money's in


---------55:29----------
childhood


---------55:30----------
and the reason for that is because as we


---------55:32----------
grow older our ability


---------55:34----------
to process emotions improves like if i'm


---------55:37----------
walking down the street and i get bit by


---------55:38----------
a dog like what kind of thoughts do you


---------55:40----------
like what's my initial reaction


---------55:43----------
uh i mean at least for me if i get bit


---------55:46----------
by


---------55:47----------
i'm probably just gonna get like upset


---------55:49----------
and like angry


---------55:50----------
yep and then what are you rather than


---------55:52----------
rather than cry


---------55:54----------
sure and then what happens is


---------55:57----------
walk away i guess sure right so like


---------56:00----------
like you kind of walk away and


---------56:01----------
okay maybe this is what we need to work


---------56:03----------
on a little bit so like this is also


---------56:04----------
where like you know most adults will do


---------56:06----------
some amount of processing right like so


---------56:08----------
in the same way so we can talk about


---------56:10----------
this in terms of stupidity actually we


---------56:11----------
have a good example of this


---------56:12----------
where you sort of rationally look at


---------56:14----------
your situation


---------56:15----------
and you kind of say like oh actually i'm


---------56:17----------
not stupid i just feel stupid right now


---------56:19----------
but like i actually have a lot that i'm


---------56:21----------
you know i contribute to people et


---------56:22----------
cetera et cetera does that sort of make


---------56:24----------
sense


---------56:25----------
so there's this process of like actually


---------56:27----------
digesting or metabolizing emotions so


---------56:30----------
this is what psychotherapy is


---------56:31----------
so when you go and you talk to a


---------56:33----------
counselor and you like talk about your


---------56:34----------
feelings it's kind of weird like


---------56:36----------
how does that help people like what is


---------56:39----------
the mechanism through which


---------56:40----------
talking about the bad stuff in your life


---------56:43----------
actually like


---------56:44----------
helps you in any way shape or form


---------56:46----------
because a lot of times people will


---------56:47----------
think about the bad things in their life


---------56:49----------
it doesn't help them at all it just


---------56:50----------
makes them feel worse


---------56:51----------
so there's actually this process of


---------56:54----------
metabolizing and digesting your negative


---------56:56----------
emotions


---------56:57----------
and the more that you do that the more


---------57:01----------
um you're kind of free of those some


---------57:04----------
scars


---------57:05----------
so if i get bit by a dog and i kind of


---------57:06----------
like process it


---------57:09----------
then like i'm not i'm not going to get


---------57:11----------
triggered by the dog anymore


---------57:14----------
and i'm sure if we like tunnel down


---------57:15----------
enough i can ask you enough open-ended


---------57:17----------
questions that you know it's hard to


---------57:18----------
lead you in the right direction but i'm


---------57:20----------
sure if you look in your life


---------57:21----------
you'll see that there are times where


---------57:22----------
you felt emotionally bad and you like


---------57:24----------
did the work of talking it through with


---------57:26----------
a friend or you like went for a long


---------57:29----------
hike


---------57:29----------
or like you did something right you


---------57:31----------
didn't just shove it aside you didn't


---------57:33----------
stick it under the rug


---------57:34----------
but you actually spent some time


---------57:36----------
grieving so grieving is another good


---------57:38----------
example of this emotional processing


---------57:39----------
thing


---------57:40----------
where like some people don't grieve and


---------57:42----------
then they stay stuck


---------57:44----------
does that make sense because that ball


---------57:46----------
of emotional energy that some scar is


---------57:47----------
just living down there


---------57:49----------
and grieving is how we like get over it


---------57:51----------
psychotherapy is how we get over it


---------57:54----------
okay so


---------57:57----------
let me just think about where i wanted


---------57:58----------
to go with this any questions about this


---------57:59----------
does this make sense


---------58:01----------
yeah no it makes a lot of sense and it's


---------58:04----------
making me think about like how


---------58:06----------
i because specifically for anger


---------58:10----------
when i get angry i've learned how to


---------58:12----------
deal with that and i don't i


---------58:13----------
rarely ever get angry but like when i


---------58:16----------
get really


---------58:17----------
mad or frustrated now i'll go and work


---------58:19----------
out or i'll go running


---------58:20----------
because it's just like a way for me to


---------58:22----------
get a lot of energy out really quick


---------58:24----------
and that's sort of how i process that


---------58:27----------
but


---------58:27----------
i don't have that for any other emotion


---------58:30----------
yep that's very


---------58:31----------
very well said so the other thing


---------58:32----------
beautiful ethan so good okay


---------58:34----------
so a couple of important principles your


---------58:36----------
body and your mind are connected


---------58:38----------
right so there's like there's like a


---------58:40----------
pseudoscientific


---------58:41----------
practice called tapping or the emotional


---------58:44----------
freeing technique


---------58:45----------
which now actually has a little bit of


---------58:47----------
data behind it


---------58:48----------
which is like a technique that people


---------58:50----------
use for trauma which actually now has


---------58:52----------
clinical trials that show it's like


---------58:54----------
it actually does something so the idea


---------58:56----------
is that like it's kind of weird because


---------58:57----------
it sounds pseudo


---------58:58----------
super pseudo scientific and what people


---------59:00----------
do is like there are these people who


---------59:01----------
are tappers


---------59:02----------
and what they literally do is they just


---------59:04----------
like tap on parts of your body to like


---------59:06----------
free the pent-up emotions kind of like


---------59:09----------
acupuncture or something


---------59:11----------
sort of i think acupuncture uses a


---------59:13----------
different a whole different modality but


---------59:15----------
yeah


---------59:15----------
yeah so and the point here though is


---------59:17----------
that like


---------59:18----------
physical and we know that for example


---------59:20----------
the diagnostic criteria for


---------59:22----------
for anxiety includes muscle tension so


---------59:25----------
there's clearly a connection between


---------59:27----------
your body and your mind and you can


---------59:28----------
actually process emotions physically if


---------59:30----------
you want to


---------59:31----------
that's a completely valid doesn't have


---------59:32----------
to be psychotherapy you can actually go


---------59:34----------
and like


---------59:34----------
hike and climb mountains and that will


---------59:37----------
help you like process your emotions


---------59:40----------
the other interesting way that the mind


---------59:41----------
processes emotions which is i think what


---------59:43----------
your mind has learned how to do


---------59:44----------
is dreams and nightmares so every time


---------59:47----------
you have a nightmare about that


---------59:49----------
i know it's unfortunate but like my hope


---------59:52----------
is that you're digesting a little bit


---------59:54----------
and there are actually particular


---------59:55----------
techniques that we can do


---------59:57----------
i i can walk you through those maybe


---------59:58----------
that's not gonna be our meditation for


---------60:00----------
the day at the end of the day


---------60:01----------
about how to like think about nightmares


---------60:03----------
and how to like work with them a little


---------60:04----------
bit so that like you sort of


---------60:06----------
use that nightmare to like do the


---------60:08----------
emotional processing and let it go


---------60:11----------
because your body and your mind are


---------60:12----------
gonna do whatever they can to heal like


---------60:14----------
if you get a cut


---------60:15----------
it's just gonna try to heal and your


---------60:17----------
mind does the same thing it does the


---------60:18----------
best that it can


---------60:20----------
so it'll and and so if you have


---------60:22----------
nightmares about how often you have


---------60:23----------
nightmares by the way


---------60:26----------
um i mean i don't have nightmares all


---------60:29----------
that often


---------60:30----------
um the like school ones the like stress


---------60:34----------
stream kind of things


---------60:36----------
i'll have like


---------60:39----------
maybe once every few weeks or once a


---------60:42----------
month maybe


---------60:43----------
yeah so i think that's just like


---------60:46----------
your your brain is like you still have


---------60:49----------
that pent up emotion i know it


---------60:50----------
sounds kind of weird but in the


---------60:52----------
nightmare so our


---------60:54----------
when you're in the nightmare is the


---------60:55----------
nightmare real


---------60:57----------
no uh or like is it


---------61:01----------
is like what's happening something that


---------61:03----------
actually happened


---------61:04----------
is that where you're asking is your


---------61:06----------
experience of it real


---------61:09----------
uh i mean yeah because i'll wake up and


---------61:13----------
feel stressed yep so like like and even


---------61:16----------
then like the emotions that you feel in


---------61:18----------
a nightmare are they real


---------61:21----------
yeah it's bizarre right yeah but


---------61:24----------
absolutely


---------61:25----------
so i think like this is your and if we


---------61:26----------
think about like this emotional


---------61:28----------
catharsis and when people like


---------61:29----------
like come into my office and they start


---------61:31----------
crying like what we're doing is bringing


---------61:33----------
those emotions


---------61:34----------
back into the conscious mind so that we


---------61:36----------
can experience them process them and let


---------61:38----------
them go


---------61:39----------
and so i think that your mind has just


---------61:41----------
learned how to do this through a


---------61:42----------
nightmare because you don't know how to


---------61:44----------
do it


---------61:44----------
other ways or maybe you have i don't


---------61:46----------
know if you see a therapist or not but


---------61:47----------
like


---------61:48----------
you know that's another way i would


---------61:50----------
suspect that if you start going to


---------61:51----------
therapy


---------61:52----------
i'm assuming that you don't already know


---------61:54----------
but that if you start i just


---------61:55----------
i just stopped going to therapy actually


---------61:57----------
i just like took a break


---------61:59----------
because doing stuff over


---------62:02----------
zoom every week like i couldn't like get


---------62:05----------
into the right like


---------62:06----------
mindset every week and so until i can go


---------62:09----------
back in person we


---------62:10----------
we took a little bit of a break but i


---------62:11----------
just stopped going like a few weeks ago


---------62:15----------
good good i i think taking a break from


---------62:17----------
therapy is like important too like it


---------62:18----------
should be part of your vacation


---------62:20----------
um but anyway so hopefully you can kind


---------62:23----------
of work on some of those things


---------62:24----------
there but i think it sort of makes sense


---------62:27----------
to me that you have nightmares about the


---------62:28----------
sort


---------62:28----------
this kind of stuff yeah so the


---------62:32----------
just to kind of summarize so ethan do


---------62:34----------
you mind just sharing with me like what


---------62:36----------
you've taken away from the conversation


---------62:38----------
so far like key points


---------62:40----------
that yeah uh i mean the


---------62:44----------
the sort of realization of like having


---------62:46----------
to like


---------62:47----------
kill a version of me off i think


---------62:50----------
has like affected me a lot more than i


---------62:52----------
initially thought and like


---------62:54----------
and i think i get this from my dad but


---------62:56----------
like i very much


---------62:59----------
don't process my emotions like something


---------63:02----------
will happen to me and i'll just kind of


---------63:05----------
brush it off


---------63:06----------
um and i also just like


---------63:09----------
will kind of roll over for people too


---------63:12----------
what does that mean


---------63:13----------
well just like i don't know uh


---------63:17----------
i don't i don't like stand up for myself


---------63:19----------
all that much


---------63:20----------
um and also i don't know how to say no


---------63:23----------
to anybody


---------63:24----------
um which is something that i've been


---------63:26----------
sort of like working on


---------63:28----------
um and i think that's part of me my


---------63:31----------
insecurity


---------63:32----------
is like i don't want this is something


---------63:34----------
i've actually talked to my therapist a


---------63:35----------
lot about


---------63:36----------
um is that i don't want people to think


---------63:38----------
that i'm an [ __ ]


---------63:39----------
and so if somebody asked me to do


---------63:41----------
something i'll just like kind of bend


---------63:43----------
over backwards for them


---------63:44----------
and be like oh yeah of course because i


---------63:46----------
don't want them to think i'm a dick


---------63:48----------
okay i'm curious did you feel pressured


---------63:50----------
to come on here today


---------63:52----------
no okay would you tell me if you did


---------63:56----------
yeah okay yes i'm very excited okay


---------64:00----------
because i would hate to i would hate to


---------64:01----------
you know have you bend over backwards


---------64:03----------
for


---------64:04----------
no you know um okay so


---------64:07----------
so really i'm glad that so now i'm going


---------64:10----------
to give you a choice so


---------64:12----------
what i'm actually hearing ethan is that


---------64:13----------
the the biggest thing that was helpful


---------64:15----------
for you was sort of this realization


---------64:17----------
about your mom and sort of being you


---------64:19----------
know forced to


---------64:23----------
looking for the right word amputate a


---------64:25----------
part of yourself


---------64:27----------
yeah and and so now you know i i've


---------64:30----------
sketched out this beautiful plan


---------64:32----------
but i'm wondering if we should actually


---------64:33----------
abandon it and just maybe like dig for a


---------64:35----------
couple more of those gems like


---------64:37----------
what do you think we can go down our


---------64:39----------
standard track of okay here's the way


---------64:41----------
that some scars work


---------64:42----------
this feeling of insecurity is


---------64:43----------
essentially like pent-up emotions from


---------64:45----------
these


---------64:46----------
past times that then activate we can now


---------64:48----------
move on to like youtube and think a


---------64:50----------
little bit about how that entire process


---------64:52----------
is exacerbated by social media then we


---------64:55----------
can talk about how


---------64:56----------
opening up is difficult and then we can


---------64:59----------
sort of talk about you know becoming


---------65:01----------
your best


---------65:01----------
self or we can dig for gems


---------65:04----------
what do you want to do uh we can do we


---------65:07----------
can do either of those


---------65:09----------
um your time bro i'm going to force you


---------65:11----------
to choose


---------65:12----------
oh [ __ ] no i'm not no i can't


---------65:15----------
i'm so sorry i'm so sorry


---------65:19----------
okay oh god wait um


---------65:23----------
you don't have to choose you choose you


---------65:27----------
do you want to choose no not really


---------65:30----------
okay i will choose for you okay okay


---------65:32----------
let's let's


---------65:33----------
let's stick with our original thing okay


---------65:36----------
i'm so sorry ethan oh god it's very


---------65:39----------
funny


---------65:40----------
i didn't mean to all right


---------65:44----------
so let's talk about youtube so you say


---------65:46----------
that you suffer from


---------65:47----------
imposter syndrome or maybe something


---------65:50----------
like that what do you mean by that


---------65:53----------
um so definitely over the past year


---------65:56----------
because the


---------65:57----------
the channel that i was doing with a


---------65:59----------
friend of mine like really


---------66:01----------
boosted my career a lot and boosted my


---------66:03----------
own channel and everything


---------66:05----------
um and so i just sort of feel like


---------66:08----------
um just kind of standard imposter


---------66:12----------
syndrome of like


---------66:13----------
the things that i have i don't deserve


---------66:15----------
or


---------66:16----------
um i i think a lot of um


---------66:20----------
i think a lot about like why am i in


---------66:23----------
this scenario


---------66:24----------
and like uh you know a lot of a lot of


---------66:27----------
people in my life


---------66:28----------
especially over the past year have had


---------66:30----------
really shitty things happen in them


---------66:32----------
and here i am like you know on paper


---------66:35----------
like living the dream in los angeles


---------66:38----------
um and so it's a lot of like why am i


---------66:40----------
this person


---------66:41----------
that's experiencing this um and there's


---------66:45----------
there's a lot of guilt that i that i


---------66:48----------
feel with the


---------66:49----------
success that i have and i don't feel


---------66:52----------
that i deserve it basically


---------67:03----------
do you feel like you


---------67:06----------
don't deserve it from like a cosmic


---------67:08----------
sense or do you feel like


---------67:10----------
people haven't figured out that you


---------67:12----------
don't make good content yet


---------67:15----------
[Laughter]


---------67:17----------
oh i i think i think it's the latter


---------67:21----------
it's in my mind like there's so many


---------67:24----------
other people that make way better stuff


---------67:26----------
than i do


---------67:28----------
like i don't think that i'm particularly


---------67:31----------
interesting


---------67:32----------
or that i


---------67:35----------
and again this is something that i'm


---------67:36----------
working on with my therapist


---------67:39----------
of like i don't feel like i'm worthy of


---------67:41----------
people's time


---------67:44----------
most of the time so i'm


---------67:48----------
noticing a couple of different things


---------67:49----------
and i wouldn't call all of them imposter


---------67:51----------
syndrome okay


---------67:52----------
so can i try to tease apart untangle


---------67:54----------
this ball of yarn so when i think about


---------67:56----------
imposter syndrome so here's


---------67:58----------
for better or for worse i feel like i'm


---------68:01----------
understand it quite well now


---------68:03----------
um you know we've worked with a lot of


---------68:04----------
streamers and and uh we have like a


---------68:06----------
program with twitch where we


---------68:08----------
support content creators and so


---------68:12----------
one of the things that that when i think


---------68:14----------
about imposter syndrome i'm going to use


---------68:15----------
sort of this eastern kind of conception


---------68:17----------
of it as well


---------68:18----------
so we have an internal sense of self


---------68:20----------
right and this is the way that you


---------68:22----------
view yourself and we have the way that


---------68:24----------
the world treats us


---------68:26----------
and so the way that i view myself is


---------68:28----------
different from the way that the world


---------68:29----------
treats me does that make sense


---------68:32----------
generally speaking though


---------68:36----------
actually so let's go back to your dad


---------68:37----------
for a second so there are times


---------68:39----------
where like harmony is built when these


---------68:42----------
two things


---------68:43----------
are even so i think like the


---------68:44----------
significance of like your dad talent


---------68:46----------
like appreciating you for who you are


---------68:48----------
is like you knew deep down that you were


---------68:51----------
working really


---------68:52----------
really hard and you were trying and so


---------68:54----------
you had this view of yourself but what


---------68:56----------
did the world think of you


---------68:58----------
that i was a failure right so but like


---------69:02----------
the world kept on telling you were a


---------69:03----------
fail you were a failure


---------69:05----------
does waking up at 4 30 in the morning


---------69:07----------
making youtube videos


---------69:08----------
going to work and then coming back home


---------69:10----------
and editing them


---------69:11----------
if i describe that to someone like what


---------69:14----------
adjectives would you use to describe


---------69:15----------
that person


---------69:17----------
like hard-working and dedicated and


---------69:20----------
probably successful passionate right


---------69:24----------
yeah


---------69:24----------
so there's a there's a there's a


---------69:26----------
disconnect between your internal


---------69:29----------
sense and what the world is telling you


---------69:31----------
that can be very devastating for people


---------69:33----------
and then here comes your dad and he's


---------69:35----------
like he's a signal from the outside


---------69:37----------
world that aligns with like


---------69:39----------
your passion and your dedication and so


---------69:42----------
it can feel really good


---------69:43----------
so in that situation your self-esteem is


---------69:46----------
up here the world is treating you down


---------69:48----------
here


---------69:48----------
and so that's kind of feels bad man


---------69:51----------
right


---------69:52----------
impostor syndrome is this it's when


---------69:56----------
you have a sense of yourself like you're


---------69:57----------
just like an ordinary guy like you're 24


---------69:59----------
year old ethan


---------70:01----------
you know there's some things you're good


---------70:02----------
at some things you're not great at and


---------70:04----------
the world is like oh my god


---------70:07----------
it's it's ethan he's so great like look


---------70:10----------
at the school stuff he's doing all the


---------70:12----------
time man oh my god i love ethan and then


---------70:14----------
you're like wait a minute hold on a


---------70:15----------
second


---------70:16----------
yeah you know so what i see in imposter


---------70:18----------
syndrome and i see it a lot


---------70:20----------
at places so i teach at harvard medical


---------70:21----------
school and like i see it a lot there


---------70:23----------
bizarrely and you'd think that like you


---------70:25----------
know


---------70:26----------
like what's the correlation between


---------70:28----------
success and imposter syndrome


---------70:30----------
and generally speaking the more


---------70:31----------
successful people are the more


---------70:33----------
that they feel imposter syndrome and and


---------70:36----------
essentially what happens is like


---------70:37----------
generally speaking our internal sense of


---------70:39----------
self and external sense of self tend to


---------70:41----------
like


---------70:41----------
stick with each other so if you think


---------70:43----------
about a standard person it's like oh you


---------70:44----------
know i'm a high school student


---------70:46----------
i feel terrible and then you like become


---------70:48----------
a freshman in college


---------70:49----------
then once you're a freshman in college


---------70:50----------
you feel like a like you know a nobody


---------70:52----------
like you're a freshman you're a noob


---------70:54----------
and then you go back home for christmas


---------70:57----------
and then you hang out with people who


---------70:58----------
are one or two years younger than you


---------71:00----------
yeah and then like then you feel like a


---------71:03----------
big swinging dick


---------71:04----------
you know yeah it's like look at all


---------71:05----------
these high school plebs and like i'm in


---------71:08----------
college now [ __ ]


---------71:10----------
and so there's kind of this weird like


---------71:12----------
this slow


---------71:13----------
growth right and then you finish high


---------71:15----------
school and then you go back and like you


---------71:17----------
like


---------71:18----------
like do a career panel for like high


---------71:20----------
schools i mean


---------71:21----------
sorry you finish college and then you


---------71:22----------
get a job and then you're like 24 and


---------71:24----------
you go back and you like


---------71:25----------
do some career panel at the guidance


---------71:27----------
office or whatever


---------71:28----------
and they're all these 21 year olds and


---------71:30----------
like you're a 24 year old and you're


---------71:31----------
like paying your own rent


---------71:32----------
and then you like feel like someone


---------71:34----------
right but you're the most junior person


---------71:35----------
at the


---------71:36----------
the the company so you don't feel like


---------71:38----------
much there


---------71:39----------
so generally speaking there's like an


---------71:41----------
even sense


---------71:42----------
of like societal respect with like an


---------71:45----------
internal sense of value


---------71:46----------
because that's the way that we're sort


---------71:48----------
of designed we're not designed to like


---------71:50----------
inherit vast amounts of success over


---------71:53----------
brief periods of time because things


---------71:54----------
like social media


---------71:55----------
like i don't know if this makes sense


---------71:57----------
but you know 10 000 years ago


---------71:59----------
you couldn't blow up in your tribe yeah


---------72:02----------
there's only like so big that you could


---------72:05----------
get


---------72:05----------
right and so like sure like you could


---------72:09----------
maybe like you single-handedly killed a


---------72:11----------
tiger and then everyone's like yay and


---------72:13----------
then you're like yay look at how awesome


---------72:15----------
i am


---------72:15----------
and like 15 people think you're great


---------72:18----------
yeah and so our brains are just not


---------72:20----------
designed like the concept of blowing up


---------72:22----------
was not technologically possible


---------72:24----------
yeah in the environment like you go look


---------72:26----------
at a tribe of like a pack of deer


---------72:29----------
right like how how much can their social


---------72:31----------
status change


---------72:33----------
yeah very little right and so like


---------72:36----------
enter youtube where suddenly now we have


---------72:39----------
these things where like people get


---------72:41----------
elevated a lot so if you heard of a


---------72:43----------
company called goldman sachs


---------72:45----------
you know yeah okay so like i also work


---------72:47----------
with a fair number of people at goldman


---------72:49----------
and like goldman is sort of like it's


---------72:50----------
like a platinum tier investment bank


---------72:52----------
it's where everyone wants to go they're


---------72:54----------
like super famous super rich whatever


---------72:55----------
and so we see a ton of imposter syndrome


---------72:58----------
before like when i'm working with a 22


---------73:00----------
year old who's applying to be in goldman


---------73:02----------
he's like at the top of his class he's


---------73:05----------
the most competitive


---------73:06----------
he feels really good about himself and


---------73:08----------
then when he lands at goldman within six


---------73:10----------
months he's got impostor syndrome


---------73:12----------
because then when he introduces himself


---------73:13----------
to people and he's like oh i work at


---------73:15----------
goldman


---------73:16----------
and then i was like oh yeah and then


---------73:19----------
he's like but wait a minute because he's


---------73:20----------
like the most junior kid on the totem


---------73:22----------
pole so every day when he goes to work


---------73:23----------
he feels like clueless


---------73:24----------
and here he is getting all this external


---------73:26----------
respect yeah


---------73:28----------
so bizarrely what what i see in imposter


---------73:30----------
syndrome is like when there's


---------73:31----------
when there's a quick elevation the


---------73:34----------
imposter syndrome gets worse because


---------73:35----------
then you're kind of confused because


---------73:37----------
everyone's treating you like you're the


---------73:38----------
best thing since sliced bread


---------73:39----------
but like i know this sounds kind of


---------73:41----------
weird but like you still [ __ ] the same


---------73:42----------
every morning


---------73:43----------
yeah right and you're like wait a minute


---------73:47----------
yeah you know does that make sense


---------73:50----------
yeah it makes a lot of sense and and so


---------73:54----------
that's i definitely see that and i think


---------73:56----------
that like basically is if you do like


---------73:58----------
self-reflective work and stuff like that


---------74:00----------
we can talk about spirituality and stuff


---------74:02----------
that's one thing but i'm also detecting


---------74:04----------
something else which i don't think is


---------74:06----------
imposter syndrome which is sort of the


---------74:07----------
sense of worthiness


---------74:09----------
what's fair do i deserve this and i


---------74:11----------
don't really get the sense that


---------74:13----------
i feel like that's a little bit more


---------74:15----------
almost like spiritual in nature what do


---------74:16----------
you think


---------74:18----------
yeah i'm so i


---------74:22----------
i why is that different from imposter


---------74:25----------
syndrome


---------74:26----------
of like because you sort of described it


---------74:29----------
as like


---------74:30----------
uh other people saying like oh you're


---------74:32----------
hot [ __ ] and really you're just


---------74:34----------
a normal dude um but how is that sort of


---------74:37----------
different from


---------74:38----------
feeling like oh like i have


---------74:41----------
this stuff and i don't feel worthy like


---------74:44----------
why me


---------74:45----------
yeah so so the reason i'd say that


---------74:47----------
that's different is one has to do with a


---------74:49----------
comparison


---------74:51----------
it may not be different right so it may


---------74:53----------
be the same so i'm kind of proposing to


---------74:54----------
you but


---------74:55----------
what i'm like especially when you talked


---------74:56----------
about like other like so if you ask why


---------74:59----------
am i successful


---------75:00----------
and other people are not that doesn't


---------75:03----------
have to come with imposter syndrome


---------75:05----------
that i think is a really really


---------75:07----------
important question from like a spiritual


---------75:09----------
and karmic perspective


---------75:11----------
like why do you have the life that you


---------75:13----------
have


---------75:15----------
and imposter syndrome is about sort of


---------75:17----------
like being afraid that one day


---------75:19----------
everyone's gonna wake up and like start


---------75:20----------
to think that like


---------75:23----------
you make crappy content they know


---------75:26----------
they've figured it out


---------75:27----------
right so so the being afraid of them


---------75:30----------
figuring it out is


---------75:31----------
different from like understanding like


---------75:33----------
ethan why were you given the gifts that


---------75:35----------
you were given


---------75:37----------
you know you say your adhd and you have


---------75:39----------
struggles and things like that


---------75:40----------
totally get it but like i think you've


---------75:42----------
discovered that you


---------75:44----------
are brilliant right i think


---------75:47----------
that is not a word that i would use to


---------75:49----------
describe myself


---------75:51----------
but i'm also very very bad at uh


---------75:55----------
giving myself any credit at all or


---------75:57----------
saying anything nice about myself


---------75:59----------
yeah so i think that that feeling of


---------76:01----------
unworthiness


---------76:03----------
can grow into imposter syndrome but i


---------76:06----------
think that has deeper roots dude


---------76:10----------
because i think you were taught you were


---------76:12----------
unworthy


---------76:13----------
from a very young age what do you think


---------76:16----------
about that


---------76:18----------
yeah no i i definitely feel


---------76:21----------
feel that and it's it's so interesting


---------76:24----------
because i


---------76:24----------
i don't feel that at all from my family


---------76:27----------
because my family has always been


---------76:29----------
uh they've always supported like


---------76:31----------
everything that i've


---------76:32----------
that i've ever done and like both my


---------76:34----------
parents when


---------76:35----------
when i moved out to la they were like


---------76:37----------
you have to go and do this like you need


---------76:39----------
to go and make this leap


---------76:41----------
you can always come back blah blah blah


---------76:42----------
but like from kind of everybody else in


---------76:45----------
the outside


---------76:46----------
world i've always felt like


---------76:49----------
oh i'm doing bad and i'm stupid


---------76:54----------
there it is so there's the sump scar


---------76:58----------
it's the persistent feeling you carry


---------77:01----------
with you


---------77:02----------
right so i i think that impostor


---------77:04----------
syndrome can grow on this but this feels


---------77:06----------
deeper to me than


---------77:07----------
because like there are a lot of people


---------77:08----------
who blow up and have impostor syndrome


---------77:10----------
but are like narcissistic pricks who


---------77:12----------
don't bend over backwards for anyone


---------77:14----------
right so i think your particular


---------77:16----------
combination is like an insecurity that


---------77:19----------
pre-dates the youtube


---------77:20----------
followed by an explosion of social media


---------77:23----------
where like


---------77:24----------
you know now suddenly everyone's


---------77:25----------
treating you well and it's like doubly


---------77:27----------
perplexing


---------77:28----------
because there's the normal dose of


---------77:29----------
imposter syndrome and that compounds


---------77:32----------
with like the sense of like


---------77:35----------
am i really good at what i do am i


---------77:37----------
really worthy


---------77:38----------
so now the question becomes where does


---------77:40----------
that


---------77:42----------
you know i'm curious what what do you


---------77:44----------
think about the content you make


---------77:47----------
i think it's fine honestly


---------77:51----------
like i i i think that it's


---------77:55----------
entertaining for people but it's nothing


---------77:58----------
it's nothing great um i think that i


---------78:01----------
have made really cool stuff


---------78:03----------
but um yeah no i


---------78:06----------
i do think that i just am another dude


---------78:08----------
on youtube


---------78:09----------
like making videos and


---------78:12----------
i i think that i'm doing things that


---------78:16----------
anybody can do and that i'm i'm nothing


---------78:19----------
special


---------78:20----------
and then i just got lucky and i was at


---------78:22----------
the right place at the right time


---------78:29----------
i could get behind that


---------78:33----------
so so i know this sounds kind of weird


---------78:35----------
ethan but i think that that's


---------78:36----------
okay what do you think yeah yeah no and


---------78:39----------
like i


---------78:40----------
i think that that's very real


---------78:44----------
where it's just like i do genuinely


---------78:46----------
think that like


---------78:48----------
anybody can do what i do it's not like i


---------78:51----------
do anything profound


---------78:53----------
and like i like i i make


---------78:56----------
decent content and i got really lucky


---------78:58----------
and like i worked really hard and that


---------79:00----------
that worked out somehow


---------79:04----------
do you feel


---------79:07----------
unworthy


---------79:10----------
um yes and no it depends


---------79:16----------
it kind of depends on the mood that i'm


---------79:17----------
in um because there are parts of me that


---------79:21----------
sort of like with the stupidity thing


---------79:23----------
where i can recognize


---------79:24----------
like i i busted my ass for years and


---------79:28----------
years and years to like get where i am


---------79:30----------
um but then there's there's other parts


---------79:33----------
of me that


---------79:34----------
that are like i know people that work so


---------79:36----------
much harder than me and


---------79:37----------
are are you know better people than i


---------79:41----------
am and you know why don't


---------79:45----------
why aren't they where i'm where i'm at


---------79:47----------
why was i the person that


---------79:50----------
got got handed this i don't feel like i


---------79:52----------
deserve it


---------79:55----------
okay


---------80:01----------
so i don't know why ethan but i'm just


---------80:02----------
kind of in a teaching mode today


---------80:05----------
and maybe it's because you're working


---------80:06----------
with a therapist but you seem very


---------80:08----------
insightful to me so i want to give you


---------80:09----------
some stuff to kind of think about


---------80:11----------
as opposed to like maybe like meet you


---------80:13----------
where you're at which is normally what i


---------80:15----------
do


---------80:16----------
so here's here's what i'd recommend to


---------80:17----------
you and this is part of the process of


---------80:20----------
like helping people overcome imposter


---------80:21----------
syndrome


---------80:22----------
why do you compare


---------80:26----------
so that's that's something that i have a


---------80:28----------
really hard time is


---------80:29----------
i'm constantly comparing myself to


---------80:31----------
others um


---------80:33----------
and i think it's because of like


---------80:37----------
the people that are in my


---------80:41----------
friend group and like specifically on


---------80:43----------
youtube like most of the people that


---------80:44----------
i'm surrounded by are


---------80:48----------
these insanely successful talented


---------80:50----------
people


---------80:51----------
and i constantly feel like hey


---------80:54----------
that i'm always overshadowed by them and


---------80:57----------
that i will never be able to escape that


---------80:59----------
shadow ever


---------81:00----------
and i'll always just be that dude that's


---------81:04----------
friends with x um


---------81:07----------
and also uh


---------81:11----------
where what was the other point that i


---------81:12----------
was gonna make


---------81:14----------
i'll ask the question again why do you


---------81:17----------
always compare


---------81:20----------
um oh yeah that's the other thing is


---------81:24----------
that people always compare me to them


---------81:26----------
all the time it's like okay ethan did


---------81:28----------
this this person did that


---------81:30----------
um or like i wish these people would do


---------81:34----------
these things together or whatever


---------81:36----------
and it's always people comparing me to


---------81:40----------
my friends um and so i always feel like


---------81:43----------
i


---------81:45----------
i always compare myself to the people


---------81:48----------
that i'm around because other people


---------81:50----------
do that to me as well


---------81:53----------
how does it how does it feel to be


---------81:56----------
compared to these other people


---------81:59----------
um there's two sides of it which are


---------82:02----------
very


---------82:03----------
opposite and conflicting one


---------82:07----------
part of it is like i'm honored to be


---------82:09----------
even


---------82:10----------
remotely associated with these people


---------82:12----------
because these are people that i look up


---------82:14----------
to


---------82:14----------
and um that make


---------82:17----------
some really amazing stuff and that i


---------82:19----------
genuinely like believe


---------82:21----------
in the content that they make and


---------82:22----------
they're talented people and then the


---------82:24----------
other side of that


---------82:25----------
is the exact opposite where like it can


---------82:27----------
be really degrading


---------82:28----------
where anything that i do is going to be


---------82:31----------
compared to what these other people are


---------82:33----------
doing


---------82:33----------
and it really sucks sometimes where it's


---------82:36----------
like okay can you just


---------82:39----------
look at the thing that i made without


---------82:41----------
bringing up these other people like not


---------82:42----------
everything that i do


---------82:44----------
has to be connected to these other


---------82:50----------
people


---------82:53----------
can i think for a second


---------82:59----------
now i'm facing the challenge of how how


---------83:00----------
to try to condense you know weeks of


---------83:02----------
work into like 15 minutes


---------83:06----------
because there's definitely a road


---------83:08----------
forward i just don't know how to


---------83:10----------
condense it so let me just see if i can


---------83:12----------
pull this off


---------83:19----------
ethan do you have a particular if you


---------83:21----------
don't mind sharing do you have a


---------83:22----------
particular like religious or spiritual


---------83:24----------
bend


---------83:26----------
i'm not religious or spiritual at all


---------83:29----------
okay


---------83:31----------
all right let's start with this who are


---------83:33----------
you


---------83:35----------
what a loaded question uh


---------83:40----------
i genuinely don't even know how to


---------83:41----------
answer that


---------83:43----------
yep uh


---------83:50----------
i don't even know where to s to start


---------83:53----------
answering that


---------83:55----------
don't worry about being right yeah


---------83:59----------
just tell me who do you who are you um


---------84:06----------
am i allowed to just use a bunch of


---------84:08----------
adjectives absolutely


---------84:10----------
you're allowed to say whatever you want


---------84:12----------
to nothing is wrong with what you were


---------84:14----------
going to say


---------84:16----------
cool um i think that like


---------84:19----------
at my core i'm a very like passionate


---------84:22----------
um and i i do think that i'm a very


---------84:26----------
insightful person


---------84:28----------
um yeah i think


---------84:31----------
i think at my core like i'm very


---------84:33----------
passionate and


---------84:34----------
i think that i'm a pretty thoughtful


---------84:38----------
dude like i i do go out of my way for


---------84:40----------
the people that i care about a lot


---------84:42----------
and um yeah


---------84:47----------
so i'm hearing compassionate insightful


---------84:51----------
and dedicated is that fair


---------84:55----------
yeah i think i'm pretty easy going


---------84:58----------
sometimes too


---------84:59----------
to a fault yep uh yeah so that's


---------85:03----------
okay so here's here's i know it sounds


---------85:05----------
kind of weird but like when i work with


---------85:06----------
people with imposter syndrome like i


---------85:08----------
think it ultimately comes down to


---------85:10----------
the ahamkada or the ego which i don't


---------85:12----------
know if you remember when i drew but


---------85:14----------
there's like emotional mind there's the


---------85:15----------
intellectual mind and there's this thing


---------85:17----------
called the ego


---------85:18----------
and if we think so the one of the


---------85:20----------
functions of ego is to compare


---------85:22----------
so like what the ego does when we're


---------85:24----------
feeling bad about ourselves


---------85:26----------
is that it compares us to other people


---------85:29----------
sometimes it does so to reinforce the


---------85:31----------
fact that we feel bad about ourselves


---------85:33----------
but otherwise it also does it to kind of


---------85:35----------
pump ourselves up


---------85:36----------
yeah but if you kind of think about it


---------85:38----------
like i know this sounds kind of weird


---------85:40----------
but like you know i want you to look at


---------85:42----------
two rocks


---------85:44----------
and like just think about this for a


---------85:45----------
second


---------85:47----------
and like you can compare them


---------85:50----------
you can say one is bigger or smaller


---------85:54----------
but like it doesn't mean anything


---------85:57----------
does that make sense yeah and so i think


---------86:00----------
this is


---------86:00----------
once again where like social media


---------86:04----------
reinforces or conditions our mind to


---------86:06----------
compare


---------86:07----------
and especially when people are making


---------86:08----------
comparisons so it's almost like there's


---------86:10----------
an assault on your mind which is


---------86:12----------
in uh increasing your aham god now the


---------86:15----------
interesting thing is


---------86:16----------
a hamgar is technically translated as


---------86:18----------
the sense of i


---------86:20----------
so sometimes people who have a hum card


---------86:22----------
it's not necessarily like ego like it's


---------86:24----------
not


---------86:24----------
necessarily that they're egotistical you


---------86:27----------
can still have a sense of


---------86:28----------
i that has a very low impression


---------86:31----------
like i can beat myself up a lot i'm so


---------86:33----------
stupid i am this i am this i am this or


---------86:36----------
you can be like i'm the best thing since


---------86:37----------
slice friend


---------86:38----------
the yogis would actually say that it's


---------86:40----------
the i am part that's the problem


---------86:42----------
what's on the other end of the spectrum


---------86:44----------
is always going to lead to suffering


---------86:45----------
whether you say you're the best thing


---------86:47----------
since sliced bread and you're super


---------86:48----------
narcissistic those people suffer


---------86:49----------
immensely


---------86:50----------
or you beat yourself up those people


---------86:51----------
suffer immensely as well


---------86:54----------
and so oddly enough i think that like


---------86:56----------
you know you your your mind can make


---------86:58----------
comparisons but i think your true


---------86:59----------
freedom and the reason that you're going


---------87:01----------
to continue to have imposter syndrome


---------87:02----------
until you recognize who you are


---------87:04----------
because and now we get to the punch line


---------87:07----------
as long as you don't know who you


---------87:09----------
are where does your sense of identity


---------87:12----------
come from


---------87:16----------
what other people tell me exactly


---------87:20----------
right so so this is where like when when


---------87:22----------
it comes to your sense of self


---------87:27----------
ego is when the sense of the self comes


---------87:29----------
from the outside


---------87:31----------
oh dr k oh harvard


---------87:35----------
harvard oh did you see it did you see it


---------87:39----------
oh so beautiful


---------87:48----------
right and so like


---------87:52----------
you know it's like as long as that's


---------87:54----------
what your identity is based on like


---------87:55----------
you're gonna suffer


---------87:58----------
and and so like even the people at


---------88:00----------
harvard like they suffer a lot because


---------88:02----------
there's always


---------88:03----------
you know someone higher than them or


---------88:06----------
even if you rise to the head of a


---------88:08----------
department and you run


---------88:10----------
a division there are other divisions


---------88:14----------
and so like as long as your sense of


---------88:16----------
identity is based upon comparison like


---------88:18----------
the imposter syndromes to a certain


---------88:20----------
degree gonna be there


---------88:23----------
and so now the question becomes how do


---------88:25----------
you discover who you are


---------88:32----------
no idea okay close your eyes


---------88:37----------
who are you ethan what is your


---------88:40----------
experience


---------88:41----------
of yourself


---------88:46----------
the first thing that i want to do is


---------88:47----------
just say the things that i already said


---------88:50----------
okay when you asked me before of who am


---------88:53----------
i


---------88:54----------
okay so you can say those things so now


---------88:56----------
let's pick insightful


---------88:59----------
show me where insightful is like in this


---------89:02----------
experience if this is the only moment


---------89:04----------
that you existed


---------89:08----------
how would i know that how how would you


---------89:10----------
know how would you know that you're


---------89:12----------
insightful


---------89:15----------
uh by


---------89:18----------
just the fact that i can reflect i guess


---------89:21----------
okay


---------89:22----------
okay good experiences that i've had and


---------89:24----------
me as a person


---------89:26----------
okay so that's actually a far better


---------89:27----------
answer than i thought was possible


---------89:29----------
it shows that you're insightful but yeah


---------89:32----------
so but but i'm i'm gonna say like it


---------89:34----------
goes it's a little bit weird because i'm


---------89:35----------
gonna still tunnel down so


---------89:38----------
what the real answer is the capacity to


---------89:40----------
reflect


---------89:43----------
so i want you to notice that like so are


---------89:46----------
you a man


---------89:47----------
i don't know what your gender identity


---------89:48----------
is but do you identify as a man


---------89:51----------
how would you know if this is all that


---------89:54----------
existed if if you were alive for just a


---------89:57----------
moment in time and it was this moment


---------89:59----------
how would you know that you were a man


---------90:01----------
because i think that i am a man


---------90:04----------
okay but where is the madness in you


---------90:10----------
uh


---------90:15----------
i don't know right it's weird


---------90:19----------
yeah so so once again you gave the right


---------90:21----------
answer which is a step forward which is


---------90:23----------
that because you think you're a man


---------90:26----------
are you a youtuber yes


---------90:29----------
how would you know uh


---------90:34----------
because i make content on youtube okay


---------90:37----------
and were you a youtuber 15 years ago


---------90:43----------
no were you you


---------90:46----------
15 years ago yes


---------90:50----------
well then how does that work then how


---------90:52----------
can being a youtuber be a part of you


---------90:58----------
because we're constantly growing and


---------91:00----------
changing we you're correct we are


---------91:02----------
constantly growing and changing


---------91:05----------
but who is the you that is constantly


---------91:07----------
growing and changing


---------91:09----------
yeah right so you can


---------91:13----------
open your eyes let's check in how you


---------91:16----------
feeling right now what what are you


---------91:18----------
just how was that for you confusing do


---------91:20----------
you feel i don't wanna i don't want you


---------91:21----------
to feel stupid but i encour


---------91:23----------
i understand that we're walking on like


---------91:24----------
very unfamiliar territory that's


---------91:26----------
difficult for most people


---------91:28----------
yeah no i don't i don't feel stupid


---------91:31----------
actually


---------91:32----------
um genuinely um it's


---------91:36----------
it's really really interesting being


---------91:39----------
asked those questions


---------91:40----------
because that's not something that people


---------91:43----------
like


---------91:44----------
nobody goes up to somebody and it's like


---------91:45----------
who are you like


---------91:47----------
deep down who are you and so it's really


---------91:51----------
really weird thinking about that and


---------91:54----------
asking


---------91:54----------
and i think that that's most of what


---------91:56----------
therapy is


---------91:58----------
is just having somebody ask you a


---------91:59----------
question that you need to ask yourself


---------92:02----------
and asking myself that question and


---------92:04----------
genuinely not really having any idea how


---------92:06----------
to answer it


---------92:07----------
it's also kind of terrifying being like


---------92:09----------
oh i don't really know who i am at


---------92:12----------
at my core um and so it's it's kind of


---------92:16----------
to answer your question it's kind of


---------92:18----------
scary yeah a little bit


---------92:20----------
good so that's what we want because i


---------92:23----------
think that's going to be your road


---------92:24----------
forward so here i'll leave you with a


---------92:25----------
couple of thoughts so here's the thing


---------92:27----------
ethan


---------92:28----------
you are what you are and maybe now we'll


---------92:32----------
sort of segue into like


---------92:35----------
you know so let's just touch on opening


---------92:37----------
up is difficult so like


---------92:38----------
you have this idea of all this [ __ ] that


---------92:40----------
you are but you're not any of that stuff


---------92:43----------
all the stuff that you're afraid to show


---------92:44----------
other people


---------92:46----------
is not actually who you are because what


---------92:48----------
you are and this is sort of the yogic


---------92:50----------
perspective


---------92:51----------
is there's a eunice that transcends body


---------92:54----------
so like when you were a child you were


---------92:56----------
still you and when you're an adult


---------92:57----------
you're still you but the body has


---------92:59----------
changed


---------92:59----------
before you were a youtuber you were


---------93:01----------
still you


---------93:03----------
right like and after like when you were


---------93:04----------
a tiny youtuber you were still you


---------93:06----------
and now that you're a successful


---------93:08----------
youtuber you're still you


---------93:10----------
like you're still that kid who would


---------93:12----------
wake up at 4 30 every day to make videos


---------93:16----------
that's like that's a part of you there's


---------93:19----------
like a piece of you


---------93:20----------
that wants to like share something with


---------93:22----------
the world


---------93:24----------
and that part of you doesn't care really


---------93:27----------
about anyone else it doesn't care about


---------93:29----------
whether you're bigger or smaller or get


---------93:30----------
compared or don't compare it or whatever


---------93:33----------
right because like i think when you


---------93:34----------
really stop and think about


---------93:36----------
when you make your best content it is


---------93:39----------
when you are the furthest away from what


---------93:41----------
people think you are


---------93:43----------
and it is the closest to when you are


---------93:45----------
you


---------93:46----------
because i know this sounds kind of weird


---------93:49----------
but when you were working as that


---------93:51----------
manager and you were making you two


---------93:53----------
youtube videos a day


---------93:55----------
were you being you


---------93:58----------
yeah absolutely


---------94:02----------
absolutely right you were so close to


---------94:04----------
yourself back then


---------94:06----------
and the crazy thing is like when your


---------94:07----------
mom told you like pick one


---------94:10----------
the reason that that was so painful is


---------94:12----------
because she was asking you


---------94:14----------
you were so close to who you were back


---------94:16----------
then you had figured out who you were


---------94:18----------
and she was like


---------94:19----------
lop a piece off and you were like


---------94:22----------
no that's not i'm not a student it's


---------94:24----------
just not who i


---------94:25----------
am yeah and so i know it sounds kind of


---------94:29----------
weird but like there's a eunice that


---------94:31----------
transcends


---------94:32----------
your physical body there's a unis that


---------94:33----------
even transcends your mind


---------94:35----------
because their fluctuations with the mind


---------94:36----------
one day you're sad one day you're angry


---------94:39----------
but you're still you one day you're


---------94:42----------
egotistical one day you feel unworthy


---------94:44----------
maybe you feel those things more


---------94:45----------
constantly


---------94:46----------
but i guess that when you're taking a


---------94:48----------
dump


---------94:49----------
you don't really feel unworthy you're


---------94:51----------
just like


---------94:54----------
you're just exactly exactly


---------94:57----------
right and maybe if you're on your phone


---------94:59----------
and you're checking twitter then you


---------95:00----------
will feel unworthy


---------95:04----------
and and so you know i mean but like like


---------95:06----------
there's there's a eunice ethan


---------95:08----------
and this is the thing is i i would


---------95:09----------
encourage you to walk that journey and


---------95:11----------
now it's going to be tricky because i


---------95:12----------
don't know


---------95:13----------
you know therapy is a good place to


---------95:14----------
start but i think it's a little bit more


---------95:15----------
spiritual in nature


---------95:17----------
of really like go through this process


---------95:19----------
of like when you close your eyes and you


---------95:20----------
like sit down like i want you to go


---------95:22----------
experience


---------95:23----------
different things like go and like hike


---------95:25----------
and then like ask yourself like who's


---------95:27----------
doing the hiking is this a youtuber like


---------95:29----------
where are they because i'm not gonna i


---------95:30----------
don't think you're gonna find one i


---------95:31----------
don't think you are a youtuber yeah


---------95:33----------
i think a youtuber is just a mantle that


---------95:35----------
you put on


---------95:38----------
right and i think that the closer that


---------95:40----------
you get to that identity like


---------95:42----------
the less that this vacuum of identity


---------95:44----------
will be filled up by social media


---------95:47----------
and as you become solidified and


---------95:49----------
grounded in yourself


---------95:51----------
and i know you've been this you probably


---------95:53----------
are to a certain degree it's just


---------95:54----------
social media is going to pull you away


---------95:56----------
from that because in terms of identity


---------95:57----------
it's like


---------95:59----------
and you were taking a month off right so


---------96:02----------
like


---------96:02----------
i think you got closer to you yeah


---------96:06----------
and does that make sense yeah


---------96:09----------
no and there there were parts of of that


---------96:12----------
month where i did feel really close to


---------96:13----------
myself like


---------96:15----------
uh there was just like a


---------96:18----------
there was just a night where i just and


---------96:20----------
it was very cathartic and


---------96:22----------
very good but i just like sat and cried


---------96:25----------
for


---------96:25----------
like and it came out of nowhere but i


---------96:28----------
just


---------96:28----------
sobbed on my kitchen floor uh for like


---------96:31----------
15 or 20 minutes


---------96:33----------
out of nowhere and like it was really


---------96:36----------
good


---------96:37----------
because i think that i don't allow


---------96:41----------
or like subconsciously i don't allow


---------96:43----------
myself to


---------96:44----------
feel my like deep emotions all that much


---------96:48----------
and i think that's a thing that a lot of


---------96:49----------
youtubers struggle with because we sort


---------96:51----------
of like wear this mask of like okay i


---------96:53----------
need to make a video now i need to go on


---------96:54----------
stream now


---------96:55----------
time to be happy because we need to do


---------96:57----------
an alexathymia workshop for y'all


---------96:59----------
but okay yeah um that's uh


---------97:03----------
that's something that my therapist uh


---------97:05----------
brought up like a


---------97:06----------
month or two ago she's like i think that


---------97:08----------
you have alexa thymey and i was like i


---------97:09----------
don't know what that is and explained it


---------97:11----------
and i was like oh


---------97:12----------
yeah because i uh i can only this is


---------97:15----------
something that we've been working on


---------97:16----------
is that when she asked me how i'm doing


---------97:19----------
or how something affects me


---------97:21----------
most of the time my go-to thing is weird


---------97:23----------
or fine


---------97:24----------
and i have such a hard time explaining


---------97:27----------
how


---------97:28----------
something actually makes me feel can you


---------97:30----------
explain to people what alexa thymey is


---------97:33----------
uh from my understanding of it it's sort


---------97:35----------
of the inability


---------97:36----------
to uh


---------97:41----------
the inability to express uh


---------97:44----------
or articulate your emotions i guess well


---------97:47----------
said so i kind of think about it as


---------97:49----------
someone who's colorblind to emotion


---------97:51----------
yeah that's a good way of putting it


---------97:53----------
right so it's like it's like


---------97:55----------
and so we see this a lot actually in in


---------97:57----------
men especially because


---------97:59----------
men are actually conditioned to suppress


---------98:01----------
emotions and like not recognize them


---------98:03----------
so men are allowed to feel basically one


---------98:06----------
emotion any guess what it is


---------98:09----------
there's one emotion that's socially


---------98:10----------
acceptable for us to express


---------98:13----------
anger absolutely absolutely right so


---------98:16----------
like even when we get shamed and we get


---------98:19----------
dumped we feel pissed off yeah


---------98:22----------
it's the only real thing that we


---------98:23----------
understand like it's like you could


---------98:25----------
tell anger but everything else is weird


---------98:28----------
yeah and even positive emotions are like


---------98:30----------
oh it's fine


---------98:32----------
you don't you don't walk in and say like


---------98:34----------
i feel like validated because people


---------98:36----------
love me in the world and i feel like


---------98:37----------
loved and appreciated like you still


---------98:39----------
like you're just not taught how to even


---------98:41----------
recognize that like i feel good today


---------98:43----------
why do you feel good i i don't know i


---------98:45----------
don't know it's fine i'm just i'm just


---------98:47----------
surviving


---------98:48----------
i'm vibing today you know it's


---------98:51----------
yeah yeah so so alexa time


---------98:55----------
is like not knowing what you feel and


---------98:57----------
then the challenge is that like it's


---------98:58----------
hard to


---------98:59----------
you know process like what you don't


---------99:01----------
which you can't


---------99:02----------
feel or can't articulate


---------99:05----------
and and then you know in medicine we


---------99:07----------
have a saying that good diagnosis


---------99:08----------
precedes good treatment and i think the


---------99:10----------
big problem with lexithymia is that like


---------99:12----------
when we're


---------99:13----------
when we don't know what we feel like we


---------99:15----------
can't really fix it


---------99:16----------
because are you feeling sad are you


---------99:18----------
feeling ashamed are you feeling afraid


---------99:20----------
you know are you feeling guilty


---------99:24----------
all these things are important and even


---------99:25----------
like solidifying like the positive


---------99:27----------
feelings is actually really important


---------99:29----------
too


---------99:30----------
yeah um but yeah i'm gonna have to think


---------99:33----------
about that


---------99:34----------
but anyway i'm sorry you were saying


---------99:36----------
something else i kind of jumped in


---------99:38----------
with alex i just made a side comment


---------99:39----------
about i don't remember


---------99:41----------
okay um yeah and then i think the last


---------99:45----------
thing that i just want to toss your way


---------99:46----------
is like


---------99:47----------
i think ethan for someone who is as


---------99:49----------
contemplative as you are


---------99:51----------
so i'd tack one more thing i think


---------99:52----------
you're insightful but i think you're


---------99:53----------
also like a thinker


---------99:55----------
i get the sense that you know you may


---------99:57----------
not really view yourself this way


---------99:58----------
because of the adhd


---------100:00----------
but like like you think i get the sense


---------100:02----------
you think about stuff


---------100:04----------
um and so one thing that i would really


---------100:07----------
encourage you to also kind of do going


---------100:09----------
forward is like think about why you


---------100:12----------
so like you know i personally do derive


---------100:14----------
a lot of value from like


---------100:16----------
thinking about karma um and i don't know


---------100:20----------
whether it's real or not real


---------100:22----------
but there's good scientific evidence


---------100:23----------
that having


---------100:25----------
an internally consistent way that you


---------100:27----------
view the world


---------100:28----------
is like a good way to find like peace


---------100:30----------
and happiness and stability and builds


---------100:32----------
resilience


---------100:33----------
it doesn't say that a particular way is


---------100:36----------
superior to other ways so it's not like


---------100:38----------
the christian model is like better or


---------100:40----------
worse than the hindu model


---------100:41----------
but that just or even like being like a


---------100:43----------
secular humanist is totally fine too


---------100:46----------
but there is good data that spending


---------100:47----------
some time thinking about it and then


---------100:49----------
coming to your own conclusions about


---------100:51----------
like


---------100:52----------
what is the way that i'm viewing my life


---------100:55----------
in existence can be helpful


---------100:57----------
what do you think about exploring things


---------100:58----------
like the theory of karma and stuff like


---------101:00----------
that


---------101:03----------
uh yeah i mean i'm always open to like


---------101:06----------
exploring and uh and just


---------101:09----------
gaining knowledge about stuff because


---------101:11----------
that's not something that i've even


---------101:13----------
ever really dived into ever okay


---------101:16----------
i think it could help you answer these


---------101:18----------
questions like why you


---------101:20----------
like why are you lucky like why have you


---------101:22----------
seen so much success over the last year


---------101:23----------
when other people are struggling


---------101:25----------
and then i think there's another piece


---------101:27----------
of that which is that like


---------101:28----------
if you are lucky like what do you what


---------101:31----------
do you do with it


---------101:32----------
yeah you're saying yeah like that that


---------101:36----------
sort of struck a chord what do you


---------101:37----------
can you share a little bit yeah i mean


---------101:41----------
i i feel like i struggle with that a lot


---------101:44----------
where


---------101:45----------
where it's like okay like i am very


---------101:48----------
lucky to be


---------101:49----------
where i am like i have influence and


---------101:53----------
you know i'm successful and blah blah


---------101:55----------
blah but there's a lot of times where


---------101:57----------
i'm like


---------101:58----------
what the [ __ ] am i doing like yeah i


---------102:01----------
don't know


---------102:01----------
where i i feel sometimes


---------102:04----------
that i'm that i'm not


---------102:08----------
using what i have in the in the correct


---------102:10----------
way


---------102:11----------
yep yeah good i'm i'm very happy to hear


---------102:15----------
that


---------102:16----------
because i i think that's what makes the


---------102:18----------
world a better place


---------102:20----------
when people have resources and have


---------102:22----------
talents


---------102:23----------
and they think to themselves am i using


---------102:25----------
this the best way that i can i think


---------102:27----------
like that's


---------102:28----------
where the light in the world comes from


---------102:30----------
it's like when people like you are like


---------102:31----------
hey maybe i can do something and you


---------102:33----------
don't have to be big you know i think


---------102:35----------
it's just everyone has resources at


---------102:36----------
their disposal


---------102:38----------
um but yeah ethan i


---------102:42----------
can i pause for a second and maybe even


---------102:44----------
start with a little bit of an apology


---------102:46----------
yeah sure so here's here's what i i sort


---------102:50----------
of got from our conversation today


---------102:52----------
and i just want to make sure that you


---------102:54----------
know i feel bad if this wasn't really


---------102:55----------
what you were looking for it wasn't


---------102:57----------
helpful but


---------102:58----------
when i talk to you and when i listen to


---------102:59----------
you like here's what i see


---------103:01----------
there's a psychological component


---------103:03----------
there's this some scar of feeling stupid


---------103:05----------
and whatnot


---------103:06----------
and and you know like that was born in a


---------103:09----------
particular place you carry it around


---------103:10----------
with you it activates when you you when


---------103:12----------
you see the toilet flush that's when you


---------103:14----------
think toilet


---------103:15----------
so when you're in a group of people like


---------103:16----------
you're gonna be transported


---------103:18----------
and maybe this is a better way to put it


---------103:20----------
i think you become


---------103:21----------
eight-year-old ethan yeah in your mind


---------103:24----------
right and it's weird because that can


---------103:26----------
co-exist with successful ethan


---------103:28----------
like here's one ethan who's like oh like


---------103:30----------
how do i use my resources to better


---------103:32----------
you like make the world a better place


---------103:34----------
and like what do i do about like making


---------103:36----------
oh i want to help the universe


---------103:38----------
and then there's like oh my god stay


---------103:39----------
quiet don't open your mouth because


---------103:41----------
you're an idiot and you'll never


---------103:42----------
you know yeah you can't this is weird


---------103:44----------
right


---------103:45----------
so the thing about a some scar is that


---------103:47----------
the emotional energy retains the age at


---------103:50----------
which it was formed


---------103:51----------
so in psychology we call this regression


---------103:54----------
but you get like


---------103:55----------
your mind like boots up an old version


---------103:58----------
of your os


---------103:59----------
yeah and so it's really weird and it can


---------104:02----------
be really confusing but the first thing


---------104:04----------
to understand is that those can


---------104:06----------
coexist right i can like i can i forget


---------104:09----------
what it what's even called when you


---------104:11----------
have like linux installed on a windows


---------104:13----------
machine or


---------104:14----------
uh oh yeah you got like multiple os's


---------104:20----------
and you run one os inside the other dual


---------104:23----------
boot


---------104:25----------
yeah i don't remember i used to know


---------104:27----------
this kind of stuff but


---------104:28----------
anyway so it's like you've got these


---------104:29----------
multiple os so that's the psychological


---------104:31----------
component you know if you have


---------104:32----------
i'm going to give you a chance to ask


---------104:34----------
practical questions so that's where we


---------104:35----------
kind of started with


---------104:36----------
understanding the nature of mind


---------104:37----------
understanding what a samskara is how


---------104:39----------
that emotional energy gets stored it


---------104:40----------
gets called up


---------104:41----------
doesn't mean you're stupid it just means


---------104:43----------
that there's an eight-year-old


---------104:44----------
kid who feels stupid who is then


---------104:48----------
maximizing on your desktop and covering


---------104:50----------
all of your conscious space


---------104:52----------
yeah second thing is that you know some


---------104:54----------
of those insecurities like unworthiness


---------104:56----------
and stuff


---------104:57----------
can get exacerbated by youtube and


---------104:58----------
social media and that has to do with as


---------105:01----------
long as you aren't grounded with


---------105:02----------
who you are on the inside all of that


---------105:05----------
external stuff


---------105:06----------
is going to determine who you are


---------105:10----------
because the mind needs some kind of


---------105:12----------
identity


---------105:13----------
and if it can't figure out who we are if


---------105:15----------
i ask you who you are and you can't


---------105:16----------
answer that question


---------105:17----------
your mind is going to fill it up with


---------105:18----------
whatever you see on social media


---------105:21----------
that impostor syndrome is going to be an


---------105:22----------
escalation of external value that is out


---------105:25----------
of proportion with your internal value


---------105:28----------
and this once again gets to why it's


---------105:30----------
important to figure out who you are


---------105:32----------
because as you ask as you understand who


---------105:34----------
you are that's going to even things out


---------105:36----------
and then the imposter syndrome will melt


---------105:37----------
away


---------105:37----------
literally i've seen it melt away with


---------105:40----------
people once they understand who they are


---------105:42----------
yeah then we didn't really quite get


---------105:45----------
into why opening up is difficult but i


---------105:47----------
think like


---------105:48----------
ultimately you know you should ask this


---------105:50----------
question we kind of have this kind of


---------105:51----------
spiritual component towards the end


---------105:53----------
which is like


---------105:54----------
discovering who you are because you


---------105:56----------
didn't well know you know you just can't


---------105:57----------
put words to it


---------105:58----------
but you can say like i was close to


---------106:00----------
myself then i sat down on the kitchen


---------106:02----------
core


---------106:02----------
for i cried and so for you to actually


---------106:05----------
learn the systematic process of


---------106:07----------
discovering who you are


---------106:09----------
re-accessing who you are on a daily


---------106:11----------
basis


---------106:12----------
so you can kind of check in and be with


---------106:14----------
yourself every single day


---------106:15----------
and that the more you move towards that


---------106:17----------
person and the more that that person


---------106:19----------
grows within you


---------106:20----------
there's a part of you like i know i mean


---------106:22----------
i don't know but i'm gonna predict ethan


---------106:24----------
that there are times where you have this


---------106:26----------
idea and then you're gonna be like i


---------106:28----------
wanna do this thing like this thing that


---------106:29----------
you were talking about


---------106:30----------
deleting all your videos and there's


---------106:32----------
probably another part of you that like


---------106:33----------
thinks to himself like what if everyone


---------106:35----------
thinks it's stupid


---------106:37----------
and then you're like you know what i'm


---------106:39----------
gonna do it anyway because i think it's


---------106:40----------
fun


---------106:41----------
and so there are times where you shine


---------106:43----------
forward and overcome


---------106:45----------
all of the other voices telling you like


---------106:47----------
oh what if it doesn't work or what if it


---------106:48----------
thinks it's stupid


---------106:49----------
but in that journey ultimately i don't


---------106:51----------
think has to do with the psychology of


---------106:52----------
imposter syndrome i don't think has to


---------106:54----------
do with like your some scars i think


---------106:56----------
that journey is a spiritual one


---------106:58----------
and so what i want to apologize for is i


---------107:00----------
feel like i've introduced a lot of


---------107:01----------
different concepts and i've left you


---------107:03----------
hanging on each one


---------107:05----------
no i think that this was really good


---------107:07----------
like


---------107:08----------
it it just makes me think a lot more


---------107:11----------
about


---------107:12----------
again about like who i am as a person


---------107:14----------
because that's not something that i


---------107:16----------
really ever think about um and it also


---------107:20----------
i don't know makes me think about my


---------107:22----------
past a lot and


---------107:23----------
and why i have certain feelings about


---------107:26----------
things and like


---------107:27----------
again going back to being like oh man i


---------107:31----------
really had to like off a version of


---------107:34----------
myself


---------107:35----------
like that uh and i i think


---------107:38----------
again like that's something as a male


---------107:41----------
that


---------107:42----------
we have an issue with is like i suppress


---------107:45----------
a ton of stuff and it's like oh did i


---------107:48----------
ever


---------107:48----------
really processed that of like having to


---------107:51----------
go through that


---------107:52----------
and like you know going away from this


---------107:55----------
other


---------107:56----------
version of myself that was a giant part


---------107:59----------
of my life for such a long time like i


---------108:01----------
never


---------108:02----------
i've never really processed that before


---------108:06----------
or even really thought about it at all


---------108:08----------
if i'm being honest


---------108:10----------
yeah okay is there anything that um i


---------108:13----------
can


---------108:13----------
help you with or anything that you want


---------108:15----------
more direction on


---------108:20----------
um yeah i guess sort of like


---------108:25----------
figuring out who who


---------108:28----------
i am and that's that's obviously like a


---------108:31----------
very


---------108:32----------
broad thing but like i don't even know


---------108:34----------
where to start of


---------108:36----------
i don't even know where to start there


---------108:38----------
and that that's something that i think


---------108:40----------
coincides with like


---------108:41----------
self-love too because i i think that i


---------108:44----------
have a really hard time with that


---------108:46----------
and i think that i i don't have a super


---------108:48----------
great impression of


---------108:50----------
myself and i don't even know where to


---------108:52----------
begin


---------108:53----------
with that like how do you even begin


---------108:55----------
with like loving yourself


---------108:58----------
and like because it's not like i hate


---------109:00----------
myself but it's


---------109:01----------
i don't know where to start you know


---------109:03----------
what i mean yeah i i know exactly what


---------109:05----------
you mean


---------109:12----------
um


---------109:14----------
me just let me just think for a second


---------109:20----------
i want to share with something with you


---------109:21----------
but for some reason i feel like it's


---------109:23----------
it feels a little bit promotional to me


---------109:25----------
and i don't want to do that and i'm just


---------109:26----------
trying can i just like think through why


---------109:36----------
okay i'm just going to steer clear of


---------109:37----------
that um


---------109:39----------
i made this guide to meditation and and


---------109:45----------
let me just think okay because i think


---------109:47----------
it does illustrate the point well but i


---------109:49----------
don't wanna


---------109:55----------
it feels to me like i'm i'm gonna


---------109:57----------
advertise for something but i just don't


---------109:59----------
want to


---------110:00----------
but i think it's actually it's this is


---------110:02----------
why i made it


---------110:03----------
this is a common problem so people have


---------110:06----------
been asking me like in our community for


---------110:08----------
a long time like


---------110:09----------
what is like how do i figure out like


---------110:13----------
who i am


---------110:14----------
and so this is where i draw a little bit


---------110:15----------
on eastern spirituality but like we


---------110:17----------
basically made this course on meditation


---------110:19----------
hopefully it'll come out in a couple


---------110:20----------
months


---------110:21----------
um but a big part of this is something


---------110:23----------
called the the atman pada


---------110:24----------
so atman means soul or self and pada


---------110:27----------
means path


---------110:29----------
and so there is some like stuff about


---------110:31----------
figuring out like what is the nature of


---------110:34----------
self


---------110:35----------
i don't know if that makes sense or not


---------110:36----------
but like yeah it's interesting because


---------110:38----------
we don't really


---------110:39----------
think about it we don't like really get


---------110:42----------
taught


---------110:43----------
what it is so my hope is that you know


---------110:45----------
this


---------110:46----------
will help people on their journey and i


---------110:49----------
would encourage you to check it out


---------110:50----------
because


---------110:51----------
i'm going to answer your question now


---------110:52----------
but like there's more detail about it


---------110:54----------
that i i like to share so it's a whole


---------110:57----------
set of things like practices and


---------110:59----------
and understanding but let's start here


---------111:00----------
okay did that feel


---------111:02----------
like i just felt like it was


---------111:03----------
inappropriate to try to i mean i'm


---------111:05----------
trying to promote it it's just


---------111:07----------
i just it felt like i mean you have


---------111:09----------
resources that you've made to help


---------111:11----------
people with the exact same questions but


---------111:13----------
it just it felt like


---------111:15----------
disingenuous for some reason it did not


---------111:17----------
come across


---------111:18----------
that way at all um so here's what i


---------111:20----------
would say like so the first thing is


---------111:22----------
that like discovering who you are is


---------111:24----------
absolutely a process and there are


---------111:25----------
a bunch of different steps okay so


---------111:27----------
there's an experiential route


---------111:30----------
right which we touched on today and if


---------111:32----------
you liked that kind of thing


---------111:34----------
then i can guide you more there i'm


---------111:36----------
going to give you like some kind of


---------111:37----------
practice


---------111:38----------
in the next five minutes there's also


---------111:40----------
like sort of a journaling


---------111:42----------
or almost like intellectual or


---------111:44----------
contemplative route


---------111:46----------
which is like using like logic


---------111:47----------
philosophy thinking maybe taking a long


---------111:49----------
walk it's not an experience


---------111:52----------
so if i were to ask you to find


---------111:54----------
masculinity within yourself if you


---------111:55----------
identify as a man


---------111:57----------
that's an experiential thing yeah so


---------112:00----------
there's a little bit more of like a


---------112:01----------
philosophical or


---------112:02----------
intellectual or contemplative approach


---------112:04----------
which is separate from the experiential


---------112:06----------
approach


---------112:07----------
and then the third thing that i'm going


---------112:08----------
to offer you is


---------112:11----------
um hold on let me think what was the


---------112:15----------
third thing


---------112:16----------
oh yeah the third thing is something


---------112:17----------
relating to dreams and nightmares


---------112:18----------
because maybe we can hit two birds with


---------112:20----------
one stone there


---------112:21----------
but there's particularly a practice


---------112:22----------
which i think will give you a clue as to


---------112:24----------
who you truly are


---------112:26----------
that that relates to dreams and


---------112:28----------
nightmares


---------112:30----------
um so which one do you want do you want


---------112:32----------
the experiential one the dreams and


---------112:33----------
nightmares one


---------112:34----------
or the contemplative philosophical


---------112:38----------
uh let's do


---------112:42----------
the experiential one


---------112:45----------
okay


---------112:57----------
do you meditate i don't um


---------113:00----------
and that's something that i've wanted to


---------113:02----------
do and i've tried before


---------113:04----------
um and i've had a really hard time doing


---------113:07----------
it because i get too distracted


---------113:08----------
and my mind just like goes everywhere um


---------113:12----------
and i because that's something that i


---------113:14----------
would really like to do and i think that


---------113:16----------
i would benefit from it but i don't


---------113:17----------
really know how


---------113:18----------
to how to do it with my brain


---------113:21----------
beautiful okay this is gonna be this is


---------113:23----------
gonna be easy easy peasy loving squeezy


---------113:25----------
okay


---------113:26----------
we're gonna do two we're gonna do two or


---------113:27----------
three birds with one stone


---------113:29----------
so what we're gonna do is use your adhd


---------113:32----------
to help you figure out who you are


---------113:35----------
so this is what we're gonna do we're


---------113:36----------
gonna i'm gonna teach you a regular


---------113:37----------
meditation practice which you're gonna


---------113:38----------
be terrible at


---------113:40----------
great and then what we're going to do is


---------113:42----------
the real meditation practice behind that


---------113:44----------
which is going to trick you into


---------113:45----------
discovering who you are


---------113:47----------
great okay so i'm going to give you


---------113:49----------
meditation practice and this is what's


---------113:50----------
going to happen


---------113:51----------
your mind is not going to want to do it


---------113:54----------
and then there is going to be a part of


---------113:56----------
you that tries to force your mind into


---------113:58----------
doing it


---------113:59----------
does that make sense and so then the


---------114:02----------
question that i really want you to pay


---------114:03----------
attention you can fail catastrophically


---------114:05----------
at the meditation practice


---------114:07----------
let your adhd mind is wander as much as


---------114:09----------
you want to i mean


---------114:10----------
don't let it go but try to pull it back


---------114:12----------
and what i really want you to pay


---------114:14----------
attention to


---------114:15----------
is what is the part of you that is


---------114:17----------
pulling your mind back


---------114:20----------
what is that right because if if we're


---------114:22----------
saying that your mind is doing one thing


---------114:26----------
what is the part of you that is


---------114:27----------
controlling your mind


---------114:31----------
does that make sense yeah so we're gonna


---------114:34----------
go like a two-layer deep


---------114:36----------
meditation technique where if you


---------114:37----------
succeed great then you learned how to


---------114:39----------
meditate and your mind paid attention


---------114:41----------
no big deal wonderful okay we've


---------114:44----------
tricked you into meditating and even if


---------114:46----------
you fail i want you to just notice


---------114:48----------
what is the part of you that is


---------114:50----------
intending


---------114:52----------
and what is the part of you that is


---------114:53----------
failing does that make sense


---------114:55----------
yeah and then try to figure out which


---------114:58----------
one is the real you


---------114:59----------
okay so next question i'll give you so


---------115:02----------
now we have to come up with a generic


---------115:03----------
meditation


---------115:04----------
technique i really like to start with


---------115:05----------
something for some people who have adhd


---------115:07----------
i do something called alternate nostril


---------115:09----------
breathing have you ever heard of that or


---------115:11----------
tried that


---------115:12----------
i'm not okay so i like this practice


---------115:14----------
because


---------115:15----------
it isn't easy to do so if you think


---------115:17----------
about the mind with adhd


---------115:19----------
if it's very if i sat you if i told you


---------115:21----------
to close your eyes and observe your


---------115:23----------
breath


---------115:23----------
what would your mind do i'd start


---------115:26----------
manually breathing


---------115:28----------
okay good and then what would your mind


---------115:30----------
do uh


---------115:31----------
probably trail off um


---------115:34----------
yeah so so with the mind with adhd we


---------115:37----------
need to give you something


---------115:38----------
harder to do and the more difficult it


---------115:41----------
is to do


---------115:42----------
like the more balls your mind has to


---------115:45----------
juggle the more


---------115:46----------
likely you are to successfully meditate


---------115:48----------
okay okay


---------115:49----------
so i'm going to teach you a weird


---------115:50----------
pattern of breathing that you kind of


---------115:52----------
like


---------115:52----------
is hard to do and that's going to


---------115:54----------
hopefully help us okay


---------115:56----------
so it's going to be failures upon


---------115:57----------
failures upon failures so first of all


---------115:59----------
take your right hand okay can you


---------116:02----------
fold can i see it can you move it in


---------116:04----------
front of the camera yeah


---------116:06----------
it can you fold the the these two


---------116:08----------
fingers down


---------116:10----------
yep good okay so now what we're going to


---------116:12----------
do is i'm going to take my right


---------116:14----------
thumb and block my right nostril very


---------116:16----------
good


---------116:17----------
and i'm going to breathe in through my


---------116:18----------
left


---------116:21----------
now i'm going to block the left nostril


---------116:25----------
yep pinky yep pinky good exhale


---------116:30----------
breathe in through the same nostril


---------116:34----------
switch breathe out exhale


---------116:40----------
in


---------116:45----------
switch out


---------116:50----------
in


---------116:55----------
switch out


---------117:00----------
we're going to pause for a second you


---------117:02----------
got the hang of it


---------117:04----------
yeah so it's confusing because you're


---------117:06----------
going to breathe in switch


---------117:07----------
and breathe out and then you breathe in


---------117:10----------
again


---------117:11----------
so you always switch on a full breath


---------117:13----------
okay


---------117:14----------
what some people want to do is they want


---------117:16----------
to go in


---------117:18----------
out switch incorrect


---------117:22----------
yeah it's in and then what


---------117:25----------
and then switch and then what and then


---------117:28----------
out


---------117:28----------
and then what and then in and then what


---------117:31----------
and then switch and then out


---------117:33----------
beautiful okay so we're going to do this


---------117:36----------
for like


---------117:37----------
how long you want to do it however long


---------117:40----------
it takes


---------117:41----------
okay we're going to do like one to three


---------117:43----------
minutes okay


---------117:45----------
so i want you to do that and if your


---------117:48----------
mind wanders


---------117:49----------
we're gonna stack stuff up so we're


---------117:51----------
gonna go straight to hard mode okay so


---------117:53----------
we're not if


---------117:53----------
you just get if this is enough to occupy


---------117:55----------
your mind and it's all you can handle


---------117:57----------
that's great then we've tricked you into


---------117:58----------
meditating


---------118:00----------
here's a question what should i be


---------118:02----------
thinking about


---------118:04----------
focus on maintaining the the the rhythm


---------118:08----------
okay okay if your mind starts to wander


---------118:14----------
just try to make sure you're doing the


---------118:16----------
practice properly


---------118:17----------
or what you can do is focus on the


---------118:19----------
sensation of the breath


---------118:21----------
entering and leaving okay


---------118:24----------
cool i know it sounds weird what you


---------118:26----------
should be yeah and then remember if your


---------118:27----------
mind starts to wander


---------118:29----------
let it come back to the breath and then


---------118:32----------
pay attention to who's bringing the mind


---------118:34----------
back


---------118:35----------
okay okay so we're gonna do this for


---------118:38----------
like three minutes


---------118:39----------
so close your eyes sit up straight


---------118:42----------
and fail go


---------119:28----------
hey


---------119:42----------
me


---------120:10----------
yes


---------120:38----------
so


---------120:52----------
okay go ahead and finish the round that


---------120:54----------
you're on


---------120:56----------
let your eyes stay closed for a second


---------121:06----------
okay so i'm gonna ask


---------121:10----------
what is your mind doing now what was


---------121:13----------
your mind doing


---------121:14----------
during the practice um


---------121:18----------
it feels a little lighter now i guess is


---------121:22----------
how i would describe it


---------121:23----------
uh-huh during it i was going back and


---------121:26----------
forth


---------121:27----------
between focusing on breathing


---------121:30----------
and noticing how congested i am okay


---------121:34----------
um we're also thinking about uh


---------121:37----------
what twitch chat was saying while i was


---------121:40----------
doing that


---------121:40----------
okay so what so i want you to


---------121:45----------
so thinking was your mind


---------121:49----------
what was the focusing on your breathing


---------121:53----------
is that mind


---------122:01----------
i would assume it's also mine just a


---------122:04----------
different part of mind


---------122:06----------
okay more like focused like


---------122:09----------
i want to do the thing okay and and


---------122:12----------
what so when you started thinking about


---------122:14----------
what twitch hat was thinking about


---------122:16----------
yeah and you returned to focusing on the


---------122:19----------
breath or once twitch had entered the


---------122:21----------
picture it's hard to get them out


---------122:24----------
uh it was very ping-pongy so it was like


---------122:29----------
a thought would enter about chat and


---------122:31----------
then i'd be like no focus on the


---------122:33----------
breathing and then i'd go back to


---------122:34----------
focusing on the breathing and then i'd


---------122:37----------
switch to this nostril and i'd be like


---------122:39----------
wow it's really hard to breathe out of


---------122:40----------
that


---------122:42----------
okay nostril then i'd be like no back to


---------122:43----------
breathing okay so now open your eyes


---------122:47----------
so there's a lot going on there first of


---------122:49----------
all i think you did a fantastic job


---------122:51----------
cool okay so here's why even though you


---------122:55----------
were thinking about a lot of stuff


---------122:57----------
so many important things there that are


---------122:58----------
so subtle so the first is that


---------123:01----------
i want you to notice the interaction


---------123:03----------
between


---------123:04----------
noticing and thought so before you


---------123:07----------
think about how congested you are what


---------123:10----------
has to happen first


---------123:14----------
like the spark of the idea in the back


---------123:17----------
of my mind


---------123:17----------
so the noticing happens first and you


---------123:19----------
say spark of idea in the back of your


---------123:21----------
mind


---------123:22----------
it's not in your mind it's actually


---------123:23----------
outside of your mind yeah


---------123:25----------
so this is where the mind is a thinking


---------123:28----------
machine


---------123:28----------
it's where we experience thoughts and


---------123:30----------
emotions and have identities


---------123:32----------
about ourselves our ego our emotions and


---------123:35----------
our intellect all exist within our mind


---------123:38----------
when you watch a sunset and it's


---------123:41----------
beautiful and you're just like vibing


---------123:46----------
that's not really thinking it's not


---------123:49----------
really emotion it's not


---------123:50----------
joy or sadness there's not really ego


---------123:53----------
you're not like oh like if you take a


---------123:55----------
picture like if you take a selfie of


---------123:56----------
yourself then that becomes ego


---------123:59----------
but if you're just enjoying the


---------124:00----------
experience


---------124:02----------
that's not actually inside mind it's


---------124:04----------
actually outside of mind


---------124:06----------
does that make sense yeah so the yogis


---------124:10----------
hypothesize that the noticing capacity


---------124:12----------
actually exists outside of mind


---------124:14----------
and what happens is you notice something


---------124:16----------
like my nostril is congested


---------124:18----------
and then your mind starts to make


---------124:21----------
judgments about it


---------124:22----------
does that make sense it starts thinking


---------124:25----------
hypothesizing


---------124:26----------
oh man this is crazy what are they gonna


---------124:28----------
think can they hear it


---------124:30----------
there goes the mind yep


---------124:33----------
right do they think that i'm super


---------124:35----------
congested can they tell


---------124:37----------
there's the ego right


---------124:40----------
and then what did you do did you let go


---------124:43----------
of those thoughts and come back to the


---------124:44----------
breath


---------124:46----------
yeah how


---------124:52----------
by i guess by me


---------124:55----------
noticing that i wasn't on the breathing


---------124:59----------
that i wasn't focusing on the breathing


---------125:01----------
and then so


---------125:02----------
i almost like got distracted by


---------125:05----------
going back to the breathing yes yeah


---------125:08----------
very good


---------125:08----------
so noticing you're like oh


---------125:12----------
my mind has run over there now so now


---------125:15----------
the question


---------125:16----------
i know it was your first time but i'm


---------125:18----------
gonna ask you what the hell is it that


---------125:20----------
does the noticing


---------125:24----------
because if your mind is distracted how


---------125:26----------
are you able to


---------125:27----------
like what is it that's pulling the mind


---------125:29----------
because we've concluded the mind is


---------125:30----------
running out of like ryan is like oh my


---------125:32----------
god what does switch chat think about


---------125:33----------
the sound of my congested ass nostril


---------125:37----------
that's what your mind is doing yeah so


---------125:40----------
what is that


---------125:41----------
how are you if your mind is by


---------125:43----------
definition distracted


---------125:44----------
how can you undistract it doesn't make


---------125:46----------
sense you can't undistract yourself


---------125:48----------
right there's the second faculty and


---------125:50----------
like does that


---------125:52----------
sort of make sense something is outside


---------125:54----------
of the mind and like


---------125:55----------
tugging on it you're like get back


---------125:59----------
yeah and then the mind


---------126:02----------
and then you focus on the breathing and


---------126:04----------
then what happens in your mind


---------126:08----------
and then i notice something again


---------126:12----------
of like mostly my nostril


---------126:15----------
because i can feel it yep so then you


---------126:19----------
notice


---------126:19----------
and then the mind starts again because


---------126:21----------
boy does the mind


---------126:22----------
love to like you know think like oh like


---------126:26----------
if we think about social anxiety like


---------126:27----------
oh that person is looking at me he must


---------126:29----------
think i'm stupid


---------126:31----------
there's just a noticing there's an


---------126:33----------
observation that our mind attaches all


---------126:35----------
this crap to it


---------126:36----------
yeah and then it goes off to the races


---------126:40----------
you can yawn or sneeze whichever you


---------126:41----------
need to do bro i'm not sure which one it


---------126:44----------
was going to be


---------126:45----------
just like my face made a face all right


---------126:48----------
so so maybe that's that's your body or


---------126:51----------
brain's way of signaling


---------126:53----------
maybe this is a good place to stop i


---------126:55----------
think it is a good place to stop


---------126:56----------
but i want you to just appreciate that


---------126:59----------
there is some capacity


---------127:01----------
outside of your mind that can restrain


---------127:04----------
your mind


---------127:05----------
and that's what i'm going to hypothesize


---------127:06----------
to you is actually closest to the real


---------127:09----------
you


---------127:10----------
because i'd say that all of your best


---------127:12----------
inspiration doesn't come


---------127:14----------
from the mind it comes from that thing


---------127:17----------
and then your mind starts to shape it


---------127:19----------
think about how to execute it and all


---------127:21----------
that kind of stuff but that the


---------127:22----------
inspiration actually comes from outside


---------127:24----------
of mind what do you think about that


---------127:26----------
yeah that that makes a lot of sense


---------127:28----------
actually


---------127:30----------
uh because there's a i don't know a lot


---------127:32----------
of times where


---------127:33----------
i'll just have like a random idea that


---------127:35----------
comes kind of


---------127:36----------
out of nowhere and then i start thinking


---------127:39----------
about it


---------127:40----------
exactly so the thinking is separate from


---------127:42----------
the birth of the random idea


---------127:44----------
so spend time in that space and now i'm


---------127:46----------
gonna ask you


---------127:47----------
that noticing capacity if that's outside


---------127:50----------
of the mind


---------127:51----------
what is it or what are the qualities of


---------127:54----------
it


---------127:57----------
uh


---------128:00----------
that is correct that is correct that is


---------128:04----------
exactly correct


---------128:07----------
so ultimately what the yogis concluded


---------128:09----------
is that it doesn't have


---------128:11----------
qualities yeah because like even when


---------128:14----------
you're like


---------128:15----------
i don't know how to describe it that is


---------128:16----------
correct it cannot be described


---------128:19----------
it is formless and this so this is the


---------128:22----------
thing and now we're going to


---------128:23----------
kind of get to the punch line right so


---------128:25----------
like this is something normally that i


---------128:26----------
don't


---------128:26----------
you know i teach people over the course


---------128:28----------
of weeks but now i'm going to give you a


---------128:29----------
hypothesis


---------128:30----------
for you to test and tear apart is that


---------128:33----------
that observing capacity


---------128:34----------
is what they call divine it is actually


---------128:37----------
formless


---------128:38----------
and like it doesn't have qualities it is


---------128:40----------
neither good nor bad


---------128:42----------
it is just it is what is it is that


---------128:45----------
which notices


---------128:46----------
everything else it's kind of like


---------128:49----------
you know there's if i watch tv like


---------128:51----------
there's water on the screen but is the


---------128:53----------
water on the screen wet


---------128:57----------
so if i'm sitting in the theater


---------128:59----------
everything that happens in the screen of


---------129:01----------
the mind


---------129:02----------
can happen on the screen of the mind but


---------129:04----------
sitting in the theater i can never get


---------129:06----------
wet no matter how


---------129:07----------
hard of a storm there is on the tv


---------129:09----------
screen yeah


---------129:10----------
and so all of the qualities that we


---------129:12----------
think of in life happen inside our mind


---------129:14----------
oh i'm better than this person i'm worse


---------129:16----------
than this person


---------129:17----------
i'm successful i'm on sex all that


---------129:19----------
shit's in the mind


---------129:20----------
it's not really who you are and as we


---------129:22----------
tunnel down and like


---------129:23----------
adult child whatever like it's not who


---------129:25----------
you are what you are is that thing


---------129:28----------
and the closer you get to that thing the


---------129:31----------
better you'll feel


---------129:32----------
and when you're cur when you're


---------129:34----------
constantly grounded in that thing


---------129:36----------
you will have attained enlightenment


---------129:38----------
which is what would the talked about


---------129:45----------
this was really really great by the way


---------129:47----------
okay good good it


---------129:48----------
really got me thinking a lot


---------129:50----------
[Laughter]


---------129:51----------
and also thinking about how to not think


---------129:54----------
there we go


---------129:55----------
well's done yeah


---------130:00----------
good job ethan so listen yeah i'm really


---------130:03----------
happy to hear that


---------130:04----------
so you know i yeah spend more time in


---------130:07----------
that space


---------130:08----------
and even if your mind wanders if your


---------130:10----------
mind can get feels congested


---------130:12----------
that's totally fine because the other


---------130:15----------
thing that you're doing i know this


---------130:16----------
sounds weird


---------130:17----------
but every time your mind wanders and you


---------130:19----------
bring it back


---------130:21----------
what you're actually doing that's


---------130:22----------
actually a mental push-up


---------130:24----------
so if you think about adhd adhd is your


---------130:27----------
mind


---------130:28----------
wandering around without any kind of


---------130:30----------
direction because when you were eight


---------130:31----------
years old what did you want your mind to


---------130:33----------
do


---------130:35----------
i wanted to focus absolutely


---------130:38----------
could not so when you meditate and you


---------130:41----------
start thinking about congestion


---------130:43----------
and you bring the mind back what are you


---------130:45----------
training your mind to do


---------130:47----------
to come back yep and so the worse you


---------130:51----------
are at meditating what does that mean


---------130:52----------
about the number of push-ups that you're


---------130:54----------
doing when you meditate


---------130:56----------
i'm doing more push-ups and what does


---------130:59----------
that mean for your


---------131:01----------
swolness i'm getting stronger


---------131:05----------
absolutely so the more your mind wanders


---------131:08----------
literally you are strengthening a


---------131:10----------
capacity in your brain


---------131:12----------
called frontal lobe inhibition of other


---------131:15----------
things


---------131:16----------
every time your mind mind wanders every


---------131:18----------
time you bring it back


---------131:19----------
you are actually becoming more buff


---------131:22----------
mentally


---------131:24----------
you are training your attention it's


---------131:26----------
like a dog that runs over there and


---------131:28----------
you're like


---------131:28----------
heel boy and then the more you train it


---------131:31----------
the more it's going to start to listen


---------131:33----------
yeah my mind is going to be


---------131:37----------
so huge it's not


---------131:40----------
your mind that's gonna be huge it's you


---------131:42----------
that's gonna be huge


---------131:44----------
i'm gonna be huge you're gonna be so


---------131:46----------
small dude


---------131:48----------
i don't know if you're in a relationship


---------131:49----------
or what your you know sexual preferences


---------131:51----------
but i'm just gonna assume a


---------131:52----------
cisgendered male who's heterosexual and


---------131:54----------
the ladies are gonna love it


---------131:56----------
[Laughter]


---------131:58----------

---------131:59----------

---------132:19----------
hopefully dive more into meditation and


---------132:22----------
