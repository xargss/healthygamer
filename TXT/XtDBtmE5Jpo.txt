---------00:00----------
listen what would it feel like so you're


---------00:02----------
scared of hate but I'm gonna ask you


---------00:04----------
another question what would it feel like


---------00:06----------
if if you didn't manipulate someone and


---------00:09----------
they chose to love you instead if they


---------00:13----------
actually said you know what despite all


---------00:16----------
of your BS and with you just being you


---------00:18----------
and without manipulating me I love you


---------00:21----------
how would that make you feel there would


---------00:24----------
be a comma afterwards I say I love you


---------00:28----------
now we're late for Quidditch is what I


---------00:30----------
would hear that's how crazy again it is


---------00:31----------
to me like that's what I would hear like


---------00:33----------
Oh even though you didn't you know make


---------00:37----------
me feel a certain way about you I love


---------00:39----------
you let's go win for Gryffindor like


---------00:41----------
that is how


---------00:49----------
oh man I did not sleep at all good lord


---------00:54----------
sorry to hear that man I know no no no


---------00:57----------
it's totally fine it's not it wasn't a


---------00:59----------
bad thing it was just okay I didn't


---------01:01----------
sleep so have you been I'm still alive I


---------01:06----------
think that's pretty much a blessing at


---------01:09----------
this point um I know that's what I was


---------01:14----------
going to tell you so do you remember


---------01:16----------
when like last time you told me all I


---------01:19----------
said I was going to clean my room


---------01:22----------
okay like at the end of it all I said


---------01:24----------
that well you'll be happy to know that I


---------01:27----------
kind of took that in a different


---------01:30----------
direction I clean my room but I also


---------01:33----------
found a new place to live that is not


---------01:36----------
with a bunch of people that don't pay


---------01:38----------
rent good for you yeah that is huge but


---------01:43----------
but yes that's what I've been doing


---------01:45----------
that's so let's talk about that for a


---------01:47----------
second okay because I think that's more


---------01:51----------
significant I mean it's a it sounds very


---------01:53----------
significant to me because not just from


---------01:56----------
a financial perspective but let's think


---------01:57----------
about why were you living with people


---------01:59----------
who didn't pay rent like what drove you


---------02:05----------
to do that well I think um like I've


---------02:14----------
always worked a lot of jobs and I don't


---------02:17----------
spend a lot of money I'm just myself so


---------02:19----------
when my first video on YouTube blew up


---------02:22----------
and I saw the money that I was making I


---------02:24----------
just was like oh man I could just live


---------02:27----------
with my best friends forever this is my


---------02:29----------
path to being Drake like I thought I was


---------02:32----------
gonna go so far that money whatever like


---------02:35----------
we could just live together that didn't


---------02:38----------
happen but at the time I thought that


---------02:41----------
was gonna happen so when things started


---------02:43----------
slowing down and getting bad after four


---------02:45----------
years of doing it I didn't really know


---------02:50----------
how to live alone or live with less


---------02:53----------
people so I kind of just


---------02:56----------
kept it going and added more people and


---------03:00----------
now I'm in crippling debt and I'm alone


---------03:04----------
okay sorry well so okay so how does how


---------03:09----------
does that feel to be in crippling debt


---------03:11----------
and alone ah the question I mean it


---------03:17----------
feels honestly the debt feels right it


---------03:20----------
feels like an ample punishment because I


---------03:24----------
also think that like by paying for


---------03:28----------
everything for everybody I I also


---------03:32----------
believe I kind of ruined their lives a


---------03:34----------
bit like I spoiled them and I didn't do


---------03:37----------
anything with it I would tell people


---------03:38----------
like during my depression oh yeah we're


---------03:41----------
gonna like videos are coming back we're


---------03:44----------
gonna work like you know we got this


---------03:47----------
just a we got this we got this and then


---------03:48----------
I never worked and that was like an


---------03:50----------
ongoing cycle for the next three years


---------03:53----------
so it's like I feel like with debt and


---------03:57----------
guilt it's pretty good pretty good


---------04:01----------
punishment it's pretty terrible okay so


---------04:03----------
so our and how does it feel to be alone


---------04:09----------
I think I will be okay is like I think


---------04:17----------
that I just need space to be like just


---------04:20----------
me and so I'm looking forward to that


---------04:23----------
like it feels good because I'm moving


---------04:27----------
like I'm moving a lot of my stuff like


---------04:29----------
today tomorrow the next day and it feels


---------04:31----------
good that I actually was brave enough to


---------04:33----------
just end the cycle so it's been so hard


---------04:35----------
so like I don't know how it's gonna be


---------04:38----------
but right now I'm very confident that if


---------04:41----------
I'm only financially taking care of


---------04:45----------
myself and I'm only doing things that


---------04:47----------
are like important for me instead of


---------04:49----------
putting everyone else first I'm hoping


---------04:51----------
that that will that'll be the catalyst


---------04:54----------
that starts change to make me come back


---------04:56----------
to yeah I was doing before


---------04:59----------
so Skyy I think it's great because I


---------05:00----------
think there was something within you


---------05:02----------
that felt like like you know a sense of


---------05:08----------
your identity was in


---------05:09----------
porting other people oh yeah and and so


---------05:15----------
you sort of let that part of you which i


---------05:17----------
think is is basically you know a part of


---------05:19----------
your ego and so like in order to be a


---------05:22----------
good person you had to like help other


---------05:24----------
people and pay their rent and like


---------05:26----------
Manono doubt that there was genuine


---------05:28----------
caring involved in terms of like you


---------05:31----------
know wanting your your friends and you


---------05:34----------
know to have an easy time and that your


---------05:35----------
success should you wanted to share your


---------05:37----------
success and all this other kind of good


---------05:38----------
stuff but i think it's actually a huge


---------05:41----------
step forward if you've let those voices


---------05:44----------
stop running the show and drive you into


---------05:46----------
crippling debt because that's what those


---------05:48----------
voices do yes a hundred iliyan present i


---------05:54----------
will say this though it kind of sucks


---------05:57----------
because along the way like i had made


---------06:01----------
friends that didn't need money like i


---------06:05----------
had made friends like when i would like


---------06:07----------
when i was be at home versus like going


---------06:09----------
out to conventions like packs and and


---------06:12----------
and whatnot like i would have friends


---------06:14----------
that are just there to chill i didn't


---------06:15----------
have to pay for anything i could just


---------06:16----------
relax and it sucks because like i just i


---------06:24----------
don't know i this this lifestyle kind of


---------06:25----------
ruined a lot of those relationships


---------06:27----------
because i wasn't even sure how to be a


---------06:30----------
good friend like i I treated them like


---------06:32----------
absolute garbage because I thought that


---------06:35----------
you know I could just solve any problem


---------06:38----------
like paying them but then if I couldn't


---------06:41----------
it's like Omar okay I don't have any


---------06:43----------
problem solving skills now yeah this is


---------06:46----------
[ __ ]


---------06:46----------
so what let's think about that for a


---------06:48----------
second why do you think that you treated


---------06:50----------
your friends that didn't need your help


---------06:52----------
like garbage


---------06:54----------
like that's strange right one would


---------06:55----------
expect turns out to not be very strange


---------06:57----------
but one would expect that the you know


---------07:00----------
that those would be the relationships


---------07:02----------
that would have been the healthiest and


---------07:03----------
that you have cultivated the most but it


---------07:05----------
seems like the opposite actually


---------07:06----------
happened I guess like I guess because my


---------07:10----------
actions that I would normally do towards


---------07:12----------
people that lived with me I did them on


---------07:17----------
others that didn't live with me and and


---------07:20----------
really stuck their neck out for me which


---------07:21----------
is like


---------07:23----------
you know one of them let me borrow like


---------07:26----------
what like without any hesitation at all


---------07:28----------
dropped


---------07:30----------
$8,100 literally like the next day when


---------07:35----------
I needed it right and two years down the


---------07:40----------
road


---------07:40----------
I didn't even begin to talk about paying


---------07:42----------
them back I probably could have if I


---------07:45----------
budgeted correctly and there's a lot of


---------07:47----------
people out there that I owe money to a


---------07:49----------
lot a lot like whatever you think is a


---------07:54----------
lot triple it and that's half like so I


---------07:58----------
with this particular case though she


---------08:02----------
ended up she was so hurt that I didn't


---------08:07----------
like talk to her about it because in my


---------08:10----------
world I'm thinking oh if I suspect if


---------08:12----------
someone gives me money after all these


---------08:14----------
years like people that live with me


---------08:15----------
I pretty much deserve it at that point


---------08:17----------
like after I had given the hundreds of


---------08:19----------
thousands of dollars for rent food all


---------08:21----------
the [ __ ] that we did it's like I don't


---------08:23----------
I'm family not gonna pay you back but


---------08:25----------
with the people outside of the home I


---------08:27----------
couldn't I didn't have the null the


---------08:33----------
basic human decency to just like honor


---------08:37----------
and agreement you know what I mean like


---------08:39----------
I didn't even think about it and it


---------08:41----------
[ __ ] me up really bad I mean it darned


---------08:44----------
me up it darn do you oh yeah oh yeah


---------08:48----------
thanks thanks for being sense on but


---------08:51----------

---------08:53----------

---------08:53----------

---------08:55----------

---------08:59----------

---------09:00----------

---------09:03----------
back to Skye subscribe what what do you


---------09:05----------

---------09:07----------

---------09:10----------
if you want to in your relationships and


---------09:11----------
why you perceive your relationships like


---------09:13----------
that but hey you know is there something


---------09:16----------
in do you feel like because last time


---------09:18----------
you you know you sent me that voicemail


---------09:20----------
which was really fantastic actually wait


---------09:25----------
which was you sent me like a voicemail


---------09:26----------
that that you recorded like you sent me


---------09:29----------
like this tech like this voice message


---------09:30----------
that was like you were in bed and trying


---------09:33----------
to fall asleep and you had some thoughts


---------09:34----------
and you said


---------09:36----------
yeah so we can together you were talking


---------09:41----------
about like when you should start making


---------09:42----------
changes oh yeah


---------09:45----------
so love our what do you want to talk


---------09:48----------
about you tell me like what would be


---------09:50----------
helpful okay um I think we already


---------09:56----------
discussed like the feeling of it being


---------09:59----------
too late to do things I got this because


---------10:06----------
III put notes I even yeah that's right I


---------10:09----------
had notes I'm so dumb I when I when I


---------10:12----------
had reached oh do you want me to just I


---------10:16----------
don't think there's I know yeah like if


---------10:20----------
I start right this second will it prove


---------10:23----------
that like you know I won't procrastinate


---------10:25----------
or is it better to start later after


---------10:28----------
I've had preparation like it's jumping


---------10:30----------
into something cold turkey the way to go


---------10:33----------
or is waiting and being prepared better


---------10:37----------
or are they both rationalizations that's


---------10:40----------
what I was confused about yeah so you


---------10:42----------
tell me why don't we talk is there


---------10:43----------
something particular on your mind do you


---------10:44----------
want to dig into that do you want to


---------10:46----------
talk about friendships tell me what do


---------10:48----------
you think would be pretty bad so I want


---------10:51----------
to know can I read people can I play the


---------10:53----------
voicemail for people did yeah I think I


---------10:57----------
still have it a lot oh it's it's not I


---------11:01----------
don't think it's it's not like no I know


---------11:02----------
I know oh you do if you look in our


---------11:08----------
group shot oh it's in the group Cheyenne


---------11:10----------
yeah you just scroll up there's a big


---------11:13----------
black okay


---------11:15----------
square yeah here we go y'all ready chat


---------11:18----------
we're gonna it's like super


---------11:20----------
unprofessional I'm sorry for doing it


---------11:22----------
this way but I'm about to sleep my voice


---------11:25----------
is dead and then add this thought and


---------11:26----------
I'm totally down don't like talk about


---------11:28----------
this another community he'll have me but


---------11:31----------
I wanted to ask when it comes to life


---------11:36----------
changes like things that we talked about


---------11:38----------
is that something that I should just do


---------11:41----------
[ __ ] side


---------11:43----------
okay this is like to like talk about


---------11:44----------
this another community will have me but


---------11:47----------
I wanted to ask when it comes to life


---------11:52----------
changes like things that we talked about


---------11:54----------
is that something that I should just do


---------11:56----------
immediately right now or is there merit


---------11:59----------
of like setting a date to start like why


---------12:04----------
do you think like setting a date is


---------12:05----------
rationalizing yeah like what would be


---------12:07----------
the wisest way to affect change in a


---------12:11----------
healthy manner it's like kind of my


---------12:16----------
question again so sorry this is like


---------12:19----------
super alright do you guys got that so


---------12:23----------
let's go back to this okay so what do


---------12:27----------
you think um I I can't tell when I'm


---------12:33----------
manipulating myself or people I don't


---------12:37----------
know how to tell and it's getting bad


---------12:40----------
because even if I was like now when I


---------12:43----------
talk I could be telling the truth but


---------12:45----------
everyone will think I'm manipulating but


---------12:48----------
then am I like that's like I don't even


---------12:50----------
know like that that's why I sent that


---------12:52----------
because I was thinking about everything


---------12:54----------
you said about or that really helpful


---------12:57----------
session about you know going on Sage


---------12:59----------
giving it your all but then being


---------13:00----------
content because that was the best you


---------13:02----------
could have done and I was like that is


---------13:05----------
genius but I don't know when to start


---------13:07----------
and I can't tell what my brain if I


---------13:09----------
brain is tricking me or not so that's


---------13:11----------
yeah so I think a great it's so first of


---------13:14----------
all you've taken the first important


---------13:16----------
step which is realizing that your brain


---------13:18----------
loves to trick you right is that normal


---------13:22----------
it's completely normal


---------13:23----------
it's very normal so so that that and


---------13:26----------
even then you're kind of saying you were


---------13:27----------
saying that oh like sometimes like I'm


---------13:29----------
telling the truth and people think I'm


---------13:30----------
being manipulative I think some of the


---------13:32----------
times when you're the most manipulative


---------13:34----------
sky is when you tell the truth and


---------13:40----------
right no I mean the damn so just because


---------13:46----------
you're telling the truth doesn't mean it


---------13:47----------
isn't manipulative I cannot understand


---------13:52----------
that you can honor like you don't I


---------13:54----------
don't get I don't how are you like like


---------14:00----------
manipulating the truth or no so so I


---------14:04----------
think I think manipulation so let's


---------14:06----------
define manipulation right so what is


---------14:08----------
manipulation


---------14:08----------
I guess changing or maybe not reforming


---------14:16----------
what's the word I'm looking for it like


---------14:21----------
bothering an object or an idea I'm so


---------14:24----------
I'm trying to find the right it's it's


---------14:25----------
it's a hard question harder than it


---------14:27----------
seems uh I'm gonna say changing changing


---------14:37----------
something by way of not something with


---------14:42----------
malicious intent okay I don't know yeah


---------14:44----------
yeah yeah yeah changing something with


---------14:46----------
malicious intent it's great it's great


---------14:47----------
right so so I I think it's sort of like


---------14:50----------
controlling someone's behavior usually


---------14:52----------
like altering something for the purpose


---------14:55----------
of controlling someone else's behavior


---------14:56----------
and like with some degree of like


---------15:00----------
malicious intent or you're kind of


---------15:02----------
taking advantage of them you know it's


---------15:03----------
like a little bit immoral there's


---------15:05----------
something in there I don't know that


---------15:06----------
it's necessarily malicious attack but I


---------15:08----------
basically think about manipulating


---------15:10----------
someone is sort of altering information


---------15:12----------
or tailoring information to control


---------15:13----------
someone else's behavior like that's what


---------15:15----------
manipulation is manipulation is about


---------15:17----------
controlling other human beings right


---------15:20----------
yeah and sometimes one of the best ways


---------15:23----------
you can control other human beings is by


---------15:24----------
telling the truth


---------15:25----------
Oh My Jesus Christ okay right so I I


---------15:33----------
think that you do some manipulative


---------15:35----------
stuff you're kind of an open book but I


---------15:36----------
think you understand how being an open


---------15:41----------
book can be advantageous to you and I


---------15:44----------
think you calculate something about that


---------15:48----------
hmmm I think I think that you're right


---------15:54----------
for the most part but I'm not lying when


---------15:58----------
I say that I just don't know when the


---------16:00----------
manipulation switch is on I completely


---------16:02----------
agree with you I do not blame you for


---------16:04----------
manipulating okay to be clear so I think


---------16:08----------
manipulation happens a lot of times when


---------16:10----------
we don't even want it to but it happens


---------16:13----------
almost so like why do you want to


---------16:15----------
control another person's behavior like


---------16:16----------
what's like when you think about when


---------16:18----------
you manipulate when one human being


---------16:20----------
manipulates another human being what is


---------16:22----------
the main thing that drives them what


---------16:24----------
drives the manipulation to to make sure


---------16:30----------
that they don't do anything bad that has


---------16:32----------
anything to do with you maybe yes so if


---------16:35----------
you have to say if you had to attach an


---------16:36----------
emotion to that what is the emotion that


---------16:39----------
one feels when I don't want you to do


---------16:42----------
something bad to me what is the emotion


---------16:44----------
I'm feeling I don't want you to do


---------16:49----------
something fear absolutely I think it's


---------16:54----------
it's it's weird right so like I know


---------16:57----------
that this stuff seems really simple in


---------16:59----------
in in a sense it is but we don't ever


---------17:01----------
stop and like think about what actually


---------17:04----------
drives us and you can get to the answer


---------17:06----------
it's just like let's just that's you're


---------17:07----------
doing great sky so the first thing


---------17:09----------
you're when you manipulate people out of


---------17:12----------
fear like if you think about it like if


---------17:13----------
I you know let's say I'm married and and


---------17:16----------
you know let's use a real example so you


---------17:19----------
know my wife doesn't want me to play as


---------17:20----------
many video games as I play and so then


---------17:22----------
she's like oh like how late like I have


---------17:24----------
trouble waking up on the weekends and


---------17:25----------
then she's like okay like how late were


---------17:27----------
you up and then then I like I want to


---------17:29----------
manipulate the information a little bit


---------17:31----------
right I'm like oh I I did a little bit


---------17:32----------
of work and I played some donut I sort


---------17:34----------
of say like both of those things even


---------17:36----------
though the little bit of work may have


---------17:37----------
been 60 seconds and then the donut may


---------17:40----------
have been two hours but like I sort of


---------17:42----------
present it like I did both of those


---------17:43----------
things like that's manipulation right


---------17:45----------
it's manipulation yes so in that moment


---------17:49----------
like why am i manipulating like what is


---------17:51----------
the drive behind me manipulating can you


---------17:53----------
guess I mean I would say in that case


---------17:56----------
it's like


---------17:58----------
think it sounds like you kind of know


---------18:00----------
your body and I guess what's best for


---------18:02----------
you so maybe you did that because you


---------18:05----------
didn't want to elicit a reaction that


---------18:07----------
would be disastrous so you wanted to


---------18:10----------
save that exactly so I'm trying to


---------18:12----------
control another person's behavior right


---------18:14----------
I didn't want to elicit a reaction that


---------18:17----------
is not gonna like affect me well because


---------18:21----------
you think like listen me then like you


---------18:23----------
know right that causes marital problems


---------18:26----------
fine


---------18:27----------
so would you you were you conscious like


---------18:30----------
in that example like are you saying that


---------18:32----------
knowing fully well what you're doing a


---------18:33----------
hundred percent me at this point usually


---------18:37----------
but that takes practice right so it


---------18:41----------
takes practice so the first thing so


---------18:43----------
then like a if the goal of manipulation


---------18:46----------
is to control someone's behavior and


---------18:48----------
then if the reason you want to control


---------18:51----------
their behaviors to prevent a particular


---------18:52----------
outcome where's the root of the desire


---------18:57----------
to manipulate coming from so that


---------19:02----------
question may be a little bit yeah I have


---------19:05----------
no clue so like what is the thing that's


---------19:07----------
driving the manipulation let me ask let


---------19:09----------
me ask it that way we were kind of


---------19:10----------
talking about emotions earlier um like


---------19:14----------
for me I guess like I oh well actually


---------19:21----------
God I know I know so just like how you


---------19:25----------
said right that 30 seconds or a minute


---------19:28----------
of work in two hours of dota I did the


---------19:32----------
same thing for about five years when it


---------19:36----------
came to people I was living with like


---------19:38----------
how much money was actually needed to


---------19:42----------
like maintain this lifestyle and then


---------19:45----------
like I know that I would definitely like


---------19:48----------
not be honest about how much I was


---------19:50----------
paying for rent or who was paying rent


---------19:53----------
or how many people you know was I doing


---------19:55----------
this for but I would be telling the


---------19:57----------
truth in explaining that yes there are


---------20:00----------
people that don't pay things


---------20:02----------
yes rent is high yes I pay everything


---------20:04----------
but I was never I was never like


---------20:06----------
forthcoming with the information I was


---------20:08----------
really afraid to like


---------20:10----------
I was really afraid that anyone would


---------20:12----------
just call me an idiot because I was


---------20:14----------
being one like so because it was so like


---------20:17----------
yeah so good so what's the driving force


---------20:20----------
there you often you said it you said it


---------20:23----------
but yes I'm gonna suggest just to not


---------20:25----------
have someone think that I'm a complete


---------20:27----------
idiot yeah so so in that - you said you


---------20:31----------
were afraid that someone was gonna call


---------20:33----------
you an idiot right and also everyone


---------20:38----------
like it's so obvious to everyone else


---------20:40----------
like and it's so stupid that I'm sitting


---------20:44----------
here and I'm like literally giving


---------20:47----------
putting myself in a lifetime out of debt


---------20:49----------
but yet when I lament like when I tell


---------20:52----------
my problems to literally anyone even at


---------20:55----------
the peak of their honesty like everyone


---------20:58----------
it was all the same like dude you gotta


---------21:00----------
leave you gotta live by yourself like


---------21:01----------
yeah you should do this man that's so


---------21:04----------
dumb and it's hard because it's like I


---------21:06----------
can't do that like I don't know I don't


---------21:07----------
know why I couldn't do that and for


---------21:09----------
everyone else it's like they they're all


---------21:11----------
gods that they all could do it if they


---------21:13----------
were me they'd be doing it right now and


---------21:15----------
it's like I couldn't do it I can't bring


---------21:17----------
myself to do okay so they're two layers


---------21:19----------
of this sky I'm gonna try to keep track


---------21:21----------
of both of them I'm gonna stick always


---------21:22----------
start with manipulation because this is


---------21:23----------
very important I think this could help a


---------21:25----------
lot of people so fear is what drives


---------21:28----------
your manipulative tendencies right so


---------21:32----------
for you if you're saying I don't know


---------21:35----------
when I'm manipulating and when I'm not


---------21:38----------
manipulating what can you look at within


---------21:41----------
yourself to give you a clue whether


---------21:43----------
there's manipulation or there's not


---------21:44----------
manipulation what I'm scared of


---------21:49----------
absolutely right


---------21:52----------
so you look hard here right you look for


---------21:56----------
fear because you have learned like so


---------21:59----------
remember manipulation is not it's not


---------22:01----------
about evil that's why I don't like the


---------22:02----------
word malicious manipulation in your case


---------22:05----------
I think is predominantly about


---------22:06----------
protection it's your mind trying to


---------22:10----------
protect you from everyone calling you an


---------22:13----------
idiot because you have the curse of


---------22:14----------
being smart and you know that what


---------22:17----------
you're doing is stupid and you know that


---------22:20----------
if other people know what you're doing


---------22:21----------
they're gonna tell you things


---------22:23----------
that they're gonna say it's stupid


---------22:25----------
they're gonna think you're stupid and


---------22:27----------
they're gonna give you solutions that


---------22:28----------
any idiot could do but you're not gonna


---------22:30----------
be able to do them and you know that


---------22:33----------
because what keeps those people in your


---------22:35----------
house is not IQ its feelings and like


---------22:40----------
feelings could give they don't care


---------22:42----------
about what the rationale is like the


---------22:45----------
reason that you've been like keeping


---------22:47----------
people in your house and I don't know


---------22:48----------
where this goes but we can explore it


---------22:50----------
but like you know somewhere along the


---------22:52----------
way I mean we've talked some about your


---------22:53----------
past is like you you want to support


---------22:55----------
people you want to help people like you


---------22:57----------
don't want to abandon them because


---------22:58----------
you've been [ __ ] abandoned and you


---------23:01----------
don't want you know you want people to


---------23:02----------
be like safe and comfortable and like


---------23:05----------
that didn't happen for you so I think


---------23:07----------
there's something there we can go there


---------23:08----------
if you want to but let's table that for


---------23:10----------
a second if you're okay with it I'm just


---------23:13----------
highlighting a little bit because I


---------23:15----------
don't think it's idiocy that keeps these


---------23:17----------
people in your house right there's that


---------23:20----------
is actually coming from some kind of


---------23:22----------
positive emotion within you because if


---------23:24----------
you think about the stupider and action


---------23:26----------
is the more powerful the thing has to be


---------23:29----------
within you that gets it done so this is


---------23:33----------
another thing that I see a lot is people


---------23:34----------
judge themselves for doing like


---------23:36----------
astronomically idiotic stip and what I


---------23:40----------
want all of you guys to understand is


---------23:41----------
that if you're doing something that


---------23:42----------
everyone else is causing Stute calling


---------23:44----------
stupid


---------23:45----------
that just makes you feel more and more


---------23:46----------
incompetent but that's incomplete that's


---------23:48----------
not right it's not that you're stupid


---------23:50----------
it's that there is something within you


---------23:52----------
that is driving you so hard that it


---------23:55----------
overcomes how glaringly idiotic at us


---------23:58----------
does that make sense


---------24:02----------
yeah so we'll get to


---------24:05----------
let's go back to fear and manipulation


---------24:06----------
but I think you know when you say like


---------24:08----------
oh it's like all these people would call


---------24:09----------
me stupid like you don't want them to


---------24:11----------
think that about you but what what's


---------24:12----------
really going on is like I don't think


---------24:13----------
they understand right like sky they


---------24:15----------
don't get it they don't understand why


---------24:17----------
you do what you do you may not even get


---------24:19----------
it you may not understand why you do


---------24:21----------
what you do all you know is that what


---------24:22----------
they think is simple you just you're not


---------24:24----------
going to be able to do that you just


---------24:26----------
can't kick everyone out of your house


---------24:29----------
and [ __ ] this I mean darn this okay this


---------24:36----------
is a bombshell I think I don't know I


---------24:38----------
was like the whole time you were talking


---------24:40----------
I was struggling to see if I should say


---------24:42----------
this but I will I mean in in in a good


---------24:47----------
amount of those cases if yeah they would


---------24:51----------
call me an idiot but I believe that they


---------24:55----------
also wouldn't give me money they


---------24:57----------
wouldn't let me borrow anything if they


---------24:59----------
knew that it was going to all these


---------25:01----------
people that are just pretty much free


---------25:04----------
living mm-hmm so it's easier to just say


---------25:08----------
that I'm the target and not let anyone


---------25:11----------
know that they're not doing what they


---------25:14----------
need to do because I don't want them to


---------25:17----------
be scrutinized but I certainly don't


---------25:19----------
want to be scrutinized it's like I


---------25:21----------
wanted to I wanted to say that the


---------25:23----------
lifestyle worked for me and I did


---------25:25----------
genuinely believe that while I was


---------25:28----------
depressed if I just kept this lifestyle


---------25:29----------
going like my friends would eventually


---------25:31----------
uplift me and I would be back on my feet


---------25:35----------
in no time so whatever money I borrowed


---------25:37----------
from someone it was always like oh man


---------25:40----------
that's a lot but I I can do it now like


---------25:43----------
you know I'm feeling better and then it


---------25:45----------
never got better and then having a bunch


---------25:48----------
of people here then turned into the


---------25:51----------
worst decision I've ever made


---------25:52----------
like that's that's my thing is that I


---------25:56----------
threw it all I've turned it all of my


---------25:59----------
social relationships to maintain this


---------26:01----------
lifestyle and now it's like even the


---------26:04----------
people living here I've never been this


---------26:06----------
alone in my life easy like so alone like


---------26:12----------
it's nuts


---------26:13----------
I'm just annoying to everybody now I'm


---------26:15----------
on the internet and that just that's


---------26:17----------
like


---------26:22----------
that's all and it's quite a bit what are


---------26:26----------
you feeling right now


---------26:27----------
terrible yeah that I can counter yeah


---------26:31----------
you know what yeah yeah I mean this is


---------26:38----------
all like retribution though right like


---------26:40----------
everyone that's been cancelled online as


---------26:42----------
like they're typically trying to do


---------26:44----------
something and forget the past well then


---------26:48----------
they get canceled for something that was


---------26:49----------
brought up and I've always thought like


---------26:51----------
I have a lot of actions that I've done


---------26:53----------
in my home that definitely could raise a


---------26:56----------
cancel like for sure but to me my


---------27:00----------
punishment is again debt until I'm dead


---------27:04----------
and being alone like I I feel like even


---------27:07----------
I I feel like I'm I did all of this


---------27:12----------
damage to myself almost entirely no one


---------27:15----------
else's to blame and that's really hard


---------27:17----------
for me to live with like really really


---------27:20----------
hard I can't do it sometimes did you how


---------27:25----------
long have you been living with that Oh


---------27:31----------
like ever since 2015


---------27:37----------
like I oh yeah a hundred percent around


---------27:41----------
then what my channel started going down


---------27:43----------
when I was depressed I just felt like


---------27:45----------
damn


---------27:46----------
even though depression you think


---------27:49----------
everything that happens to you is your


---------27:50----------
fault yes a hundred percent times ten


---------27:58----------
that happens to me good or bad is a


---------28:00----------
direct action of me 100%


---------28:04----------
how long have you paddles if I could be


---------28:06----------
any other way


---------28:08----------
what how long have you believed that my


---------28:14----------
whole life okay what does it mean if it


---------28:19----------
if that isn't true to me that's like


---------28:23----------
like if that's not true then also in


---------28:28----------
that world where it's not true humans


---------28:30----------
can also fly like they could just soar


---------28:33----------
into the air because to me I think that


---------28:36----------
whatever action you took I just always


---------28:42----------
thought well I did this action or like I


---------28:45----------
was a catalyst in this way so I


---------28:47----------
shouldn't have done that kind of asked


---------28:50----------
for it stuff like that yeah so I'm gonna


---------28:53----------
say something to you okay so like


---------28:54----------
sometimes when I work with people they


---------28:56----------
say things like oh yeah the fact that it


---------28:58----------
was my fault that he hit me because I


---------29:01----------
should have done a better job at like


---------29:03----------
cleaning up it wasn't his fault it was


---------29:07----------
my fault what do you think about that


---------29:16----------
for that person maybe


---------29:19----------
oh man


---------29:22----------
be honest guy I don't think it's the


---------29:25----------
person the person that got hit on done


---------29:27----------
it's not there


---------29:28----------
oh my brain is short-circuiting I know


---------29:31----------
okay good sure that's what we're here


---------29:34----------
for


---------29:34----------
yeah let's understand let's understand


---------29:37----------
what's the short what's the short


---------29:39----------
circuit because it's pain because it's


---------29:49----------
not


---------29:51----------
oh [ __ ] okay it this is the hardest


---------29:59----------
thing okay it's not the person that got


---------30:01----------
hit it's not their fault but they were a


---------30:05----------
part of the act no that's stupid


---------30:08----------
it doesn't matter if they were part of


---------30:11----------
it they got hit by a monster but they're


---------30:15----------
there they're in it I guess they're


---------30:18----------
doing so tell me what you're feeling


---------30:19----------
oh just ah that's that that sound is how


---------30:28----------
I'm feeling


---------30:29----------
oh yeah so let me try to put words to


---------30:32----------
that sound okay yes thank you so first


---------30:35----------
of all I think you're doing great sky


---------30:37----------
sorry for bodying that's so hard like


---------30:39----------
yeah I know I'm but do you want to do


---------30:44----------
you want to take a break


---------30:44----------
earth no no no no no no no we should


---------30:47----------
dive right in I'm good I'm just like


---------30:49----------
yeah I'm good I'm ready okay so I think


---------30:53----------
here's what's going on with anything so


---------30:54----------
you know that that's not that person's


---------30:56----------
fault right like when they get hit and


---------30:59----------
they say oh it's because I didn't do XYZ


---------31:01----------
like I should have been better you


---------31:03----------
there's a part of you that knows that


---------31:05----------
it's it's ridiculous that we call that


---------31:08----------
the person who got hit is not the


---------31:12----------
perpetrator they're the victim the


---------31:15----------
problem is like if I say if I make you


---------31:18----------
say that


---------31:19----------
you say like that's true for them but


---------31:22----------
it's not true for me but like yeah how


---------31:23----------
can I say that it's not true for me


---------31:25----------
because that's just [ __ ] - what it


---------31:28----------
isn't


---------31:28----------
Oh God it does exactly oh yes if I have


---------31:37----------
if I was left alone with that and that


---------31:39----------
wouldn't end this guy okay right so so


---------31:44----------
so that that can be so good good job


---------31:46----------
right and the feeling is good I think


---------31:48----------
you actually did a very good job of


---------31:50----------
describing how you felt right which is


---------31:52----------
like that it's like an existential grunt


---------31:54----------
it's like just like a torturous like you


---------31:57----------
can't because it doesn't compute like


---------32:01----------
you know that you shouldn't feel this


---------32:02----------
way about yourself but you do


---------32:04----------
and it doesn't matter how true that


---------32:06----------
scenario is for this fictional person it


---------32:10----------
does not apply to you you are different


---------32:12----------
and you have trouble computing that


---------32:14----------
together and your thing is blurry by the


---------32:16----------
way your mic there we go yeah okay yeah


---------32:21----------
um I was gonna say that first of all


---------32:25----------
you're great and second of all the


---------32:29----------
reason why I would think that I'm


---------32:31----------
different is because I think that I was


---------32:35----------
born with a lot of advantages that makes


---------32:38----------
it so those kinds of situations I


---------32:41----------
believe they're very it's very hard for


---------32:44----------
that to happen to me like for example


---------32:48----------
like okay I'm like six five if I don't


---------32:52----------
hunch my back so it's like I don't


---------32:54----------
really have to worry about walking into


---------32:56----------
my car


---------32:56----------
I'm huge no one's gonna attack me and


---------32:59----------
they think that I'm gonna fight them I'm


---------33:01----------
a [ __ ] I will run but they don't think


---------33:04----------
that so like in that scenario if someone


---------33:07----------
were to jump me right sure that's not my


---------33:10----------
fault but in my mind it's like that is


---------33:13----------
probably not going to happen because I


---------33:15----------
have a I have a set of skills and


---------33:17----------
physical attributes that make it


---------33:19----------
difficult for those things that happen


---------33:22----------
to me yeah but I mean pardon me for


---------33:25----------
being insensitive but no please you know


---------33:27----------
so there so first of all this this is a


---------33:29----------
belief that is not doesn't it wasn't


---------33:31----------
born today right the belief that you are


---------33:34----------
everything that happens to you is your


---------33:36----------
fault


---------33:36----------
was not born today you felt this way


---------33:40----------
as you say your whole life off ever


---------33:44----------
since that ever since the rape I felt


---------33:46----------
that light times 10 ya think


---------33:48----------
right yeah so like this is if I wasn't


---------33:52----------
on AOL and and and so this is the thing


---------33:54----------
back then you weren't six five right and


---------33:59----------
you weren't an adult you were a kid and


---------34:05----------
you


---------34:07----------
and and this is unfortunately what


---------34:09----------
happens to people who have been abused


---------34:12----------
is they think that it's their small a


---------34:15----------
fault especially when they're kids


---------34:16----------
and it's funny I just talked about this


---------34:18----------
but what are you feeling I mean I I I


---------34:23----------
think it was my fault hundred percent


---------34:25----------
yeah hundred percent and then when I


---------34:28----------
look at even things that I do now my


---------34:31----------
channel my twitch my friendships my debt


---------34:34----------
all of that all of it my fault entirely


---------34:38----------
a hundred percent the sky what is it


---------34:41----------
beautiful isn't your fault what does the


---------34:43----------
world look like it like I said people


---------34:47----------
opened the window right now Harry Potter


---------34:50----------
is about the draft me for Quidditch like


---------34:52----------
that's the same world so so yeah so


---------34:54----------
let's let's take into that because I


---------34:56----------
think this has to be this has to be


---------34:57----------
approached okay so I think right now so


---------35:01----------
let's think about let's remember that


---------35:02----------
our mind does things for a reason okay


---------35:05----------
and our mind is really trying to help us


---------35:09----------
out a lot of times it doesn't do as good


---------35:10----------
of a job as we want it to but that's


---------35:12----------
just because it doesn't know how to do


---------35:14----------
any better so let's think about why your


---------35:17----------
worldview is so difficult to abandon so


---------35:20----------
right now the good thing about your


---------35:21----------
worldview is that it makes sense right


---------35:24----------
like it makes sense that you live in a


---------35:27----------
world where you were an actor or like


---------35:30----------
isn't you could take action not like


---------35:32----------
your fake but that you are like an actor


---------35:34----------
in the world and you exert agency in the


---------35:35----------
world and the world responds to you so


---------35:38----------
the world makes sense because like you


---------35:39----------
know you're you're playing a video game


---------35:41----------
and you control the character and if you


---------35:42----------
hit the spacebar the character jumps and


---------35:44----------
that's just it makes sense every time


---------35:45----------
you get the space part of the character


---------35:46----------
jumps so this is a world that makes


---------35:48----------
sense


---------35:49----------
you also have control over this world if


---------35:52----------
you are responsible for everything that


---------35:54----------
happens to you that also means you have


---------35:56----------
a hope right if you can learn how to be


---------35:59----------
a better person then you can create the


---------36:01----------
life that you want you can create a life


---------36:02----------
where you're safe you can create a life


---------36:04----------
where you're loved you can create a life


---------36:06----------
where you're wealthy you can create a


---------36:08----------
life where you're comfortable all of


---------36:10----------
these things are within your power if


---------36:12----------
only you figure out how right oh I mean


---------36:16----------
yeah yeah that sounded great I was I was


---------36:19----------
lost


---------36:20----------
like damn sign me up for that yeah so


---------36:22----------
that's that's the the beautiful thing


---------36:24----------
about the world that you've constructed


---------36:26----------
because you at the end of the day like


---------36:28----------
all of these things are possible for you


---------36:30----------
but it's kind of you feeling something


---------36:33----------
yeah I'm feeling just getting drink


---------36:38----------
water continue you're good


---------36:39----------
I'm curious what you're feeling I'm just


---------36:45----------
waiting for Harry Potter behind them in


---------36:48----------
his world that Cummins drive neo but I


---------36:51----------
just I want to hear more as though I


---------36:52----------
don't think Harry Potter's out there ok


---------36:54----------
so so I think the challenge here though


---------36:55----------
is that like that's not actually the way


---------36:57----------
the world works right because like the


---------36:59----------
the the hard thing about giving up your


---------37:02----------
worldview is you give up control for


---------37:04----------
your future if other people are involved


---------37:07----------
like let's say there's two kinds of


---------37:09----------
world like there's like there's a


---------37:10----------
single-player game and there's a


---------37:11----------
multiplayer game and if you're playing a


---------37:14----------
single-player game then you can control


---------37:15----------
everything in the game but if you're


---------37:17----------
playing multiplayer and I'm like I'm


---------37:18----------
running around and like I get like PvP


---------37:21----------
and ganked yes then like I don't want to


---------37:25----------
live in the multiplayer world because


---------37:27----------
like other people can interfere with me


---------37:29----------
and so I defeat huh sorry the days out


---------37:33----------
and I'm saying they feed like if I play


---------37:35----------
with someone yeah they're gonna be like


---------37:36----------
noobs yeah thank you yes and and so it


---------37:40----------
can actually be like a little bit


---------37:42----------
dangerous to think about living in a


---------37:45----------
multiplayer world because like you're


---------37:46----------
actually not in control and that thought


---------37:48----------
is terrifying like yeah you yeah I don't


---------37:56----------
like that and an especially especially


---------37:59----------
when we when we look at you know for


---------38:02----------
example victims of traumatic experiences


---------38:05----------
so this is gonna be kind of a random


---------38:07----------
thing but often times people or who are


---------38:09----------
people who are anorexic or have eating


---------38:12----------
disorders that's oftentimes linked to an


---------38:15----------
abusive relationship in their early


---------38:17----------
years so they have especially like a


---------38:19----------
parent or something who is like really


---------38:21----------
mean to them or something


---------38:22----------
or have a conditional affection or


---------38:24----------
things like that and if you talk to


---------38:26----------
these people like so eating disorders


---------38:28----------
the root issue if you talk to people is


---------38:30----------
it's about control so someone like a 15


---------38:33----------
year old girl with


---------38:34----------
anorexia like all of the ones that I've


---------38:36----------
worked with when I talked to them it's


---------38:37----------
all about control they can't control


---------38:39----------
their parents they can't control their


---------38:40----------
grades but they can control what they


---------38:42----------
put in their body and it's this really


---------38:44----------
bizarre sense of control and the more


---------38:47----------
you try to control what they eat the


---------38:49----------
more they fight and the more they rebel


---------38:51----------
they just want to be able to commits all


---------38:53----------
about control control control it's not


---------38:55----------
about intelligence you could show them


---------38:57----------
as much information that you want to


---------38:59----------
about them becoming getting osteoporosis


---------39:01----------
at a young age or electrolyte balances


---------39:02----------
or things like that oftentimes these


---------39:04----------
people when they're very severe they get


---------39:05----------
hospitalized against their will because


---------39:07----------
they're not eating in their bodies like


---------39:08----------
literally dying in their heart is


---------39:10----------
getting arrhythmias at the age of 15


---------39:12----------
which they should not have and they they


---------39:15----------
just you cannot communicate with them on


---------39:17----------
any kind of rational level because for


---------39:19----------
them it's all about control they cannot


---------39:21----------
surrender control because early on in


---------39:23----------
their life they did not have it and the


---------39:25----------
thought of not having again is


---------39:27----------
absolutely terrifying because you will


---------39:30----------
tell yourself whatever you can to not be


---------39:33----------
12 years old and on AOL again because in


---------39:36----------
that moment in your life you didn't have


---------39:38----------
control and and there's no [ __ ] way


---------39:41----------
you're willing to go back to that state


---------39:42----------
and you're 65 when you stand up straight


---------39:46----------
and you were in control and the world is


---------39:49----------
gonna give you what you deserve and you


---------39:51----------
were gonna create what the world gives


---------39:52----------
you I was but like I it wasn't like it


---------39:58----------
wasn't like I just like logged onto AOL


---------40:00----------
and then a dude came to rape me like it


---------40:03----------
was way way more than that like I was


---------40:06----------
literally like in a gay chat room trying


---------40:09----------
to get information about you know being


---------40:11----------
a semen demon and an app and a guy DM me


---------40:14----------
and lied to me about who he was we


---------40:17----------
talked for a bit I think he darks the


---------40:19----------
hell out of me


---------40:19----------
which is why he when he asked I'm so mad


---------40:22----------
when he asked if I lived out sterile I


---------40:25----------
did not even think why anybody would ask


---------40:26----------
me that we're to this day I like if I


---------40:30----------
could just go back it's like I just feel


---------40:32----------
like you shouldn't have done that like


---------40:34----------
everything else is fine tell him you


---------40:36----------
live upstairs in your parents room he'll


---------40:37----------
break in and die but


---------40:39----------
no I had to answer that yeah so why are


---------40:43----------
you telling me that what are you doing


---------40:44----------
what are you using those statements for


---------40:46----------
what's the function of your words in


---------40:48----------
this conversation because that action is


---------40:52----------
not just a one-way thing like there are


---------40:56----------
things that I could have done to prevent


---------40:58----------
it and I just feel like it didn't I


---------41:07----------
didn't feel like I didn't have control


---------41:09----------
of the situation and all really I felt


---------41:15----------
that oh [ __ ] oh my god no I sound like


---------41:19----------
law and order I'd literally was about to


---------41:21----------
say it felt like I wanted it to happen


---------41:24----------
and I don't know if that's true I know


---------41:27----------
it wasn't I know that it definitely


---------41:29----------
wasn't true when the cops came here but


---------41:30----------
it's like like in the middle of it in


---------41:35----------
the middle of it of the rape the only


---------41:37----------
thing I remember vividly is that my body


---------41:40----------
tried to like convince my mind that this


---------41:43----------
felt good and it was okay because you're


---------41:45----------
gay so it's like well you're gay so this


---------41:48----------
is what's gonna happen anyway so like I


---------41:51----------
I don't I guess I just tricked myself


---------41:54----------
and I've always felt really guilty


---------41:57----------
because like I tell people that you know


---------42:01----------
I think the worst part about being raped


---------42:04----------
a conversation that I think should be


---------42:05----------
opened a lot more is that because your


---------42:08----------
body is really good at protecting itself


---------42:11----------
there was about two seconds where it was


---------42:14----------
enjoyable it felt good and a day and


---------42:16----------
then I have to live with that that it


---------42:21----------
was the most painful thing that happened


---------42:22----------
to me but my body tried to convince


---------42:24----------
myself that it was fine for two seconds


---------42:29----------
I think that's the whose fault was it


---------42:32----------
mine I mean I died


---------42:38----------
I I felt if my mind convinced me of that


---------42:43----------
I I don't know if anybody else would


---------42:48----------
think that but think what


---------42:58----------
like my mind didn't my mind tried to


---------43:02----------
make it okay I guess so I gotta feel


---------43:06----------
like if my mind made it okay oh [ __ ]


---------43:10----------
this is hard ooh I kind of felt like if


---------43:16----------
my mind made this okay then somewhere


---------43:19----------
deep in the recesses of my psyche is


---------43:22----------
guilt like maybe I did something to


---------43:30----------
provoke it or something and and my mind


---------43:33----------
was just following up it's like oh well


---------43:36----------
I think this is kind of what you wanted


---------43:39----------
maybe not as violent but I've never been


---------43:43----------
able to explain why I felt that way but


---------43:45----------
I just have to live with that so after


---------43:48----------
that if I can make my brain feel like


---------43:52----------
that then I figured okay it doesn't get


---------43:56----------
much worse than that like you can you


---------43:57----------
can you sky I can tell that you're


---------44:00----------
working through a lot of stuff I'm not


---------44:01----------
able to quite keep up so can you help me


---------44:04----------
understand what you mean by guilt so


---------44:08----------
it's clear to me that you sort of


---------44:10----------
figured something out I'm just not able


---------44:11----------
to follow you quite as quickly so what


---------44:14----------
do you feel guilty for


---------44:20----------
in a gay chat room and like specifically


---------44:30----------
not really talking I didn't have anyone


---------44:34----------
to talk to about being gay my house so


---------44:35----------
it's like I feel guilty for taking that


---------44:39----------
method when maybe it would have been


---------44:43----------
better to do to me more healthy like


---------44:45----------
reach out to someone that's not in my


---------44:48----------
family or I don't know something like


---------44:51----------
that like that might at the action that


---------44:54----------
I took was like why would I do that like


---------44:56----------
it didn't it just doesn't make sense


---------45:00----------
this guy do you deserve forgiveness


---------45:05----------
absolutely not 0% no way cuz I mean I


---------45:14----------
did a lot I did too much damage to


---------45:16----------
people even now like like a lay in the


---------45:20----------
wake of bring out your dead like there


---------45:22----------
are so many lives that I've ruined and


---------45:24----------
then obviously like I mean I eat it


---------45:29----------
doesn't get any worse than lying to your


---------45:32----------
fans like six times and going through


---------45:35----------
the exact same cycle to the point where


---------45:38----------
even your most loyal banja like I we're


---------45:41----------
done and then I want I wanted


---------45:44----------
forgiveness but I would always like mess


---------45:46----------
it up so so at this point I deserve it


---------45:49----------
yeah no I don't think so how would you


---------45:52----------
feel if people did forgive you well I


---------45:56----------
wouldn't


---------46:01----------
I'd have to get my Nimbus 2000 and hop


---------46:03----------
right on that [ __ ] Quidditch team


---------46:05----------
that's the first thing that I would I


---------46:06----------
would if people forgave me I'm out there


---------46:09----------
right now getting the seeker like for


---------46:11----------
Hogwarts for Gryffindor no I'm a


---------46:14----------
Hufflepuff but you know that's how I


---------46:16----------
feel okay getting that Nimbus can I just


---------46:19----------
think for a second sky absolutely I'm


---------46:23----------
gonna just sit and look at my phone sky


---------46:37----------
do you are you a good person yeah no no


---------46:47----------
okay


---------46:48----------
do you are you loved


---------47:05----------
I don't know have you been loved before


---------47:08----------
I don't know I can't tell cuz that's


---------47:20----------
what I struggled with with my mom


---------47:21----------
forever is after the rape my brother


---------47:23----------
told everyone and bullied me about it


---------47:25----------
like no one in the family seemed to


---------47:27----------
think that was heinous or terrible and


---------47:30----------
is like oh alright you go to NICs baby


---------47:33----------
shower he just put in 2000 and what 17


---------47:38----------
18 just put all my angry texts out there


---------47:41----------
and Facebook and my reddit and all my


---------47:45----------
rape business out and ridiculed it again


---------47:47----------
but but yeah let's go to NICs baby


---------47:49----------
shower like trash


---------47:51----------
so if that's happening how could you


---------47:55----------
look how could you love someone and take


---------47:58----------
that action it makes no sense yeah


---------48:02----------
therefore I'm gonna just think for


---------48:08----------
another minute okay thank you for


---------48:10----------
answered your questions Yoko


---------48:23----------
so sky um first of all do you have any


---------48:27----------
questions for me cuz I think I think we


---------48:32----------
may be coming to maybe a closing point


---------48:34----------
soon just I want to just see if there's


---------48:36----------
anything I mean this this is this part


---------48:40----------
of me is very dark and remember in the


---------48:48----------
beginning I said like I feel like I have


---------48:49----------
unfixable problems uh-huh I think that


---------48:52----------
what we're diving into now is like the


---------48:56----------
final lock and key I agree it's a nice


---------49:00----------
no question yeah basically so I don't


---------49:03----------
mind I don't mind that being a stopping


---------49:06----------
point at all yeah so so I don't I don't


---------49:09----------
think we're done but I I just think that


---------49:11----------
there's something I need to spend some


---------49:13----------
time thinking about and there's some


---------49:14----------
thoughts that I want to share with you


---------49:16----------
and I'd love to get your your reaction


---------49:20----------
to what I want to share with you but


---------49:21----------
something tells me that your immediate


---------49:24----------
reaction is not going to be as important


---------49:27----------
is you thinking about this over the next


---------49:29----------
few days yeah and and I'm happy to do


---------49:34----------
another show whenever okay so Skye the


---------49:36----------
first thing is that what I'm going to


---------49:38----------
tell you I think is going to require


---------49:40----------
immense immense courage and also I don't


---------49:45----------
blame you if you decide not to go down


---------49:48----------
this road but essentially your entire


---------49:51----------
life is built upon this very very simple


---------49:55----------
premise that needs to be like that needs


---------49:57----------
to be yanked out from under you and if


---------49:59----------
it can be then I think you can be fixed


---------50:01----------
but in order for this premise to be


---------50:04----------
yanked out you have to be willing to


---------50:05----------
yank it out and I think it's going to be


---------50:07----------
absolutely terrifying because it's going


---------50:09----------
to change the way that you see the world


---------50:12----------
but in order to do the things that I


---------50:15----------
think you need to do to live a happy


---------50:16----------
life you have to change your worldview


---------50:18----------
so let me explain what I mean you live a


---------50:22----------
life where everything has comes down to


---------50:24----------
you everything is your under your


---------50:26----------
control everything is kind of your fault


---------50:28----------
both the good and the bad that other


---------50:31----------
people don't essentially have agency in


---------50:33----------
the world that other people acting or


---------50:36----------
just based upon whether you can


---------50:38----------
manipulate them enough to do the things


---------50:40----------
that you want right like either you're


---------50:42----------
gonna manipulate them and then they'll


---------50:43----------
do the right thing in which case you're


---------50:44----------
responsible or you're insufficient in


---------50:47----------
terms of manipulating them which is like


---------50:51----------
your fault once again because you didn't


---------50:53----------
like handle the relationship the right


---------50:55----------
way right it doesn't it doesn't presume


---------50:58----------
that there's any kind of agency or


---------51:00----------
control outside of you does that make


---------51:01----------
sense also like I think somewhere along


---------51:06----------
the way you stopped you closed the doors


---------51:11----------
to you being capable of being loved and


---------51:15----------
I didn't ask you if you're able to love


---------51:18----------
I think you are I think what what's


---------51:20----------
challenging here is that I don't know if


---------51:23----------
you're willing to take the risk to be


---------51:24----------
loved again because I think that like


---------51:27----------
that huh what was that the the yank the


---------51:31----------
blanket the part of it buddy that's part


---------51:33----------
of it I think you have to risk a lot of


---------51:35----------
things one is the possibility of


---------51:38----------
understanding that other human beings


---------51:40----------
actually have agency and control in this


---------51:42----------
world which is a terrifying thought


---------51:44----------
right oh yeah it's what it's like taking


---------51:48----------
taking a single player person and


---------51:50----------
sticking them into a multiplayer game


---------51:51----------
they're like this is not what I signed


---------51:53----------
up for


---------51:54----------
oh you learn how to clap back yeah so


---------51:57----------
that's exactly and and so you have but


---------52:01----------
like and I think that there's a part of


---------52:03----------
you so now I want you to look within


---------52:04----------
yourself there's a part of you that


---------52:07----------
recognizes that like when some people


---------52:09----------
are the vic-20 have a 12 year old that


---------52:12----------
gets raped by an adult man who found


---------52:17----------
where the kid lived


---------52:19----------
you know that that is not the 12 year


---------52:21----------
olds fault like you know that but it


---------52:23----------
feels like it was your fault and this is


---------52:25----------
what happens to people who were abused


---------52:27----------
so people who are abused start to it's


---------52:30----------
it's almost it's not like it's not


---------52:32----------
you're stupid in fact it's the opposite


---------52:34----------
so in a very simple level it comes down


---------52:36----------
to theory of mind and now I'm gonna get


---------52:38----------
a little bit academic so when you have a


---------52:41----------
child there understand huh well yeah


---------52:44----------
just really quick I was I just turned 15


---------52:47----------
at the time I don't know oh right yeah


---------52:50----------
but go on you're good so I think when


---------52:52----------
you know when kids are young less less


---------52:55----------
so when they're 15 but when kids are


---------52:57----------
young they don't understand that other


---------52:59----------
human beings have thoughts and feelings


---------53:01----------
and action like have behaviors like they


---------53:03----------
just don't understand they don't have


---------53:05----------
like theory of mind so they don't have


---------53:07----------
the capacity to understand that like it


---------53:09----------
like you know I have a two-year-old and


---------53:11----------
my two-year-old doesn't understand that


---------53:12----------
like I have thoughts and feelings of my


---------53:14----------
own they're just if they want daddy


---------53:16----------
don't like tell them the story at 3:00


---------53:17----------
in the morning when they've woken up


---------53:18----------
like they don't understand that I'm


---------53:20----------
tired like that doesn't compute the


---------53:21----------
brain has not developed the capacity to


---------53:24----------
understand that other human beings like


---------53:26----------
think and act in a particular way and


---------53:27----------
that they have their own reasons for


---------53:29----------
doing things which is why abusing a


---------53:31----------
child is so devastating because if


---------53:33----------
nothing else exists in the world so let


---------53:34----------
me put it this way it's like a


---------53:36----------
five-year-old is basically playing a


---------53:37----------
single-player game because their brain


---------53:39----------
does not have the capacity to recognize


---------53:42----------
that other people are actually they


---------53:44----------
think everyone is an NPC when it's


---------53:46----------
actually like another like it's like


---------53:49----------
another player that's zoned into your


---------53:50----------
server but they think everything is NPCs


---------53:52----------
that make sense and if something bad


---------53:55----------
happens to a five-year-old and you're in


---------53:57----------
a world full of NPCs whose fault is it


---------54:01----------
your fault absolutely right because


---------54:04----------
everyone else is an NPC and it's a is


---------54:08----------
yeah wow I never I I never actually it


---------54:13----------
that my do you think that's linked so I


---------54:15----------
like babies don't really have object


---------54:17----------
permanence and then like when you just


---------54:19----------
make something disappear they think it's


---------54:21----------
gone forever yes as they can't okay sort


---------54:24----------
of so object permanence is a slightly


---------54:25----------
different thing why but they yeah it is


---------54:29----------
linked in the sense that that's one


---------54:31----------
example of


---------54:32----------
fundamental capacity that a baby does


---------54:34----------
not have that adults do have and another


---------54:37----------
capacities is called theory of mind


---------54:39----------
which is separate from object permanence


---------54:41----------
but which is your ability to like


---------54:43----------
recognize that other people have


---------54:44----------
persistent thoughts and feelings and


---------54:46----------
there are their own agents so when it


---------54:50----------
god oh yeah I mean that what you just


---------54:58----------
said like everyone have their own


---------54:59----------
thoughts and feelings and agency I just


---------55:02----------
to me I can't even imagine that being


---------55:05----------
true


---------55:06----------
yeah I know that sounds terrible though


---------55:08----------
right wait so so so now we understand


---------55:11----------
actually like the the the depth of or


---------55:14----------
sort of the how can I say this how


---------55:19----------
deeply rooted this belief isn't in you


---------55:21----------
and the first question is like whether


---------55:23----------
you're willing to try to live a life


---------55:26----------
where you're not in control


---------55:28----------
whether you're try whether you're


---------55:30----------
willing to try to live a life where you


---------55:33----------
could let other people love you and like


---------55:36----------
it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that


---------55:38----------
you don't feel loved because you know


---------55:40----------
like love genuinely comes from another


---------55:41----------
person it's not something that you can


---------55:43----------
control you can't manipulate someone to


---------55:45----------
love you like true authentic love I


---------55:46----------
don't think you can really manipulate


---------55:47----------
out of someone and and so if you're the


---------55:50----------
only agent it doesn't surprise me that


---------55:52----------
you're not able to kind of feel love


---------55:54----------
because it's like you don't really know


---------55:55----------
what that is like are you just


---------55:56----------
manipulating them is that the way


---------55:58----------
they're treating you that way like and


---------56:00----------
you also have this sort of oh my god yes


---------56:02----------
yeah but yes so in order for you to feel


---------56:05----------
loved you have to give people the


---------56:07----------
opportunity to like have control over


---------56:09----------
the way that they treat you so you're


---------56:14----------
bigoted yeah huh and now I'm uh oh you


---------56:19----------
said it so perfectly


---------56:22----------
goddamnit when you just said like you


---------56:26----------
know you if someone feels a certain way


---------56:29----------
about you


---------56:30----------
do they feel that way because you went


---------56:32----------
through leaps and bounds to kind of


---------56:34----------
manipulate your image how are you like


---------56:35----------
it's almost like you're almost like I'm


---------56:38----------
taking everyone in the world and then


---------56:40----------
saying you don't have to have a first


---------56:42----------
impression of me let me just go ahead


---------56:44----------
and coat in what I want you to think


---------56:47----------
about me like so that you'll never get


---------56:50----------
it wrong like that's but then it what is


---------56:54----------
what if someone just hates you um this


---------56:56----------
is terrible so sky this is so I started


---------56:59----------
this off with it requires courage on a


---------57:01----------
level that you do have never experienced


---------57:04----------
this is terrible thought yes right you


---------57:08----------
have to you have to be willing to let


---------57:10----------
them hate you no no I I would rather


---------57:22----------
think about existing and death times 10


---------57:25----------
than this


---------57:26----------
I know so it's is courage on an order of


---------57:29----------
magnitude that you have never well what


---------57:31----------
if they what if they hate me but if I


---------57:35----------
just was able to tell them a little


---------57:37----------
about lightning sky oh okay


---------57:40----------
what would it feel like so you're scared


---------57:43----------
of hate but I'm gonna ask you another


---------57:44----------
question what would it feel like if if


---------57:47----------
you didn't manipulate someone and they


---------57:50----------
chose to love you instead if they


---------57:53----------
actually said you know what despite all


---------57:56----------
of your BS and with you just being you


---------57:58----------
and without manipulating me


---------58:00----------
I love you how would that make you feel


---------58:03----------
there would be a comma afterwards I say


---------58:07----------
I love you


---------58:08----------
now we're late for Quidditch is what I


---------58:10----------
would hear that's how crazy again it is


---------58:11----------
to me


---------58:12----------
like that's what I would hear like Oh


---------58:14----------
even though you didn't you know make me


---------58:17----------
feel a certain way about you I love you


---------58:19----------
let's go win for Gryffindor like and


---------58:21----------
that is how absolutely impossible but


---------58:24----------
it's not like it's not like I'm a


---------58:27----------
monster or something it's that like I I


---------58:30----------
don't even really like I mean I hate


---------58:33----------
myself I mean many of us do we just


---------58:35----------
don't really want to say it so it's like


---------58:37----------
if I hate Who I am oh well I'm not gonna


---------58:43----------
let up like other people see this mess


---------58:46----------
as for what it is because then they'll


---------58:49----------
hate me too that's crazy there's no way


---------58:50----------
I have to show at least that I have the


---------58:54----------
desire and the will to change and be


---------58:57----------
better otherwise what's the point why


---------58:59----------
even beloved like if you're not gonna


---------59:02----------
love your soul this doesn't make sense


---------59:04----------
to me damn I must sound like a psycho no


---------59:10----------
I don't think you sound like a psycho I


---------59:12----------
think you sound like someone who was


---------59:14----------
abused and it wasn't sufficiently loved


---------59:15----------
when you were growing up that's what


---------59:18----------
that's what when people are abused and


---------59:22----------
don't have an appropriate home


---------59:24----------
environment to get them through that


---------59:25----------
abuse they end up sounding like you I


---------59:28----------
don't think you're psycho I think you're


---------59:30----------
I think it's the only way that you've


---------59:31----------
learned how to survive this is this this


---------59:34----------
all of these thoughts and constructions


---------59:36----------
that you have are about survival because


---------59:39----------
the thought that someone could see you


---------59:41----------
for who you are and accept you is


---------59:42----------
mind-boggling and there's no [ __ ] way


---------59:44----------
that you're willing to risk it and


---------59:46----------
because you never risk it you're never


---------59:49----------
getting data to the contrary of your


---------59:51----------
opinion you've never given an


---------59:53----------
opportunity for someone to love you so


---------59:55----------
how can you possibly be loved because at


---------59:57----------
this point you're just fake and and what


---------60:01----------
I'm asking you to do requires a lot of


---------60:03----------
courage it requires you to let someone


---------60:05----------
see the real you and then let them make


---------60:10----------
their own decision and then understand


---------60:12----------
because it's devastating


---------60:13----------
because I can even there's even a part


---------60:16----------
of you that actually doubts that you're


---------60:17----------
actually a piece of [ __ ] but you would


---------60:19----------
rather sit in the comfort of the thought


---------60:22----------
that you're a piece of [ __ ] rather than


---------60:25----------
risk the the chance that it could be


---------60:27----------
wrong and then like you really know for


---------60:29----------
a hundred percent because that's the


---------60:32----------
same thing as like my channel is like I


---------60:36----------
could put a hundred percent into my


---------60:39----------
videos I've never done that yeah I


---------60:41----------
haven't because you've got the slice of


---------60:44----------
protection right yeah right right and


---------60:46----------
I've been actually a failure I just


---------60:49----------
didn't give it my all yeah and then now


---------60:52----------
it's like so sky Icecrown sound it


---------60:55----------
worked out - courage and courage courage


---------60:58----------
I don't care about what looked out so


---------61:00----------
you just have to decide are you willing


---------61:02----------
to live a life where you are willing to


---------61:04----------
risk are you willing to be loved are you


---------61:07----------
willing to be successful are you willing


---------61:09----------
to fail are you willing to be rejected


---------61:12----------
this is the question you have to ask


---------61:14----------
yourself do you want to try to live a


---------61:18----------
different way


---------61:23----------
I don't know if I can and I don't know


---------61:29----------
as I am right now I think of myself as


---------61:33----------
honestly like disgusting


---------61:38----------
yeah like actually repulsive okay in in


---------61:41----------
mind body everything so though it's like


---------61:44----------
yep


---------61:46----------
give yourself some time okay so the


---------61:49----------
first thing is I think it's good that


---------61:50----------
you're moving out and I think you're the


---------61:51----------
more that you prioritize yourself you're


---------61:53----------
gonna build a little bit of confidence I


---------61:55----------
think it's actually a huge step forward


---------61:56----------
that you're moving out the second second


---------61:59----------
thing is that I do think you can repair


---------62:00----------
your relationships and I think you could


---------62:02----------
pay off your debt and stuff like that


---------62:03----------
not to say that not not to say that that


---------62:07----------
you know that's a guaranteed or anything


---------62:09----------
but I have I have faith in you and


---------62:11----------
that's not just like because I'm just a


---------62:13----------
generally good guy and I have faith in


---------62:14----------
people I think if you're able to make


---------62:16----------
money at some point in life generally


---------62:18----------
speaking like you don't just randomly


---------62:19----------
make like oh sure winning the lottery is


---------62:21----------
the exception but even being like on UT


---------62:23----------
YouTube personality or whatever a twitch


---------62:25----------
personality like there's some something


---------62:27----------
that resonated with your community


---------62:29----------
that's like still there it's like a


---------62:30----------
skill that you have and as long as


---------62:32----------
you're able to kind of like pick it up


---------62:33----------
and polish it off like I think you'll be


---------62:35----------
able to start generating revenue again


---------62:36----------
maybe you won't maybe I have no idea


---------62:38----------
well I think it's possible for you and


---------62:40----------
that's like sort of an it like it's a


---------62:41----------
scientific statement it's not like a you


---------62:43----------
know like oh I'm a nice dude oh yeah I


---------62:45----------
mean I've clearly demonstrated yeah I


---------62:48----------
have the tools to do it yeah absolutely


---------62:50----------
so so I think you can I think you can do


---------62:52----------
this I think the the last thing and I'm


---------62:55----------
gonna try to help you with this of


---------62:57----------
course but and we're gonna meditate I'm


---------62:59----------
listening and I'm also taking notes


---------63:00----------
because what you just said to me III


---------63:03----------
think you have to just be willing to


---------63:05----------
like let yourself be wrong on all of


---------63:08----------
this stuff oh right because because like


---------63:12----------
and I think what you're gonna get is


---------63:14----------
gonna be just as amazing as Quidditch


---------63:16----------
like it's you're gonna be surprised like


---------63:18----------
if you actually let yourself be loved by


---------63:20----------
someone it's about as good as Quidditch


---------63:25----------
you know a flying broom I would take a


---------63:29----------
flying broom over love free oh yeah okay


---------63:33----------
well I'm just saying like I see what you


---------63:35----------
mean they're like I mean I'm sure isn't


---------63:37----------
amazing you know so I mean I'd say that


---------63:39----------
just just for the sake of seeing what


---------63:43----------
that feels like


---------63:44----------
I think you've got to try it so you can


---------63:46----------
report back and let us know how do i


---------63:49----------
okay last question what is what do you


---------63:51----------
feel is the first step to trying that


---------63:54----------
good assuming I would we're gonna


---------63:56----------
meditate world that's gonna be number


---------63:58----------
one okay


---------64:00----------
what is we're gonna meditate I'm gonna


---------64:02----------
show you how to do we're gonna do the


---------64:03----------
first step right now


---------64:04----------
oh [ __ ] okay yeah sorry no procrastinate


---------64:09----------
on okay so this guy I want you to sit up


---------64:12----------
straight okay close your eyes


---------64:21----------
and you guys can do this at home


---------64:22----------
especially if you resonate with sky cuz


---------64:25----------
I'm gonna ask some weird questions so


---------64:27----------
Scott you're busted right like


---------64:29----------
fundamentally agree well ways they


---------64:34----------
busted what do you mean like in a good


---------64:38----------
way like you're like you're broken good


---------64:40----------
you're amazing no no no well you're like


---------64:42----------
a piece of crap


---------64:43----------
ah yes right that one incapable of being


---------64:46----------
loved ah that is your fund about a


---------64:50----------
broken an unfixable so I want you to


---------64:56----------
tell me I want you to try to find where


---------64:58----------
that comes from in your body so where


---------65:01----------
does that feeling arise from like what


---------65:03----------
is it that you can you find the like the


---------65:08----------
fundamental brokenness within you the


---------65:09----------
part of you that is unfixed does it live


---------65:11----------
anywhere in in your being my weight okay


---------65:24----------
yeah I would say my weight okay that's


---------65:31----------
the only thing I can see okay okay so


---------65:35----------
are you saying that kind of


---------65:36----------
intellectually or you're saying are you


---------65:38----------
kind of like you're feeling the


---------65:39----------
heaviness of your body and you're like


---------65:41----------
yeah this is like kind of a busted thing


---------65:43----------
it I mean I could even use this as an


---------65:48----------
example like just a minute ago you kind


---------65:52----------
of readjusted yourself on a chair and


---------65:54----------
you sit up a bit and we could see your


---------65:56----------
body I never make a situation where


---------65:59----------
that's possible so it's like I'm already


---------66:02----------
frame one manipulating the way that I


---------66:05----------
look just take selfie angles there's an


---------66:08----------
entire show on catfishing like the the


---------66:11----------
idea of being someone else or letting


---------66:15----------
people see with only what they need to


---------66:16----------
see okay is like close they stop talking


---------66:19----------
for a second and ah and where do you sew


---------66:22----------
all the thoughts that you just had can


---------66:24----------
you find them somewhere in your body


---------66:26----------
even if it's in your mind that's fine


---------66:29----------
like I know that sounds kind of weird


---------66:31----------
but like just just feel the person that


---------66:33----------
you are which is fundamentally someone


---------66:35----------
who is who is in control of the world


---------66:37----------
and incapable of love that's the person


---------66:42----------
that you are agree or disagree is that


---------66:44----------
the person that you are right now


---------66:46----------
yes that's Skye right and you were Skye


---------66:49----------
strongly agree okay now we're gonna try


---------66:52----------
some chanting which we did I think


---------66:55----------
earlier in the week but for those of you


---------66:57----------
were here so we're gonna try to practice


---------66:58----------
this again so I'm gonna teach you how to


---------67:00----------
chant ohm so this is gonna be kind of


---------67:02----------
weird and hopefully we don't blow


---------67:04----------
everyone's ears off


---------67:05----------
so ohm is composed of three syllables


---------67:08----------
ah-hoo and mm okay so I'm gonna chant


---------67:12----------
once and you go through all three of


---------67:15----------
those sounds over the course of one


---------67:17----------
breath


---------67:20----------
ah


---------67:23----------
[Laughter]


---------67:30----------
Oh


---------67:39----------
okay so remember that Sapna chanting is


---------67:42----------
about not sound it's about vibration so


---------67:47----------
I want you to feel the vibration in your


---------67:50----------
body as you chant those sounds okay so


---------67:52----------
we're gonna do it together and the sound


---------67:55----------
is ie you ah ooh perfect


---------68:02----------
yeah very good so let's do it together


---------68:04----------
so deep breath in tight whoa hmm


---------68:20----------
bigger breath let me hear it let me hear


---------68:23----------
it again big deep breath okay yeah okay


---------68:35----------
so I want you to spend longer on the ooh


---------68:37----------
so big deep breath as big as you could


---------68:40----------
take and stretch it out as long as you


---------68:42----------
can one more time


---------69:00----------
good much better now I want you to


---------69:06----------
increase the vibration okay one more


---------69:10----------
time we'll do it together


---------69:19----------
[Music]


---------69:21----------
Oh


---------69:28----------
good again


---------69:37----------
[Music]


---------69:45----------
y'all watching at home y'all should do


---------69:47----------
this - yeah actually paid okay let's say


---------69:52----------
again big breath in


---------70:02----------
[Music]


---------70:09----------
four more breaths


---------70:28----------
big deep breath


---------70:45----------
two more make them count


---------70:58----------
[Music]


---------71:05----------
last one give it everything you've got


---------71:13----------
[Laughter]


---------71:16----------
[Music]


---------71:37----------
[Music]


---------71:39----------
what the hell and I want you to just


---------71:53----------
feel the person that you are and try to


---------72:02----------
get a sense of what what's wrong with


---------72:04----------
this person sort of feel the remnants of


---------72:16----------
vibration just feel like how do you how


---------72:21----------
does it feel right now like it feels


---------72:31----------
like I'm like my like I'm closing my


---------72:36----------
eyes obviously I feels like my mind is


---------72:38----------
like shaving off pieces on my mind it's


---------72:41----------
weird like good keep shaving buddies


---------72:45----------
like yeah just yeah when you said is


---------72:52----------
this you said is this person terrible or


---------72:55----------
something yeah I was always gonna answer


---------72:59----------
no yeah it was weird


---------73:01----------
yep but very weird right it's a new


---------73:04----------
sensation to not be a terrible person


---------73:06----------
all right


---------73:11----------
I guess it is possible so it's not about


---------73:16----------
whether it's possible it's about trying


---------73:20----------
okay so Skyy I want you to start by


---------73:23----------
doing this practice every day for three


---------73:25----------
to five minutes nine breaths nine rounds


---------73:30----------
three to five minutes oh okay


---------73:35----------
so nine breaths and just sit with the


---------73:38----------
person that you are before the practice


---------73:40----------
it's a different sky from where you are


---------73:42----------
after the practice the feeling won't


---------73:46----------
last long but I want you to have an


---------73:48----------
experience of yourself where you aren't


---------73:51----------
a piece of [ __ ] and that starts for a


---------73:55----------
few moments after meditation just sit


---------73:58----------
with that person to hang out with that


---------73:59----------
person yeah


---------74:03----------
okay okay okay all right


---------74:07----------
questions before we wrap up for the day


---------74:10----------
yeah are you um god no like ah then


---------74:15----------
that's it that's all I had asked hey I


---------74:17----------
appreciate know as usual know if I was


---------74:21----------
if I was God then I couldn't actually


---------74:22----------
help anyone but as it turns out Amin and


---------74:25----------
so the cool thing about being human is


---------74:27----------
that the experiences that I have I can


---------74:30----------
actually like the things that happen to


---------74:33----------
me and my growth in life is actually


---------74:36----------
applicable to other humans right so


---------74:38----------
that's kind of cool ah yeah


---------74:40----------
[ __ ] well I I look forward to our next


---------74:43----------
meeting there's actually amazing I'm


---------74:45----------
glad you feel that way yeah uh yeah okay


---------74:49----------
so I'm gonna do that nine breaths every


---------74:51----------
day yep because I think we're at the


---------74:55----------
when it comes to me and my unfixable


---------74:57----------
problems the finish line is the what we


---------74:59----------
brought up earlier and I'm looking


---------75:02----------
forward to at least trying what I can to


---------75:05----------
do it I'll do it I'll do whatever it


---------75:07----------
takes all right good I'm very happy to


---------75:11----------
hear that so just give it your best and


---------75:13----------
don't beat yourself up when you


---------75:14----------
inevitably screw up which is okay


---------75:16----------
because screw ups are a normal part of


---------75:18----------
life and it doesn't mean that they can't


---------75:20----------
be fixed so if you miss a day on


---------75:22----------
meditation don't throw the baby out with


---------75:24----------
the bathwater just


---------75:25----------
pick it up the next day or in two days


---------75:27----------
or in three days pick it up when you can


---------75:29----------
when you're able to and I don't know


---------75:31----------
where you live but if there's any kind


---------75:33----------
of Meditation Center that you can go to


---------75:35----------
that could help a lot I'm gonna prove to


---------75:39----------
because it helps to be in a community


---------75:41----------
with other people who meditate just to


---------75:44----------
keep you on on on track okay yeah all


---------75:48----------
right thanks a lot sky good job thank


---------75:51----------
you thank you as usual thank you for


---------75:53----------
today yeah man I'm gonna have a lot to


---------75:55----------
think about


---------75:55----------
yeah I'm not willing to give up hope on


---------75:57----------
you yet and I'm glad that you're you're


---------75:59----------
willing to entertain the idea that maybe


---------76:01----------
you are fixable


---------76:05----------
well I'm gonna go shower and cry I'll


---------76:09----------
talk to you soon you know have a good


---------76:11----------
