---------00:00----------
so the first thing that i kind of want


---------00:01----------
to talk a little bit about in terms of


---------00:03----------
sleep is i don't know if you all know


---------00:04----------
this but we have a lot of information


---------00:07----------
about sleep right


---------00:09----------
so


---------00:10----------
if we look kind of statistically


---------00:13----------
this is


---------00:15----------
this the level of scientific advancement


---------00:17----------
in the world is at an all-time high at


---------00:19----------
least


---------00:20----------
you know most people can sort of assume


---------00:22----------
that i don't know about the sumerians


---------00:23----------
and some of these ancient civilizations


---------00:25----------
that may have gone to space and whatnot


---------00:27----------
but generally speaking we can assume


---------00:29----------
that our scientific


---------00:30----------
our level of understanding


---------00:32----------
scientifically of sleep is at an


---------00:33----------
all-time high


---------00:35----------
we also tend to have access to science


---------00:38----------
at an unprecedented level right so now


---------00:40----------
we have for example lots of people like


---------00:42----------
myself


---------00:43----------
who understand some degree of science


---------00:46----------
i.e or clinicians and we show up on


---------00:48----------
twitch or youtube or whatever like tick


---------00:50----------
tock instagram whatever and we will like


---------00:53----------
teach people about the science right so


---------00:55----------
so not only is like not only do we know


---------00:57----------
the most about sleep that we've ever


---------00:59----------
known


---------01:00----------
but the ability for you to access that


---------01:02----------
information


---------01:03----------
is also at an all-time high


---------01:06----------
so this kind of begs the question


---------01:08----------
if this is the most we've ever known


---------01:10----------
about sleep and access to information


---------01:12----------
about sleep is an all-time time high


---------01:15----------
why is everyone struggling with sleep


---------01:18----------
right it's kind of weird like there's


---------01:20----------
something fundamentally wrong with the


---------01:22----------
way that we approach sleep


---------01:25----------
so the first thing that i'm going to


---------01:26----------
kind of do is like talk a little bit


---------01:28----------
about what how people approach sleep so


---------01:30----------
the first thing that happens is someone


---------01:31----------
says


---------01:32----------
i have trouble with sleep right so we're


---------01:34----------
going to actually flash to a subreddit


---------01:36----------
post that kind of triggered this which


---------01:38----------
is a great post


---------01:41----------
dr k i need to sleep help okay dear dr k


---------01:45----------
i was wondering if you could make a


---------01:46----------
stream video about topics around sleep


---------01:47----------
insomnia sleep disorders depression and


---------01:49----------
sleep reasons why people have difficulty


---------01:51----------
sleeping etc i believe many peop many


---------01:53----------
struggle with sleeping especially my


---------01:55----------
fellow gamers advice is much needed


---------01:57----------
personal experience i don't allow myself


---------01:59----------
to sleep even though i'm tired and


---------02:00----------
exhausted i take a long time to actually


---------02:02----------
fall asleep i wake up multiple times at


---------02:05----------
night and the overall sleep experience


---------02:07----------
does not feel like quality sleep and i


---------02:09----------
don't feel rested at all when i wake up


---------02:12----------
i also have a hard time getting out of


---------02:13----------
bed in the morning i struggle with


---------02:15----------
depression and ptsd and them seeing a


---------02:16----------
therapist would love any advice so


---------02:18----------
beautiful post we get requests like this


---------02:21----------
all the time people are constantly


---------02:22----------
asking us about sleep and so the other


---------02:24----------
thing that tends to happen is if you


---------02:26----------
look at like people who disseminate


---------02:27----------
information sleep is a hot topic so a


---------02:30----------
lot of people are talking about it right


---------02:32----------
so you'll tend to have i've sort of


---------02:34----------
noticed that like you'll have experts in


---------02:36----------
sleep so you'll have some kind of


---------02:37----------
scientists like probably a phd


---------02:39----------
who is an expert in sleep or


---------02:41----------
neuroscience or something like that


---------02:43----------
right so they really understand the


---------02:44----------
science and then what they'll tend to do


---------02:46----------
is they'll offer recommendations so look


---------02:48----------
at this they'll look at studies and


---------02:50----------
stuff and they'll say like oh like


---------02:51----------
there's a study that shows this and like


---------02:52----------
this is what we understand about the


---------02:54----------
brain and neuroscience and circadian


---------02:56----------
rhythms and stuff like that and then


---------02:57----------
they'll make recommendations


---------02:59----------
and so despite the fact that their


---------03:01----------
science is really solid in their


---------03:03----------
recommendations appear to be really good


---------03:06----------
we see still seem to have a societal


---------03:08----------
sleep problem and why is that okay


---------03:10----------
and so i think the the problem here is


---------03:12----------
that if you look at a lot of people who


---------03:14----------
are scientists


---------03:15----------
they have very little clinical


---------03:17----------
experience so the majority of people who


---------03:19----------
are scientists who will offer sleep


---------03:21----------
recommendations have not worked with


---------03:23----------
like actual humans around their problems


---------03:25----------
that's not actually part of their job


---------03:27----------
right their part their job is to do a


---------03:29----------
clinical trial where we offer an


---------03:31----------
intervention we're going to take 10 000


---------03:33----------
people we're going to split them into a


---------03:34----------
control group and a normal group and 5


---------03:37----------
000 people we're going to give let's say


---------03:38----------
some kind of supplement or herb and 5


---------03:40----------
000 people we're going to do


---------03:42----------
give them a sugar pill and what we're


---------03:44----------
going to detect is that on average the


---------03:47----------
people who take the herb or the


---------03:49----------
supplement do better than the people who


---------03:52----------
take the placebo and so they conclude


---------03:54----------
that on average this herb or supplement


---------03:57----------
results in like an improvement in sleep


---------03:59----------
but let's remember that out of those 5


---------04:01----------
000 people let's say 2 000 people got


---------04:03----------
better with the placebo and 3 000 people


---------04:05----------
got better with the herb


---------04:07----------
let's remember for a moment that like 2


---------04:09----------
000 people got better with the placebo


---------04:11----------
and 2 000 people didn't get better at


---------04:12----------
all


---------04:13----------
so really all you're talking about is a


---------04:15----------
thousand people in the middle that got


---------04:17----------
better from the the herb right so if you


---------04:20----------
really think about it


---------04:21----------
only 20 percent the the effect size or


---------04:24----------
what's called the number needed to treat


---------04:27----------
for your medication is like you have to


---------04:29----------
treat five people on average to get


---------04:31----------
actually that may be the incorrect


---------04:33----------
calculation but


---------04:34----------
there's this concept of number needed to


---------04:36----------
treat where when we look at science we


---------04:38----------
look at populations and what we end up


---------04:40----------
with is sort of like even though this


---------04:41----------
study is successful and someone can say


---------04:44----------
very scientifically that this works


---------04:46----------
better than placebo there's actually


---------04:48----------
like 4 000 people in that study who did


---------04:50----------
not benefit from it and this is the way


---------04:52----------
that science proceeds right so then


---------04:53----------
we'll do clinical trials on for example


---------04:55----------
cbt for insomnia cognitive behavioral


---------04:58----------
therapy for insomnia and that appears to


---------04:59----------
work for sleep people will develop apps


---------05:02----------
and study like these kinds of things and


---------05:03----------
we study yoga and we study this and we


---------05:05----------
study that and we study this kind of


---------05:07----------
thing and we found this kind of


---------05:08----------
correlation and so all of our science


---------05:11----------
sort of is like very generalized and


---------05:13----------
looking at populations and so this is


---------05:15----------
the reason why people have difficulty


---------05:18----------
sleeping because the question is if you


---------05:20----------
are having difficulty sleeping should


---------05:22----------
you adjust your diet because there's a


---------05:24----------
study that shows that diet is helpful


---------05:25----------
for sleep should you take this


---------05:27----------
particular supplement because there's


---------05:28----------
studies that shows that this is helpful


---------05:30----------
for sleep should you see a psychologist


---------05:32----------
and do cognitive behavioral therapy for


---------05:34----------
insomnia because the study shows that


---------05:36----------
that works


---------05:37----------
and there's no specificity of


---------05:40----------
recommendations right so this is the


---------05:42----------
downside of that i've sort of noticed


---------05:45----------
right i'm not trying to criticize anyone


---------05:46----------
i think they're offering good


---------05:47----------
information but when it comes to why we


---------05:50----------
have so much information about all the


---------05:52----------
stuff that's effective for sleep when it


---------05:54----------
translates to an actual human being or


---------05:57----------
you it doesn't seem to translate very


---------05:59----------
well right


---------06:01----------
and that there's a good reason for that


---------06:02----------
and that's because the scientists tend


---------06:04----------
not to be clinicians


---------06:06----------
on the flip side we have clinicians


---------06:08----------
right so we have medical doctors we may


---------06:10----------
have psychologists that work with people


---------06:12----------
individuals and then they'll sort of


---------06:14----------
make recommendations do cbt things like


---------06:16----------
that and if we have all these clinicians


---------06:18----------
why is it sleep cured like don't we have


---------06:20----------
all these people who are on the front


---------06:22----------
lines like clinicians like myself that


---------06:24----------
are working with people every day and


---------06:25----------
and


---------06:26----------
shouldn't that fix it and this is the


---------06:28----------
problem is that clinicians tend to be


---------06:30----------
taught pathology right so if you go to a


---------06:33----------
medical doctor and you say i have


---------06:35----------
trouble with sleep what they will do is


---------06:37----------
try to diagnose you with something and


---------06:39----------
if there's something pathological that


---------06:41----------
they can fix they'll help you right so


---------06:43----------
if you have sleep apnea for example they


---------06:45----------
will give you a cpap machine a con a


---------06:48----------
continuous positive airway pressure


---------06:49----------
machine that prevents you from becoming


---------06:51----------
apnic and then you're you'll be fine so


---------06:53----------
if you're in the ten percent of the


---------06:55----------
population that has a clear diagnosis


---------06:57----------
i.e something is really busted with you


---------07:01----------
they'll they may be able to fix that so


---------07:02----------
other examples of this could be like


---------07:04----------
hyperthyroidism for example so it leads


---------07:06----------
to insomnia so if your thyroid is out of


---------07:08----------
whack or you have sleep apnea a medical


---------07:10----------
doctor can fix that but medical doctors


---------07:12----------
are individualized and pathology focused


---------07:16----------
and and phds or scientists tend to be


---------07:19----------
like understanding the science but can't


---------07:21----------
tailor their recommendations to an


---------07:23----------
individual person because they're not


---------07:25----------
like really diagnosticians right they're


---------07:27----------
not clinicians they're not taught in


---------07:28----------
that skill and this is the basic problem


---------07:31----------
that i see with sleep


---------07:33----------
is that we have a bunch of information


---------07:35----------
but all of the people who can


---------07:36----------
individualize your recommendations are


---------07:38----------
focusing on pathology and all of the


---------07:40----------
people who have access to the really


---------07:42----------
high quality scientific information that


---------07:44----------
is not pathological in nature i.e


---------07:46----------
supplements herbs things like that don't


---------07:48----------
really have a very solid training in in


---------07:52----------
like diagnostics and sort of teasing


---------07:54----------
apart what is going on with an


---------07:56----------
individual which is why we get these


---------07:58----------
super generic recommendations right so


---------08:00----------
you'll get like these these like people


---------08:02----------
that go on podcasts and stuff and


---------08:04----------
there's nothing against them and they'll


---------08:05----------
say okay here are five things you can do


---------08:07----------
for your sleep there's data to support


---------08:08----------
all five of these things and then like


---------08:10----------
you'd think that if those actually


---------08:12----------
worked then like sleep would be cured


---------08:13----------
for everyone right like those five


---------08:15----------
things like it every problem would be


---------08:16----------
solved but the truth is the problem


---------08:18----------
isn't solved and why is that it's


---------08:19----------
because there's a lack of diagnostic


---------08:21----------
specificity okay


---------08:23----------
y'all with me there so let's start with


---------08:25----------
this


---------08:27----------
okay


---------08:29----------
okay so here's how we're gonna approach


---------08:31----------
this and this is why it's gonna be


---------08:32----------
complicated all right chat


---------08:35----------
so what we're gonna do


---------08:37----------
okay there we go there we go


---------08:42----------
okay


---------08:44----------
so let's start from the top


---------08:47----------
okay why is sleep a problem


---------08:49----------
so remember kind of like i said so we've


---------08:51----------
got phds over here


---------08:53----------
and they're really good at the science


---------08:56----------
right but they don't know how to provide


---------08:58----------
personalized recommendations


---------09:00----------
this could also be


---------09:02----------
um i mean maybe some of them do i don't


---------09:04----------
know that maybe that's a little bit


---------09:05----------
unfair actually and i think about it the


---------09:07----------
problem is that on a podcast you're not


---------09:08----------
going to get a personalized


---------09:09----------
recommendation right on a youtube video


---------09:11----------
you're not going to get a personalized


---------09:12----------
recommendation unless it's dr k which


---------09:14----------
we'll get to in a second


---------09:16----------
um so then then we've got mds over here


---------09:19----------
that are really good at personalized


---------09:20----------
stuff but what we're really trained in


---------09:23----------
is pathology


---------09:26----------
and so the fact that like our whole


---------09:28----------
society has insomnia and difficulty


---------09:31----------
sleeping


---------09:33----------
has to do with the fact that like this


---------09:35----------
is where we're getting their our


---------09:36----------
information so what's kind of in the


---------09:38----------
middle here and this is what i think is


---------09:39----------
like really really missing from western


---------09:42----------
science and what i really appreciate


---------09:43----------
about my eastern education is like


---------09:45----------
basics of how sleep works


---------09:48----------
so what we're going to start with today


---------09:50----------
is like understand like how does sleep


---------09:52----------
work and so an industry that has done a


---------09:55----------
really good job of this


---------09:57----------
that is like for example the fitness


---------09:59----------
industry or like the bodybuilding


---------10:00----------
industry right so like what's happened


---------10:02----------
in this industry you have a lot of


---------10:03----------
people walking around who like are in


---------10:05----------
shape and they know how to get get


---------10:07----------
in shape they're healthy they're they're


---------10:09----------
fit and why is that it's because there's


---------10:11----------
a lot of like basic information about


---------10:14----------
how to get physically healthy in terms


---------10:16----------
of like building muscle mass and working


---------10:18----------
out and stuff like that there's a lot of


---------10:20----------
information about the basics of fitness


---------10:22----------
that is not coming from phds and not


---------10:24----------
coming from mds like if you go to a


---------10:26----------
doctor's office and you say can you help


---------10:28----------
me get in shape like it's a basic


---------10:30----------
function of the human body like the


---------10:32----------
doctor is going to be like


---------10:33----------
kind of but not really right they can


---------10:35----------
assess you for diabetes and maybe start


---------10:37----------
you on anti-diabetes medication maybe


---------10:39----------
they can like give you an inhaler if


---------10:41----------
you've got asthma they can focus on the


---------10:43----------
pathology but they're not going to like


---------10:44----------
help you figure out how to work out


---------10:46----------
right


---------10:47----------
and then on the flip side you've got


---------10:48----------
phds that you know they'll give you good


---------10:50----------
information too they'll say you can use


---------10:52----------
this supplement


---------10:53----------
and then you'll build muscle mass better


---------10:55----------
there's this kind of thing that you can


---------10:56----------
do there's this kind of thing that you


---------10:57----------
can do but once again they're not going


---------10:59----------
to give you personalized recommendations


---------11:00----------
they're not going to give you like a


---------11:01----------
workout plan right because that's


---------11:03----------
something that a personal trainer does


---------11:05----------
so the main thing that i think is really


---------11:07----------
missing is like the basics of like how


---------11:09----------
sleep works


---------11:11----------
so where does insomnia actually come


---------11:13----------
from right like why do people have


---------11:15----------
difficulty sleeping what are the factors


---------11:17----------
that lead to people like


---------11:20----------
what makes it easy for you to sleep what


---------11:22----------
does your body and physiology and brain


---------11:24----------
rely on to go to sleep how does your


---------11:27----------
body know when you should go to sleep


---------11:30----------
what are the signals that make you


---------11:31----------
sleepy what are the signals that keep


---------11:33----------
you awake and these kinds of fundamental


---------11:35----------
things


---------11:37----------
because we don't understand them we


---------11:39----------
can't tailor our treatment to them


---------11:40----------
because we don't like we just treat


---------11:42----------
insomnia like one word okay so let's


---------11:45----------
start by looking at insomnia and


---------11:47----------
unpacking it


---------11:49----------
because there are three there are


---------11:50----------
different problems when it comes to i


---------11:52----------
have trouble sleeping so the first


---------11:54----------
problem that we have is a lack of


---------11:55----------
specificity with our jargon


---------11:58----------
so if we talk to people who have


---------12:00----------
insomnia


---------12:01----------
what we find is they're people who have


---------12:02----------
trouble falling asleep


---------12:05----------
okay


---------12:06----------
this is completely different so the


---------12:08----------
mechanisms of falling asleep are


---------12:10----------
completely different from the mechanisms


---------12:12----------
of staying asleep


---------12:16----------
right so some people like and i know it


---------12:17----------
sounds kind of weird but you guys get


---------12:19----------
that falling asleep like if i have


---------12:20----------
narcolepsy i have no problem staying


---------12:22----------
asleep like the problem is that i fall


---------12:24----------
asleep way too easily completely


---------12:26----------
different paths so both of these people


---------12:27----------
will say i get bad sleep but there's no


---------12:30----------
specificity in terms of like what's your


---------12:32----------
problem do you have a problem falling


---------12:33----------
asleep or staying asleep because as


---------12:35----------
we'll get into there are different


---------12:36----------
mechanisms and if this is your problem


---------12:38----------
your solutions are going to be different


---------12:40----------
than if this is your problem okay


---------12:42----------
so next thing is that people have


---------12:43----------
difficulty waking up


---------12:50----------
and this too is another like it's a


---------12:52----------
completely different thing right i have


---------12:53----------
no problem falling asleep i have no


---------12:55----------
problem staying asleep i have probably


---------12:57----------
uh some problem waking up and so people


---------12:59----------
will say my sleep sucks well why is it


---------13:01----------
well it's because i heart it's hard for


---------13:02----------
me to wake up in the morning and i feel


---------13:04----------
tired in the morning well okay so then


---------13:06----------
that's you guys get how that's like a


---------13:07----------
completely different thing than like


---------13:09----------
like someone who has anxiety


---------13:11----------
who is awake for three hours like


---------13:12----------
worrying about tomorrow that person's


---------13:15----------
solution is going to be completely


---------13:16----------
different from the person who can fall


---------13:19----------
asleep on time and just has a lot of


---------13:21----------
trouble waking up in the morning now the


---------13:22----------
two may be related because if you sleep


---------13:25----------
three hours late then you're gonna have


---------13:26----------
trouble waking up at 7am because you


---------13:29----------
fell asleep late so i can we cannot


---------13:31----------
understand why things get tangled but


---------13:33----------
let's start by understanding there are


---------13:34----------
different mechanisms at play when it


---------13:36----------
comes to insomnia


---------13:38----------
the the next thing that i'm going to say


---------13:40----------
is i'm tired during the day


---------13:44----------
or in the morning


---------13:46----------
so


---------13:47----------
you might ask what does that have to do


---------13:48----------
with kind of insomnia right so if i ask


---------13:50----------
people


---------13:52----------
how do you know that your sleep is bad


---------13:54----------
if i start with that question


---------13:56----------
what most people will do is they'll say


---------13:58----------
well i feel tired in the morning or


---------14:00----------
during the day


---------14:01----------
so this is the tricky thing about sleep


---------14:03----------
so there's a huge problem with sleep


---------14:04----------
misperception


---------14:06----------
there's a ton of data that shows that


---------14:08----------
human beings are very very bad at


---------14:10----------
judging their sleep


---------14:11----------
and why is that is because you're not


---------14:13----------
conscious


---------14:14----------
so people will say for example that i've


---------14:16----------
only slept three hours last night people


---------14:18----------
say that kind of crap all the time how


---------14:20----------
do they know they only slept three hours


---------14:23----------
do you guys realize if you only slept


---------14:25----------
three hours a night like how torturous


---------14:27----------
it would be to be like bored for five


---------14:29----------
hours in the middle of the night like


---------14:30----------
doing absolutely nothing


---------14:32----------
it's so bad like sleep misperception is


---------14:35----------
like a huge problem so this is another


---------14:37----------
interesting thing right so like there's


---------14:39----------
a fantastic medication called


---------14:42----------
a clever medication i should say


---------14:44----------
so there's a there's a medication called


---------14:46----------
zolpidem which is also known as the


---------14:48----------
trade name in the u.s is called ambien


---------14:49----------
and like this is like a wonder drug for


---------14:51----------
sleep


---------14:52----------
so if you look at the clinical trials


---------14:54----------
for an ambient or zolpidem essentially


---------14:56----------
what it does is increases it only


---------14:58----------
improves sleep by 30 minutes


---------15:01----------
that's all it does it gives people 30


---------15:03----------
more minutes of sleep


---------15:04----------
okay that's it


---------15:06----------
and people think it it cures their


---------15:09----------
insomnia and why is that is because it


---------15:11----------
targets misperception


---------15:13----------
so the real thing that's opened and


---------15:14----------
assaulted it only increases their sleep


---------15:16----------
by 30 minutes it gives you half an hour


---------15:18----------
extra sleep but what it really helps


---------15:20----------
people do is fall asleep


---------15:23----------
and it gives them the perception


---------15:26----------
that they slept well


---------15:28----------
this is really what it improves


---------15:30----------
but the actual amount of sleep that you


---------15:31----------
get from an ambient result is very low


---------15:34----------
right


---------15:35----------
and so like it alters sleep


---------15:37----------
misperception


---------15:38----------
so if we kind of look at insomnia and we


---------15:41----------
try to ask people the question okay like


---------15:43----------
why do you think you are having bad


---------15:45----------
sleep the first thing we need to


---------15:46----------
understand is that misperception is a


---------15:48----------
huge problem and people tend to like


---------15:50----------
poorly diagnose like their own sleeping


---------15:52----------
problems and that sort of makes sense


---------15:54----------
because


---------15:56----------
you're not conscious right so you don't


---------15:57----------
really know what's going on during sleep


---------15:59----------
and so what people will do is they will


---------16:01----------
reverse engineer their sleeping


---------16:04----------
diagnosis


---------16:05----------
based on what they are aware of which is


---------16:07----------
like tiredness during the day right


---------16:10----------
and so this is another reason why for


---------16:12----------
example sleep apnea is so difficult to


---------16:14----------
diagnose


---------16:15----------
because sleep apnea is like this period


---------16:17----------
of time where you stop breathing during


---------16:18----------
sleep and it happens like 10 times a


---------16:20----------
night 30 times a night things like that


---------16:22----------
and people don't realize they never


---------16:23----------
realize all they know is that they're


---------16:26----------
tired during the day and by the way 10


---------16:27----------
of the population has sleep apnea so


---------16:29----------
then what happens is you go to a sleep


---------16:31----------
study and then like you measure your


---------16:33----------
ethnic episodes you sleep in a


---------16:34----------
laboratory where you're being constantly


---------16:36----------
monitored they monitor every single


---------16:38----------
breath that you take over the course of


---------16:39----------
the night and then they diagnose you


---------16:40----------
with sleep apnea


---------16:42----------
okay


---------16:43----------
so when we talk about insomnia we're


---------16:46----------
talking about a number of discrete


---------16:48----------
processes


---------16:50----------
and what people tend to do is they like


---------16:52----------
believe that


---------16:54----------
you know they have difficulty sleeping


---------16:56----------
because of like poor data from the next


---------16:58----------
day or they are aware of some of these


---------17:00----------
things like people are aware of this


---------17:02----------
stuff right so if i wake up or i'm


---------17:03----------
tossing and turning all night i have a


---------17:05----------
vague sense


---------17:06----------
of what tossing and turning all night is


---------17:08----------
but what we'll really discover is it's


---------17:10----------
not really all night


---------17:12----------
so just take a step back from that


---------17:14----------
but these are kind of three discreet


---------17:16----------
things that are four discrete things


---------17:17----------
that people will say when they say i


---------17:19----------
have trouble my sleep sucks okay


---------17:21----------
so the first thing that we have to try


---------17:23----------
to do is sort of recognize that there


---------17:25----------
are four discrete things that have four


---------17:26----------
discrete processes which we'll have in


---------17:28----------
turn four discrete solutions


---------17:31----------
okay


---------17:33----------
next thing is


---------17:37----------
let's think a little bit about so if we


---------17:39----------
want to understand what are the


---------17:40----------
components of sleep


---------17:42----------
if we want to understand how to tackle


---------17:44----------
these problems we have to understand


---------17:46----------
like what sleep is


---------17:48----------
why we sleep and like how the body knows


---------17:51----------
how to fall asleep okay


---------17:53----------
so


---------17:54----------
why is this important so like i want you


---------17:56----------
all to just think about this for a


---------17:57----------
second right so if we want to optimize


---------17:59----------
something in our body


---------18:01----------
we have to understand like how it works


---------18:04----------
and why it has evolved the way that it


---------18:06----------
has and once we understand like what how


---------18:09----------
the body works


---------18:10----------
then we can start to make very targeted


---------18:12----------
changes to optimize things in the


---------18:14----------
direction that we want to so once again


---------18:16----------
i'm going to use a fitness analogy right


---------18:18----------
so once we understand okay the body


---------18:20----------
craves carbohydrates because they're


---------18:22----------
calorie dense


---------18:23----------
and back when we evolved like there were


---------18:26----------
survival benefits to eating calorie


---------18:27----------
dense food okay now that i understand


---------18:29----------
this basic principle i understand like


---------18:31----------
what i need to alter in order to like


---------18:34----------
work in line with my body so i'm gonna


---------18:36----------
need to eat like complex carbohydrates


---------18:38----------
that in higher fiber diets to help me


---------18:41----------
feel full


---------18:43----------
and if i eat high fiber foods that help


---------18:46----------
me feel full it will counteract some of


---------18:49----------
the caloric craving that i have so we


---------18:51----------
can start to leverage our understanding


---------18:53----------
of like biology and physiology and diet


---------18:57----------
and fitness to optimize our physical


---------18:58----------
health no one does this with sleep right


---------19:01----------
like no one explains like what are the


---------19:03----------
basics of like why we sleep okay


---------19:06----------
so let's go over the basics of why we


---------19:08----------
sleep and once we understand like why we


---------19:10----------
sleep and how we sleep we'll start to


---------19:12----------
see where these four problems arise okay


---------19:16----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------19:17----------
sleep is really really important


---------19:19----------
and it's highly adaptable


---------19:22----------
this is why it's such a problem so if we


---------19:24----------
look at for example your heartbeat okay


---------19:26----------
or your respiratory rate your heartbeat


---------19:29----------
and your respiratory rate are not like


---------19:31----------
that adaptable so the goal of the heart


---------19:33----------
is to continuously pump blood like all


---------19:35----------
the time we don't need to adapt it it's


---------19:37----------
not like we want to stop pumping blood


---------19:39----------
for a couple hours and then like pump


---------19:41----------
extra blood later like sure you can


---------19:43----------
increase your heart rate from let's say


---------19:45----------
you have a resting heart rate of like


---------19:46----------
70. you can go up to like 110 or 120


---------19:49----------
push come to shop but you're never gonna


---------19:51----------
go up to a thousand like you'll die if


---------19:52----------
you do that and you're never gonna drop


---------19:54----------
down to like 20 right like if you do


---------19:56----------
then you're bradycardic and you can have


---------19:58----------
all kinds of problems


---------19:59----------
sleep is a little bit different though


---------20:01----------
so if we think about you know let's say


---------20:02----------
i'm walking around in the jungle


---------20:05----------
and i see a tiger


---------20:07----------
and then like


---------20:08----------
i want to be able to control my sleep


---------20:10----------
right so like if a tiger finds me at two


---------20:12----------
in the morning i need the ability to


---------20:14----------
like stay awake


---------20:16----------
despite the fact that i'm tired


---------20:18----------
otherwise i'll get eaten and similarly


---------20:21----------
like i i need to be able to adjust my


---------20:23----------
sleep schedule i need to be able to stay


---------20:24----------
up all night like let's say i'm a woman


---------20:26----------
giving birth


---------20:27----------
and if i'm in the middle of the labor


---------20:29----------
process and it's midnight it's not like


---------20:31----------
my body's like okay well now that it's


---------20:34----------
midnight let me shut off let me just go


---------20:35----------
to sleep and just pause the labor


---------20:37----------
problem no like you need to stay up all


---------20:38----------
night and like finish the process of


---------20:40----------
labor right so there are all kinds of


---------20:42----------
situations which sleep needs to be


---------20:44----------
highly adaptable and this is why it


---------20:46----------
changes so easily right it's really easy


---------20:48----------
to screw up your sleep schedule because


---------20:51----------
sleep by nature is highly adaptable our


---------20:53----------
body is designed to be able to adjust


---------20:55----------
our sleep schedule based on our needs so


---------20:57----------
other good examples of this are like jet


---------20:59----------
lag right so our body doesn't have a


---------21:01----------
fixed clock our body has a clock that


---------21:03----------
adapts to things like sunlight


---------21:06----------
this will become really really important


---------21:07----------
later so that's how like you know we


---------21:09----------
start off jet lag when our internal


---------21:11----------
circadian rhythm is out of proportion to


---------21:14----------
day time and night time but our body


---------21:17----------
fundamentally a lot of its triggers and


---------21:19----------
cues about when we should sleep and when


---------21:21----------
we should be awake have to do with like


---------21:23----------
light and darkness right and so this has


---------21:26----------
to do with like this has even been


---------21:27----------
evolved over like you know farming and


---------21:29----------
stuff like that like humans tend to be


---------21:30----------
more awake at certain times of the day


---------21:32----------
less awake at other times a day it's all


---------21:33----------
biological in nature but it's it's


---------21:35----------
adaptable


---------21:37----------
so


---------21:39----------
um


---------21:41----------
so here's kind of what what i'm gonna do


---------21:43----------
i'm gonna draw something


---------21:44----------
okay so this is like our sleep so this


---------21:46----------
is like


---------21:48----------
so this is our this is let's say a night


---------21:50----------
of sleep


---------21:51----------
and then if you have problems falling


---------21:53----------
asleep there's like an obstacle here so


---------21:55----------
our body has a very natural tendency to


---------21:58----------
start at point a and go to point z right


---------22:00----------
that's what it wants to do it wants to


---------22:02----------
sleep for eight hours a day and it's got


---------22:04----------
like a


---------22:04----------
this is a natural


---------22:07----------
tendency towards stuff


---------22:09----------
and then there are some kinds of


---------22:11----------
problems that can cause an obstacle to


---------22:13----------
our body's desire to sleep so this is


---------22:15----------
falling asleep


---------22:16----------
so we'll talk about what these factors


---------22:18----------
are


---------22:19----------
and then they're staying asleep


---------22:21----------
so there are things that will disrupt us


---------22:26----------
in the middle of our sleep and then


---------22:27----------
there's even like waking up


---------22:29----------
right so like there are difficulties


---------22:31----------
with waking up where our body naturally


---------22:33----------
wants to end the sleep it's not like you


---------22:35----------
have to


---------22:36----------
turn stop sleeping


---------22:38----------
intentionally right after you sleep for


---------22:40----------
a while your body's like we're done time


---------22:41----------
to wake up so there are natural


---------22:43----------
mechanisms that involve waking up their


---------22:44----------
natural mechanisms that involve staying


---------22:46----------
asleep in their natural mechanisms that


---------22:47----------
involve falling asleep and if we


---------22:49----------
understand what those are we will start


---------22:51----------
to gain power over these different


---------22:53----------
problems okay now just to kind of point


---------22:56----------
out like this is the problem with sort


---------22:57----------
of like the sleep wellness industry for


---------22:59----------
lack of a better term


---------23:01----------
is that what does the sleep wellness


---------23:02----------
industry do it just like drives stuff


---------23:04----------
this way it's like here take this


---------23:06----------
supplement


---------23:08----------
here take this herb


---------23:10----------
here use this app


---------23:12----------
it has no


---------23:13----------
cognizance


---------23:15----------
of like these different physiologic


---------23:18----------
neuroscientific mechanisms they're just


---------23:20----------
like hey do this thing


---------23:22----------
hey do cbt for sleep


---------23:25----------
and i'm not saying that this stuff isn't


---------23:26----------
effective i'm just saying it's just like


---------23:28----------
you're just adding crap into this this


---------23:31----------
like cycle which is going to cause


---------23:33----------
problems so medical doctors are guilty


---------23:35----------
of this too oh i'm having trouble with


---------23:37----------
insomnia if i'm a psychiatrist i'm like


---------23:39----------
here take some trazadone


---------23:41----------
or here pop an ambien


---------23:44----------
and i'm not really addressing the


---------23:47----------
underlying mechanisms with any


---------23:48----------
specificity so come this morning i am


---------23:52----------
tired


---------23:53----------
why because i have this crap floating in


---------23:55----------
my system


---------23:56----------
right


---------23:57----------
so like trazado like floats around and


---------23:59----------
gives people a sense of daytime


---------24:01----------
tiredness


---------24:04----------
and this is the next problem with sleep


---------24:06----------
is that all the things that we do over


---------24:08----------
here


---------24:09----------
that allow us to basically overcome and


---------24:11----------
ignore all of these factors create side


---------24:14----------
effects in the morning


---------24:18----------
so i'll hit on this again


---------24:20----------
but so what are the solutions that


---------24:22----------
people use we use substances right


---------24:25----------
whether it's a whether it's a chemical


---------24:27----------
like whether it's a prescribed drug or a


---------24:30----------
supplement or whatever we just decide


---------24:32----------
like instead of fixing any of this crap


---------24:34----------
in the middle


---------24:35----------
what we're just gonna do is like i'm


---------24:36----------
gonna pop a pill i'm gonna take a


---------24:37----------
supplement i'm gonna take a little i'm


---------24:39----------
gonna take me some magnesium right


---------24:41----------
because sometimes that helps with


---------24:42----------
insomnia i'm gonna take me some valerian


---------24:44----------
root or some apogenin or like some


---------24:46----------
kavakava or like there's all kinds of


---------24:47----------
stuff out there right i mean just take


---------24:49----------
me some of this stuff


---------24:51----------
and then instead of fixing the problem


---------24:52----------
we have that stuff floating around in


---------24:54----------
our system and then we're tired the next


---------24:55----------
day this is also true of marijuana right


---------24:57----------
so like people say oh i use marijuana to


---------24:59----------
help me sleep because i can't sleep


---------25:00----------
without it well then what happens like


---------25:02----------
the next morning so marijuana does


---------25:04----------
different things so it affects so we


---------25:05----------
have you know


---------25:06----------
our sleep cycles


---------25:09----------
right so we've got like you know


---------25:11----------
different phases of sleep and then we


---------25:13----------
have rem sleep


---------25:14----------
and basically early on in the night


---------25:16----------
we'll have like a lot of let's say phase


---------25:18----------
one to two sleep and then you know this


---------25:20----------
is let's say phase three to four and


---------25:22----------
then we've got some rem sleep over here


---------25:23----------
so let's say here's like


---------25:25----------
early night and then as the night goes


---------25:27----------
on we've got sleep uh phase one to two


---------25:30----------
and then we enter phase three to four


---------25:31----------
i'm a little bit rusty on this and then


---------25:33----------
we have more rem sleep


---------25:35----------
right so we have different phases of


---------25:36----------
sleep so our our brain does different


---------25:38----------
things and so hour one of sleep looks


---------25:40----------
like this


---------25:43----------
and hour seven of sleep looks like this


---------25:46----------
so that the the natural change our sleep


---------25:49----------
cycle like evolves over the course of


---------25:51----------
the night


---------25:52----------
and what that means is if i use


---------25:54----------
marijuana or alcohol like if i drink


---------25:56----------
alcohol i will pass out right so alcohol


---------25:59----------
will overcome this step no problem


---------26:02----------
marijuana will overcome the step of


---------26:03----------
falling asleep the problem is then it


---------26:06----------
messes with this stuff and we get like


---------26:08----------
non-restful sleep


---------26:11----------
and we even talk about it in our lingo


---------26:13----------
right we say okay i drink alcohol to


---------26:15----------
help me pass out


---------26:17----------
it's not a natural falling asleep


---------26:19----------
process it's bypassing this step


---------26:21----------
artificially with chemicals which


---------26:23----------
results in a an alteration so like when


---------26:26----------
you drink alcohol for example it


---------26:28----------
decreases the amount of rem sleep that


---------26:29----------
you have it decreases the amount of late


---------26:31----------
stage sleep that you have and so you


---------26:33----------
result in non-restful sleep and then you


---------26:35----------
wake up in the morning


---------26:37----------
tired


---------26:38----------
and then what do you do


---------26:40----------
right so if you use pot or alcohol to


---------26:42----------
sleep at night what do you do then you


---------26:44----------
drink coffee


---------26:47----------
stimulants


---------26:48----------
right


---------26:49----------
and then once i start pounding the


---------26:51----------
coffee


---------26:52----------
when nighttime comes around i have


---------26:54----------
trouble falling asleep because i've got


---------26:56----------
this artificial stimulant floating


---------26:58----------
around in my system preventing me from


---------27:00----------
sleeping


---------27:01----------
and then what do i do


---------27:03----------
right so


---------27:04----------
can't fall asleep


---------27:08----------
oh yeah marijuana sweet


---------27:11----------
marijuana


---------27:13----------
poor quality sleep


---------27:18----------
wake up tired


---------27:20----------
coffee and this is the cycle


---------27:23----------
and so then people are kind of screwed


---------27:25----------
because now you have a potentially


---------27:27----------
marijuana dependence or a caffeine


---------27:28----------
dependence and without either one you're


---------27:31----------
kind of like you can't function right


---------27:34----------
so i this is where like i think if you


---------27:36----------
want to really conquer sleep


---------27:38----------
and be good at it you can't just take a


---------27:41----------
supplement you can't just go to cbt for


---------27:43----------
insomnia unfortunately like sure those


---------27:46----------
things can help


---------27:47----------
like cpap and sleep apnea is the one


---------27:49----------
thing that i'd say is like or maybe


---------27:50----------
hyperthyroidism stuff too but there are


---------27:52----------
definitely things that you can do and


---------27:54----------
like absolutely like supplements can


---------27:55----------
help like doing cbt for insomnia can


---------27:57----------
help there's overwhelming data that does


---------27:59----------
this but in my experience


---------28:01----------
so i've helped like


---------28:02----------
a bunch of people like really just sleep


---------28:05----------
like babies


---------28:06----------
and i'd say that in eighty percent of


---------28:08----------
the people i've done it without a single


---------28:10----------
damn medication


---------28:12----------
uh maybe i'll use it at the beginning


---------28:14----------
because there are other things going on


---------28:15----------
but for like 80 of people it's about


---------28:17----------
understanding how sleep happens


---------28:21----------
and then understanding okay what is the


---------28:22----------
problem that is interfering with your


---------28:24----------
sleep and then targeting that thing


---------28:26----------
specifically because if you use


---------28:28----------
something else like an herb a supplement


---------28:30----------
or a medication


---------28:32----------
that's going to cause side effects


---------28:33----------
because that's just how like stuff that


---------28:34----------
you stick in your body works


---------28:36----------
right like things will create


---------28:38----------
physiologic changes if you ingest them


---------28:41----------
okay


---------28:42----------
so i'm not blaming people who use


---------28:43----------
substances to help them fall asleep hell


---------28:45----------
i sometimes prescribe substances to


---------28:47----------
people to help them fall asleep


---------28:49----------
including marijuana i've done that


---------28:50----------
before right but what i'm saying is that


---------28:53----------
a sustained healthy


---------28:56----------
way to get restful sleep


---------28:58----------
comes with like understanding sleep


---------29:00----------
first


---------29:01----------
and then targeting what your specific


---------29:03----------
like problem with sleep is and it feels


---------29:06----------
just so much better it's just tricky


---------29:08----------
because no blog post from the sleep


---------29:12----------
nutrition supplement industry is gonna


---------29:14----------
explain this stuff right because it's


---------29:16----------
against their business model like


---------29:17----------
they're just trying to sell this thing


---------29:19----------
and i'm not even blaming them because


---------29:20----------
they can be scientific about it they're


---------29:22----------
like sleep is a huge problem let me go


---------29:24----------
look at what science has to offer and


---------29:25----------
they see oh this herb works let's start


---------29:27----------
selling this herb which is totally fine


---------29:28----------
like there's a there's a value to that


---------29:30----------
but in my experience as a clinician


---------29:33----------
this stuff is ultimately way more


---------29:35----------
valuable okay


---------29:37----------
so next question so now that we


---------29:39----------
understand the sleep cycle okay so


---------29:41----------
there's like


---------29:42----------
we start you know at night time


---------29:45----------
and then we wake up ideally in the am


---------29:48----------
there's falling asleep staying asleep


---------29:51----------
waking up right these are our three


---------29:52----------
obstacles so let's start with this


---------29:55----------
okay


---------29:57----------
how does the body like let's just talk


---------29:59----------
about sleep for a second how does the


---------30:00----------
body know like


---------30:02----------
what how does sleep work so imagine that


---------30:04----------
i'm an alien


---------30:06----------
or you're like you have a five-year-old


---------30:08----------
kid who comes to you and says


---------30:10----------
you know person can you please tell me


---------30:13----------
how does the body know like how does the


---------30:14----------
body know when to go to sleep what do


---------30:16----------
y'all think what are the factors


---------30:19----------
that determine when we go to sleep


---------30:24----------
right okay so good so one person is


---------30:26----------
saying adenosine


---------30:28----------
excellent


---------30:29----------
so


---------30:30----------
let's talk about adenosine for a second


---------30:31----------
oh hold on hold on melatonin hold on


---------30:35----------
hold on


---------30:36----------
melatonin


---------30:38----------
exhaustion


---------30:42----------
darkness


---------30:44----------
or light very good


---------30:49----------
okay


---------30:51----------
temperature


---------30:56----------
okay


---------30:57----------
so people are saying stress


---------30:59----------
excellent a lot of good stuff here


---------31:02----------
okay so so remember for all the all five


---------31:05----------
heads out there that are like uh like


---------31:07----------
endogenous body clock circadian rhythm


---------31:10----------
like melatonin light sensitivity


---------31:12----------
remember we're talking to an alien


---------31:13----------
you're not allowed to use science


---------31:16----------
because that's not a thing like let's


---------31:17----------
understand sleep on a basic level what


---------31:19----------
the does that even mean


---------31:21----------
no science


---------31:23----------
tell me like on a basic level


---------31:26----------
how how does sleep work


---------31:29----------
how does the body know when i'm supposed


---------31:30----------
to go to sleep


---------31:33----------
okay


---------31:34----------
we'll get to the science don't worry


---------31:35----------
about it but for now we want to


---------31:37----------
understand on a very simple level


---------31:39----------
you're tired


---------31:40----------
okay


---------31:42----------
okay so let's talk about a couple of


---------31:44----------
these things okay so how does the body


---------31:46----------
know it's tired


---------31:50----------
right it's okay people are saying


---------31:51----------
routine


---------31:52----------
we'll get to these


---------31:59----------
no it's not low blood sugar see there's


---------32:00----------
the science again nope happens to be


---------32:02----------
wrong fatigue that is a synonym for


---------32:05----------
tired right okay so now here comes the


---------32:08----------
so like let's just think about this


---------32:09----------
right so can you sleep for 24 hours a


---------32:11----------
day


---------32:14----------
science is coming don't worry chat


---------32:16----------
but let's start with basics


---------32:19----------
generally speaking no right so if


---------32:20----------
there's some kind of illness and we'll


---------32:21----------
talk about illness at the end


---------32:24----------
you've done that i'm sure


---------32:26----------
right so then we'll even talk a little


---------32:27----------
bit about how you've been able to do


---------32:29----------
that because generally speak people


---------32:30----------
don't sleep for 24 hours a day right


---------32:32----------
generally speak


---------32:33----------
speaking people will stay awake for


---------32:35----------
about 16 hours a day


---------32:37----------
and they'll sleep for about


---------32:39----------
eight hours a day on average okay so


---------32:41----------
there may be variations there are


---------32:42----------
absolutely times where i've slept 20


---------32:44----------
hours


---------32:45----------
and so but the the basic idea is that


---------32:47----------
you know if i wake up at like 10 in the


---------32:49----------
morning like


---------32:50----------
it's really hard for me to sleep eight


---------32:52----------
hours at 3 p.m like for most people you


---------32:55----------
may be able to do it because your system


---------32:56----------
is all messed up totally fine or there


---------32:59----------
could be an illness going on but


---------33:00----------
generally speaking like our body kind of


---------33:02----------
wakes up after like somewhere between


---------33:04----------
like seven and ten hours


---------33:06----------
right and we get tired pretty naturally


---------33:08----------
somewhere around 16 hours and so even if


---------33:10----------
you talk to people who have really super


---------33:12----------
messed up sleep schedules this tends to


---------33:14----------
be like pretty consistent maybe it'll be


---------33:15----------
like 12 to 20.


---------33:17----------
right so they may stay up for 20 hours


---------33:19----------
then pass out for 10 and their sleep


---------33:21----------
like schedule is constantly like


---------33:23----------
changing so one day i'm gonna wake up at


---------33:25----------
10 a.m and the next day i wake up at


---------33:27----------
noon


---------33:28----------
and the next day i wake up at 2 p.m


---------33:30----------
and then i'm going to sleep at like


---------33:32----------
let's say 4 in the morning


---------33:34----------
and the next day i wake up go to sleep


---------33:35----------
at 6 in the morning


---------33:37----------
next day i go to sleep at six in the


---------33:39----------
morning


---------33:40----------
right like but if you talk to people


---------33:42----------
this is what you'll see there'll be


---------33:43----------
still be some degree of consistency


---------33:46----------
okay


---------33:47----------
so the the general thing to understand


---------33:49----------
is that our body and this is where


---------33:50----------
science comes in so now we're gonna uh


---------33:52----------
you know unlock the science so like


---------33:54----------
we're just gonna simplify things with


---------33:55----------
adenosine


---------33:56----------
so basically as we are awake our body


---------33:59----------
our brain builds up this chemical called


---------34:01----------
adenosine which is a waste product


---------34:03----------
product it's kind of this is an


---------34:05----------
oversimplification that's not really


---------34:06----------
true in some ways but


---------34:08----------
um you know comes from atp because we


---------34:10----------
recycle atp and stuff all the time


---------34:13----------
uh and so atp is our major um


---------34:17----------
energy source which stands for adenosine


---------34:18----------
triphosphate right so we've got a couple


---------34:20----------
of phosphates on there each time we bust


---------34:22----------
off a phosphate fate we release energy


---------34:26----------
so oh yeah look at that some of that


---------34:28----------
sweet sweet energy


---------34:29----------
that comes out right and so this is like


---------34:31----------
where our body gets energy is we take an


---------34:33----------
adenosine triphosphate we turn it into


---------34:35----------
adenosine diphosphate and we get some


---------34:38----------
energy in the process so as we are awake


---------34:41----------
and active we're going to be building up


---------34:43----------
adenosine


---------34:45----------
and then as we sleep and rest we're


---------34:47----------
going to decrease adenosine


---------34:49----------
okay


---------34:50----------
so this is just a broad corollary that


---------34:53----------
i'm drawing but there are other


---------34:54----------
metabolic waste products so over the


---------34:56----------
course of like let's say a 24-hour day


---------35:00----------
oh god my handwriting's so bad


---------35:03----------
this is something you all got gotta


---------35:05----------
understand okay we're gonna have waste


---------35:07----------
products that build up for the first 16


---------35:09----------
hours


---------35:11----------
so these are metabolic waste products


---------35:16----------
right like adenosine


---------35:18----------
and then when we sleep


---------35:20----------
we're going to go ahead and kind of


---------35:22----------
bring those back down right so


---------35:24----------
and


---------35:26----------
so then at the end when we wake up over


---------35:27----------
here we're like back to


---------35:29----------
our baseline right so zero waste


---------35:32----------
okay now when people don't get good


---------35:34----------
sleep what we'll end up doing is you may


---------35:35----------
sleep so for example if you have a


---------35:37----------
problem with your sleep like let's say


---------35:39----------
you use like marijuana or alcohol what


---------35:41----------
you'll end up with is this even though


---------35:43----------
you're sleeping eight hours


---------35:46----------
the quality of your sleep in terms of


---------35:48----------
and i also don't know if this is really


---------35:50----------
metabolic waste products that gets


---------35:51----------
altered but whatever


---------35:53----------
crap gets created right so when you wake


---------35:56----------
up you're actually going to be like


---------35:58----------
you're going to feel cruddy because


---------35:59----------
you're like waking up over here


---------36:02----------
right so this is why like using some


---------36:05----------
some kinds of supplements or even


---------36:06----------
medications can be unhealthy y'all with


---------36:08----------
us so the first thing that we're going


---------36:10----------
to pay attention to is adenosine or just


---------36:12----------
like metabolic waste that our body


---------36:13----------
builds up


---------36:15----------
how else does our brain know our body


---------36:17----------
know when it is time to go to sleep


---------36:19----------
right so this is the use science chads


---------36:22----------
over here we're going to just talk about


---------36:23----------
darkness and light right so like our


---------36:26----------
body has a thing called a circadian


---------36:28----------
rhythm


---------36:30----------
and light is a huge huge part of like


---------36:33----------
our body's physiology of sleeping and


---------36:36----------
wakefulness so let's step away from


---------36:38----------
humans because humans are going to get


---------36:39----------
complicated by all kinds of things but


---------36:40----------
we can look at other mammals right we


---------36:42----------
look like monkeys which are genetically


---------36:44----------
like 99 similar to us they're they have


---------36:47----------
a heart just like we do they have a


---------36:48----------
brain just like we do they have you know


---------36:50----------
lungs just like we do they have kidneys


---------36:52----------
just like we do and so like you know how


---------36:54----------
does a monkey's sleep cycle work well it


---------36:56----------
has a lot to do with light


---------36:58----------
so when our our


---------37:00----------
body so our body


---------37:02----------
adopts a healthy sleep schedule using


---------37:04----------
light as a signal okay so this is where


---------37:07----------
melatonin comes in


---------37:10----------
so when there is light melatonin


---------37:12----------
production shuts off okay and when there


---------37:15----------
is darkness


---------37:18----------
melatonin production goes up


---------37:22----------
and melatonin melatonin primes us for


---------37:24----------
sleep okay and then melatonin in turn


---------37:27----------
helps us sleep


---------37:29----------
so why is this a problem nowadays so now


---------37:31----------
what people do is they supplement


---------37:33----------
melatonin instead of having our body


---------37:35----------
create it we're going to start taking it


---------37:37----------
before bed and then melatonin has been


---------37:39----------
clinically effective to


---------37:41----------
improve sleep right help people sleep


---------37:43----------
but why is melatonin being shut off in


---------37:45----------
the first place why do we need to


---------37:46----------
supplement it why aren't we getting


---------37:47----------
enough of our own and it turns out that


---------37:49----------
blue light


---------37:51----------
or the wavelength that's emitted by


---------37:52----------
screens


---------37:54----------
shuts off melatonin production


---------37:58----------
so essentially because we're using


---------37:59----------
screens


---------38:01----------
we are


---------38:02----------
we stop melatonin production and so


---------38:04----------
therefore we're popping a pill


---------38:07----------
pop a melatonin we try to balance it out


---------38:11----------
and then hopefully we sleep


---------38:13----------
so here's something i'm going to tell


---------38:14----------
you all as a physician okay


---------38:17----------
nothing that we human beings do to try


---------38:19----------
to


---------38:20----------
any any time we try to artificially do


---------38:23----------
the body's job we're worse at it so i'll


---------38:25----------
give you guys just an example


---------38:27----------
so the body has this mechanism of


---------38:28----------
homeostasis


---------38:30----------
okay


---------38:32----------
and homeostasis is like maintaining a


---------38:35----------
balance so like let's look at


---------38:36----------
homeostasis of blood pressure for


---------38:37----------
example


---------38:38----------
so like our body has all kinds of very


---------38:41----------
sophisticated mechanisms to keep your


---------38:43----------
blood pressure at 120 over 80. and then


---------38:46----------
along comes modern medicine which we


---------38:48----------
sort of have to do and we'll give people


---------38:50----------
like anti-hypertensives so people's


---------38:52----------
blood pressure is too high


---------38:55----------
so people have hypertension which is


---------38:57----------
elevated blood pressure


---------38:58----------
so if my blood pressure is let's say


---------39:01----------
170 over 100 then


---------39:04----------
along comes dr k who prescribes you an


---------39:06----------
anti hypertensive medicine


---------39:08----------
and what do you guys think the side


---------39:10----------
effect


---------39:11----------
of


---------39:12----------
antihypertensive medicines are


---------39:15----------
how do these people wind up in the


---------39:16----------
hospital when i give them


---------39:17----------
antihypertensives do you all know


---------39:23----------
what happens when i try to fix their


---------39:25----------
blood pressure by lowering it


---------39:27----------
with an ace inhibitor


---------39:30----------
they pass out


---------39:31----------
excellent and why do they pass out


---------39:33----------
because their blood pressure is too low


---------39:36----------
so instead of winding up at 120 over 80


---------39:38----------
like they end up at like 100 over 60 and


---------39:41----------
then they pass out


---------39:44----------
right so like generally speaking when we


---------39:46----------
look at popping pills


---------39:48----------
and administering medicine we do not get


---------39:51----------
anywhere near the sophistication of what


---------39:53----------
the human body is able to achieve on its


---------39:55----------
own


---------39:57----------
okay


---------39:58----------
and so this is why we end up with this


---------40:00----------
crap


---------40:01----------
because like when you use like let's say


---------40:03----------
you use a substance


---------40:05----------
like marijuana or alcohol you're taking


---------40:07----------
a gigantic hammer to this sophisticated


---------40:09----------
circuit that is your brain you're just


---------40:11----------
smacking it over the head and this is


---------40:13----------
why you pass out right it's even in our


---------40:15----------
language there's no there's no like


---------40:17----------
sophistication to it it's just like wham


---------40:20----------
and then you wake up the next morning


---------40:21----------
and you're tired because you just took a


---------40:22----------
hammer to your system and then you need


---------40:24----------
caffeine and then you feel jittery


---------40:27----------
right and then you can't fall asleep


---------40:28----------
it's just it's terrible like trying to


---------40:31----------
you know it's kind of like i work in


---------40:32----------
addiction medicine and sometimes people


---------40:34----------
will speed ball


---------40:35----------
and the speed ball is when you use


---------40:36----------
cocaine and heroin at the same time to


---------40:38----------
balance out each other's effects but i


---------40:40----------
can tell you that people who use speed


---------40:41----------
balls are like not


---------40:43----------
as


---------40:44----------
good as people who like just let their


---------40:46----------
body sort of naturally equilibrate to


---------40:49----------
how they should be feeling okay


---------40:52----------
right


---------40:54----------
so


---------40:55----------
we we will try to supplement stuff which


---------40:57----------
is fine and then we have like all these


---------40:59----------
these um you know studies that show that


---------41:01----------
melatonin helps which is true but let's


---------41:04----------
start to understand light and darkness


---------41:06----------
okay


---------41:07----------
so like our our first thing is


---------41:08----------
metabolism


---------41:11----------
so what drives sleep metabolism drives


---------41:13----------
sleep second thing is light


---------41:16----------
drive sleep okay what else


---------41:18----------
drives sleep so we're going to talk


---------41:20----------
about physiology and now


---------41:24----------
all of you scientific people get to say


---------41:26----------
stuff okay so someone said stress


---------41:28----------
okay so


---------41:29----------
let's see if people have watched dr k's


---------41:31----------
guide does anyone remember from dr k's


---------41:33----------
guide how stress interferes with sleep


---------41:36----------
who knows the answer


---------41:42----------
anyone know anyone know


---------41:46----------
cortisol good and what does cortisol do


---------41:50----------
how does cortisol mess with sleep


---------41:53----------
you all remember this is a tough one you


---------41:55----------
got to know you got to know a little bit


---------41:56----------
of neuroscience here


---------42:00----------
increased alertness very good


---------42:03----------
right so alertness


---------42:06----------
and


---------42:07----------
that damn thing the reticular


---------42:10----------
activating formation


---------42:13----------
so let's understand this okay bunches of


---------42:16----------
details and about this in dr k's guide


---------42:18----------
but we're going to do a quick quick


---------42:19----------
rundown okay


---------42:20----------
so


---------42:21----------
let's try to understand like why why


---------42:24----------
what did stress used to be when we


---------42:26----------
evolved so let's say i'm a monkey and


---------42:28----------
like what does stress look like in my


---------42:31----------
life right so like i see a predator


---------42:32----------
there's a snake oh crap there was a


---------42:34----------
python


---------42:35----------
on the tree that was next to me


---------42:38----------
so i'm gonna move away from it and then


---------42:40----------
i'm gonna i'm gonna sleep at some point


---------42:42----------
so


---------42:43----------
when i see the python my my body is


---------42:45----------
gonna release two chemicals i'm


---------42:47----------
oversimplifying stuff okay


---------42:48----------
so i'm gonna release adrenaline which


---------42:51----------
gives me a short burst of energy like


---------42:53----------
wakes me the f up and then i'm gonna


---------42:55----------
release cortisol which has an a uh


---------42:58----------
appear


---------42:59----------
a duration of action of four to 24 hours


---------43:02----------
okay so then my body secretes cortisol


---------43:05----------
my adrenal glands


---------43:07----------
and then for the next four to 24 hours i


---------43:09----------
have this hormone that's gonna float


---------43:11----------
around in my body and it's a hormone so


---------43:13----------
it travels through the bloodstream and


---------43:14----------
affects every single one of my organs by


---------43:16----------
the way that's what makes it a hormone


---------43:18----------
is that it affects everything so it's


---------43:19----------
gonna affect my blood pressure it's


---------43:21----------
gonna affect my sense of hunger it's


---------43:22----------
gonna make me feel less hungry it's


---------43:24----------
gonna affect my immune system it's gonna


---------43:25----------
affect my liver it's gonna route blood


---------43:28----------
away from my liver


---------43:30----------
it is also going to affect this part of


---------43:31----------
my brain called the reticular activating


---------43:33----------
formation which is the part of my brain


---------43:34----------
that helps me sleep


---------43:36----------
and what does it tell to my reticular


---------43:38----------
activating formation


---------43:40----------
what is it it says hey you need to wake


---------43:42----------
up very very very easily because if we


---------43:45----------
hear a twig snap it could be the python


---------43:48----------
if we smell something that smells like a


---------43:50----------
python i need to be able to wake up so


---------43:53----------
generally speaking it's hard to wake me


---------43:54----------
up when i'm sleeping but when cortisol


---------43:57----------
is floating around in my system it's


---------43:58----------
very easy to wake up while sleeping oh


---------44:01----------
interesting dr k are you suggesting for


---------44:03----------
a moment hold on a second does this mean


---------44:06----------
that interrupted sleep


---------44:10----------
may have more to do with stress and


---------44:12----------
cortisol than let's say waking up in the


---------44:14----------
morning oh maybe maybe that could be


---------44:17----------
true maybe they're actually discreet


---------44:19----------
physiologic and neuroscientific


---------44:20----------
mechanisms that are responsible for each


---------44:22----------
of these three things and if we target


---------44:24----------
each of those mechanisms and understand


---------44:26----------
what turns them on and then we go back


---------44:28----------
to the root of how they're being turned


---------44:30----------
on and then we actually end up turning


---------44:31----------
them off we will fix your sleep problem


---------44:33----------
weird right i know it's kind of bizarre


---------44:36----------
but maybe if you have trouble sleeping


---------44:37----------
because you're stressed out all the time


---------44:39----------
dealing with your stress


---------44:41----------
in


---------44:42----------
during your waking hours will actually


---------44:44----------
naturally resolve your sleep problem


---------44:46----------
it's weird


---------44:48----------
weird maybe you don't actually need to


---------44:50----------
take a supplement maybe what you need to


---------44:52----------
do do is deal with the stress that is


---------44:54----------
activating your brain and telling it to


---------44:56----------
not go to sleep


---------44:58----------
interesting interesting maybe i don't


---------45:00----------
know though


---------45:01----------
we'll see


---------45:03----------
okay so that's just one example so if


---------45:05----------
you have stress and you have a high


---------45:07----------
level of cortisol floating around so


---------45:08----------
here's a good example of modern things


---------45:10----------
okay so let's say


---------45:12----------
i'm


---------45:13----------
failing out of school


---------45:18----------
right


---------45:19----------
my future


---------45:23----------
this is not something that is a


---------45:24----------
temporary thing so our stress system


---------45:26----------
evolved to deal with like short-term


---------45:29----------
threats like python right it's not like


---------45:33----------
on the 30th of the month the python is


---------45:36----------
going to show up so i'm dreading it for


---------45:38----------
the next 29 days


---------45:39----------
oh my god i got an f on my first test


---------45:42----------
and for the next three months no matter


---------45:45----------
how hard i study i can't get an a in the


---------45:47----------
class my future cortisol level


---------45:49----------
constantly high


---------45:51----------
alertness level constantly high


---------45:54----------
irritable


---------45:57----------
uh


---------45:58----------
hunger is all messed up


---------46:03----------
right digestion is messed up


---------46:05----------
because remember cortisol reroutes blood


---------46:07----------
away from your gi system and liver


---------46:11----------
and my sleep is messed up my future


---------46:14----------
which you're stressed about every single


---------46:16----------
day when you go to class or don't go to


---------46:18----------
class your cortisol level goes up


---------46:21----------
and then you can't sleep because your


---------46:23----------
reticular activating formation of


---------46:24----------
cortisol is like hey


---------46:26----------
better sleep lightly because we're gonna


---------46:28----------
get screwed because our system our our


---------46:30----------
biological machinery cannot


---------46:33----------
differentiate between a tiger in the


---------46:35----------
woods and failing out of school like it


---------46:37----------
just doesn't have the sophistication to


---------46:39----------
do that


---------46:40----------
and then what happens is oh my sleep


---------46:42----------
sucks


---------46:44----------
let me let me take


---------46:46----------
let me take this herb and that'll fix it


---------46:50----------
right


---------46:51----------
and then you wake up the next day and


---------46:52----------
you're tired because you've got the herb


---------46:54----------
floating around in your system gg


---------46:56----------
okay


---------46:58----------
so


---------46:59----------
stress is absolutely a big part of it


---------47:02----------
the other physiologic hormone by the way


---------47:04----------
there's a lot more complexity than this


---------47:05----------
okay i'm just using this to illustrate a


---------47:06----------
point


---------47:08----------
the other hormone that we're going to


---------47:09----------
talk about is insulin so if i were to


---------47:10----------
ask y'all


---------47:12----------
what makes you sleepy right because if


---------47:14----------
we want to understand how to go to sleep


---------47:16----------
let's start with this okay there's stuff


---------47:18----------
about metabolism and light and cortisol


---------47:20----------
and okay so what keeps you awake stress


---------47:22----------
keeps me awake excellent next question


---------47:24----------
is what makes you sleepy


---------47:28----------
excellent this is the right answer a


---------47:30----------
burrito makes you sleepy


---------47:33----------
right


---------47:34----------
no no no


---------47:35----------
so this is what we call the food coma so


---------47:38----------
let's understand ourselves like what is


---------47:40----------
going on with the food coma it's like 2


---------47:42----------
p.m


---------47:43----------
i haven't eaten all day


---------47:45----------
and i have a gigantic burrito because


---------47:47----------
i'm starving and then it's like


---------47:50----------
and it's hard to stay awake


---------47:52----------
and then i drink a cup of coffee to make


---------47:54----------
it through the end of work


---------47:56----------
and then nighttime rolls around and i


---------47:57----------
have difficulty sleeping where did that


---------47:59----------
all begin it began with the burrito


---------48:02----------
okay but not just the burrito because


---------48:04----------
eating a burrito is not the only thing


---------48:07----------
that correlates with an insulin spike


---------48:10----------
okay so this is what happens when you


---------48:12----------
eat food you release a hormone called


---------48:15----------
insulin insulin is an anabolic hormone


---------48:19----------
okay what anabolic hormone means is that


---------48:22----------
it's a hormone that activates like it


---------48:23----------
tells your body hey it's time to build


---------48:25----------
stuff so it's time to store away food


---------48:28----------
it's time to process calories it's time


---------48:30----------
to build glycogen build fat build muscle


---------48:33----------
so we're going to go into like building


---------48:35----------
phase


---------48:36----------
and when we go into building phase like


---------48:38----------
we get sleepy because our body does a


---------48:40----------
lot of tissue repair for example and


---------48:42----------
building stuff while we sleep so for


---------48:44----------
example we know that our brain grows


---------48:46----------
while we sleep we know that muscles grow


---------48:48----------
while we sleep so if you want to be a


---------48:50----------
good bodybuilder you need lots and lots


---------48:52----------
of sleep because that's when your body


---------48:53----------
like builds stuff right we're inactive


---------48:55----------
we're not expending energy we're


---------48:58----------
building things


---------48:59----------
so anabolic sort of having an anabolic


---------49:02----------
embolic metabolism or an anabolic mode


---------49:04----------
will be pro sleep


---------49:06----------
so what tends to happen is is when we


---------49:08----------
eat a burrito


---------49:10----------
we will release insulin


---------49:13----------
and insulin in turn will make us sleepy


---------49:17----------
so


---------49:18----------
in the first couple weeks of medical


---------49:20----------
school i was super stressed out for


---------49:22----------
reasons that aren't important and i was


---------49:23----------
having trouble sleeping so i decided


---------49:25----------
that i was going to do


---------49:28----------
something called burrito chemistry


---------49:31----------
and so what i did


---------49:33----------
is before i went to bed i would eat a


---------49:35----------
gigantic burrito


---------49:36----------
and then i would listen to biochemistry


---------49:38----------
lectures because biochemistry lectures


---------49:40----------
were so hard to stay awake during right


---------49:42----------
so i don't know if you're like me but


---------49:44----------
biochemistry lectures are like hard for


---------49:46----------
me to stay awake during and so that


---------49:48----------
combination would like knock me out


---------49:51----------
the cool thing


---------49:53----------
is that like by the next morning my body


---------49:55----------
has digested the burrito


---------49:57----------
and it's not like biochemistry lectures


---------49:59----------
have any side effect if anything maybe i


---------50:00----------
absorb some biochemistry in my sleep and


---------50:02----------
so when i wake up the next morning i'm


---------50:04----------
actually like feeling okay


---------50:06----------
right there's no herb floating around in


---------50:08----------
my system there's no tracidone floating


---------50:10----------
around in my system i like feel pretty


---------50:11----------
good


---------50:12----------
so we can actually use physiology


---------50:15----------
and especially insulin and the kinds of


---------50:17----------
foods that we eat and when we eat them


---------50:20----------
and how we eat them to help us go to


---------50:21----------
sleep


---------50:22----------
so once again the insulin thing though


---------50:25----------
is not going to affect us


---------50:27----------
here


---------50:28----------
or here the insulin thing will affect us


---------50:31----------
here so burrito chemistry


---------50:34----------
targets this


---------50:37----------
you all get that


---------50:39----------
stress


---------50:40----------
reduction


---------50:43----------
targets the first part too but in


---------50:45----------
different ways because there's it's not


---------50:47----------
just one thing stress has multiple


---------50:48----------
effects on your body right


---------50:51----------
okay


---------50:52----------
so


---------50:55----------
this'll all come together don't worry


---------50:56----------
about it all right so


---------50:59----------
um


---------51:02----------
okay


---------51:03----------
so this is these are kind of like three


---------51:05----------
things that we're going to talk a little


---------51:06----------
bit about metabolism light and


---------51:08----------
physiology as like mechanisms that will


---------51:11----------
affect the three dimensions


---------51:13----------
that we are talking about falling asleep


---------51:15----------
or four dimensions falling asleep


---------51:17----------
staying asleep trouble waking up and


---------51:19----------
feeling tired during the day okay


---------51:22----------
now so so we can also see that


---------51:24----------
technology acts here


---------51:27----------
right um


---------51:30----------
sleep cycles are going to be sort of


---------51:32----------
here as well


---------51:33----------
in terms of like metabolism so what i


---------51:36----------
mean by that is that you know


---------51:38----------
like if i wake up at noon it's going to


---------51:40----------
be hard for me to go to sleep at 9 00


---------51:42----------
p.m you all get that and that's


---------51:43----------
essentially like due to our internal


---------51:45----------
metabolism


---------51:47----------
okay


---------51:48----------
so we've talked a little bit about um


---------51:53----------
we've talked a little bit about these


---------51:54----------
three dimensions so let's go back to our


---------51:56----------
diagram and now we're going to start


---------51:58----------
talking


---------52:02----------
a couple of other things okay so we're


---------52:04----------
gonna talk about medical stuff


---------52:06----------
so here's our sleep diagram so here's


---------52:09----------
you know


---------52:10----------
hour zero let's say hour ten


---------52:12----------
right so we have obstacles to falling


---------52:14----------
asleep obstacles to staying asleep


---------52:17----------
obstacles to


---------52:19----------
um


---------52:20----------
waking up


---------52:21----------
okay those are all discreet and we'll


---------52:23----------
get to solutions in a second


---------52:26----------
the next thing that we have to talk a


---------52:27----------
little bit about is illness so


---------52:29----------
if you have an


---------52:30----------
illness this line no longer applies what


---------52:34----------
we're dealing with is a slightly


---------52:36----------
different line


---------52:38----------
so like if we think about correcting an


---------52:40----------
illness there's like something so if we


---------52:41----------
haven't let's say i'm hyperthyroid okay


---------52:44----------
what's to happen is


---------52:46----------
when i'm hyperthyroid


---------52:50----------
these things are going to be altered by


---------52:52----------
something fundamental so our like level


---------52:54----------
of thyroid hormone like creates a


---------52:56----------
completely different scenario so the


---------52:58----------
normal things the normal physiologic


---------53:00----------
stuff may be insufficient so i can even


---------53:03----------
correct this problem i can do


---------53:04----------
psychotherapy around my stress and i can


---------53:06----------
manage like waking up well but if i'm


---------53:08----------
hyperthyroid all the stuff that would


---------53:10----------
normally fix my problems may not fix my


---------53:12----------
problem because there's a underlying


---------53:15----------
physiological state which is completely


---------53:17----------
different so for example burrito


---------53:19----------
chemistry is not going to help me wake


---------53:21----------
up feeling rested if i have sleep apnea


---------53:24----------
do you all get that so the thing about


---------53:26----------
illness is that illness like


---------53:27----------
fundamentally alters things and then


---------53:29----------
this has to be fixed in order for the


---------53:32----------
other stuff to like you know


---------53:35----------
start working properly do you all get


---------53:37----------
that so let's talk a little bit about


---------53:39----------
the conditions that lead to um


---------53:43----------
altered neurochemistry altered


---------53:45----------
physiology that just sort of like in


---------53:47----------
which normal sleep no longer applies


---------53:49----------
right because everything we've talked


---------53:50----------
about so far is just like normal sleep


---------53:52----------
and how it works and what are the


---------53:54----------
drivers for sleep so the first thing is


---------53:56----------
mental illness so this is the cool thing


---------53:58----------
i mean it's not cool but it's


---------54:00----------
interesting intellectually


---------54:01----------
so this is an interesting observation


---------54:03----------
that i made that i'm sure lots of other


---------54:04----------
people made but i don't know why they


---------54:06----------
don't teach us this explicitly


---------54:08----------
so the common denominator for every


---------54:11----------
psychiatric illness


---------54:13----------
depression anxiety


---------54:15----------
psychosis


---------54:16----------
ocd is impaired sleep


---------54:18----------
the one symptom


---------54:20----------
that all people who have a psychiatric


---------54:22----------
diagnosis that may be a little bit of an


---------54:23----------
over generalization i'm sure there's


---------54:24----------
something out there that doesn't apply


---------54:27----------
um like maladaptive daydreaming or


---------54:29----------
something but generally speaking if you


---------54:30----------
look at the common denominator for all


---------54:32----------
mental illnesses it is impaired sleep


---------54:38----------
and so this is when i got curious about


---------54:39----------
sleep and this is by the way how i


---------54:40----------
developed all this crap because i i


---------54:42----------
thought to myself i was like oh like


---------54:43----------
that's kind of interesting i wonder if


---------54:45----------
if this is the common denominator if i


---------54:47----------
get really really good at helping people


---------54:49----------
with their sleep i wonder if like i


---------54:50----------
would help all of my patients instead of


---------54:52----------
learning depression treatment anxiety


---------54:54----------
instead of becoming an expert in


---------54:56----------
depression treatment an expert in


---------54:58----------
anxiety treatment an expert in ocd


---------55:00----------
treatment i wonder if i just become an


---------55:02----------
expert in sleep can i actually help


---------55:05----------
everyone that i see and i think the


---------55:07----------
answer is basically yes so we know that


---------55:09----------
depression leads to sleep impairment we


---------55:11----------
know that anxiety leads to sleep


---------55:13----------
impairment


---------55:14----------
we know that you know ptsd leads to


---------55:16----------
sleep impairment okay and the other


---------55:18----------
really interesting thing uh so other


---------55:20----------
causes are going to be like


---------55:22----------
hyperthyroidism so there's all kinds of


---------55:24----------
causes


---------55:26----------
right so i i'm not going to cover them


---------55:28----------
all so for example there's this


---------55:29----------
condition called


---------55:31----------
uh


---------55:32----------
familial


---------55:35----------
fatal insomnia i've seen one patient


---------55:36----------
with this it is terrifying


---------55:40----------
so this is a genetic condition


---------55:43----------
that is almost like a prion disease


---------55:46----------
um so you inherit some kind of protein


---------55:49----------
that later in life prevents you from


---------55:51----------
sleeping and then you can't sleep like


---------55:52----------
you literally cannot sleep so some


---------55:54----------
fundamental circuit in your brain that


---------55:56----------
lets you fall asleep fails and then you


---------55:59----------
start to become like psychotic


---------56:00----------
delusional and eventually you die it's a


---------56:02----------
terrifying condition


---------56:03----------
we're not really covering all of the


---------56:05----------
physiologic causes of sleep because


---------56:07----------
they're exceedingly rare so we're just


---------56:08----------
covering the big ones so the top of the


---------56:09----------
list


---------56:10----------
is mental illness


---------56:13----------
hyperthyroidism


---------56:15----------
sleep apnea


---------56:19----------
right and there are other things also


---------56:20----------
acid reflux


---------56:25----------
there are also circadian rhythm


---------56:26----------
disorders


---------56:32----------
so these are things like um shift work


---------56:35----------
disorder


---------56:38----------
so these are people who work night


---------56:40----------
shifts right also medical residents and


---------56:42----------
doctors uh there's like you know


---------56:45----------
basically something that is what is it


---------56:48----------
late shift


---------56:51----------
i forget the name this is basically like


---------56:53----------
night owls people have a night owl


---------56:55----------
circadian rhythm


---------56:58----------
there's like circadian rhythm like nos


---------57:00----------
there's a bunch of these diagnoses but


---------57:02----------
essentially these are diagnoses where we


---------57:04----------
have an internal biological clock


---------57:07----------
which tells us when to wake up and when


---------57:09----------
to go to sleep which by the way is


---------57:10----------
influenced by all the things that we


---------57:11----------
already discussed


---------57:13----------
like light and metabolism that somehow


---------57:15----------
gets shifted off


---------57:18----------
and so those are


---------57:20----------
unique diseases which have their own


---------57:21----------
treatments


---------57:22----------
my point is that you know if you have


---------57:25----------
and the interesting thing is that these


---------57:26----------
map on to particular areas right so


---------57:28----------
generally speaking


---------57:30----------
speaking people with anxiety have


---------57:32----------
difficulty falling asleep


---------57:34----------
people with depression suffer from early


---------57:36----------
morning awakening


---------57:39----------
so in the case of depression


---------57:40----------
we see something very interesting which


---------57:42----------
is even if you go to sleep late like if


---------57:44----------
i have trouble falling asleep and i go


---------57:46----------
to sleep at midnight i wake up at 4 00


---------57:47----------
a.m every day and i feel super depressed


---------57:49----------
and my mind is racing


---------57:51----------
right so these discrete processes ptsd


---------57:54----------
tends to happen here


---------57:56----------
have difficulty staying asleep why is


---------57:57----------
that because they have nightmares


---------58:00----------
right so we even have some medications


---------58:02----------
like prosocian


---------58:05----------
um which will stop nightmares and help


---------58:07----------
pts people with ptsd sleep through the


---------58:09----------
night so people with ptsd don't


---------58:11----------
necessarily have troubles falling asleep


---------58:13----------
or waking up but or they're even if they


---------58:16----------
have trouble waking up the reason they


---------58:17----------
have trouble waking up is because their


---------58:18----------
sleep is disturbed in the middle of the


---------58:20----------
night right so we can even see amongst


---------58:22----------
mental illnesses


---------58:24----------
not all of the insomnia is the same like


---------58:26----------
there are discrete different


---------58:29----------
sources of insomnia that particular


---------58:31----------
mental illnesses will target and damage


---------58:34----------
which results in these three buckets


---------58:37----------
so hyperthyroidism for example will have


---------58:39----------
uh will act here


---------58:41----------
and here


---------58:42----------
really


---------58:44----------
um but we'll see like a lot of times


---------58:46----------
people will have difficulties falling


---------58:48----------
asleep if they're hypothyroid sleep


---------58:50----------
apnea


---------58:51----------
sort of


---------58:53----------
is noticed here


---------58:56----------
but is really a problem over here


---------58:59----------
okay this is really where sleep apnea


---------59:01----------
acts


---------59:03----------
so once again we've got like tons of


---------59:04----------
evidence that insomnia is not all the


---------59:07----------
same so if you're listening to your


---------59:08----------
favorite wellness podcast and they're


---------59:10----------
like oh this thing helps with sleep like


---------59:12----------
i think the reason that everyone is


---------59:13----------
still having sleep problems despite the


---------59:15----------
fact that we have a thousand wellness


---------59:16----------
podcast is because i don't hear anyone


---------59:18----------
talking this specifically about sleep


---------59:20----------
and that's like why the problem is


---------59:21----------
persisting fundamentally


---------59:23----------
so if we have reflux for example reflux


---------59:26----------
acts here in here


---------59:28----------
so people can have trouble falling


---------59:30----------
asleep if they have reflux so just to


---------59:32----------
understand this a little bit so reflux


---------59:34----------
is when


---------59:35----------
you have stomach acid which normally


---------59:37----------
belongs in the stomach and the stomach


---------59:39----------
is a high acidic environment so it's


---------59:41----------
protected against the high acid our


---------59:43----------
esophagus which is the pipe that


---------59:45----------
connects our mouth to our stomach


---------59:48----------
shouldn't have stomach acid in it


---------59:50----------
stomach acid will damage it


---------59:52----------
so when we have reflux we have a lazy


---------59:54----------
valve


---------59:55----------
or lazy flap that allows acid to leak


---------59:58----------
from our stomach into our esophagus


---------60:00----------
then the esophagus starts taking acid


---------60:03----------
damage every round


---------60:04----------
as it starts taking acid damage you're


---------60:06----------
like being injured and it releases all


---------60:09----------
kinds of inflammatory chemicals bumps up


---------60:11----------
your cortisol level and causes all kinds


---------60:13----------
of problems right so re like reflux can


---------60:16----------
actually cause this as well so this is


---------60:18----------
the kind of thing where as long as


---------60:19----------
you've got reflux going on i mean you


---------60:20----------
can


---------60:21----------
cut out caffeine all you want to but as


---------60:23----------
long as you've got that reflux signal


---------60:24----------
you can deal with your internal worries


---------60:26----------
about how your life is never going to go


---------60:28----------
anywhere or whatever you do deal with


---------60:30----------
all that crap but as long as the reflux


---------60:32----------
is creating a physiologic like you know


---------60:34----------
you're sitting in a pool of acid your


---------60:35----------
esophagus is sitting in a pool of acid


---------60:37----------
that's going to create a physiologic


---------60:38----------
effect which will will make it hard for


---------60:40----------
you to sleep okay


---------60:43----------
so the key thing here is that different


---------60:45----------
kinds of illnesses are going to alter


---------60:46----------
the general trajectory that you're


---------60:48----------
working with right that's why we call it


---------60:49----------
a pathology because it changes the game


---------60:52----------
and so playing a normal strategy of


---------60:55----------
trying to use burrito chemistry


---------60:57----------
or you know leveraging like having a


---------61:00----------
healthy like light


---------61:01----------
kind of balance


---------61:03----------
will result in what won't work properly


---------61:06----------
because there's some other confounding


---------61:07----------
factor


---------61:08----------
okay so let's talk a little bit about


---------61:12----------
solutions for sleep


---------61:14----------
okay


---------61:17----------
how we doing so far chat you all doing


---------61:19----------
okay


---------61:20----------
we're like one hour in


---------61:22----------
so we're going to pause we can actually


---------61:23----------
stop we can do solutions later


---------61:32----------
okay we can absolutely do recap before


---------61:35----------
we jump into solutions


---------61:37----------
let's do a recap excellent excellent


---------61:39----------
thank you okay


---------61:40----------
so let's start from the top


---------61:42----------
okay the first thing


---------61:45----------
is despite


---------61:46----------
an increase in the amount of science


---------61:49----------
and an increase in the dissemination of


---------61:52----------
scientific information


---------61:53----------
why is insomnia such a problem so i


---------61:56----------
believe it is generally a problem


---------61:57----------
because


---------61:59----------
scientific studies look at populations


---------62:01----------
and do not


---------62:02----------
recommend like individualized


---------62:06----------
treatments for insomnia right


---------62:08----------
so like you can have all these general


---------62:10----------
recommendations do this for sleep do


---------62:12----------
that for sleep and we're about to get to


---------62:13----------
those but the key thing to understand is


---------62:15----------
that insomnia is not


---------62:17----------
homogeneous it is not one thing it is a


---------62:20----------
constellation of different things and if


---------62:22----------
you want to conquer your insomnia what


---------62:24----------
you need to do is


---------62:25----------
start to figure out first what kind of


---------62:28----------
insomnia you have because each one has a


---------62:29----------
different solution


---------62:31----------
so we talk about why people have trouble


---------62:34----------
sleeping or what their perception is


---------62:35----------
they say my sleep sucks what that means


---------62:38----------
they could be talking about one of four


---------62:39----------
things


---------62:40----------
number one they have difficulty falling


---------62:42----------
asleep they're staying awake they go to


---------62:44----------
bed on time they're tossing and turning


---------62:46----------
and they're not able to fall asleep


---------62:47----------
number two


---------62:48----------
even if they do fall asleep they're


---------62:49----------
tossing and turning all night they wake


---------62:51----------
up in the middle of the night they don't


---------62:52----------
feel like they get restful sleep


---------62:54----------
overnight so when they wake up in the


---------62:55----------
morning


---------62:56----------
they feel unrested


---------62:58----------
number three i have difficulty waking up


---------63:00----------
so this could be related to number two


---------63:02----------
or related to number one right if i


---------63:05----------
toss and turn for two hours and i don't


---------63:07----------
actually go to sleep on time let's say i


---------63:09----------
go to bed at 10 p.m and i have to wake


---------63:11----------
up at 6 a.m but for the first two hours


---------63:13----------
i'm tossing and turning then i'm gonna


---------63:14----------
wake up tired or if i do go to bed at 10


---------63:18----------
at 10 pm but if i'm tossing turning all


---------63:19----------
night i'm going to wake up feeling tired


---------63:21----------
some people have difficulty just waking


---------63:23----------
up even if they do go to bed on time and


---------63:25----------
even if it does appear that they sleep


---------63:27----------
pretty well


---------63:29----------
the fourth reason that people say that


---------63:30----------
their sleep sucks is because they're


---------63:31----------
tired during the day or in the morning


---------63:34----------
okay


---------63:35----------
and the key thing here


---------63:37----------
is that if we want to conquer insomnia


---------63:40----------
we have to know which one is our problem


---------63:42----------
because each of these involves different


---------63:44----------
mechanisms and if we fix those


---------63:46----------
mechanisms we can fix our sleep


---------63:48----------
okay


---------63:49----------
so then we got to this


---------63:51----------
diagram which is sort of like you know


---------63:54----------
uh okay hold on a second let me actually


---------63:58----------
right so


---------64:00----------
the solutions that society tends to


---------64:02----------
offer us tend to be like instead of


---------64:04----------
focusing on falling asleep staying


---------64:06----------
asleep or difficulty waking up and


---------64:08----------
offering us a tailored solution what we


---------64:10----------
tend to do is recommend things just


---------64:13----------
blanket right take this herb


---------64:15----------
smoke marijuana drink alcohol do cbt for


---------64:19----------
insomnia take this medication that is


---------64:21----------
prescribed by a physician


---------64:23----------
and all of these things don't account


---------64:25----------
for any of the specificity of what is


---------64:27----------
causing our sleep problem we're just


---------64:29----------
taking a huge hammer to the problem


---------64:32----------
which in turn means that we wake up


---------64:33----------
tired in the morning because we're not


---------64:35----------
dealing with the root of the problem


---------64:38----------
then we enter into this cycle where i


---------64:39----------
wake up tired so i need marijuana to


---------64:41----------
fall asleep and then i pass out and then


---------64:44----------
i get low quality sleep i wake up tired


---------64:46----------
then i have to drink coffee and since i


---------64:49----------
drink a bunch of coffee i can't fall


---------64:50----------
asleep since i can't fall asleep i need


---------64:51----------
more marijuana


---------64:53----------
right so we end up in this vicious cycle


---------64:55----------
where like our solutions become our


---------64:58----------
problems


---------65:00----------
so


---------65:01----------
in order to understand this i think the


---------65:03----------
the key solution is like let's


---------65:05----------
understand like how sleep works like


---------65:07----------
what are the basics of sleep


---------65:09----------
what helps us fall asleep why do we fall


---------65:11----------
asleep why do we get sleepy why do we


---------65:13----------
have difficulty waking up what


---------65:14----------
determines when we wake up because think


---------65:16----------
about that for a second it's really


---------65:17----------
interesting right you don't need


---------65:19----------
anything to wake you up like if you go


---------65:21----------
to sleep now


---------65:22----------
you will wake up at some point right so


---------65:25----------
there's some internal mechanism that


---------65:27----------
causes you to wake up what are the


---------65:28----------
mechanisms that cause you to wake up


---------65:30----------
what are the mechanisms that cause you


---------65:31----------
to go to sleep so we talked about a


---------65:33----------
couple of those


---------65:35----------
metabolism right so over the course of


---------65:37----------
the day we build up metabolic waste


---------65:38----------
products when we go to sleep we clear


---------65:40----------
those metabolic waste products when we


---------65:43----------
clear those metabolic waste products we


---------65:45----------
tend to wake up


---------65:47----------
okay this is why if you for example if i


---------65:49----------
have a 36 hour shift as a doctor i'm not


---------65:51----------
gonna wake up in eight hours i will be


---------65:53----------
sleep deprived and it'll take my body


---------65:56----------
longer to clear those metabolic waste


---------65:58----------
products so instead of sleeping for


---------65:59----------
eight hours i will sleep for 12 hours


---------66:02----------
and there are other different things


---------66:03----------
that you have to make up for the sleep


---------66:04----------
debt over the next couple of days so


---------66:05----------
i'll sleep like 10 hours a day for the


---------66:06----------
next three days instead of sleeping


---------66:09----------
16 hours at a stretch right so there are


---------66:11----------
all kinds of complicated mechanisms


---------66:12----------
which we're not going to go into right


---------66:13----------
here but


---------66:14----------
so metabolism is one big reason why we


---------66:17----------
get tired


---------66:18----------
and why we wake up light is another huge


---------66:21----------
reason so our body has been evolved to


---------66:24----------
be very sensitive to light in terms of


---------66:26----------
telling us when to go to sleep and when


---------66:27----------
to wake up so even if we think about jet


---------66:30----------
lag how does jet lag get corrected think


---------66:33----------
about that for a second right so i have


---------66:34----------
a circadian rhythm which wants me to go


---------66:36----------
to sleep at a particular time and wake


---------66:38----------
up at a particular time how does the


---------66:40----------
circadian rhythm adjust how does it know


---------66:42----------
how to adjust it uses light right so


---------66:46----------
light is a huge part of our ability to


---------66:48----------
sleep


---------66:50----------
third thing is we have all kinds of


---------66:51----------
physiologic mechanisms which we're just


---------66:53----------
going to use too just to


---------66:54----------
illustrate this example one is cortisol


---------66:57----------
so when we get stressed out


---------66:59----------
we release cortisol cortisol goes to our


---------67:02----------
brain and turns on this part of our


---------67:03----------
brain called the reticular activating


---------67:05----------
formation which then tells us that we


---------67:07----------
need to sleep very very lightly or sleep


---------67:09----------
less because we're in danger and so if


---------67:11----------
you're in a chronic state of stress your


---------67:13----------
body is literally going to be telling


---------67:15----------
you to wake the f up all the time and


---------67:17----------
sleep very lightly so any kind of noise


---------67:19----------
will wake you up if you have a high


---------67:20----------
level of cortisol in your system


---------67:23----------
so in order to fix that problem you have


---------67:24----------
to deal with the underlying stress and


---------67:25----------
then you'll be able to sleep better the


---------67:27----------
other thing that we talked a little bit


---------67:28----------
about is insulin so when we eat food


---------67:31----------
we secrete insulin and when we secrete


---------67:33----------
insulin it makes us sleepy


---------67:36----------
okay


---------67:37----------
so


---------67:38----------
then we've talked about mental illness


---------67:40----------
that all of these mechanisms are fine


---------67:42----------
and good but this is in a normal healthy


---------67:44----------
functioning human being


---------67:45----------
if you throw on some kind of mental or


---------67:48----------
physiologic illness you're playing a


---------67:50----------
completely different game with a


---------67:52----------
completely different set of rules so if


---------67:54----------
you want any of that other stuff to work


---------67:56----------
you have to move back to the baseline by


---------67:58----------
treating that illness so that could mean


---------68:00----------
treating the ptsd could mean treating


---------68:02----------
depression it could mean getting a sleep


---------68:04----------
a cpap for for sleep sleep apnea you


---------68:07----------
know there are all kinds of other stuff


---------68:08----------
could mean getting your acid reflux


---------68:10----------
treated you know get get yourself a ppi


---------68:13----------
and we'll talk about that kind of stuff


---------68:16----------
which is a proton pump inhibitor which


---------68:17----------
is a treatment for acid reflux


---------68:20----------
um


---------68:21----------
and so that's where we are so far okay


---------68:23----------
so now we're going to talk about


---------68:25----------
solutions


---------68:28----------
so the first thing that you should do


---------68:29----------
we're going to start with uh let me see


---------68:32----------
okay let's start with general solutions


---------68:34----------
and then we'll get to specifics okay


---------68:37----------
first thing you should do is get a


---------68:38----------
medical evaluation


---------68:42----------
and why should you start with this


---------68:44----------
you should start with this because if


---------68:46----------
any of these things is going on and


---------68:48----------
you're not aware of it like the rest of


---------68:50----------
the stuff may not work right this could


---------68:52----------
be a really simple fix if there's


---------68:54----------
actually some kind of pathology going on


---------68:56----------
like if you can correct your thyroid


---------68:57----------
level and like easy done finished right


---------69:00----------
so this may be the biggest bang for your


---------69:02----------
buck


---------69:02----------
okay


---------69:04----------
next thing you should do


---------69:06----------
is diagnose your sleeping problem


---------69:11----------
and i don't mean like


---------69:13----------
give yourself a medical diagnosis


---------69:16----------
so maybe isolate is a better word


---------69:20----------
so this is where you can use something


---------69:21----------
like a sleep diary and try to figure out


---------69:23----------
okay what is actually my sleeping


---------69:26----------
problem is my problem that i have


---------69:28----------
difficulty falling asleep is my problem


---------69:30----------
that i have difficulty staying asleep is


---------69:32----------
my problem that i have difficulty waking


---------69:34----------
up is my problem that i feel tired


---------69:37----------
during the day


---------69:38----------
and be a little bit careful and be


---------69:40----------
critical and this is where you want to


---------69:41----------
like measure stuff right so people will


---------69:43----------
say oh my problem is that i get three


---------69:45----------
hours of sleep a night but if you


---------69:46----------
actually use a sleep diary what you will


---------69:48----------
discover you will uncover the sleep


---------69:50----------
misperception which is that you actually


---------69:52----------
fall asleep around 11


---------69:55----------
and then you may have opened your eyes


---------69:56----------
briefly at like two in the morning and


---------69:59----------
then you actually get out of bed at


---------70:00----------
seven and you may discover that


---------70:03----------
you're actually sleeping a normal amount


---------70:05----------
and then that should trigger something


---------70:07----------
really interesting because now you know


---------70:09----------
okay so there's something else going on


---------70:10----------
i'm actually sleeping eight hours a day


---------70:12----------
so components of a sleep diary which


---------70:14----------
will try to put together something some


---------70:15----------
kind of like worksheet or something for


---------70:16----------
y'all


---------70:18----------
but what time do you fall asleep


---------70:26----------
what time do you wake up


---------70:32----------
how rested do you feel


---------70:35----------
on a scale of one to ten


---------70:37----------
right so do this every day for a month


---------70:41----------
other things you can do is like how um


---------70:45----------
yeah so other things that i would add is


---------70:47----------
like what is your technology use


---------70:51----------
before bed


---------70:56----------
um


---------70:57----------
what


---------70:58----------
was


---------70:59----------
your


---------71:01----------
bedtime


---------71:03----------
routine


---------71:07----------
what was


---------71:10----------
caffeine


---------71:13----------
alcohol


---------71:15----------
marijuana intake like that day


---------71:18----------
right so like what did you do in the


---------71:19----------
four hours before bed


---------71:24----------
um


---------71:25----------
any particular sources of stress that


---------71:27----------
day


---------71:28----------
right so you should start like


---------71:30----------
collecting data over time


---------71:32----------
there are other things that we'll we'll


---------71:34----------
add to the sleep diary we'll try to put


---------71:35----------
something together for y'all that's


---------71:36----------
pretty comprehensive but you want to


---------71:37----------
check this stuff every single day right


---------71:40----------
you can even


---------71:41----------
include some stuff about dreams if you


---------71:43----------
want to but we'll get to that in a


---------71:44----------
second


---------71:46----------
so you th this is where you need to


---------71:47----------
collect really really high quality


---------71:49----------
information


---------71:50----------
so that you can make a targeted


---------71:52----------
intervention that will work for you


---------71:55----------
okay so sleep diary is really important


---------71:59----------
next thing okay so now just general


---------72:02----------
solutions so the first thing is time


---------72:04----------
outdoors


---------72:06----------
so every day you should spend at least


---------72:09----------
one hour outside if you can


---------72:11----------
okay so like this is the biggest problem


---------72:13----------
that i see with the gaming generation is


---------72:15----------
like we live in a cube


---------72:17----------
right especially if we're like really


---------72:19----------
hardcore gamers or like it doesn't you


---------72:21----------
don't have to be a hardcore gamer


---------72:23----------
especially during coven we wake up


---------72:26----------
we stay indoors


---------72:28----------
we


---------72:29----------
let's say we shower let's say i'm like a


---------72:30----------
generally healthy person during covet


---------72:32----------
right i wake up i shower i eat some


---------72:35----------
breakfast i sit down i work for eight


---------72:37----------
hours remotely


---------72:39----------
i take a break


---------72:40----------
i watch some tv while i have a late


---------72:43----------
lunch


---------72:44----------
right because like i'm not gonna just


---------72:46----------
sit there and eat my food i'm gonna have


---------72:47----------
some kind of technology while i'm doing


---------72:49----------
it i'm going to like watch something or


---------72:50----------
listen to something or whatever


---------72:52----------
and then i'm going to like log on with


---------72:53----------
my friends and i'm going to game for a


---------72:54----------
couple of hours and i'm going to wrap up


---------72:56----------
the day with some netflix


---------72:58----------
and then watch youtube videos on my


---------73:00----------
phone before i go to sleep


---------73:02----------
right so i've just been in this damn


---------73:03----------
cube the whole time so i have no outdoor


---------73:05----------
stuff so then what what does that mean


---------73:07----------
for my sleep


---------73:09----------
how does my body know that it's bedtime


---------73:12----------
it has no idea


---------73:13----------
how does it know when it's a daytime it


---------73:15----------
has no idea


---------73:16----------
it's not seeing any horizons which is


---------73:19----------
really important


---------73:21----------
actually for your eyes and stuff like


---------73:22----------
that too it's not getting exposed to a


---------73:24----------
large amount of light


---------73:26----------
right it's just the same damn


---------73:28----------
even walls


---------73:30----------
even windows maybe you get a little bit


---------73:32----------
of light


---------73:33----------
even light from our computer screen so


---------73:35----------
it's getting the same stimulus


---------73:38----------
all day long


---------73:39----------
and all night long there isn't a


---------73:41----------
difference in the kind of stimulus it


---------73:43----------
gets so it gets it it gets confused from


---------73:46----------
a circadian rhythm


---------73:48----------
so i know it's kind of weird but go


---------73:51----------
outside


---------73:53----------
during the day


---------73:58----------
and


---------73:59----------
at dusk


---------74:01----------
if you can this is ideal this is huge


---------74:04----------
okay


---------74:05----------
so this will start using a lot of good


---------74:07----------
like light


---------74:09----------
information


---------74:10----------
like your body you'll be sending all


---------74:12----------
kinds of signals to your body and there


---------74:14----------
are all kinds of mechanisms i haven't


---------74:16----------
even touched on so for example you will


---------74:17----------
produce


---------74:19----------
vitamin d


---------74:21----------
which in turn will decrease your


---------74:23----------
depression


---------74:25----------
which in turn


---------74:26----------
will move you in this direction cool


---------74:31----------
right so spend some time outdoors


---------74:37----------
next thing


---------74:41----------
structured bedtime routine


---------74:46----------
we are creatures of habit our brain


---------74:48----------
likes habit who here has to concentrate


---------74:51----------
every time they brush their teeth no you


---------74:52----------
don't need to concentrate anymore your


---------74:53----------
brain is formed a habit


---------74:55----------
help your habit work for you okay so


---------74:58----------
develop a bedtime routine so for two


---------75:00----------
hours before bed no screens


---------75:03----------
this is so hard oh my god dr k


---------75:06----------
how am i supposed to not use a screen


---------75:08----------
before bed it's impossible


---------75:10----------
couple of really good rules no phones in


---------75:12----------
bed


---------75:16----------
also applies to tablets


---------75:19----------
switches


---------75:22----------
laptops just no phones in bed


---------75:25----------
right that's hard dr k


---------75:29----------
i understand that it's hard it's just


---------75:31----------
you need to decide


---------75:34----------
what do you prefer


---------75:36----------
do you would you rather have your phone


---------75:38----------
in bed or would you rather have a good


---------75:39----------
night's sleep you have a choice


---------75:41----------
i'm not saying you have to do it i'm


---------75:43----------
just saying if you want a good night's


---------75:44----------
sleep you start with no phones in bed


---------75:47----------
this is where i'm going to help you all


---------75:48----------
out a little bit i'm not going to just


---------75:49----------
leave you with that decision all on your


---------75:50----------
own so i think this is where the biggest


---------75:54----------
challenge that we face


---------75:56----------
is that for the two hours before bed we


---------75:57----------
don't know what to do


---------75:59----------
right it's like if i'm not on my phone


---------76:01----------
because if you think about like when do


---------76:02----------
you pull out your phone you pull out


---------76:04----------
your phone during periods of boredom or


---------76:06----------
transitions when there's nothing else


---------76:07----------
going on you pull out your phone if


---------76:10----------
you're in a transition point you pull


---------76:11----------
out your phone if you're waiting for


---------76:13----------
your friend to pick you up and they're


---------76:14----------
gonna be there in five minutes and


---------76:16----------
you're ready what are you gonna do in


---------76:18----------
those five minutes you're going to pull


---------76:19----------
out your damn phone


---------76:21----------
right you're not going to sit there


---------76:23----------
you're going to pull out your phone


---------76:24----------
toilets transitions


---------76:27----------
right that's when we use our phone


---------76:29----------
the problem is that once you start


---------76:31----------
scrolling it's going to inhibit your


---------76:32----------
melatonin production


---------76:34----------
right so screens


---------76:37----------
inhibit melatonin


---------76:40----------
and are also going to


---------76:42----------
activate mental function


---------76:45----------
so this is what i want you all to


---------76:46----------
understand about your brain


---------76:48----------
you know how you don't cook food and put


---------76:50----------
it straight into the fridge what do you


---------76:51----------
do with food before you stick it in the


---------76:53----------
fridge


---------76:54----------
you got to let it come to room temp you


---------76:56----------
got to let it cool down


---------76:57----------
so your brain needs a cool down time so


---------77:00----------
that doesn't mean be inactive that means


---------77:03----------
don't do some kind of hyper stimulating


---------77:06----------
dopaminergic activity let it come to


---------77:08----------
room temperature before you you put it


---------77:10----------
to sleep that's what you need to do with


---------77:11----------
your brain okay


---------77:13----------
so screens are really really problematic


---------77:15----------
because the reason they're so damn


---------77:16----------
addictive and this is the way that


---------77:18----------
they're designed


---------77:19----------
is to stimulate the brain and keep it


---------77:22----------
engaged so it's the very opposite it's


---------77:24----------
like the you know the the


---------77:26----------
like all these apps and stuff are like


---------77:28----------
microwaves for your brain like they're


---------77:30----------
just gonna heat it up


---------77:31----------
like if you if you browse reddit for


---------77:33----------
example or twitter like they're gonna


---------77:34----------
there's gonna be a lot of like sexist


---------77:36----------
like political meme-ish


---------77:39----------
anti-blizzard anti-ea anti-work


---------77:43----------
anti-like climate change anti-liberal


---------77:46----------
antifa like so there's gonna be some


---------77:48----------
kind of crap that's gonna amp you up


---------77:50----------
right i'm not trying to place a value


---------77:51----------
judgment on any of it i'm not saying any


---------77:53----------
of it is right or wrong that's for other


---------77:54----------
people to decide i'm ignorant to that


---------77:56----------
stuff all i'm saying is that all that


---------77:58----------
stuff is gonna have you


---------77:59----------
like being


---------78:02----------
activated


---------78:04----------
okay


---------78:06----------
so


---------78:08----------
this is why you need to stay away from


---------78:09----------
screens so then the question is okay dr


---------78:11----------
k what should i do instead of


---------78:13----------
the screens and this is beautiful this


---------78:14----------
is like the most op move


---------78:17----------
all of the crap that you should be doing


---------78:19----------
anyway


---------78:20----------
right so if you procrastinate to do


---------78:22----------
things because you're xyz that is the


---------78:25----------
stuff that you should do for two hours


---------78:26----------
before bed so i like to the best one to


---------78:30----------
start with for me is grocery shopping i


---------78:32----------
will go grocery shopping at like 9 p.m


---------78:33----------
at night


---------78:35----------
okay so it gets me out of the house i'm


---------78:37----------
away from a screen i do my grocery


---------78:39----------
shopping then i've got groceries for


---------78:40----------
tomorrow so that's a win


---------78:42----------
i also clean before bed really fantastic


---------78:45----------
cleans out the mind


---------78:47----------
should the


---------78:48----------
this is in dr k's guide which in turn


---------78:50----------
will reduce your stress


---------78:53----------
reduce your anxiety


---------78:56----------
and target falling asleep


---------78:59----------
easy champ


---------79:01----------
right so cleaning and you have the bonus


---------79:04----------
of like having a you know clean dishes


---------79:09----------
you have the bonus of like not having a


---------79:11----------
messy place


---------79:14----------
so we're gonna take this goal that you


---------79:17----------
have set for yourself


---------79:18----------
and it's very hard for you to do and


---------79:20----------
we're gonna leverage that goal to help


---------79:22----------
you sleep every single day


---------79:24----------
okay you can also do things like sort


---------79:26----------
through the mail


---------79:28----------
i do all kinds of like random stuff okay


---------79:31----------
exercise yoga


---------79:33----------
meditation


---------79:39----------
okay and then some people say but i


---------79:41----------
thought you weren't supposed to exercise


---------79:42----------
before bed


---------79:43----------
and that's where like yeah generally


---------79:44----------
speaking if you look at population


---------79:46----------
studies it is more advantageous to


---------79:49----------
exercise earlier in the day for the


---------79:51----------
average person


---------79:52----------
but if you're like me you can exercise


---------79:54----------
for before bed and then like if you do


---------79:56----------
like two hours before bed you feel super


---------79:58----------
tired and like really good at night and


---------80:00----------
it's very easy to sleep


---------80:02----------
okay you can also do something like take


---------80:03----------
a bath so there's some physiologic stuff


---------80:06----------
here


---------80:07----------
where


---------80:10----------
i'm just trying to figure out if i want


---------80:11----------
to go into this


---------80:12----------
so when you take a hot bath you get a


---------80:14----------
lot of vasodila peripheral vasodilation


---------80:22----------
and then after the bath


---------80:24----------
you get alterations


---------80:28----------
in blood vessels


---------80:34----------
that make you sleepy


---------80:37----------
i'm not going to go into more detail but


---------80:39----------
not here but there's a lot that goes on


---------80:42----------
there right so you can use like


---------80:43----------
physiology there too


---------80:46----------
okay other advantage other things that


---------80:48----------
you can do so if you're bored right so


---------80:50----------
i'd say audio stuff is totally fine


---------80:55----------
physical books totally fine


---------80:58----------
be careful about what you read but


---------81:00----------
generally speaking like i'll listen to


---------81:01----------
like spirituality lectures and podcasts


---------81:04----------
and like stuff that's like interesting


---------81:06----------
and that like i'm glad the next day that


---------81:08----------
i learned something but it's not so


---------81:10----------
intellectually stimulating like i would


---------81:12----------
not read like a horror novel before bed


---------81:14----------
right unless that works for you i mean


---------81:15----------
it may work for you


---------81:17----------
but you can like all that stuff that you


---------81:18----------
want to learn like you know you want to


---------81:19----------
read more nonfiction you want to like


---------81:21----------
learn more about stoicism get yourself


---------81:23----------
an audio book and just listen to it in


---------81:25----------
bed okay


---------81:27----------
um we'll talk a little bit about


---------81:28----------
meditation in a second


---------81:30----------
and then uh


---------81:33----------
last thing is food


---------81:34----------
okay


---------81:35----------
so here's our tip


---------81:39----------
for eating


---------81:41----------
so here is the diet that i would


---------81:43----------
recommend for the average person who


---------81:46----------
wants to use that insulin spike in their


---------81:48----------
favor


---------81:49----------
so i'd say start


---------81:51----------
breakfast


---------81:53----------
with something like oatmeal


---------81:55----------
high fiber


---------81:58----------
high satiety


---------82:01----------
low calorie


---------82:03----------
food


---------82:05----------
okay


---------82:06----------
so if you don't do this


---------82:09----------
you will have a huge lunch


---------82:13----------
okay so we don't want a huge lunch we


---------82:15----------
want some kind of high fiber high


---------82:17----------
satiety like


---------82:19----------
pile of stuff in your stomach so that


---------82:22----------
you feel kind of full


---------82:24----------
you need to eat a pre-emptive lunch


---------82:28----------
so if you wait


---------82:31----------
too long


---------82:32----------
this calorie deficit which you've


---------82:34----------
already built up


---------82:36----------
is going to cause you to crave really


---------82:38----------
unhealthy food so you want to have like


---------82:40----------
a gigantic pile of oatmeal at like 8 a.m


---------82:43----------
with berries


---------82:44----------
and then you want to fix yourself some


---------82:46----------
kind of like sandwich or something like


---------82:47----------
even before you get hungry like 11 30


---------82:50----------
eat a sandwich or something not too


---------82:51----------
calorie dense


---------82:53----------
but you want to avoid being super super


---------82:55----------
hungry at 11 30


---------82:57----------
or at noon actually so you got to eat


---------82:58----------
early okay


---------83:00----------
then what's going to happen when evening


---------83:02----------
rolls around like when 6 pm


---------83:05----------
7 p.m rolls around you're gonna be


---------83:07----------
famished because you're like kind of


---------83:09----------
calorie deficit for the day and then i


---------83:11----------
want you to eat whatever the hell you


---------83:13----------
want


---------83:14----------
so go to town on the burrito


---------83:17----------
okay


---------83:17----------
hit that food coma veg out for a little


---------83:20----------
bit go through your bedtime routine and


---------83:23----------
then just pass the out


---------83:25----------
okay this is really really really


---------83:28----------
important okay


---------83:29----------
so there's an important point so a lot


---------83:31----------
of people say i do bodybuilding what


---------83:32----------
about this what about gaining weight


---------83:35----------
it takes about three days to reset your


---------83:37----------
sleep schedule so all this stuff you can


---------83:39----------
start to adjust these things but to


---------83:40----------
reset your sleep schedule all it takes


---------83:42----------
is three days


---------83:44----------
generally speaking so it's okay to do


---------83:46----------
this for three days and then you can


---------83:48----------
adopt healthier eating habits afterward


---------83:50----------
because then you've got other stuff


---------83:51----------
going for you right now your circadian


---------83:53----------
rhythm after three days your circadian


---------83:55----------
rhythm is adjusted it's gonna be easy


---------83:57----------
for you to fall asleep at 10 pm so you


---------83:59----------
don't need the burrito to get you into


---------84:02----------
the coma right at that point this stuff


---------84:04----------
will be enough


---------84:06----------
okay so these are general tips for sleep


---------84:12----------
okay


---------84:14----------
other things to remember


---------84:16----------
so last point that i'll kind of share is


---------84:18----------
that generally speaking it is easier to


---------84:20----------
wake up when you're tired than it is to


---------84:22----------
go to bed when you're not


---------84:24----------
okay


---------84:25----------
so


---------84:27----------
this may not apply to some of y'all so


---------84:29----------
if you have a problem with this phase


---------84:32----------
of sleep maybe this is not true for you


---------84:35----------
but generally speaking i think like


---------84:36----------
physiologically it's like easier to wake


---------84:38----------
up in the middle of the night if your


---------84:40----------
house is on fire than it is to like go


---------84:42----------
to sleep you know


---------84:44----------
if you're


---------84:45----------
fully awake


---------84:47----------
so our we have more mechanisms that can


---------84:49----------
increase wakefulness than we do that can


---------84:52----------
increase sleepiness


---------84:56----------
so if you want to reset your sleep


---------84:57----------
schedule what it takes is three days


---------85:01----------
of waking up on time


---------85:06----------
and


---------85:08----------
if you guys just want one tip bit of


---------85:10----------
advice being


---------85:13----------
a zombie


---------85:16----------
you will be a zombie don't drink


---------85:18----------
caffeine you're just gonna be a zombie


---------85:19----------
all day long you're gonna feel terrible


---------85:22----------
you're not gonna be able to do anything


---------85:24----------
you're gonna be unproductive you're


---------85:26----------
going to be kind of moody irritable like


---------85:28----------
it's just going to feel like you're


---------85:30----------
you're like lagging in real life


---------85:32----------
you're like playing real life on ping


---------85:34----------
that's what it's going to feel like


---------85:36----------
and then sleep will feel like a relief


---------85:43----------
next day you're gonna wake up


---------85:45----------
you're gonna be a zombie you're gonna do


---------85:46----------
that three days in a row


---------85:48----------
by the end of it you'll feel amazing


---------85:49----------
you'll have detox off of caffeine


---------85:55----------
you may have even detoxed off with some


---------85:57----------
of that dopamine too


---------85:59----------
and your sleep your circadian rhythm


---------86:00----------
will be reset and then you'll be like


---------86:02----------
golden


---------86:04----------
okay you just have to understand that


---------86:06----------
you have to like you're gonna be a


---------86:07----------
zombie for a while okay


---------86:10----------
so at this point we're an hour and a


---------86:12----------
half in and i have not even gotten to


---------86:14----------
the three specifics so i think we're


---------86:16----------
gonna save that for another day


---------86:19----------
so what we'll have maybe next time is


---------86:23----------
specific strategies


---------86:26----------
for if you have trouble falling asleep


---------86:32----------
staying asleep


---------86:37----------
and waking up


---------86:40----------
right so how can we look at


---------86:42----------
please today


---------86:46----------
okay we can do it today that means


---------86:48----------
that's all we're gonna do today i gotta


---------86:50----------
i gotta check


---------86:58----------
okay today okay


---------87:06----------
so good


---------87:07----------
okay


---------87:12----------
okay finish today that's all we're going


---------87:14----------
to do today then


---------87:16----------
because i did what i normally do so


---------87:17----------
we're like this is like dude this is a


---------87:19----------
90 minute lecture


---------87:20----------
folks you all get that like we're


---------87:22----------
already 90 minutes in and by the way


---------87:24----------
i've done like 12 hour seminars on sleep


---------87:28----------
so there's just we're just scratching


---------87:30----------
the surface like there's so much to


---------87:31----------
understand about this


---------87:33----------
that's all


---------87:34----------
applicable too it's not just like


---------87:35----------
academic


---------87:36----------
like here's what we like there's like


---------87:38----------
there's so many different things


---------87:39----------
so one tip that i we haven't even talked


---------87:41----------
about which is huge


---------87:43----------
is you remember this this rem cycle


---------87:45----------
business


---------87:48----------
right so you have


---------87:50----------
you have sleep cycles where you start


---------87:52----------
here and then you end here


---------87:55----------
so if you wake up here


---------87:58----------
you'll feel groggy


---------88:01----------
but if you wake up here you'll feel


---------88:03----------
rested


---------88:04----------
and this is if you for example sleep for


---------88:06----------
two hours and wake up here you will feel


---------88:08----------
rested if you sleep for eight hours and


---------88:11----------
wake up here you'll feel groggy so


---------88:14----------
understanding where you are in your


---------88:16----------
sleep cycle when you wake up is critical


---------88:18----------
so this is why you know sometimes you


---------88:20----------
take a nap


---------88:21----------
and like you wake up feeling way more


---------88:23----------
tired than when you went to bed and


---------88:24----------
sometimes you take a nap and it's like


---------88:26----------
you feel amazing


---------88:28----------
and you're like wait but why is that


---------88:30----------
like i only slept for a half an hour or


---------88:32----------
45 minutes and i feel amazing and other


---------88:34----------
times it's like i slept for three hours


---------88:35----------
and i feel like a zombie like i don't


---------88:37----------
understand what's going on it's because


---------88:38----------
of when you wake up during this this


---------88:41----------
cycle and so even understanding things


---------88:43----------
to that specificity will control


---------88:46----------
how easy it is to wake up because you


---------88:48----------
have to wake up at the right time of


---------88:49----------
your sleep cycle


---------88:52----------
okay


---------88:57----------
okay


---------89:00----------
okay strategies


---------89:04----------
all right


---------89:07----------
so difficulty falling asleep


---------89:11----------
so the first thing to understand


---------89:14----------
is that according to ayurveda which by


---------89:15----------
the way i know we've had some people who


---------89:17----------
were


---------89:18----------
uh skeptical of irvada which is totally


---------89:20----------
fine um i'm still amalgamating different


---------89:22----------
kinds of evidence that i will present to


---------89:24----------
y'all and hopefully y'all will be


---------89:26----------
convinced


---------89:30----------
i am um


---------89:32----------
i'm i'm convinced that ayurveda is very


---------89:34----------
helpful from a clinical standpoint


---------89:35----------
precisely because of things like this so


---------89:37----------
if you guys like think this is pretty


---------89:38----------
cool and no one else talks about it this


---------89:40----------
way


---------89:41----------
this kind of thinking essentially comes


---------89:43----------
from ayurveda


---------89:44----------
this idea that insomnia is not


---------89:47----------
homogeneous and affects different people


---------89:48----------
in different ways is like a


---------89:50----------
fundamentally ayurvedic concept and you


---------89:52----------
may say but that's a fundamentally human


---------89:53----------
concept but that's not how western


---------89:55----------
medicine really thinks about it right


---------89:56----------
because


---------89:58----------
a medical doctor will diagnose you with


---------90:00----------
insomnia like they'll just diagnose you


---------90:01----------
with that and they'll kind of like be


---------90:03----------
done with it


---------90:04----------
right so falling asleep first of all to


---------90:07----------
understand from an ayurvedic perspective


---------90:09----------
is a bit the problem and if you guys


---------90:10----------
don't understand what that means


---------90:12----------
go watch dr k's guide and go look at the


---------90:14----------
ir by the stuff because there's like two


---------90:16----------
or three hours about that okay


---------90:18----------
so it's a fit then balance so pithas


---------90:21----------
their minds are very active their minds


---------90:23----------
are like fire they can't let things go


---------90:25----------
they have trouble cooling down before we


---------90:27----------
put the food in the fridge


---------90:29----------
right and so they have difficulty


---------90:30----------
falling asleep they will hold on


---------90:32----------
oftentimes


---------90:34----------
to a few thoughts


---------90:37----------
and these thoughts prevent them from


---------90:39----------
sleeping


---------90:41----------
okay


---------90:42----------
so if you have trouble falling asleep


---------90:44----------
first thing to understand is that it may


---------90:46----------
be a fit the issue and if you balance


---------90:47----------
your pitta it should get better


---------90:51----------
we'll talk a little bit more about that


---------90:53----------
in a second


---------90:54----------
second thing you should ask yourself is


---------90:55----------
if you're having trouble staying asleep


---------90:57----------
here's the next question you should ask


---------90:58----------
yourself


---------90:59----------
have i been


---------91:00----------
awake for


---------91:03----------
16 hours


---------91:04----------
if the answer to that question is no


---------91:07----------
your goal tomorrow is to go to sleep at


---------91:09----------
the same time and have that turn that


---------91:11----------
question into a yes


---------91:13----------
okay so


---------91:15----------
the solution to that is


---------91:18----------
wake up earlier


---------91:23----------
right because remember your metabolic


---------91:25----------
substrates haven't built up to help you


---------91:27----------
fall asleep if you haven't been awake


---------91:29----------
for 16 hours so your answer is to wake


---------91:31----------
up earlier


---------91:33----------
by the way you may be a zombie


---------91:35----------
gg just let your circadian rhythm


---------91:37----------
balance after three days it's gonna be


---------91:39----------
tough


---------91:41----------
right but this is what you're gonna need


---------91:42----------
to do the good news is even after one


---------91:44----------
day you may start to feel a little bit


---------91:46----------
better okay


---------91:48----------
so the next thing to think a little bit


---------91:49----------
about


---------91:51----------
is your let me just make sure


---------91:56----------
um okay yeah so next thing to think


---------91:57----------
about is does your body


---------92:02----------
know


---------92:04----------
it is time to sleep


---------92:09----------
and you may ask


---------92:10----------
me


---------92:11----------
dr k how does my body know whether it is


---------92:13----------
time to sleep or not and this is where


---------92:15----------
like we talked about this right what are


---------92:17----------
the ways in which your body knows that


---------92:18----------
it's been time to sleep so we've talked


---------92:20----------
about being awake for 16 hours


---------92:22----------
what has your light exposure been like


---------92:25----------
have you been stuck in a room all day


---------92:27----------
because if the answer to that question


---------92:28----------
is yes your body is really confused


---------92:30----------
what's your technology use like


---------92:36----------
and if your body is like oh if you've


---------92:37----------
been like sitting in a room without


---------92:39----------
windows for the last


---------92:41----------
16 hours and there's been a constant


---------92:43----------
stream of like computer monitor light or


---------92:46----------
tv screen light on you then your body


---------92:48----------
has no idea it's time to sleep and it's


---------92:50----------
gonna get confused it's gonna be hard to


---------92:51----------
fall asleep okay


---------92:57----------
next thing is


---------93:01----------
stress and anxiety


---------93:06----------
do you have stress do you have anxiety


---------93:09----------
what are you stressed out about what are


---------93:10----------
you anxious about this is where things


---------93:12----------
get a little bit complicated so you can


---------93:15----------
you know depending on how bad things are


---------93:17----------
you can work with a therapist


---------93:20----------
you can work with a coach


---------93:23----------
you can also just like


---------93:24----------
introspect


---------93:27----------
process


---------93:28----------
we touch on this all through the rest of


---------93:30----------
our stuff so there's a lot of stuff


---------93:32----------
about this in dr k's guide but i can't


---------93:34----------
go into like how to fix stress or


---------93:36----------
anxiety like


---------93:37----------
in five minutes right it's just not that


---------93:39----------
simple


---------93:40----------
but the truth is that if you're having


---------93:41----------
trouble falling asleep and you're in a


---------93:43----------
stressful state


---------93:45----------
that has high cortisol


---------93:47----------
this is going to be activating your raf


---------93:50----------
and is going to make it hard for you to


---------93:51----------
fall asleep and make you a light sleeper


---------93:53----------
so you have to deal with this stuff


---------93:56----------
there are a couple of other specific


---------93:58----------
practices so the meditative rewind


---------94:00----------
practice which is in the guide


---------94:03----------
is very effective for this


---------94:07----------
yoga nidra


---------94:09----------
is also very effective for this both


---------94:11----------
those are in the guide we're going to


---------94:12----------
teach you guys a different meditation


---------94:14----------
today


---------94:16----------
okay


---------94:16----------
so you have to deal with your stress and


---------94:18----------
anxiety and then the last thing


---------94:20----------
is


---------94:22----------
diet optimization for this so remember


---------94:24----------
since it's a bit the problem


---------94:26----------
what we really want to do is focus on


---------94:28----------
like cooling kind of heavy


---------94:30----------
foods so you know if you eat yogurt


---------94:35----------
with fruit


---------94:38----------
drizzle


---------94:40----------
maple syrup


---------94:43----------
before bed this should be your dessert


---------94:46----------
right we're gonna get some good


---------94:48----------
protein in there


---------94:49----------
some good antioxidants


---------94:52----------
get some vitamin c


---------94:55----------
get some


---------94:55----------
[Music]


---------94:58----------
other stuff fiber


---------95:01----------
right it's going to taste yummy because


---------95:02----------
there's a little bit of maple syrup in


---------95:03----------
there now technically ayurveda says you


---------95:05----------
shouldn't mix fruit in yogurt you


---------95:07----------
shouldn't mix dairy and and fruit but


---------95:10----------
we'll step away for that for a second


---------95:13----------
um and if eating them together causes


---------95:15----------
you a lot of indigestion and interferes


---------95:16----------
with your sleep then don't do it but i


---------95:18----------
think this is like a really good kind of


---------95:20----------
dietary thing that you can have it'll


---------95:22----------
have like some density to it it'll be


---------95:24----------
like somewhat satisfying and it'll


---------95:26----------
actually be quite healthy okay


---------95:29----------
so


---------95:30----------
this is what to do if you have trouble


---------95:32----------
falling asleep okay so let's recap it's


---------95:34----------
a bit then balance so your mind will be


---------95:36----------
holding on to a few thoughts and keeping


---------95:39----------
you from sleeping


---------95:40----------
so there's


---------95:41----------
techniques and stuff around that as well


---------95:43----------
but you know the


---------95:44----------
the main thing is going to be first of


---------95:46----------
all have you been awake for 16 hours


---------95:48----------
second thing is going to be to make sure


---------95:50----------
that your body knows that it's time to


---------95:52----------
sleep and how does the body know that


---------95:53----------
it's time to sleep it has to do with


---------95:54----------
your light exposure for the day and your


---------95:56----------
technology exposure for the day


---------95:59----------
third thing to think a little bit about


---------96:00----------
is just your stress and anxiety level


---------96:02----------
and like as long as those are present


---------96:04----------
you have to understand that that is


---------96:05----------
going to lead to a clinical impact


---------96:07----------
physiologic impact on your sleep so you


---------96:10----------
can try to do all kinds of other stuff


---------96:12----------
take supplements or whatever but if you


---------96:13----------
really want to be like conquer insomnia


---------96:16----------
and sleep like a baby this must be dealt


---------96:18----------
with and oh my goodness dr k that means


---------96:21----------
that i can't fix it tonight yes that is


---------96:23----------
correct unfortunately you cannot fix


---------96:25----------
sleep necessarily in one day sometimes


---------96:28----------
it takes weeks if not months the upside


---------96:31----------
is that once you learn how to do this


---------96:32----------
and you process these problems you could


---------96:34----------
be sleeping like a baby for the next


---------96:36----------
five years


---------96:37----------
right and this is like this is the


---------96:39----------
problem with sort of like the


---------96:41----------
the


---------96:41----------
supplement industry is like they're not


---------96:43----------
gonna tell you that right like they're


---------96:45----------
like everyone out there is looking for


---------96:47----------
an easy fix to sleep


---------96:50----------
and so the market provides them with the


---------96:53----------
illusion of an easy fix


---------96:55----------
that's scientifically backed for good


---------96:57----------
reason


---------96:59----------
and then people are just


---------97:00----------
like then the problem propagates right


---------97:03----------
and it's because all we all want an easy


---------97:05----------
solution they're like i just want to


---------97:06----------
sleep tonight


---------97:07----------
and the truth is that if you want to


---------97:09----------
consistently have good sleep day after


---------97:11----------
day after day after day it's not going


---------97:13----------
to be an easy fix


---------97:15----------
unless you've got sleep apnea in which


---------97:16----------
you guys get yourself a sleep ap


---------97:18----------
cpap it'll revolutionize your life


---------97:20----------
okay


---------97:23----------
all right for staying asleep


---------97:30----------
this


---------97:30----------
is a vata imbalance


---------97:35----------
right so restlessness


---------97:37----------
about that problems


---------97:41----------
this is also where we see things like


---------97:42----------
ptsd manifest right so you're gonna get


---------97:45----------
nightmares


---------97:49----------
so the other way to think about it is


---------97:50----------
nightmares will not affect falling


---------97:53----------
asleep or waking up but they will affect


---------97:55----------
the sleep in the middle so there's like


---------97:57----------
early sleep mid sleep late sleep


---------97:59----------
okay


---------98:00----------
so key things to start with what's your


---------98:02----------
caffeine intake


---------98:04----------
also true for falling asleep especially


---------98:06----------
if you have had caffeine


---------98:09----------
um


---------98:10----------
so other vata things to be aware of is


---------98:14----------
technology use


---------98:16----------
so this isn't just technology used two


---------98:19----------
hours before bed although that'll


---------98:20----------
definitely engage the melatonin circuits


---------98:22----------
and things like that


---------98:23----------
but technology used throughout the day


---------98:25----------
so if you just overall reduce your


---------98:27----------
technology use and this is especially


---------98:29----------
phone usage in transition points it will


---------98:32----------
help you sleep i know it sounds crazy


---------98:35----------
um


---------98:40----------
so this is another really important


---------98:42----------
thing is routine before bed


---------98:47----------
so you really want to not so the the


---------98:52----------
how can i say this so for people who


---------98:54----------
have trouble falling asleep


---------98:56----------
sometimes what ends up happening is that


---------98:59----------
they basically the fatigue


---------99:01----------
gets so bad that it overcomes


---------99:05----------
their inability to fall asleep


---------99:07----------
right and if you fall asleep that way


---------99:10----------
your sleep is going to be disturbed


---------99:12----------
because your mind is not ready for sleep


---------99:15----------
it's like it doesn't want to sleep but


---------99:17----------
the fatigue overpowers it and then


---------99:19----------
you're kind of like left with a very


---------99:20----------
unrestful sleep afterward if that makes


---------99:23----------
sense


---------99:24----------
so what you want to do is is really be


---------99:26----------
careful about the routine before bed in


---------99:28----------
the cool down period because you want to


---------99:30----------
let your body prepare for a long period


---------99:33----------
of rest so cool down period becomes


---------99:35----------
really really important a couple of


---------99:37----------
other tips here so weighted blanket


---------99:43----------
can be super super op so sometimes vatas


---------99:46----------
really really like weighted blankets if


---------99:48----------
you also have anxiety so there have been


---------99:50----------
clinical studies that show that weighted


---------99:52----------
blankets will actually help people with


---------99:54----------
anxiety sleep better so if you want to


---------99:56----------
use some device or tool to help you


---------99:58----------
sleep stay asleep


---------100:01----------
another interesting question that i'll


---------100:02----------
sometimes ask people


---------100:04----------
when i'm deciding whether to recommend a


---------100:06----------
weighted blanket is i will ask them


---------100:08----------
when you were a baby did you need to be


---------100:10----------
tightly swaddled to sleep


---------100:13----------
and so they'll ask their parents and


---------100:15----------
what i've anecdotal but i've seen an


---------100:17----------
anecdotal correlation with like how


---------100:19----------
swaddled you needed to be to sleep


---------100:21----------
properly and how much you'll respond to


---------100:23----------
a weighted blanket there's all kinds of


---------100:25----------
physiologic mechanisms psychological


---------100:27----------
mechanisms things like that that are


---------100:29----------
involved with weighted blankets


---------100:31----------
um so you can even ask your parents did


---------100:33----------
i need to be like tightly swaddled or


---------100:35----------
what


---------100:37----------
uh


---------100:38----------
okay


---------100:40----------
so


---------100:44----------
yeah so temperature control is also


---------100:45----------
really important


---------100:47----------
for the maintenance of sleep


---------100:50----------
so you may need to adjust your


---------100:52----------
temperature


---------100:53----------
um


---------100:53----------
[Music]


---------100:55----------
yeah another thing you can do to fall


---------100:57----------
asleep so we mentioned a couple of these


---------100:58----------
things like audio books and stuff like


---------101:00----------
that


---------101:00----------
okay


---------101:03----------
next thing is tired in the am


---------101:10----------
okay so if you're tired in the morning


---------101:12----------
this is a kapha imbalance


---------101:16----------
or difficulty waking up


---------101:24----------
okay


---------101:26----------
so you want to use kapha alleviating


---------101:27----------
diets right so you want to eat food that


---------101:29----------
is


---------101:30----------
light dry


---------101:33----------
and sour right the other way to kind of


---------101:35----------
think about that is if you eat lightly


---------101:38----------
the night before


---------101:40----------
we're gonna let's let's kind of reverse


---------101:42----------
the process and think about physiology


---------101:44----------
so if i don't have a burrito before bed


---------101:48----------
what's gonna happen right so i'm so if i


---------101:50----------
have a burrito before bed


---------101:52----------
let's just look at the burrito


---------101:55----------
if i eat a burrito


---------101:58----------
my blood sugar


---------102:01----------
so blood sugar is going to be white


---------102:05----------
is going to go up


---------102:07----------
and then fall over the course of the


---------102:09----------
night okay


---------102:10----------
and then when i i'm going to make


---------102:12----------
something called glycogen which is my


---------102:14----------
sugar stores


---------102:16----------
so my sugar stores will also like


---------102:20----------
be high until i'm low right


---------102:24----------
and so like at this point


---------102:26----------
when i wake up let's say this is 8 a.m


---------102:29----------
i'm gonna have a lot of glycogen


---------102:31----------
so i'm not going to be


---------102:33----------
starving at all


---------102:34----------
so if i eat lightly instead


---------102:37----------
what's going to happen let's say i eat


---------102:38----------
lightly


---------102:40----------
and then i don't have any insulin spike


---------102:42----------
so let's take the non-burrito


---------102:45----------
let's say light meal before bed


---------102:50----------
my blood sugar basically stays


---------102:52----------
the new blood the new glucose that i'm


---------102:55----------
adding to the system stays low


---------102:58----------
and my my glycogen which is high is


---------103:00----------
going to decrease over the course of the


---------103:02----------
night


---------103:03----------
and then at 8 am


---------103:06----------
i'm a


---------103:08----------
hungry so it'll be easier to wake up


---------103:12----------
if you eat lightly right so glycogen


---------103:14----------
stores last for about eight hours


---------103:16----------
and so eight hours after your


---------103:20----------
glycogen starts being broken down you


---------103:22----------
will start to feel hungry and you want


---------103:24----------
to use that hunger to make help yourself


---------103:26----------
wake up


---------103:27----------
so other tips that you want to do


---------103:30----------
okay so


---------103:33----------
eat lightly


---------103:35----------
ideally not at all


---------103:39----------
before bed


---------103:42----------
okay


---------103:43----------
next thing that you want to do


---------103:47----------
no blinds so try to sleep in a room that


---------103:50----------
gets sunlight so i don't know if y'all


---------103:52----------
have ever had this annoying experience


---------103:54----------
have you ever had like an experience


---------103:55----------
where the sun is right in your eyes when


---------103:57----------
you're trying to sleep because of like


---------103:58----------
some place that you're sleeping it's


---------104:00----------
super super uncomfortable so no blinds


---------104:02----------
let that sunlight hit you in the face


---------104:04----------
and wake you up


---------104:07----------
son wakes you up


---------104:12----------
let it wake you up that's what it's


---------104:13----------
there for


---------104:14----------
it's annoying in your eyes


---------104:16----------
right and so it's kind of interesting


---------104:18----------
because just think about this for a


---------104:19----------
second


---------104:20----------
your eyes could have evolved to be


---------104:22----------
thicker


---------104:23----------
you all get that your eyes could have


---------104:25----------
evolved to be blackout curtains that are


---------104:27----------
completely able to black out the sun but


---------104:29----------
they evolved to be a certain degree of


---------104:31----------
transparency so that your body knows


---------104:33----------
when to wake up when the sunlight is in


---------104:35----------
your eyes


---------104:36----------
that's the way that they were made it's


---------104:37----------
supposed to wake you up


---------104:40----------
and so when the sunlight flashes in your


---------104:41----------
eyes


---------104:42----------
right you don't look at the sun just


---------104:43----------
keep keep your eyes closed it'll


---------104:46----------
turn off melatonin production and you'll


---------104:48----------
start to wake up


---------104:50----------
it's exactly like how it's supposed to


---------104:51----------
happen and if you use blackout curtains


---------104:54----------
or you're in a room with no natural


---------104:55----------
sunlight it's gonna be hard to wake up


---------104:59----------
okay


---------105:03----------
so


---------105:05----------
other thing is that


---------105:07----------
i know it's kind of kind of weird but


---------105:08----------
you want to try to wake up early


---------105:12----------
so you can go to bed early


---------105:19----------
which in turn means that you're you'll


---------105:21----------
start to reduce your adenosine


---------105:24----------
at let's say 9 pm


---------105:27----------
which will in turn allow you to wake up


---------105:29----------
very naturally because then your


---------105:30----------
metabolic like triggers are also going


---------105:32----------
to be active and they'll help you wake


---------105:34----------
up at like


---------105:36----------
five in the morning


---------105:38----------
other other tip


---------105:39----------
this is a key key


---------105:41----------
key tip


---------105:42----------
if you are having trouble waking up in


---------105:44----------
the morning so let's say you have


---------105:45----------
trouble at 7am


---------105:51----------
you don't need to sleep in you need to


---------105:52----------
wake up earlier so try to wake up at 5am


---------105:55----------
you will be amazed some percentage of


---------105:59----------
you will find it way easier to wake up


---------106:01----------
at 5 a.m than you will at 7 a.m so


---------106:03----------
there's circadian rhythm factors here


---------106:08----------
there's also


---------106:09----------
sleep cycle factors here


---------106:14----------
right when i say sleep cycle factors i'm


---------106:15----------
talking about this stuff


---------106:20----------
where's the sleep cycle


---------106:21----------
i'm yeah


---------106:23----------
right so like 8 am


---------106:26----------
eight a.m maybe here


---------106:29----------
and like


---------106:30----------
five a.m maybe here right between your


---------106:33----------
sleep cycles where it's easy to wake up


---------106:35----------
so i know it's kind of weird because


---------106:36----------
people were asking how do you wake up


---------106:39----------
in between your cycles and some of it is


---------106:41----------
circadian


---------106:42----------
so it's like hard like it's very


---------106:44----------
individualized


---------106:45----------
but oftentimes if you have trouble


---------106:47----------
waking up in the morning the solution is


---------106:50----------
to not sleep in but actually try to wake


---------106:52----------
up earlier and you will be stunned at


---------106:54----------
how easy it is to wake up at 5am instead


---------106:56----------
of 7am


---------106:57----------
there's also a lot of evolutionary


---------106:59----------
biology about this which is that


---------107:01----------
so if we look at


---------107:03----------
like for example


---------107:04----------
visual acuity


---------107:08----------
is highest


---------107:10----------
for mammals


---------107:12----------
at dawn


---------107:14----------
and dusk


---------107:16----------
and why is that it's because we're


---------107:17----------
designed to be awake so you have


---------107:19----------
millions or billions of your hundreds of


---------107:21----------
millions of years of evolution that is


---------107:24----------
trying to get you up at like five in the


---------107:26----------
morning around the time of dawn


---------107:28----------
and so i would adjust your psych like


---------107:31----------
like try to wake up even earlier like if


---------107:32----------
you have if you if you keep on hitting


---------107:34----------
the snooze button at 7 00 am try waking


---------107:37----------
up at five you'll be very very surprised


---------107:39----------
okay


---------107:40----------
um and so that's what i would recommend


---------107:43----------
for waking up


---------107:45----------
okay


---------107:46----------
if you have difficulty waking up


---------107:49----------
all right to wrap up we're gonna do


---------107:51----------
a meditation


---------107:54----------
um the reason we're gonna do this


---------107:55----------
meditation is


---------107:59----------
let me think about how to say this


---------108:02----------
so there's gonna be a different kind of


---------108:03----------
meditation but i want it to be something


---------108:05----------
that can help you fall asleep and can be


---------108:08----------
done easily if you wake up in the middle


---------108:10----------
of the night


---------108:13----------
so the first thing is we have three


---------108:15----------
really really good meditations


---------108:17----------
for sleep in dr k's guide we're not


---------108:19----------
going to go into those today


---------108:20----------
because they're there and that's why


---------108:21----------
they're there


---------108:22----------
right so yoga nidra medical rewind i


---------108:25----------
mean uh


---------108:27----------
meditative rewind practice


---------108:29----------
and catching the moment of sleep i think


---------108:31----------
are three really really good meditations


---------108:35----------
catching the moment of sleep meditation


---------108:36----------
is really good for someone who has a


---------108:38----------
very inquisitive active mind


---------108:40----------
and needs to focus it before bed


---------108:43----------
um


---------108:44----------
and


---------108:45----------
yoga nidra is like generally good for


---------108:46----------
cool downing uh period and meditative


---------108:49----------
rewind practice is really really good


---------108:51----------
for people who have like accumulated a


---------108:53----------
lot of emotion or had a rough day


---------108:56----------
so what i'm gonna teach y'all today is


---------108:57----------
actually uh


---------108:59----------
meditative practice


---------109:02----------
let me think about how to


---------109:04----------
say this


---------109:05----------
around darkness okay


---------109:07----------
so this is gonna fall into the category


---------109:09----------
of being like


---------109:12----------
meditations about the self too


---------109:15----------
meditations kind of around shunya


---------109:18----------
but it's a meditation that you can do


---------109:20----------
basically in the dark


---------109:23----------
and so essentially what we're going to


---------109:24----------
do i'm going to walk you all through it


---------109:25----------
but you can do this with your eyes open


---------109:27----------
if it's very dark outside or you can do


---------109:29----------
it with your eyes closed


---------109:30----------
and we're going to kind of notice


---------109:33----------
the limit


---------109:36----------
uh how can i say this


---------109:38----------
we're actually going to notice the lack


---------109:40----------
of limit


---------109:41----------
of the darkness that we experience on


---------109:44----------
the inside so if i close my eyes


---------109:48----------
i'm going to have a sense of space


---------109:51----------
which is determined by my physical body


---------109:54----------
but in my mind


---------109:56----------
i'm gonna have blackness


---------109:58----------
but if you really pay attention


---------110:01----------
it's gonna you're gonna think originally


---------110:04----------
that the darkness is limited or that the


---------110:06----------
darkness starts somewhere or ends


---------110:08----------
somewhere but really what you're going


---------110:10----------
to do is start to realize that what you


---------110:12----------
experience as darkness


---------110:14----------
has no actual limits and it extends


---------110:17----------
forever which is sort of terrifying and


---------110:20----------
sort of cool and then who are you in


---------110:22----------
that business it's kind of hard to


---------110:23----------
describe it y'all hopefully you'll get


---------110:25----------
it okay


---------110:27----------
and so this is something that you can


---------110:28----------
also kind of


---------110:29----------
swim into


---------110:31----------
in the middle of the night if you wake


---------110:33----------
up


---------110:33----------
okay


---------110:35----------
so


---------110:36----------
it it sounds terrifying but that's


---------110:38----------
because you haven't experienced it it's


---------110:39----------
actually incredibly peaceful


---------110:42----------
all right so we're going to start by


---------110:44----------
sitting up straight and closing our eyes


---------110:46----------
i gotta drink something


---------110:54----------
also spill


---------110:57----------
okay


---------111:04----------
let's just kind of breathe in and out


---------111:11----------
for me i need to cool down


---------111:14----------
i've been talking a lot


---------111:17----------
for those of you who have been listening


---------111:20----------
maybe you're feeling kind of sluggish


---------111:23----------
so let the breath start


---------111:26----------
by balancing where you are


---------111:31----------
if you feel sluggish let the breath


---------111:33----------
energize you big deep inhalation


---------111:37----------
and breathe out


---------111:41----------
let it energize you


---------111:43----------
[Music]


---------111:44----------
and out


---------111:51----------
third breath big deep breath


---------112:02----------
you may feel a little bit light-headed


---------112:04----------
or energized


---------112:06----------
but certainly not sluggish


---------112:08----------
not weighed down


---------112:12----------
and on the flip side if you feel like


---------112:14----------
you need to calm down


---------112:17----------
what we're going to do is


---------112:19----------
brief inhalation


---------112:21----------
and really stretch out that exhalation


---------112:24----------
so breathe in


---------112:26----------
and breathe out


---------112:35----------
so maybe two three second inhalation


---------112:40----------
seven eight nine second exhalation


---------112:54----------
another relatively quick inhalation


---------112:58----------
slow slow exhalation


---------113:10----------
and now let your breath guide you


---------113:13----------
it will turn you into the direction that


---------113:15----------
you need to go


---------113:21----------
you may notice a relatively even deep


---------113:24----------
slow breath now


---------113:27----------
and so we're gonna sit in that for about


---------113:29----------
a minute


---------113:41----------
if you feel like you might get


---------113:42----------
distracted


---------113:44----------
you can just appreciate


---------113:47----------
how altering the breath artificially


---------113:51----------
leads to an equilibriation


---------113:54----------
or the relationship between your breath


---------113:56----------
and your mind


---------113:59----------
try to notice the nuances or subtleties


---------114:02----------
the feeling of the breath as it is in in


---------114:06----------
you right now


---------114:54----------
and now i want you to notice


---------114:59----------
the blackness of your mind


---------115:04----------
you may kind of notice that visually you


---------115:06----------
are seeing black


---------115:12----------
and you may begin by being anchored to


---------115:14----------
your body


---------115:17----------
you may notice the limits of your body


---------115:19----------
in space


---------115:25----------
you may notice that the blackness that


---------115:27----------
you see is on your eyelids alone


---------115:39----------
and now start to move beyond your


---------115:40----------
eyelids


---------115:43----------
and notice that the black extends beyond


---------115:45----------
them


---------115:55----------
if you are anchored too much in the body


---------115:59----------
then notice the edge of your knees


---------116:04----------
the top of your head


---------116:07----------
and notice how you can feel nothing


---------116:09----------
beyond that


---------116:25----------
now follow that nothingness out as far


---------116:28----------
as it'll go


---------116:49----------
notice how tiny you truly are


---------116:56----------
how small your body feels


---------117:00----------
in the vast emptiness


---------117:15----------
and see how even within you


---------117:17----------
within the limits of your body


---------117:20----------
there's blackness


---------117:33----------
it's almost as if the border of your


---------117:36----------
body


---------117:39----------
is a paper thin screen


---------117:43----------
between


---------117:44----------
the void within you


---------117:46----------
and the never-ending void outside of you


---------117:55----------
and now sit in one of those two places


---------118:03----------
and begin to realize that they are one


---------118:05----------
and the same


---------118:17----------
that the quality of the emptiness within


---------118:19----------
you


---------118:21----------
is the same as the quality of the


---------118:23----------
emptiness beyond your body


---------118:43----------
and take all of your cares and worries


---------118:48----------
your concerns and your fears


---------118:52----------
your regrets and your anxieties


---------118:56----------
and notice how tall how tiny they are


---------118:59----------
how insignificant


---------119:02----------
compared to the vast beyond


---------119:07----------
and the well within you


---------119:09----------
a deep deep well of blackness


---------119:17----------
and notice yourself in this moment


---------119:20----------
almost floating


---------119:24----------
the energy


---------119:26----------
suffusing your body


---------119:41----------
and find peace


---------119:48----------
swim in the ocean of nothing


---------119:53----------
let it wash over you


---------119:57----------
sweeping all of your worries away


---------120:16----------
and now tell yourself


---------120:20----------
it is time to sleep


---------120:24----------
or time to work


---------120:26----------
or time to wake up


---------120:31----------
and from this place


---------120:34----------
you can send it intention towards your


---------120:38----------
conscious mind whatever it is


---------120:41----------
and that when you break from this place


---------120:43----------
which is already fading


---------120:46----------
notice how it's fading already


---------120:49----------
that this lingering thought will be


---------120:50----------
there


---------120:52----------
and whatever intention you have set


---------120:54----------
yourself


---------120:55----------
will come to be


---------121:00----------
take a deep breath


---------121:03----------
and return yourself to the


---------121:06----------
world or drift yourself to sleep


---------121:11----------
whatever you choose


---------121:16----------
and come on back


---------121:39----------
you
