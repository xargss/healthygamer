---------00:00----------
you don't accept that like all you get


---------00:02----------
to control is whether you roll the dice


---------00:04----------
what you're putting on your shoulders


---------00:05----------
is the burden of what the role is


---------00:07----------
actually going to be you're saying i


---------00:09----------
want to create this thing


---------00:10----------
to take away people's pain and that's


---------00:12----------
why you work so hard that's awesome


---------00:15----------
but then you beat yourself up if for


---------00:17----------
some reason you feel like it's not


---------00:19----------
working or it's not good enough


---------00:24----------
how's it going man going good man how's


---------00:26----------
it going


---------00:27----------
good um so and and what do i call you


---------00:31----------
friend


---------00:33----------
whatever you want arcadium uh arcade


---------00:36----------
if you like pronounced arcade but don't


---------00:39----------
worry


---------00:39----------
i there is there is a 16 long copy pasta


---------00:43----------
how many different ways people have said


---------00:44----------
the name so it's fine so


---------00:46----------
jeremy or arcadium yeah that's fine cool


---------00:49----------
man better


---------00:50----------
and and thanks for coming on so much


---------00:51----------
thanks for being supportive


---------00:53----------
of us and everything um is there


---------00:55----------
something in particular


---------00:57----------
is is it okay if i call you jeremy is


---------00:59----------
that cool yeah that's fine


---------01:00----------
okay um so jeremy can you tell me a


---------01:03----------
little bit about what you want to talk


---------01:05----------
about today if there's anything that we


---------01:06----------
can help you with


---------01:08----------
uh well i think the biggest thing um


---------01:12----------
is uh kind of like a i guess


---------01:15----------
i guess it's a dual like pronged thing


---------01:19----------
because the first thing is i deal with a


---------01:20----------
lot of uh imposter syndrome stuff


---------01:23----------
okay and i didn't even know i didn't


---------01:24----------
even know what that was called


---------01:26----------
until then uh and like until like


---------01:30----------
i don't know like eight months ago or


---------01:32----------
something like that i didn't even know


---------01:33----------
that term existed or even


---------01:36----------
and uh the other thing was


---------01:40----------
how


---------01:44----------
i guess in in addition to that um


---------01:48----------
to deal with the the burden of


---------01:49----------
responsibility that has just grown


---------01:52----------
larger and larger what is that


---------01:57----------
can you tell me what what burden you're


---------01:58----------
talking about


---------02:00----------
well specifically um i've always been in


---------02:02----------
a position of


---------02:04----------
pseudo leadership because uh dungeon


---------02:06----------
master is the arbitrator of the game


---------02:09----------
and gets everybody together and arranges


---------02:12----------
everything


---------02:13----------
but i don't know over the past three


---------02:15----------
months


---------02:17----------
the uh the weight


---------02:20----------
of all the additional stuff on top of


---------02:22----------
that has just been weighing on me a lot


---------02:24----------
well what's can you help us understand


---------02:26----------
what additional stuff has been weighing


---------02:28----------
on


---------02:28----------
okay i'm gonna try and


---------02:32----------
put this in a way that i can explain


---------02:34----------
what i'm going through


---------02:36----------
so essentially


---------02:40----------
i judge a master for nine different


---------02:43----------
groups right now


---------02:44----------
wow uh i know it's uh roughly about 40


---------02:48----------
people


---------02:48----------
if you count the guest stars and then


---------02:51----------
there is


---------02:51----------
all the people in my discord which when


---------02:53----------
i you know got my channel started


---------02:56----------
i wanted to run an mmo like d d sort of


---------03:00----------
mud thing in my in my discord like to


---------03:02----------
thank the subs and for the stuff that


---------03:04----------
sounds


---------03:05----------
awesome man that's pretty sick but uh


---------03:08----------
the problem is is that um


---------03:09----------
i i am a dungeon master not like a


---------03:12----------
administrator


---------03:13----------
and all these other skill sets i don't


---------03:15----------
actually have so i had to like learn


---------03:17----------
those on the fly


---------03:19----------
and of course i wanted to do it right


---------03:21----------
and i wanted to do it well


---------03:23----------
so i had to learn a bunch of stuff that


---------03:24----------
i wasn't really ready to learn and i


---------03:25----------
made


---------03:26----------
you know mistakes along the way but it


---------03:29----------
got to the point now


---------03:30----------
to where it's uh


---------03:34----------
not only has my actual twitch growth


---------03:38----------
gotten to this point to where there's a


---------03:39----------
lot of people depending on me for their


---------03:41----------
entertainment but


---------03:43----------
it's it's somehow increased even more


---------03:46----------
because


---------03:46----------
the players that i have many of them


---------03:49----------
don't stream the games


---------03:51----------
that we play they depend on me for


---------03:55----------
their own release their own freedom from


---------03:59----------
from their daily routine you know to


---------04:02----------
play and to


---------04:03----------
have fun but because they get so into it


---------04:06----------
their communities do too and then they


---------04:08----------
follow them and then


---------04:10----------
it's that pressure has just kept


---------04:12----------
building and building


---------04:14----------
and building on top of it and um


---------04:17----------
i'm not afraid of a little hard work the


---------04:19----------
military put that in me but


---------04:21----------
the the problem i think is is that i


---------04:23----------
don't know there's just


---------04:25----------
this voice in my head telling me i'm not


---------04:27----------
doing good enough


---------04:29----------
i guess how long does that


---------04:33----------
yes so beautifully put so first thing i


---------04:36----------
want to say jeremy is it's an


---------04:37----------
absolute pleasure to talk to it dungeon


---------04:39----------
master


---------04:40----------
explain what their experience is because


---------04:43----------
even your storytelling


---------04:45----------
you know your brain is wired to tell a


---------04:48----------
beautiful story


---------04:49----------
yeah you take a couple seconds to think


---------04:52----------
about how you're gonna start and how


---------04:53----------
you're gonna finish


---------04:55----------
um it's unfortunate that the story is


---------04:56----------
you know one of


---------04:58----------
of burden and and happiness


---------05:01----------
i i guess i i do want to be clear i'm


---------05:03----------
not


---------05:04----------
ungrateful for anything or or even that


---------05:07----------
it's a really a bad


---------05:08----------
thing you know i i mean i i don't really


---------05:10----------
view it negatively in


---------05:11----------
its entirety because it it like you were


---------05:14----------
mentioning something earlier uh


---------05:16----------
on your intro um uh the the


---------05:19----------
it was a hinduism term that you said


---------05:22----------
yeah uh i


---------05:23----------
i know that as ikigai from the japanese


---------05:26----------
term


---------05:27----------
which is essentially i think similar to


---------05:28----------
what that means


---------05:30----------
which is you know what you can get paid


---------05:32----------
for what you're good at


---------05:33----------
what serves the world and what gives you


---------05:35----------
inner peace you find that


---------05:37----------
and that's what your purpose in life is


---------05:40----------
and i was fortunate enough


---------05:41----------
to find that when i was 13 years old


---------05:45----------
so i've been doing the i knew exactly


---------05:47----------
what i wanted to be


---------05:48----------
right when that happened can you tell us


---------05:51----------
about that


---------05:52----------
yeah sure um so i guess


---------05:56----------
this has a little bit of extra context


---------05:58----------
to it um


---------06:00----------
i'm not sure how heavy we want to get


---------06:01----------
but suffice to say i grew up


---------06:03----------
in the deep south in a uh


---------06:08----------
in a place that was not tolerant of


---------06:11----------
anything


---------06:12----------
it didn't matter what it was it you know


---------06:14----------
d and d least of all


---------06:16----------
and um i uh


---------06:19----------
specifically at the time i was living in


---------06:22----------
a literal junkyard


---------06:23----------
in a trailer with tainted well water and


---------06:26----------
you know


---------06:27----------
in my opinion uh problems that


---------06:30----------
any american should be living in with


---------06:32----------
our wealth level but that's a whole


---------06:34----------
other thing


---------06:35----------
um but that's what i had to grow up with


---------06:38----------
so when i made some friends finally um


---------06:42----------
i would go to their house and i would


---------06:44----------
try to go there as much as possible


---------06:46----------
because


---------06:47----------
there was peace there and uh


---------06:51----------
and i never could find it for myself


---------06:53----------
when i uh you know when i inevitably


---------06:55----------
had to go back to my house


---------06:58----------
so while i was there one day we were


---------07:01----------
summer and we're just kind of laying


---------07:02----------
around doing nothing


---------07:04----------
my my best friend's dad came in


---------07:07----------
saw us kind of laying around i said all


---------07:09----------
right i'm going to teach you guys


---------07:10----------
something


---------07:11----------
and he sat us down and he taught me


---------07:13----------
second edition d


---------07:15----------
i cut my teeth on on a d and d yeah fake


---------07:18----------
o


---------07:18----------
all of it and uh after the first session


---------07:21----------
i knew it's exactly what i wanted to do


---------07:22----------
with the rest of my life


---------07:24----------
i didn't have a single doubt in my head


---------07:26----------
about it i knew that


---------07:28----------
this is what i want to do what was it


---------07:30----------
about a d and d that


---------07:32----------
resonated with you so deeply i was less


---------07:35----------
about what the system did it was


---------07:38----------
it was there was this one moment when i


---------07:41----------
forgot


---------07:42----------
who i was


---------07:45----------
but then i remembered what i did


---------07:48----------
and then it became a part of me and i


---------07:51----------
could


---------07:52----------
switch i could basically i guess dodge


---------07:56----------
the pain that i was feeling but in a way


---------07:59----------
that didn't feel like it was destructive


---------08:02----------
so so i guess


---------08:07----------
i guess uh i guess it was more like it


---------08:10----------
saved my life because i mean


---------08:12----------
it it gave me from that point forward


---------08:14----------
that's all i concentrated on


---------08:15----------
i didn't care about anything else it my


---------08:19----------
my my parents would be fighting tooth


---------08:21----------
and nail


---------08:22----------
in the middle of the kitchen breaking


---------08:24----------
stuff my sister would be crying and all


---------08:25----------
i could think about was dragons


---------08:28----------
it was what i needed and then eventually


---------08:31----------
you know i got through that


---------08:32----------
i joined the military i was taught how


---------08:35----------
to be a good person


---------08:36----------
and then after that i just went full


---------08:39----------
full force into it


---------08:40----------
how did you decide to join the military


---------08:43----------
i


---------08:43----------
escaped so 80 percent


---------08:47----------
escape 20 romanticized uh


---------08:51----------
like viewpoint of what the military is


---------08:54----------
which is you know everybody is rewarded


---------08:56----------
for their merits everyone acts right


---------08:58----------
everyone does the right thing because


---------08:59----------
it's the right thing you know


---------09:01----------
i of course was taught the truth that


---------09:04----------
since people are involved there will


---------09:06----------
always be all the things that make


---------09:08----------
people you know awful but for the most


---------09:11----------
part


---------09:12----------
the military was one of the best


---------09:13----------
decisions i ever made it taught me to be


---------09:15----------
an adult


---------09:16----------
because i certainly didn't learn from my


---------09:17----------
parents and more importantly i think


---------09:20----------
than anything else


---------09:21----------
it taught me the value of hard work


---------09:23----------
because until that point


---------09:25----------
i was taught um never work hard


---------09:29----------
steal if you can take from others


---------09:32----------
because they're suckers


---------09:36----------
and you can you can trick people


---------09:40----------
and uh i was taught how to do it and i


---------09:43----------
learned how to do it because i watched


---------09:44----------
what my parents would do


---------09:45----------
and why i watched what my family would


---------09:47----------
do and the people around me


---------09:49----------
i grew up in places where people made


---------09:50----------
excuses


---------09:52----------
rather than results you know things like


---------09:55----------
that


---------09:57----------
the military taught me that you can't


---------09:59----------
make an excuse


---------10:01----------
whenever you have a battle brother or


---------10:03----------
sister on the line


---------10:06----------
you know and i and i signed up during a


---------10:08----------
time the time of war so


---------10:09----------
i had to sit in a room look at a piece


---------10:11----------
of paper


---------10:12----------
and understand that if i signed it they


---------10:15----------
could imprison me for my incompetence


---------10:17----------
and kill me for my cowardice


---------10:20----------
and i took that seriously and after my


---------10:24----------
service was done


---------10:26----------
i was a i was a better person for it


---------10:29----------
wow yeah


---------10:34----------
if this is any indication of of your


---------10:36----------
storytelling capabilities you must make


---------10:38----------
one hell of it dungeon master


---------10:41----------
sorry no that's beautiful


---------10:44----------
it's quite it's quite the story man it's


---------10:47----------
yeah


---------10:47----------
you know i i'd want to call it beautiful


---------10:50----------
but it sounds like it's


---------10:51----------
it's got ugly pieces here and there to


---------10:53----------
be sure um


---------10:57----------
i i think i think a flaw in something is


---------10:59----------
what makes it beautiful too


---------11:01----------
you know nothing's perfect do you


---------11:04----------
remember


---------11:05----------
how you felt growing up with mom and dad


---------11:09----------
fighting


---------11:09----------
in one room with your sister crying


---------11:21----------
i have a lot of pieces of myself


---------11:24----------
that i've had to fight against i think


---------11:27----------
uh


---------11:29----------
i think probably the most intense one


---------11:33----------
is uh is this rage that started growing


---------11:36----------
in me


---------11:38----------
because like i said i grew up i grew up


---------11:39----------
around a lot of prejudice


---------11:41----------
i knew what a wizard was before d and d


---------11:44----------
if you understand what i mean by that


---------11:46----------
and uh


---------11:48----------
and i i was taught awful things


---------11:52----------
things that i know now aren't true


---------11:55----------
but i that's that's what like


---------12:00----------
it was when it's ingrained into your


---------12:02----------
head when you're a child


---------12:04----------
and you ex of course your elders and the


---------12:07----------
people


---------12:08----------
that love you you're you're you what


---------12:11----------
else do you have to go off of


---------12:13----------
you know you get taught those things and


---------12:15----------
then they become reality and it gets


---------12:17----------
really hard to change that and


---------12:18----------
i i think the reason that i chan i turn


---------12:21----------
that corner


---------12:22----------
you know at least racism-wise was the


---------12:25----------
first


---------12:26----------
actual person who didn't look like me


---------12:28----------
that i met


---------12:29----------
was nothing like i was told he was a


---------12:32----------
punk skater


---------12:33----------
he wore like uh punk music t-shirts


---------12:36----------
his name was tj and he did sweet kick


---------12:38----------
flips


---------12:40----------
that's it he's completely different he


---------12:43----------
was so cool man


---------12:44----------
i want to do kick flips so i changed


---------12:48----------
everything


---------12:48----------
so that's one of those what is the rage


---------12:51----------
tell me i don't see racism


---------12:53----------
sorry sorry sorry sorry that that was an


---------12:55----------
example of


---------12:57----------
because when i found out that i had been


---------12:59----------
lied to


---------13:01----------
that's when it started from that lie


---------13:04----------
because i uh


---------13:05----------
i didn't really have a childhood i grew


---------13:06----------
up really fast um


---------13:08----------
i know i wasn't really able to be naive


---------13:11----------
i think


---------13:13----------
uh it started with that that i knew that


---------13:17----------
people were lying to me and trying to


---------13:20----------
figure out who was lying to me made me


---------13:23----------
suspicious i think


---------13:25----------
and then when i actually started and


---------13:28----------
because i had that suspicion


---------13:30----------
you know my mother and father were no


---------13:31----------
longer


---------13:33----------
the um the bearers of truth and my


---------13:36----------
extended family


---------13:37----------
you know pillars of wisdom they were all


---------13:40----------
just


---------13:41----------
liars and cowards and i started seeing


---------13:44----------
it for what it was


---------13:46----------
i would see how my father in one hand


---------13:49----------
would tell me


---------13:50----------
uh you're doing a great job but then


---------13:52----------
would have such little faith


---------13:54----------
that i was going to perform the simplest


---------13:55----------
of tasks right that he would send my


---------13:58----------
little sister in to make sure i was


---------13:59----------
doing it right


---------14:01----------
he just destroyed my confidence


---------14:03----------
constantly


---------14:05----------
you know just one thing there that's


---------14:07----------
just an example and


---------14:08----------
all those little things kept piling up


---------14:10----------
and then the big things or my my


---------14:12----------
parents kept splitting up and um and i


---------14:14----------
was


---------14:15----------
forced to see violence i've had


---------14:17----------
everything happen to me


---------14:19----------
that most people have had happen to them


---------14:22----------
in some way all forms of


---------14:23----------
abuse all of them so


---------14:28----------
and i guess when i finally found


---------14:32----------
uh d and d i found that there is a place


---------14:35----------
where i can make things


---------14:37----------
the way i wanted them to be and that i


---------14:40----------
could bring joy to people through it


---------14:43----------
and it gave me a weapon a weapon i could


---------14:46----------
use against


---------14:47----------
the darkness so to speak and that's uh


---------14:51----------
that's what it did and now we get to the


---------14:54----------
burden of responsibility


---------14:56----------
yeah so what's the responsibility you


---------15:00----------
bear


---------15:00----------
jeremy


---------15:05----------
through the course of my career people


---------15:07----------
come to me


---------15:08----------
because they seek sanctuary like i did


---------15:11----------
all those years ago


---------15:14----------
whether it be uh


---------15:17----------
whether it just be to have some fun to


---------15:19----------
blow off some steam from work


---------15:21----------
or because they're trans and they want


---------15:23----------
to be the gender they want to be


---------15:24----------
and for a couple hours i can make it


---------15:28----------
true


---------15:30----------
or they can be strong and fast


---------15:34----------
smart and wise charismatic


---------15:37----------
pretty doesn't matter


---------15:41----------
i can make it true for a couple hours


---------15:47----------
and i take it seriously


---------15:52----------
even though in the end it's just a game


---------15:56----------
uh to me it's it's more than that it's a


---------16:02----------
it's a weapon against despair


---------16:06----------
which is why i have which is why i have


---------16:08----------
that dichotomy in my storytelling i


---------16:10----------
think


---------16:11----------
which dichotomy hope and despair


---------16:17----------
you said that you learned about this


---------16:18----------
term imposter syndrome recently


---------16:21----------
yeah uh specifically like uh i wanted i


---------16:24----------
think it was eight months ago


---------16:26----------
um but it was devin nash talked about it


---------16:29----------
and i was wondering what does that mean


---------16:31----------
and then i looked at i was like yeah


---------16:32----------
okay


---------16:33----------
and so that's me what features of


---------16:35----------
imposter syndrome


---------16:37----------
do you think apply to you or do you do


---------16:40----------
you identify with


---------16:42----------
well i don't even know if i have it but


---------16:44----------
this is this is what happens


---------16:46----------
to me is that i'll do something good and


---------16:49----------
then i cannot see


---------16:51----------
the success that i have even now like


---------16:54----------
the the level that i'm at right now i


---------16:56----------
don't even see it


---------16:58----------
because all i all i all i hear is that


---------17:01----------
whisper in the back of my head that it's


---------17:04----------
uh


---------17:07----------
not good enough and when i was in the


---------17:09----------
military i


---------17:10----------
i tried to cut out guilt completely out


---------17:13----------
of me


---------17:14----------
to combat it combat that voice but i


---------17:16----------
went too far in the other direction i


---------17:18----------
became a terrible person for it


---------17:20----------
i didn't care about anybody i just did


---------17:23----------
horrible things and i didn't feel any


---------17:24----------
guilt at all


---------17:26----------
and because i like forced it out of my


---------17:29----------
out of myself because i just didn't want


---------17:30----------
to feel guilty for doing the right thing


---------17:32----------
because i didn't do enough but that was


---------17:34----------
too far and


---------17:35----------
then i pulled back on and then i found a


---------17:37----------
decent balance


---------17:38----------
i think but now i think that that


---------17:42----------
the force multiplier of the size


---------17:46----------
of the weight is just


---------17:52----------
yeah makes the void like if the voice is


---------17:55----------
a percentage


---------17:56----------
of who i am because of the burden's


---------17:59----------
weight


---------18:00----------
the voice is louder now because it's


---------18:03----------
bigger i suppose can i think for a


---------18:07----------
second


---------18:08----------
yeah go ahead buddy


---------18:24----------
so jeremy we've got a fork in the road


---------18:27----------
yeah okay


---------18:29----------
and so you get to pick so one is i can


---------18:32----------
explain


---------18:35----------
the stats of the imposter syndrome


---------18:39----------
class and how does imposter syndrome


---------18:41----------
work how can we understand the mechanics


---------18:43----------
of it


---------18:44----------
it's going to be not an individual


---------18:47----------
character it's going to be a set of


---------18:48----------
rules in a rule book it's not


---------18:50----------
it may apply to you it may not it's just


---------18:52----------
the the diagram


---------18:54----------
of what imposter syndrome is and how it


---------18:56----------
feels and where it comes from


---------18:59----------
okay the other fork in the road is to


---------19:01----------
actually build a character which is you


---------19:03----------
right is to take this principle and we


---------19:05----------
don't have to do


---------19:06----------
but we don't have to do one or the other


---------19:07----------
it can be both i guess it's an


---------19:09----------
issue of sequence potentially but we can


---------19:11----------
ask you


---------19:12----------
more questions about you know the way


---------19:15----------
that you've managed guilt the way you've


---------19:16----------
dealt with your feelings


---------19:18----------
this sort of sense of burden of


---------19:19----------
responsibility we can we can talk about


---------19:21----------
you in a more specific sense


---------19:24----------
and in short i you know i think i i


---------19:28----------
already have a a decent hypothesis about


---------19:31----------
you know where a lot of your struggles


---------19:32----------
come from um


---------19:34----------
and we can kind of go more specifically


---------19:36----------
about you so do we want to explore the


---------19:38----------
character that is


---------19:40----------
jeremy or do we want to talk about the


---------19:42----------
class


---------19:43----------
imposter syndrome i mean you're the


---------19:47----------
you're the boss here which do you think


---------19:49----------
is better i'm the dm


---------19:51----------
but you're the pc so you get to choose


---------19:53----------
okay


---------19:55----------
uh finally get to play yes


---------20:00----------
um i guess


---------20:05----------
the second one okay so tell me


---------20:08----------
um tell me what uh


---------20:13----------
let me just try to find my question


---------20:16----------
because you gotta know the character


---------20:18----------
before you choose the class yeah


---------20:20----------
so you said that you tried to


---------20:24----------
cut guilt out yeah


---------20:27----------
right and and now what is it


---------20:31----------
you feel guilty or that you're not


---------20:34----------
good enough or you're gonna let people


---------20:35----------
down or what


---------20:38----------
well i suppose now because i because


---------20:41----------
cutting it out


---------20:41----------
completely wasn't the right call at all


---------20:45----------
now it's um


---------20:48----------
since the stakes are so high and since


---------20:51----------
i've


---------20:52----------
pulled off things that a lot of people


---------20:53----------
can't even believe


---------20:55----------
that someone can do there's now this uh


---------20:58----------
this


---------20:59----------
this rising bar of expectation


---------21:02----------
where i can't falter at all i can't make


---------21:04----------
mistakes


---------21:06----------
because if i do then


---------21:09----------
faith turns on its heel and


---------21:12----------
from my experience early in my career i


---------21:14----------
can see how quickly that


---------21:16----------
that faith can turn to just


---------21:19----------
distrust and just some awful stuff so


---------21:22----------
what do you mean by that


---------21:24----------
well like uh


---------21:28----------
i have an example here so uh in the


---------21:30----------
early days


---------21:31----------
of my career before i went professional


---------21:33----------
like i started charging


---------21:34----------
i did a couple of side campaigns and one


---------21:36----------
of the side campaigns i


---------21:38----------
uh told people that i would try to


---------21:39----------
prepare everything for them and so


---------21:42----------
because i told them that hey don't worry


---------21:44----------
about it i'll do this


---------21:45----------
they just tried to challenge me because


---------21:47----------
they just started doing random stuff


---------21:49----------
and then it got to the point to where i


---------21:50----------
just


---------21:52----------
i just couldn't keep up because they


---------21:54----------
would literally try to make me wrong


---------21:58----------
and so whenever the time came that one


---------22:00----------
of them did something


---------22:02----------
and i didn't have it ready for them they


---------22:04----------
said i knew you couldn't do it


---------22:07----------
and then i felt like i failed them even


---------22:08----------
though now i know that that person's


---------22:10----------
that person's just an [ __ ] but now i


---------22:13----------
know that it's


---------22:14----------
yeah i only know that now then i felt


---------22:16----------
like i let him down


---------22:17----------
okay completely so i understand we just


---------22:19----------
got a rate from


---------22:21----------
anita so um


---------22:24----------
i'm just gonna include people in so you


---------22:26----------
want to introduce yourself jeremy to


---------22:28----------
the yeah sure sure hello i am arcadium i


---------22:31----------
am a


---------22:32----------
professional dungeon master on twitch.tv


---------22:35----------
uh


---------22:37----------
i like you wow


---------22:41----------
yeah that's all so uh well welcome guys


---------22:44----------
um so we're big fans of anita


---------22:46----------
here at healthy gamer i'm dr k so we're


---------22:48----------
talking to arcadium today about


---------22:50----------
um sort of hi so as he's grown more


---------22:52----------
successful he feels some


---------22:54----------
sense of like imposter syndrome which is


---------22:56----------
that despite


---------22:58----------
the world telling him that he's doing a


---------23:00----------
good job


---------23:01----------
the more the world tells him that he's


---------23:03----------
doing a good job


---------23:04----------
the stronger the voice in his head


---------23:07----------
becomes


---------23:08----------
that it's all going to come crashing


---------23:09----------
down or that there's something that


---------23:11----------
people don't understand or things like


---------23:12----------
that


---------23:13----------
um i mean i know you haven't sort of


---------23:15----------
said that explicitly but that's


---------23:17----------
i'm basing that pretty much it i'm


---------23:19----------
basing that on the the class description


---------23:22----------
yeah yeah um so i want to just highlight


---------23:25----------
what you just said


---------23:26----------
jeremy because you kind of said that you


---------23:27----------
know you told people hey i'm going to


---------23:29----------
take care of everything and then they


---------23:30----------
set on a quest to prove you wrong


---------23:32----------
and they're going to do that right yeah


---------23:34----------
yeah and then


---------23:36----------
there's the statement that they said i


---------23:38----------
know you couldn't


---------23:39----------
do it yeah


---------23:43----------
how does that statement relate to the


---------23:45----------
voice in your head that you would


---------23:47----------
describe as imposter syndrome


---------23:50----------
well


---------23:54----------
i suppose what i what i what i would


---------23:56----------
equate to that is um


---------23:58----------
they said they knew that they couldn't


---------23:59----------
do it now i know why that person said


---------24:01----------
that now


---------24:02----------
and yeah more often because you know all


---------24:04----------
that but i guess at the in that moment


---------24:06----------
i just heard my dad i think more than


---------24:09----------
anything else


---------24:10----------
because you know he would tell me i


---------24:13----------
could do anything


---------24:14----------
and then not have any faith in me at all


---------24:16----------
that i would


---------24:18----------
uh in the same breath so i'm glad you


---------24:20----------
made that connection


---------24:21----------
because beautiful um right because i i'm


---------24:25----------
i'm envisioning that story where


---------24:27----------
you know your dad would tell you to do


---------24:28----------
something and he would send your sister


---------24:30----------
with you because


---------24:30----------
he sort of yeah and and so


---------24:34----------
when we think about you know and now if


---------24:36----------
we sort of start to connect the dots and


---------24:38----------
we think a little bit


---------24:39----------
about imposter syndrome like


---------24:42----------
what you know you so despite your


---------24:45----------
success and despite


---------24:48----------
you you being aware that you can do it


---------24:51----------
there lives within you a voice that


---------24:54----------
tells you


---------24:56----------
that you can't so then the question


---------24:58----------
becomes if we want to understand the


---------25:00----------
voices inside us right because like this


---------25:02----------
is the thing is that


---------25:04----------
we live our lives and we're like


---------25:06----------
hopefully functioning adults or even if


---------25:08----------
we're not really functioning adults


---------25:10----------
it doesn't really matter we know we're


---------25:12----------
capable of some things we have evidence


---------25:13----------
that we're capable of some things


---------25:15----------
and there are voices that we carry with


---------25:17----------
us


---------25:19----------
and so if you want to overcome that


---------25:20----------
voice that you carry with you


---------25:23----------
i think the biggest thing to understand


---------25:25----------
is to understand like we know where did


---------25:26----------
you learn that


---------25:28----------
and to understand it it's interesting


---------25:31----------
jeremy because you say that


---------25:32----------
now looking back on it you can


---------25:34----------
understand even though


---------25:35----------
you know you felt bad in that moment you


---------25:37----------
recognize that that was his problem


---------25:38----------
that's not yours


---------25:40----------
if he sets out to you know screw you


---------25:42----------
over when you're


---------25:43----------
dming a campaign like he'll he'll make


---------25:46----------
people not have fun


---------25:48----------
right like pcs can do that no matter how


---------25:51----------
strong you are as a dungeon master


---------25:53----------
an [ __ ] pc can ruin a game for you if


---------25:56----------
they really want to


---------25:57----------
yeah um and and so i think


---------26:00----------
you know it's interesting because you


---------26:01----------
say that you tried to cut out guilt and


---------26:03----------
i think that


---------26:04----------
you sort of formed a very strong version


---------26:07----------
of yourself


---------26:08----------
through the military you learned a lot


---------26:10----------
about yourself you learned a lot about


---------26:11----------
how to be a good person but you know


---------26:14----------
despite


---------26:17----------
all of that growth like wounds still


---------26:20----------
need to be healed


---------26:21----------
you know if if i'm sitting at half


---------26:23----------
health and i level up and i


---------26:25----------
gain eight hit points and then i level


---------26:27----------
up again and i gain eight hit points


---------26:29----------
it doesn't matter like that damage is


---------26:30----------
still there and the damage has to be


---------26:32----------
healed


---------26:33----------
and what i hear is a guy who was running


---------26:35----------
around at half health who's been


---------26:37----------
leveling up a lot


---------26:38----------
but at the end of the day never healed


---------26:40----------
that


---------26:41----------
initial wound yeah


---------26:44----------
and so i think the the issue is going to


---------26:46----------
be like


---------26:48----------
you know when you feel like you can't do


---------26:50----------
it


---------26:51----------
is that your dad's voice


---------26:54----------
is it yours


---------27:07----------
i suppose i uh my father's a part of me


---------27:10----------
whether i want it or not so it's


---------27:13----------
probably mine


---------27:17----------
and so what do you tell yourself


---------27:21----------
well what i've been doing lately to deal


---------27:25----------
with it


---------27:26----------
and it's probably not healthy but it's


---------27:28----------
the only thing that


---------27:30----------
that uh seems to quiet it


---------27:33----------
is that uh each time


---------27:36----------
i hit a point it'll say you can't do


---------27:38----------
better i'll do better


---------27:41----------
and then it's quiet for a while and then


---------27:42----------
it comes back and it's quiet for a while


---------27:45----------
just keep


---------27:46----------
hitting it down now i guess it helps


---------27:49----------
because i keep


---------27:50----------
doing better i don't know it's it's


---------27:52----------
really it's really strange to put it


---------27:54----------
into words


---------27:54----------
um it's almost like uh


---------27:59----------
i've got like a shadow in my mind a


---------28:01----------
demon if you will


---------28:02----------
and i live a good life out of spite of


---------28:05----------
it


---------28:06----------
just despite it yep you know so it's


---------28:10----------
i don't know it doesn't really come from


---------28:11----------
i guess in that particular instance it


---------28:13----------
doesn't come from like a place of


---------28:15----------
love and understanding and compassion as


---------28:17----------
i would like it to be it's just


---------28:19----------
from spite competitiveness i guess


---------28:23----------
yeah so now we come to another feature


---------28:25----------
of the character class of imposter


---------28:27----------
syndrome


---------28:28----------
which is that it's actually adaptive


---------28:30----------
towards success


---------28:32----------
so it actually even though it tortures


---------28:34----------
us


---------28:35----------
from an objective level it actually


---------28:38----------
helps us succeed


---------28:39----------
so i see imposter syndrome a lot like a


---------28:41----------
good example is in the investment


---------28:43----------
banking field


---------28:44----------
you get you know 22 year olds who end up


---------28:46----------
at goldman sachs they move to new york


---------28:48----------
and they live the life of a banker


---------28:51----------
and you know at the age of 22 they're


---------28:53----------
making 250k


---------28:55----------
and then suddenly it's like from


---------28:59----------
no money to 250k a year can feel like


---------29:03----------
and then the imposter syndrome hits and


---------29:05----------
it tells them


---------29:06----------
you can't do better look at this other


---------29:08----------
person he's doing better than you


---------29:10----------
you're fake you know people haven't


---------29:13----------
realized


---------29:14----------
and then they they do exactly what you


---------29:15----------
did which is they fight the voice and


---------29:17----------
they try to overcome it


---------29:19----------
and it does quiet it for a while and it


---------29:21----------
certainly improves you


---------29:22----------
right like like you you grow in


---------29:24----------
objective success


---------29:26----------
but then the voice comes back so here's


---------29:28----------
the question when when the voice says


---------29:30----------
you can't do better why do you have to


---------29:33----------
prove it wrong


---------29:40----------
i suppose um


---------29:45----------
the reason that i i do that specifically


---------29:49----------
the reason that i have to prove it wrong


---------29:51----------
is because


---------29:52----------
i'll start to believe it


---------29:55----------
because then it says other things like


---------29:59----------
like uh you don't deserve what you have


---------30:03----------
and that you lied to get there and that


---------30:05----------
you did this and that


---------30:08----------
because um that's something else that my


---------30:10----------
dad did


---------30:11----------
is that anytime he would get into an


---------30:14----------
argument


---------30:16----------
he he was not satisfied


---------30:20----------
with understanding or even victory he


---------30:23----------
would only accept


---------30:26----------
absolute victory and even then


---------30:29----------
he would not be satisfied like he would


---------30:32----------
win an argument with my mother and then


---------30:34----------
just


---------30:35----------
drill her into the ground afterwards


---------30:38----------
because he won he was right it was


---------30:42----------
it was awful and for the longest time


---------30:46----------
you know i i would uh


---------30:50----------
equate that like especially growing up i


---------30:54----------
i would equate that that is the only way


---------30:56----------
that


---------30:57----------
a winner is decided is if absolute


---------31:00----------
defeat


---------31:00----------
victory and it wasn't until you know i


---------31:02----------
got old enough


---------31:04----------
to realize that that was just the lie


---------31:06----------
that that wasn't true


---------31:08----------
but you know at that point it was taught


---------31:11----------
into my like core functions


---------31:13----------
so it's really hard to resist it


---------31:17----------
you know so jeremy let me ask you


---------31:19----------
something when you


---------31:20----------
have the voice that tells you that you


---------31:22----------
can't do it


---------31:25----------
and you overcome that voice


---------31:29----------
and you succeed and you do better


---------31:32----------
which part of you is your dad


---------31:35----------
the voice or your response to the voice


---------31:40----------
probably the voice the crazy thing is i


---------31:44----------
think it's both


---------31:46----------
yeah right because what what do you do


---------31:48----------
with that voice


---------31:50----------
you try to crush it you try to prove it


---------31:53----------
wrong


---------31:54----------
you try to drive it into the ground to


---------31:56----------
prove to it


---------31:58----------
that that voice is wrong yeah


---------32:03----------
and so what you're doing is you're


---------32:04----------
cutting out a part of yourself there too


---------32:08----------
so here's the crazy thing like there's


---------32:11----------
there's a different perspective


---------32:12----------
and i think it's gonna be hard but like


---------32:14----------
just hear me out for a second


---------32:16----------
which is that you can't do it


---------32:21----------
or that you may not be able to do it it


---------32:24----------
like the whole problem here jeremy is


---------32:26----------
that it's like it's a battle where


---------32:27----------
absolute victory


---------32:29----------
is on either side and an absolute


---------32:32----------
victory against yourself is still a loss


---------32:34----------
for you


---------32:37----------
and like what you need to do is learn


---------32:38----------
how to be in the middle


---------32:41----------
to recognize for example that you may


---------32:44----------
not be able to do it


---------32:46----------
and that's okay because the thing that


---------32:48----------
i'm hearing that is completely foreign


---------32:50----------
to you


---------32:52----------
you understand victory and defeat you


---------32:54----------
understand triumph and lost


---------32:57----------
you don't understand forgiveness


---------33:00----------
for not running yeah


---------33:05----------
i suppose right it's weird so i mean


---------33:08----------
i suppose i suppose now you said that i


---------33:10----------
suppose there's a part of me that


---------33:11----------
believes that it doesn't exist


---------33:13----------
of course because you don't no one


---------33:14----------
taught you right so the military is


---------33:16----------
gonna teach you a lot of things


---------33:18----------
it's gonna teach you you know like


---------33:22----------
how to potentially like be disciplined


---------33:23----------
and and work hard and stuff like that


---------33:26----------
it's not gonna uh very few people i've


---------33:28----------
talked to in the military have learned


---------33:29----------
forgiveness from the military


---------33:31----------
and what i'm still hearing is a war


---------33:33----------
against yourself like the wars we fight


---------33:35----------
against themselves


---------33:35----------
ourselves are the ones that even if we


---------33:37----------
live we win we lose


---------33:40----------
and what i'm what i'm hearing is you


---------33:42----------
know you kind of say oh my god i'm


---------33:43----------
responsible for creating an escape for


---------33:45----------
so many people because


---------33:47----------
this was an escape for me and that's


---------33:49----------
where i'd say like i


---------33:50----------
i don't think i don't think you're i


---------33:52----------
mean i'm sure you understand this but


---------33:54----------
like


---------33:54----------
i i really encourage you to think about


---------33:56----------
it is that you can't create an escape


---------33:58----------
for someone else


---------34:00----------
right the whole point of d d is like you


---------34:02----------
guys have to create it together


---------34:05----------
and it's not you can't guarantee you


---------34:07----------
can't all the pain


---------34:08----------
that you experience growing up that dnd


---------34:11----------
helped you escape from


---------34:12----------
you want to give that opportunity to


---------34:14----------
other people awesome


---------34:16----------
but it is not as a human being you are


---------34:19----------
entitled to your actions but not the


---------34:21----------
fruits of your actions right


---------34:22----------
it's my choice whether i choose to swing


---------34:24----------
my sword


---------34:25----------
it's not my choice whether i critical


---------34:27----------
hit critical fail or hit


---------34:29----------
that's determined by the dice and the


---------34:31----------
problem here


---------34:32----------
is that the burden of responsibility


---------34:34----------
that you bear


---------34:36----------
you don't accept that like all you get


---------34:38----------
to control is whether you roll the dice


---------34:40----------
what you're putting on your shoulders


---------34:41----------
is the burden of what the role is


---------34:43----------
actually going to be


---------34:45----------
you're saying i want to create this


---------34:47----------
thing to take away people's pain and


---------34:49----------
that's why you work so hard


---------34:51----------
that's awesome but then you beat


---------34:53----------
yourself up if


---------34:54----------
for some reason you feel like it's not


---------34:56----------
working or it's not good enough


---------34:59----------
like your job as a dungeon master is to


---------35:01----------
create an opportunity for other people


---------35:03----------
to come and escape if they want to


---------35:05----------
but you don't get to actually control


---------35:07----------
like whether that escape happens or not


---------35:10----------
but you accept that for yourself you


---------35:12----------
take that responsibility so oddly enough


---------35:14----------
i think i think you the burden of


---------35:16----------
responsibility that you take


---------35:17----------
is not actually yours to bear


---------35:24----------
i could see that


---------35:27----------
i just it's a harder thing for me to


---------35:31----------
accept i suppose because


---------35:33----------
as i've gotten better at it


---------35:36----------
i have been able to do it


---------35:40----------
and if you can help somebody


---------35:45----------
then you should sure at least i i feel


---------35:48----------
at least so yeah so so jeremy i


---------35:52----------
i can see that you're not quite buying


---------35:54----------
what i'm selling so that's


---------35:56----------
so let me explain it in a slightly


---------35:58----------
different way and then i think we have


---------35:59----------
to get to the


---------36:00----------
emotional underpinnings so you're saying


---------36:02----------
that but i have been able to do it


---------36:04----------
you're damn right so as you level up


---------36:06----------
right your thakko gets better


---------36:11----------
and like the more you level up the more


---------36:14----------
fact your thakko gets better and the


---------36:16----------
better your thakko gets the more hits


---------36:18----------
you see


---------36:19----------
and yet at the same time even if you're


---------36:20----------
a level 20 fighter with a thaco of one


---------36:23----------
it doesn't mean that you're gonna hit


---------36:25----------
you still do not control


---------36:26----------
the dice no matter how hard how good you


---------36:29----------
get


---------36:31----------
yeah right so i but i think that that


---------36:34----------
somewhere along the way


---------36:36----------
you transitioned in your mind and i'd


---------36:38----------
encourage you to really pay attention to


---------36:40----------
it when did you start accepting


---------36:42----------
responsibility for how the dice was


---------36:44----------
actually going to roll


---------36:46----------
when did you cross the line between it's


---------36:48----------
my choice


---------36:50----------
whether i roll a dice to i have to hit


---------36:54----------
and i see this in medicine too because


---------36:56----------
the better doctors become


---------36:58----------
the more that they start to think that


---------36:59----------
like the more competent of a doctor


---------37:01----------
i become the more that i think that i


---------37:03----------
can hold death at bay


---------37:07----------
the more people that i save the more i


---------37:09----------
start to think like i can do this and


---------37:10----------
i'm i i'm stronger than that


---------37:14----------
because see how many times i've eaten it


---------37:18----------
and yet the more victories you have


---------37:22----------
and the more skillful you become the


---------37:23----------
more you level up you can't conquer that


---------37:26----------
you can create a place where people can


---------37:28----------
come to escape


---------37:30----------
but you can't give them escape


---------37:35----------
yeah i suppose and i mean and i know in


---------37:39----------
my


---------37:39----------
i guess my heart that that's true so i'm


---------37:42----------
not i don't disagree with it at all


---------37:43----------
i just i guess i lament that uh


---------37:48----------
that i can't do that good in its


---------37:51----------
entirety


---------37:52----------
yes and now we're getting someone so


---------37:55----------
why do you lament that jeremy


---------38:02----------
well


---------38:04----------
life is unfair and suffering and we're


---------38:05----------
given the strength to make it through


---------38:07----------
that


---------38:08----------
but others aren't as strong as me so i


---------38:11----------
can lend them some of mine


---------38:13----------
and i just do it through d and


---------38:17----------
i guess i see that if i get strong


---------38:19----------
enough then i can


---------38:21----------
remove more suffering


---------38:25----------
that way and that because i can do it i


---------38:27----------
should


---------38:28----------
and then if i can keep doing it then i


---------38:31----------
should


---------38:32----------
and i lament that i know that i am


---------38:35----------
doomed to fail


---------38:37----------
an absolute victory and i know that


---------38:40----------
yeah so can i tell you a story


---------38:44----------
yeah if you've studied eco guy you may


---------38:47----------
have heard this one before


---------38:48----------
so there's a monk that's um


---------38:52----------
sitting on the banks of a river and he


---------38:54----------
sees a scorpion


---------38:56----------
crawling around on the banks of the


---------38:57----------
river and the scorpion


---------39:01----------
falls into the river and starts to drown


---------39:04----------
and the monk


---------39:05----------
reaches over and he plucks the scorpion


---------39:07----------
out of the water and the scorpion stings


---------39:08----------
him he's like


---------39:10----------
and then he sets it you know on the bank


---------39:12----------
of the river


---------39:13----------
and then his disciples are kind of


---------39:15----------
watching nearby and then


---------39:17----------
after a little while scorpion wanders


---------39:18----------
back down to the river


---------39:20----------
and falls into the river again and the


---------39:22----------
scorpion picks it up and it stings him


---------39:24----------
he goes out


---------39:25----------
and he like puts it safely back and the


---------39:26----------
third time scorpion goes into the river


---------39:28----------
third time he plucks it out and a third


---------39:30----------
time he gets stung


---------39:32----------
and then one of his disciples is like


---------39:35----------
master


---------39:35----------
why do you keep on saving the scorpion


---------39:38----------
if it keeps on stinging you


---------39:40----------
and you know what the master says have


---------39:43----------
you heard this one before


---------39:47----------
i guess not i said all right i've i i've


---------39:51----------
go ahead it's so evident version of it


---------39:54----------
yeah so so the master says well


---------39:56----------
you know i keep doing it because it's in


---------39:58----------
my nature to save drowning animals it's


---------40:00----------
in the scorpions in nature to bite


---------40:02----------
to sting things that pick it up


---------40:07----------
and so i i think this is the kind of


---------40:08----------
thing where like you know i think your


---------40:10----------
problem jeremy is that you seek absolute


---------40:12----------
victory


---------40:13----------
right your problem is that you've shed a


---------40:15----------
lot of what you grew up with


---------40:18----------
but the need for absolute crushing


---------40:20----------
victory so that you never have to deal


---------40:21----------
with it again


---------40:22----------
is i mean this is just the nature of


---------40:25----------
things


---------40:26----------
you can give people a place to escape


---------40:29----------
and they're going to come


---------40:30----------
in and they're going to follow their


---------40:31----------
nature and you keep doing you


---------40:34----------
right it's not like i encourage you to


---------40:37----------
be like the monk and like


---------40:38----------
do what is your role to do do what is


---------40:40----------
your ika guy or your dharma


---------40:44----------
yeah and understand that


---------40:47----------
if you were expecting and like i think


---------40:49----------
what you need to learn is like


---------40:52----------
the satisfaction of or contentment of


---------40:55----------
rolling the dice


---------40:58----------
the satisfaction or contentment of


---------41:01----------
absolutely by all means


---------41:02----------
offer what you can to help other people


---------41:05----------
and give the most that you can


---------41:07----------
to improve other people's lives and if


---------41:09----------
you can do it should you do it


---------41:10----------
hell yeah buddy go for it


---------41:15----------
but don't for a second think that


---------41:17----------
because you try


---------41:19----------
you're going to succeed don't for a


---------41:21----------
second think that your success


---------41:23----------
is actually in your hands because it


---------41:25----------
isn't


---------41:26----------
your effort is in your hands


---------41:28----------
[Music]


---------41:30----------
do you bear a burden or do you bear a


---------41:32----------
burden absolutely but the burden that


---------41:33----------
you bear is not one of improving their


---------41:35----------
lives


---------41:36----------
it's one of creating a space where they


---------41:38----------
can where they can come to


---------41:43----------
because let me ask you this like who


---------41:44----------
bore the burden of responsibility for


---------41:46----------
your escape


---------41:49----------
when you were thirteen


---------41:52----------
my son said bob smith


---------41:57----------
yeah he taught me dnd


---------42:00----------
and he was hammered the whole time but i


---------42:03----------
gotta tell you it was


---------42:05----------
is the most honest like


---------42:08----------
he's just a good dad to his son and to


---------42:11----------
me


---------42:12----------
so that's probably has something to do


---------42:14----------
with it too


---------42:17----------
i think so connect those dots for us


---------42:20----------
what do you think it has to do with it


---------42:21----------
jeremy


---------42:25----------
i guess because whenever uh whenever


---------42:27----------
andy won with my


---------42:28----------
friend who's his son whenever he'd do


---------42:30----------
well


---------42:32----------
he'd pat his son on the back


---------42:36----------
and that would be it there'd be no uh


---------42:39----------
backhand so to speak and what happened


---------42:43----------
with you jeremy


---------42:53----------
i won and i didn't need anything else


---------42:56----------
i didn't even win i guess uh


---------43:01----------
i guess for once i i just i existed in


---------43:05----------
a state where it wasn't all extreme


---------43:08----------
and it wasn't all how am i gonna put it


---------43:11----------
um


---------43:14----------
i could speak instead of scream it's the


---------43:16----------
best way i can really put it


---------43:19----------
well set yeah


---------43:27----------
it's just fun man that too it was just


---------43:30----------
fun too


---------43:32----------
the most fun i'd ever have up to that


---------43:34----------
point


---------43:36----------
oh maybe it's just the right combination


---------43:39----------
you know


---------43:40----------
a good role model that didn't knock me


---------43:43----------
down when i


---------43:44----------
got stood up peaceful place


---------43:48----------
quieter nobody was angry


---------43:52----------
and i was around friends i guess


---------43:56----------
i thought about that a lot like like


---------43:58----------
what combination happened


---------44:01----------
i don't i don't know the answer to that


---------44:03----------
but


---------44:04----------
i'm thankful every day that it happened


---------44:07----------
and


---------44:08----------
so help me understand when you feel like


---------44:11----------
you're an imposter what kind of thoughts


---------44:13----------
go


---------44:13----------
through your head


---------44:30----------
visions of myself


---------44:37----------
either failing or misusing


---------44:41----------
the position that i have the power that


---------44:45----------
i have


---------44:45----------
i suppose or or or the responsibility or


---------44:48----------
or or


---------44:49----------
neglect just lots of those things


---------44:55----------
why do you fear that those things will


---------44:57----------
come to pass


---------45:04----------
i don't know uh


---------45:07----------
because i'm always i guess i'm always


---------45:09----------
thinking about it


---------45:11----------
like in the back of my head especially


---------45:13----------
when i go to sleep


---------45:14----------
that's i think that's where the


---------45:15----------
nightmares come from but


---------45:18----------
what do you mean nightmares oh i


---------45:21----------
nearly every night i just have


---------45:24----------
awful nightmares so i don't get a lot of


---------45:26----------
sleep


---------45:27----------
granted that's also been helpful because


---------45:30----------
some of my best monsters


---------45:32----------
i've made for dnd have come from that


---------45:33----------
but


---------45:35----------
can you share something with us


---------45:39----------
can you share something what have you


---------45:40----------
made from


---------45:42----------
literally the stuff of nightmares all


---------45:44----------
right here we go let me tell you


---------45:46----------
something


---------45:48----------
so one time uh i was i was i was


---------45:51----------
dreaming


---------45:52----------
that i was like in this warehouse and


---------45:55----------
like


---------45:56----------
faces were being like stitched onto my


---------45:58----------
arms and it was crazy


---------46:00----------
and it was so vivid and real and they


---------46:02----------
were like the faces of people that i


---------46:04----------
knew growing up


---------46:05----------
and then after that i woke up i


---------46:08----------
immediately started making the creature


---------46:10----------
and that's where i made


---------46:11----------
uh my first like uh like like


---------46:15----------
face stealing creature which i kind of


---------46:16----------
based on i looked up mythology of and it


---------46:18----------
exists in other places


---------46:20----------
and i really got together and started


---------46:21----------
tinkering with it a little bit


---------46:23----------
and then i unveiled it a year later


---------46:26----------
against the party and it was like one of


---------46:28----------
the coolest fights they ever had


---------46:30----------
because it had stance changes and it


---------46:31----------
would steal like their personality


---------46:33----------
subtypes and they'd have to fight


---------46:35----------
against themselves it was awesome


---------46:37----------
pretty sick sounds pretty awesome man


---------46:40----------
man it was awesome


---------46:42----------
but yeah that's that's where most of


---------46:44----------
them come from


---------46:49----------
how are you feeling about this


---------46:50----------
conversation jeremy


---------46:54----------
uh i don't really talk to anybody


---------46:58----------
like this about this kind of stuff so


---------47:02----------
i guess a little anxious um


---------47:05----------
so when i look at your face i don't see


---------47:07----------
a whole lot of emotion


---------47:11----------
like i'm having trouble figuring out


---------47:16----------
actually the impression that i'm getting


---------47:17----------
is that you're able to understand with


---------47:19----------
things intellectually but that you're a


---------47:21----------
little bit disconnected from


---------47:23----------
yourself well


---------47:29----------
i think


---------47:34----------
maybe the the thing with that is um


---------47:41----------
my family isn't intellectual


---------47:44----------
they're very emotional


---------47:48----------
and while i know that there's a lot of


---------47:50----------
good that can be done


---------47:51----------
through that method you know i can


---------47:55----------
feel for a lot of different people and


---------47:59----------
stuff like that but


---------48:02----------
there's just a lot of a lot of


---------48:05----------
bad things that can come from it as well


---------48:07----------
um


---------48:09----------
you know anger being the one i'm most


---------48:12----------
afraid of


---------48:14----------
um and sometimes my passion for the


---------48:18----------
things i talk about kind of eek out and


---------48:20----------
then i'll get a little emotional that


---------48:22----------
way


---------48:23----------
but i don't know too many too many times


---------48:28----------
when i've allowed myself i guess that


---------48:32----------
vulnerability it uh


---------48:36----------
it's just caused something worse to


---------48:37----------
happen and there's very few people i can


---------48:39----------
really


---------48:40----------
mean vulnerability well


---------48:45----------
part of my job is to remain


---------48:49----------
neutral and unbiased which means i have


---------48:51----------
to


---------48:54----------
to some degree detach myself emotionally


---------48:58----------
from the situation because while the


---------49:01----------
dice do


---------49:02----------
decide many things i decide the


---------49:05----------
parameters and which the dice are rolled


---------49:07----------
against and i have to calculate


---------49:09----------
let varying levels of fairness and if i


---------49:12----------
while i can't control exactly what the


---------49:13----------
dice do i can augment them greatly


---------49:15----------
by the challenges that that person has


---------49:18----------
to face


---------49:19----------
so if i'm emotionally attached to


---------49:21----------
somebody and i don't want to make them


---------49:22----------
feel bad


---------49:23----------
then i won't challenge them properly and


---------49:26----------
then


---------49:26----------
i make all of their successes and their


---------49:30----------
failures meaningless


---------49:31----------
because i don't give them an honest


---------49:34----------
challenge


---------49:34----------
it's one of the reasons i don't fudge


---------49:36----------
dice rolls and some dm's do


---------49:38----------
i don't do that because the only way


---------49:42----------
that someone can


---------49:43----------
know success as if failure is real


---------49:46----------
at least in d and d um i don't know if


---------49:48----------
that applies across the board but i know


---------49:50----------
it applies in d d


---------49:51----------
and i've got the


---------49:55----------
plenty of evidence to support that


---------49:57----------
because that's why my career happened


---------49:59----------
um so


---------50:03----------
in that regard i think that's why i uh


---------50:06----------
when i talk about things like that i


---------50:07----------
detach myself


---------50:08----------
emotionally especially also on you know


---------50:12----------
on stream and stuff because


---------50:13----------
i you know i know that i'm more of a


---------50:15----------
public facing


---------50:17----------
figure now and i feel like i should be


---------50:20----------
careful with what i say and


---------50:23----------
emotions make you less careful they make


---------50:24----------
you more honest i think but also less


---------50:27----------
careful and


---------50:30----------
and i suppose also when all things are


---------50:33----------
considered


---------50:38----------
i


---------50:47----------
they're really


---------50:53----------
strong and i can't


---------50:59----------
control them if i let them out too much


---------51:04----------
i think i i hope that


---------51:07----------
suffices i don't i don't know yeah so


---------51:09----------
that i'm i'm getting that


---------51:11----------
from you yeah and i think that's a real


---------51:14----------
challenge because i i think what you've


---------51:17----------
got to do jeremy is


---------51:21----------
not controlled


---------51:25----------
yeah right so you you've tried to cut


---------51:28----------
guilt entirely out of your life


---------51:31----------
that didn't work so well and it sounds


---------51:34----------
like you have difficulty controlling


---------51:35----------
them


---------51:37----------
but what i'm what i'm getting from you


---------51:39----------
is that like sure i can explain


---------51:40----------
sort of logic and we can talk about that


---------51:42----------
go and all that good stuff


---------51:43----------
but at the end of the day i get the


---------51:46----------
sense that


---------51:48----------
there's a certain amount of teflon


---------51:50----------
coating that you've got


---------51:52----------
and so we keep slipping off of it


---------51:55----------
it's slick and and i think if you really


---------51:59----------
want to get to the root of this imposter


---------52:01----------
syndrome i mean we can talk about


---------52:02----------
features of the class and whatnot but


---------52:05----------
i think at the end of the day like what


---------52:07----------
i want you to understand is that that


---------52:08----------
voice is not coming from a rational


---------52:10----------
place it's coming from an emotion


---------52:14----------
it's coming from conditioning and if you


---------52:17----------
want to undo


---------52:18----------
so like i want you to really think about


---------52:20----------
this like so the thoughts that


---------52:22----------
enter our head come from somewhere


---------52:25----------
it's crazy like the simplest thing is


---------52:27----------
that you know so you


---------52:28----------
popped open what looked like some kind


---------52:30----------
of dr pepper beverage and


---------52:32----------
and as i saw that my indriyas or my


---------52:34----------
sense organs


---------52:37----------
detected something and then generated a


---------52:39----------
thought


---------52:40----------
in my brain so sometimes one of the


---------52:43----------
sources of thoughts is our indriyas or


---------52:45----------
our sense


---------52:46----------
organs but thoughts come from more


---------52:48----------
places than our sense organs they come


---------52:50----------
from more places than the outside world


---------52:52----------
sometimes they come from us


---------52:54----------
and if you think about you know i want


---------52:56----------
you to think about like a portal


---------52:59----------
into some you know


---------53:02----------
lower plane that's spawning denizens and


---------53:05----------
what happens is you're there and like it


---------53:07----------
spawns a denizen which is the thought in


---------53:09----------
your head and it says


---------53:10----------
i can't do well you're you're gonna fail


---------53:13----------
and then you smack that denizen down


---------53:15----------
you beat the crap out of it and then


---------53:17----------
you're like yeah i won


---------53:19----------
and then a day later a week later oh


---------53:21----------
there's the thought again


---------53:22----------
and you smack that one down too and


---------53:24----------
there's the thought again


---------53:26----------
you smack that one down too and like we


---------53:28----------
said imposter syndrome


---------53:29----------
is adaptive because if we think about it


---------53:30----------
we're farming xp right


---------53:32----------
we're just farming these denizens for xp


---------53:34----------
it's great we're leveling up


---------53:36----------
but it sucks because you're kind of


---------53:38----------
fighting these denizens from the lower


---------53:40----------
plains all the time if you want to get


---------53:42----------
to the portal that portal is emotional


---------53:44----------
if you want to close that portal like


---------53:46----------
you got to go


---------53:48----------
you can't keep on fighting these


---------53:50----------
cognitive wars against yourself


---------53:52----------
and buying yourself until tomorrow


---------53:56----------
you've got to go to like where this like


---------53:59----------
you know where this feeling comes from


---------54:00----------
the idea that like


---------54:02----------
you have within you a belief and


---------54:05----------
now i'm going out on a limb so we can


---------54:06----------
talk about it could be right could be


---------54:08----------
wrong


---------54:09----------
so i and i've seen this with people


---------54:11----------
frankly from


---------54:12----------
deep south so i grew up when you say


---------54:15----------
deep south what state are you talking


---------54:18----------
well arkansas okay so like i grew up in


---------54:21----------
east texas


---------54:23----------
and so pretty similar i mean


---------54:26----------
maybe not quite as deep i mean if well i


---------54:29----------
grew up in a city that had a population


---------54:30----------
of 100 000 people but


---------54:32----------
you know there were there were wizards


---------54:34----------
and dragons of a different kind down


---------54:35----------
there too


---------54:36----------
yeah and um


---------54:40----------
i think at the end of the day


---------54:44----------
you know there there's a part of you


---------54:46----------
that not to be in delicate and i'm going


---------54:48----------
to use an


---------54:49----------
inflammatory phrase to see if we get


---------54:50----------
some traction


---------54:52----------
there's a part of you that's a


---------54:53----------
successful twitch streamer and dungeon


---------54:55----------
master and living the life of your


---------54:56----------
dreams and you carry with you


---------54:59----------
a white trailer park trash kind of kid


---------55:01----------
around


---------55:04----------
yeah right and and those


---------55:07----------
thoughts don't come from arcadium


---------55:11----------
they come from jeremy


---------55:15----------
and like if you really want those


---------55:17----------
thoughts like that insecurity about what


---------55:19----------
you're capable of and the idea that


---------55:22----------
even if you do well it's going to come


---------55:24----------
crumbling down around you like that


---------55:25----------
fundamental


---------55:26----------
lack of faith is not arcade


---------55:30----------
because arcade is [ __ ] amazing


---------55:33----------
everyone knows that


---------55:35----------
arcadium is the the person that


---------55:37----------
literally takes


---------55:38----------
the stuff of nightmares and turns it


---------55:41----------
into an escape


---------55:43----------
for people who are suffering in the rest


---------55:44----------
of their life like how cool is that


---------55:50----------
i don't know how much more fallen hero


---------55:54----------
anti-paladin you can get


---------55:59----------
i i know i don't feel that way but


---------56:02----------
i i i unders i understand what you mean


---------56:05----------
yeah and i know that you don't feel that


---------56:06----------
way so what way do you feel jeremy


---------56:10----------
i feel uh i feel that you're right about


---------56:14----------
something that i didn't really think


---------56:15----------
about


---------56:16----------
that the persona that i created for


---------56:18----------
myself


---------56:19----------
isn't really me


---------56:23----------
not really i mean it's a part of me sure


---------56:24----------
but it's not me me


---------56:27----------
you know not as maybe that's the wrong


---------56:29----------
way to look at it but


---------56:31----------
i try to i think i think you know i i


---------56:34----------
ignore


---------56:35----------
jeremy and i try to become the person i


---------56:39----------
made for myself


---------56:40----------
because that's what i want to be but i


---------56:44----------
can't just not be


---------56:45----------
the other part of me and i gotta find a


---------56:46----------
way to put them together again yep


---------56:48----------
so now we come to a weird thing that i'm


---------56:51----------
gonna say


---------56:52----------
the reason you feel like an imposter


---------56:54----------
jeremy is because


---------56:55----------
you are one


---------56:59----------
right because you're and i know what you


---------57:01----------
mean by that yeah yeah yeah


---------57:02----------
yeah right so the reason that like


---------57:06----------
like there there is a part of you that


---------57:08----------
could fail


---------57:09----------
and i think that actually you're gonna


---------57:11----------
reach just like you said


---------57:13----------
it's it's the failures that make the


---------57:15----------
successes worthwhile and it's while you


---------57:18----------
why you don't fudge roles and in your


---------57:20----------
own life


---------57:21----------
you're trying to live a life of pure


---------57:24----------
success


---------57:26----------
without carrying that that failure with


---------57:28----------
you


---------57:31----------
and you're more than arcadium and thank


---------57:33----------
god for that you're jeremy too and it's


---------57:35----------
because like


---------57:35----------
jeremy is the fuel for arcade


---------57:39----------
all of your compassion all of your like


---------57:43----------
intrinsic understanding of your despair


---------57:46----------
and if you go find a therapist i'm sure


---------57:48----------
they'll have a field day with your


---------57:50----------
nightmares


---------57:52----------
and the you know psychological symbolism


---------57:54----------
there


---------57:56----------
yeah and so uh jeremy i think what what


---------57:59----------
you've got to do is


---------58:00----------
understand that yeah maybe you will fail


---------58:02----------
maybe you will people let


---------58:04----------
maybe you will let people down maybe you


---------58:06----------
won't win 100


---------58:09----------
and that's okay that when someone


---------58:13----------
concedes an argument you don't have to


---------58:15----------
drive them into the ground


---------58:16----------
that you don't have to be perfect all


---------58:18----------
the time if you're running nine


---------58:19----------
campaigns and you [ __ ] up one day like


---------58:21----------
that's no big deal you're allowed to


---------58:22----------
make mistakes


---------58:25----------
yeah you should have the biggest problem


---------58:29----------
is that you don't have any mercy for


---------58:30----------
yourself


---------58:34----------
there's a relentless you know like


---------58:37----------
you're trying so hard to prove to


---------58:39----------
yourself that you're


---------58:41----------
like it's weird like you have this war


---------58:42----------
where like you can't tolerate the idea


---------58:44----------
that you're not


---------58:45----------
archaedum and that jeremy may be alive


---------58:48----------
inside you and like that's not a battle


---------58:50----------
you're ever gonna win because jeremy is


---------58:51----------
alive and inside you


---------58:53----------
yeah the crazy thing is that the


---------58:54----------
conclusion that you draw from that is


---------58:56----------
that like that's a bad thing i think


---------58:57----------
it's a good thing i think it's who you


---------58:59----------
are man


---------59:01----------
you're not straight 18s bro


---------59:05----------
you've got a dump stat or two here or


---------59:07----------
there


---------59:08----------
should have rolled my stats no it's


---------59:12----------
never gonna


---------59:13----------
no i get i get what you mean though yeah


---------59:16----------
i'm sorry if i seemed resistant to the


---------59:18----------
things you were saying i didn't mean it


---------59:19----------
that way or


---------59:20----------
anything no i it's not something you


---------59:22----------
have to apologize for it's an


---------59:23----------
observation


---------59:25----------
no right i think it's it's it's not i


---------59:27----------
didn't interpret it as a resistance i


---------59:29----------
think it's protection


---------59:32----------
this is like one of those campaigns


---------59:34----------
where like there's some you know cave


---------59:35----------
that's sealed off by a bunch of wards


---------59:39----------
yeah and like eventually you got to take


---------59:40----------
the wards down and go in


---------59:43----------
the words are there for a reason they're


---------59:46----------
keeping the anger at bay


---------59:48----------
and i think a good place for you to


---------59:50----------
start is not so much about guilt it's


---------59:51----------
as you said rage like what are you angry


---------59:54----------
at man


---------59:58----------
do you let yourself be angry


---------60:01----------
i try very hard not to let myself be


---------60:03----------
angry


---------60:08----------
there is a portal deep inside a cave


---------60:10----------
that's warded off


---------60:12----------
and every week it spawns something and


---------60:14----------
all that [ __ ] is trapped in there


---------60:19----------
so i can understand that you're afraid


---------60:22----------
so i think this is going to be like a


---------60:23----------
journey


---------60:25----------
yeah you know where you learn to like


---------60:29----------
understand your anger and become more


---------60:30----------
familiar with it


---------60:40----------
it's your choice whether you want to try


---------60:41----------
to go there today or not i don't


---------60:42----------
necessarily think we need to open that


---------60:44----------
can of worms but if you want to we can


---------60:45----------
try to explore it


---------60:47----------
so now we come to another fork in the


---------60:49----------
road which is mechanics of imposter


---------60:51----------
syndrome we're exploring your anger


---------61:01----------
let's do anger because that's the thing


---------61:03----------
i'm most afraid of


---------61:05----------
why are you afraid of your anger


---------61:11----------
i promised myself before i came on here


---------61:13----------
that i'd be honest completely


---------61:15----------
and i'd listen to what you say but there


---------61:17----------
it is again


---------61:18----------
what are you doing to yourself


---------61:25----------
i don't know so so so i i okay go ahead


---------61:28----------
and finish your thought


---------61:30----------
i was just i was just gonna say that


---------61:32----------
it's i


---------61:35----------
i don't know what the rules are and what


---------61:37----------
can be talked about or anything because


---------61:39----------
i don't know how it all happens i just


---------61:41----------
i knew that before i came in here that i


---------61:43----------
wanted i wanted what help you had to


---------61:46----------
offer


---------61:46----------
okay and uh


---------61:52----------
i'm about to say i haven't really said


---------61:53----------
on stream before


---------61:55----------
i wouldn't say anything against tos or


---------61:56----------
anything that's illegal no no no no no


---------61:58----------
no no no i'm not going to say that no


---------62:00----------
it's it's just um


---------62:06----------
i don't it's something i did that was


---------62:09----------
really bad and i don't want people to


---------62:11----------
think


---------62:11----------
differently of me because of it but


---------62:15----------
if we're gonna explore the anger then we


---------62:17----------
have to go to probably the


---------62:19----------
the moment i became afraid of it


---------62:22----------
it was when i was 16 years old and um


---------62:26----------
my mom had just come home from another


---------62:29----------
drunken binge uh and this was two weeks


---------62:33----------
after


---------62:34----------
she had almost uh killed


---------62:38----------
me my sister and all my friends in a car


---------62:40----------
accident


---------62:42----------
um and all the


---------62:45----------
all the you know the back of my head


---------62:50----------
got to the point where i couldn't hold


---------62:51----------
it back anymore


---------62:54----------
and i uh


---------62:57----------
god i realized how strong i was then


---------63:02----------
i uh


---------63:06----------
i got very angry and it was over


---------63:08----------
something so


---------63:09----------
small and petty like it was


---------63:12----------
it was uh my mom


---------63:16----------
wouldn't let me go to my friend's house


---------63:18----------
she wouldn't give me a ride because she


---------63:20----------
had a headache


---------63:21----------
and i knew she had a headache because


---------63:22----------
she had been out drinking


---------63:26----------
such a petty thing to get this mad over


---------63:28----------
but


---------63:29----------
it was just the straw that broke the


---------63:30----------
camel's back


---------63:32----------
and it was uh


---------63:36----------
i i broke things


---------63:41----------
smashed the car uh


---------63:44----------
broke windows shattered the door


---------63:49----------
ah the neighbor that was our landlord


---------63:51----------
tried to stop me


---------63:52----------
i meant 10 years at 20 years my senior


---------63:57----------
uh and i heard him pretty bad


---------64:02----------
um


---------64:06----------
we had two friends of the family


---------64:09----------
that were there these two these two boys


---------64:11----------
one of them was two years


---------64:13----------
my junior i hurt him pretty bad


---------64:17----------
his little brother was faster than me


---------64:18----------
though i couldn't catch him


---------64:21----------
and what i remember standing out on the


---------64:24----------
road


---------64:25----------
right in front of where we where we were


---------64:28----------
living


---------64:29----------
all i could remember was how good i felt


---------64:33----------
and that terrified me afterwards


---------64:36----------
because you know i thought


---------64:40----------
that what i was doing was wrong


---------64:43----------
but every single part of myself


---------64:47----------
told me it wasn't


---------64:50----------
and uh


---------64:53----------
you know i was 16 young and nobody


---------64:55----------
taught me anything


---------64:57----------
and i know now it's you know there are


---------65:00----------
healthy ways to let out anger and


---------65:02----------
catharsis and or whatever that is but


---------65:06----------
all i know is that at the moment


---------65:09----------
it felt


---------65:12----------
good to the level that it


---------65:15----------
i never want to feel like that again


---------65:18----------
ever


---------65:19----------
you never want it to feel like that


---------65:20----------
again


---------65:23----------
no it was it was it was a


---------65:27----------
addictive power


---------65:32----------
like it's a good thing that my father


---------65:36----------
wasn't in the picture


---------65:37----------
at that time because i probably wouldn't


---------65:41----------
have stopped


---------65:44----------
the only thing that stopped me was uh


---------65:49----------
was when carlos came back and i saw how


---------65:51----------
afraid he was of me


---------65:58----------
and that's when i decided that without a


---------66:00----------
doubt i was going to join the military


---------66:01----------
and i was going to be taught how to


---------66:02----------
control my aggression


---------66:06----------
and they did do that they taught me the


---------66:09----------
discipline


---------66:10----------
so that i would never falter again


---------66:14----------
never let it out again and


---------66:17----------
and i also sought some therapy uh


---------66:19----------
through my


---------66:20----------
chaplain while i was in there and they


---------66:23----------
helped


---------66:23----------
it was more religious oriented but it


---------66:25----------
did the job for a bit


---------66:28----------
and uh i got through it


---------66:33----------
and it hasn't happened since


---------66:36----------
but that's why that's where that's


---------66:39----------
that's why i'm afraid of it


---------66:43----------
good reason to be afraid


---------66:46----------
i i wasn't even fully grown man


---------66:54----------
do you have anger still within you


---------66:59----------
yeah but it it doesn't get that


---------67:03----------
it doesn't get there anymore i i i found


---------67:07----------
ways to


---------67:07----------
to deal with it or not


---------67:10----------
angry at


---------67:17----------
i mean i guess a lot of things but


---------67:23----------
i honestly don't know


---------67:29----------
so jeremy sometimes people


---------67:32----------
suffer from depression and


---------67:35----------
one way to look at depression is that


---------67:37----------
it's anger directed against the self


---------67:40----------
do you ever direct anger towards you


---------67:44----------
yeah how


---------67:49----------
frequently i mean is that a big part of


---------67:52----------
the anger that you allow yourself to


---------67:54----------
feel


---------67:55----------
well i start to feel it towards somebody


---------67:57----------
else and i try to


---------67:58----------
blame myself because i don't want to


---------68:01----------
hurt someone else


---------68:05----------
i i guess there's a part of me that


---------68:07----------
doesn't believe it's my fault but i make


---------68:09----------
myself


---------68:10----------
believe that it is so that way it


---------68:12----------
doesn't


---------68:17----------
i don't ever hurt anybody like that


---------68:22----------
again


---------68:26----------
i can't can't ever let that happen again


---------68:32----------
i can get behind that and at the same


---------68:36----------
time


---------68:37----------
i think you're doing something kind of


---------68:39----------
tricky to yourself right


---------68:41----------
yeah so the solution that you found is


---------68:44----------
to take


---------68:45----------
everything that other people do wrong


---------68:46----------
and blame yourself instead


---------68:50----------
that certainly ain't going to help the


---------68:51----------
imposter syndrome


---------68:54----------
right because each insult that is done


---------68:56----------
to you suddenly you become the one at


---------68:59----------
fault


---------69:00----------
yeah and we see this a lot with people


---------69:02----------
who like


---------69:04----------
frankly we see this at i mean i see this


---------69:06----------
a lot when i think about abusive


---------69:08----------
relationships or codependency


---------69:10----------
where you know it's it's not his fault


---------69:14----------
he hit me


---------69:15----------
it's my fault because i didn't do


---------69:16----------
something and i made him angry


---------69:19----------
and in a weird way you know i hear you


---------69:23----------
blaming yourself in order to protect


---------69:27----------
other people from your anger


---------69:36----------
and it's hard because i i think you you


---------69:39----------
seem to think that if you stop


---------69:40----------
doing that then what would happen


---------69:45----------
i don't know that's


---------69:48----------
i i you know


---------69:53----------
it's reason why i don't drink or or


---------69:56----------
do any uh anything that inhibits my


---------70:02----------
mental facilities


---------70:06----------
because you know i


---------70:10----------
i understand that trying to control


---------70:12----------
everything is bad


---------70:14----------
but i suppose for better or worse it's


---------70:17----------
the best way


---------70:18----------
you know how yeah i convinced myself


---------70:21----------
that it was


---------70:22----------
that it was better to suffer from trying


---------70:25----------
to control everything too much


---------70:27----------
than the risk that would take if i gave


---------70:29----------
up too much


---------70:31----------
well obviously ideally it'd be the


---------70:33----------
middle but


---------70:34----------
i haven't found that yet yeah i mean


---------70:37----------
there you've got it bro


---------70:39----------
right you're not alone there


---------70:42----------
is that if you take the blame on all on


---------70:44----------
yourself then like things in a sense


---------70:46----------
become


---------70:46----------
easy because then you're in control


---------70:50----------
right because if it's all your fault


---------70:52----------
then


---------70:53----------
you get to control the role of the dice


---------70:56----------
yeah but i think this kind of comes back


---------70:59----------
to like now we see why you have the


---------71:01----------
burden of responsibility


---------71:03----------
because you are the dungeon master of


---------71:06----------
your life you're all powerful


---------71:09----------
and all things come down to you


---------71:13----------
and so no wonder you see a burden the


---------71:16----------
more people that you


---------71:17----------
interact with the bigger your groups get


---------71:20----------
each of their responsibilities you take


---------71:22----------
unto yourself


---------71:25----------
and it weighs you down because you're


---------71:26----------
taking the responsibility of 36 people


---------71:29----------
or 40 people yeah


---------71:33----------
we haven't even talked about i don't


---------71:35----------
know if you're in a in a romantic


---------71:37----------
relationship or not or if you've got


---------71:38----------
kids or anything like that but


---------71:41----------
i don't have any kids i've i've been


---------71:43----------
with uh


---------71:46----------
i've been with my fiance for 11 years


---------71:52----------
so i mean there's maybe a whole other


---------71:54----------
conversation there about


---------71:55----------
what that relationship is like and


---------71:59----------
yeah how you feel about that how you


---------72:01----------
relate to her


---------72:03----------
i'm assuming it's a woman but yeah yeah


---------72:05----------
no it is yeah


---------72:09----------
you know


---------72:13----------
yeah jeremy do you see a road forward


---------72:16----------
from here


---------72:22----------
well


---------72:27----------
i don't know why i think this way


---------72:31----------
certainly i i have no precedent


---------72:35----------
or or or teacher


---------72:38----------
from my childhood to have instilled this


---------72:41----------
in me but


---------72:42----------
at least not that i can remember um


---------72:48----------
but i see my life getting better


---------72:51----------
because if i'm completely honest it is


---------72:54----------
it is bad the imposter syndrome


---------72:57----------
but all the other asset like facets of


---------73:00----------
my life are getting better


---------73:02----------
i don't worry about about like


---------73:05----------
financial stuff anymore or i don't worry


---------73:08----------
that i'm wasting my time


---------73:10----------
you know like like job like uh what's


---------73:12----------
the word i'm looking for they're like um


---------73:15----------
i don't know what to call that like i


---------73:16----------
made a bad gamble with my career


---------73:18----------
i guess you know um


---------73:23----------
my family is doing better i helped i


---------73:26----------
helped


---------73:27----------
my mom beat cancer so


---------73:31----------
that kind of stuff's kind of working out


---------73:32----------
there


---------73:34----------
um you know it's


---------73:38----------
my life is not as bad as it was


---------73:41----------
it has gotten better so i have so i


---------73:45----------
guess the way forward here is


---------73:47----------
you know um


---------73:51----------
seek some therapy that can help me


---------73:55----------
that can put the time in to unravel this


---------73:59----------
wilderness um to help me through it


---------74:04----------
but i mean i


---------74:07----------
i was i was taught something one of the


---------74:10----------
few positive things i was taught with my


---------74:12----------
grandfather


---------74:14----------
was that


---------74:19----------
appreciate the water not the fish you


---------74:21----------
catch


---------74:22----------
that's what he told me and that really


---------74:26----------
resonated with me


---------74:28----------
that fact of the matter is


---------74:31----------
i'm here where so many people


---------74:36----------
in my family haven't been anywhere near


---------74:38----------
where i am


---------74:40----------
that i can help people that i cannot


---------74:43----------
worry about money that i can


---------74:45----------
do something that i'm truly proud of


---------74:48----------
and it gives me hope that even though


---------74:52----------
this


---------74:52----------
voice is in my head that it it won't be


---------74:55----------
there forever and even if it is


---------74:57----------
then i'll find a way to manage it


---------75:01----------
because i i believe in what i do


---------75:06----------
i think it makes the world a better


---------75:07----------
place so


---------75:10----------
so yeah i guess that's yeah so i think


---------75:13----------
that sounds


---------75:14----------
great and i want to share a couple of


---------75:18----------
kind of principles so the interesting


---------75:20----------
thing is you're saying everything is


---------75:21----------
getting better on the outside you know


---------75:24----------
it's it's funny because mental health


---------75:26----------
like so we're getting better at cancer


---------75:27----------
we're getting better at heart disease


---------75:28----------
and we're getting worse at mental health


---------75:31----------
like why is that so i think that this is


---------75:34----------
something that


---------75:35----------
you know people discovered in india a


---------75:37----------
couple thousand years ago is that


---------75:40----------
the better the more we take care of


---------75:42----------
things on the outside


---------75:44----------
the more that internal problems begin to


---------75:46----------
arise


---------75:49----------
and that if you look at like what a monk


---------75:50----------
does one of my teachers once told me


---------75:53----------
that anything you accomplish in the


---------75:54----------
material world is going to be


---------75:57----------
easy mode compared to like anything you


---------75:59----------
accomplish in the inner world


---------76:02----------
any task that you set your mind to


---------76:04----------
accomplish outside of yourself


---------76:06----------
is going to be easier than anything you


---------76:07----------
do within yourself


---------76:11----------
and it's it's kind of weird but there's


---------76:12----------
like another really interesting


---------76:14----------
kind of strange conundrum in the eastern


---------76:17----------
traditions which is that


---------76:18----------
you know in the in like ancient india


---------76:20----------
sometimes some people are familiar with


---------76:22----------
the caste system are you familiar with


---------76:23----------
that


---------76:25----------
there were like casts and yeah somewhat


---------76:27----------
yeah yeah so just that you're born into


---------76:29----------
them


---------76:29----------
exactly right so like there were


---------76:31----------
forecasts so the the highest caste is


---------76:33----------
the brahman or the priest


---------76:35----------
cast yeah below them or the chatrias or


---------76:38----------
warriors or nobles


---------76:40----------
they're the kings the warrior cast


---------76:44----------
the leader cast below them or the


---------76:46----------
merchants and below them or the laborers


---------76:49----------
and so the really funny thing is that if


---------76:50----------
you look at all of the the


---------76:52----------
the people who founded religions


---------76:55----------
or are divine or attained enlightenment


---------76:58----------
call it whatever you want to one is


---------77:00----------
historical they like


---------77:01----------
basically started a religion like buddha


---------77:03----------
for example


---------77:04----------
um another way to think about them so


---------77:07----------
they're viewed as divine by some people


---------77:10----------
but another way to think about it is


---------77:11----------
they attained this like


---------77:13----------
sort of superhuman state called


---------77:14----------
enlightenment


---------77:17----------
the funny thing is that none of them are


---------77:18----------
priests


---------77:20----------
which is kind of weird because they're


---------77:21----------
the experts in meditation


---------77:23----------
all of the enlightened beings that come


---------77:25----------
out of india buddha included


---------77:27----------
are kings and so then it begs the


---------77:30----------
question


---------77:30----------
why don't priests get enlightened if


---------77:32----------
they're the experts on meditation


---------77:34----------
and the answer is because you have to


---------77:37----------
settle your material world


---------77:40----------
to really fight the internal


---------77:44----------
it makes sense and what happened with


---------77:47----------
buddha is he


---------77:48----------
won the game of life right like you have


---------77:49----------
a fulfilling career it sounds like


---------77:51----------
you've got a good relationship sounds


---------77:52----------
like you're


---------77:53----------
patching things up and so imposter


---------77:56----------
syndrome arises


---------77:58----------
there's a reason why imposter syndrome


---------78:00----------
arises the most


---------78:02----------
the more successful you are the more


---------78:03----------
imposter syndrome gets worse


---------78:06----------
and i think it kind of speaks to this


---------78:08----------
age-old principle of like material stuff


---------78:10----------
is easy compared to internal style


---------78:14----------
now that may not be entirely true and i


---------78:16----------
think a lot of times


---------78:17----------
you know people have very genuine


---------78:21----------
out outward circumstances case in point


---------78:24----------
eight year old you 13 year old 16 year


---------78:26----------
old you


---------78:28----------
yeah but i i think that


---------78:32----------
you've got to be careful because just


---------78:34----------
because things in the outside world


---------78:36----------
are getting better i think they're


---------78:37----------
getting better because you worked on


---------78:38----------
them


---------78:39----------
and you have to work on this too


---------78:43----------
and i think a couple of things i think


---------78:44----------
if you want to see a therapist that's


---------78:45----------
fantastic


---------78:48----------
a couple of i don't know how else to do


---------78:49----------
it really yeah so we don't know how to


---------78:51----------
work on that


---------78:51----------
we can teach you right that's what i'm


---------78:54----------
here


---------78:55----------
yeah yeah so the first thing is to i'd


---------78:58----------
say just be aware


---------79:00----------
of what you're angry at and i'd start


---------79:02----------
with anger


---------79:04----------
and i think that there's a have faith


---------79:07----------
in the structures that you've put to


---------79:09----------
control your anger


---------79:11----------
i don't think that like exploring your


---------79:13----------
anger is going to turn you into 16 year


---------79:16----------
old you


---------79:17----------
like you're just a different person


---------79:20----------
right like you're like you failed your


---------79:22----------
saving throw back then but like


---------79:24----------
you're saving throws you're like you're


---------79:25----------
just way better now


---------79:27----------
so you're you're not going to be 16


---------79:29----------
again you're just


---------79:32----------
the reason you feel like an imposter is


---------79:34----------
because arcadium is not


---------79:36----------
entirely you but you're not entirely 16


---------79:39----------
year old jeremy either


---------79:40----------
you're both yeah right so you're like


---------79:43----------
you're like a whole party


---------79:44----------
of people and there's one person who's


---------79:46----------
been lagging behind and


---------79:48----------
and needs your help so start by being


---------79:51----------
aware


---------79:52----------
of what you feel and i'd start with


---------79:54----------
anger


---------79:55----------
seeing a therapist is i think a good


---------79:57----------
thing the second thing is that just like


---------79:59----------
your grandfather said


---------80:00----------
appreciate the water don't worry about


---------80:02----------
the fish


---------80:04----------
and in that way like do the work that


---------80:06----------
you came here to do


---------80:09----------
and whether it serves an as an escape


---------80:12----------
for people or not like that's up to them


---------80:14----------
yeah right you're going to show up with


---------80:17----------
your fishing rod


---------80:18----------
and your bait and your tackle and your


---------80:20----------
boat and you're gonna sit there and


---------80:22----------
you're gonna put your


---------80:23----------
line into the water whether the fish


---------80:26----------
bite or not is like that's not up to you


---------80:28----------
like what what's yours to control is the


---------80:29----------
preparation that you put in and the fact


---------80:31----------
that you show


---------80:32----------
up but the second you start


---------80:35----------
expecting those fish to bite the second


---------80:37----------
you beat yourself up for those fish not


---------80:39----------
biting


---------80:40----------
which i think you do a lot yeah


---------80:45----------
that's the problem right so notice that


---------80:48----------
notice that it's a very subtle threshold


---------80:50----------
and on the outside it looks exactly the


---------80:52----------
same


---------80:55----------
what like the two people one person who


---------80:57----------
expects a fish to bite one person who


---------80:59----------
doesn't expect a fish to bite


---------81:00----------
on the outside they look exactly the


---------81:02----------
same


---------81:04----------
it's just one of them is okay right huh


---------81:07----------
but one


---------81:07----------
gets a pleasant surprise yep yeah and


---------81:11----------
one of them


---------81:11----------
at the at best meets their expectation


---------81:16----------
yeah so i think you've got to start


---------81:19----------
sharing that responsibility man


---------81:21----------
it's not yours and that too i think


---------81:23----------
you've you've described it really well i


---------81:24----------
think you've


---------81:25----------
created a compensatory mechanism


---------81:28----------
for yourself which is like


---------81:32----------
i'm gonna take the blame so that i don't


---------81:33----------
have to be angry at other people


---------81:37----------
and so that's something you really gotta


---------81:38----------
pay attention to


---------81:40----------
i think this is where really looking at


---------81:42----------
your romantic relationship which


---------81:45----------
you know i think is going to be more


---------81:48----------
could have a lot of


---------81:52----------
how can i say this mal adaptations


---------81:55----------
to it in terms of you know you may be


---------81:59----------
taking more of the blame than you should


---------82:02----------
or maybe even like sometimes you lose


---------82:04----------
control a little bit with her


---------82:06----------
things like that like because it's just


---------82:07----------
not tenable sometimes it's unfortunate


---------82:10----------
but sometimes we show the worst part of


---------82:11----------
ourselves or we give the worst part of


---------82:14----------
ourselves


---------82:14----------
the people that we're closest to


---------82:17----------
yeah i have infinite patience with


---------82:20----------
anyone i'm talking about on stream


---------82:22----------
unfortunately sometimes i'll you know


---------82:24----------
get upset with my kids


---------82:26----------
because they can be infuriating


---------82:30----------
and it doesn't make me you know a bad


---------82:32----------
dad and it's something i work on but


---------82:33----------
like just be careful about the people


---------82:35----------
that are closest to you


---------82:38----------
yeah and the last thing is in terms of


---------82:42----------
imposter syndrome so now i'll explain


---------82:44----------
just a little bit about it so


---------82:45----------
imposter syndrome tends to arise when


---------82:48----------
our internal sense of worth


---------82:52----------
is far outweighed by our external sense


---------82:54----------
of work


---------82:56----------
so when the world starts treating us


---------82:58----------
like we're the hottest shits and slice


---------83:00----------
of bread


---------83:01----------
and we feel like we're nothing special


---------83:03----------
that's when imposter syndrome arises


---------83:06----------
so it's it's like applying to medical


---------83:10----------
school versus getting in


---------83:12----------
there's a huge difference even though


---------83:15----------
it's like a 24-hour period


---------83:17----------
where one day you were applying and one


---------83:19----------
day you'd get in


---------83:21----------
and and so oddly enough that you know


---------83:23----------
the the what i've seen working with a


---------83:25----------
couple of influencers and


---------83:27----------
and other people basically the more


---------83:28----------
successful you are the more vulnerable


---------83:30----------
you are to imposter syndrome


---------83:32----------
and that internal sense of self-worth i


---------83:34----------
don't know where you live now but like


---------83:36----------
spending some time with nature is a


---------83:37----------
really really good way to get in touch


---------83:39----------
with yourself


---------83:42----------
um i guess


---------83:46----------
not really a lot going well there's uh


---------83:47----------
there's a park there i could try that


---------83:49----------
yeah are you in the u.s


---------83:52----------
yeah i'm in texas do you mind if i ask


---------83:54----------
what part of texas


---------83:55----------
uh fort worth uh saginaw yeah so like


---------83:59----------
there's gotta be like you know i mean


---------84:01----------
they're like a ton of national parks


---------84:03----------
in texas yeah you may have something


---------84:05----------
that's like an hour away or something


---------84:07----------
like that i mean i'd say go there the


---------84:08----------
weather in texas is getting real nice


---------84:10----------
now


---------84:11----------
yeah it is um and and so


---------84:15----------
you know i'd spend some time away from


---------84:18----------
people and kind of like with yourself


---------84:21----------
that's a good way to kind of think about


---------84:22----------
it the other thing about imposter


---------84:24----------
syndrome is that


---------84:25----------
you know i think lastly like uh jeremy


---------84:28----------
you need to let that voice be there


---------84:30----------
and don't try to beat the [ __ ] out of it


---------84:33----------
you know like it's it's okay to have


---------84:35----------
doubt about what you're capable of


---------84:38----------
because like i want you to just think


---------84:40----------
about that voice in a slightly different


---------84:41----------
way like that voice is scared


---------84:43----------
it's a representation of your doubt it's


---------84:46----------
a representation of your insecurity


---------84:49----------
and when when you you know when you tell


---------84:52----------
yours like when


---------84:53----------
when jeremy comes to arcade and says hey


---------84:55----------
i'm afraid that we're not going to be


---------84:56----------
able to do this


---------84:57----------
and arcadium is like sit the [ __ ] down


---------84:59----------
and shut the [ __ ] up


---------85:02----------
right that's not that's gonna just make


---------85:05----------
that voice come back


---------85:07----------
later because you haven't done anything


---------85:08----------
to address its fears


---------85:10----------
the right way to talk to that voice is


---------85:11----------
hey man i understand you're scared


---------85:14----------
and it's okay to be scared and it may


---------85:18----------
come crashing down around us


---------85:21----------
and that's okay


---------85:27----------
all right i'll try that


---------85:31----------
see now there are feelings


---------85:37----------
ah yeah what are you feeling


---------85:47----------
a little sad a little happy


---------85:51----------
i don't know all of it i guess a little


---------85:54----------
bit of


---------85:55----------
a little bit everything what makes you


---------85:58----------
sad


---------85:58----------
when i was speaking those words what


---------86:00----------
were you thinking about


---------86:09----------
how much suffering i've put myself


---------86:11----------
through if


---------86:13----------
if this works then that's all i had to


---------86:16----------
do


---------86:17----------
i guess be careful good


---------86:21----------
so be careful it's not


---------86:25----------
it's not that's not how it works so this


---------86:27----------
is the crazy thing that happened so this


---------86:29----------
is how we hold ourselves back


---------86:31----------
this is subtle okay but pay a lot of


---------86:33----------
attention to this


---------86:35----------
any time we take a step forward


---------86:38----------
you know what we do we blame ourselves


---------86:42----------
for not taking it earlier


---------86:45----------
we this is the way it's funny you know i


---------86:48----------
was talking at the beginning about


---------86:49----------
how we're trying to like make more kind


---------86:51----------
of discreet content on youtube and like


---------86:53----------
this is one of the pieces that i filmed


---------86:55----------
this past week


---------86:57----------
how we turn our successes into failures


---------87:01----------
because anytime we take a step forward


---------87:03----------
instead of


---------87:05----------
being happy with ourselves instead of


---------87:07----------
being proud of ourselves


---------87:08----------
instead of giving ourselves a pat on the


---------87:10----------
back what do we what have we conditioned


---------87:11----------
ourselves to do


---------87:13----------
why didn't you do it earlier yeah


---------87:17----------
so we take what should be a success and


---------87:19----------
we turn it into a failure


---------87:22----------
and no wonder we're stuck


---------87:25----------
yeah cut yourself some slack


---------87:30----------
jeremy it's it's a long road ahead


---------87:35----------
learn to talk to yourself see even that


---------87:37----------
is the same thing


---------87:38----------
it's the same way that you talk to


---------87:40----------
yourself don't talk to yourself like


---------87:41----------
that


---------87:43----------
instead of what you need to tell


---------87:44----------
yourself is hey man it's okay that we


---------87:45----------
didn't learn this earlier


---------87:47----------
right like


---------87:51----------
like be the person that tells you like i


---------87:53----------
don't know if your dad ever told you


---------87:55----------
stuff like this maybe your grandfather


---------87:56----------
did but like you need to be like that


---------87:58----------
like the person that your dad should


---------87:59----------
have been


---------88:00----------
for yourself which is that hey man


---------88:03----------
you're gonna learn at your own pace


---------88:06----------
some people pick things up slow and some


---------88:08----------
people pick things up fast you'll get


---------88:11----------
there in the end


---------88:16----------
it's so automatic you got to be careful


---------88:28----------
okay last thing is meditation you


---------88:32----------
interested in learning meditation


---------88:34----------
sure if i can i'll try


---------88:39----------
what do you mean if you can


---------88:42----------
i'm not very chill


---------88:46----------
who says he has to be chill to meditate


---------88:51----------
i guess i was wrong to say that i'm


---------88:53----------
sorry i didn't mean


---------88:55----------
no no you're not wrong i'm just


---------88:57----------
challenging your perception


---------88:59----------
it's just because you sit still


---------89:05----------
i said still


---------89:08----------
why when you said meditation i thought


---------89:10----------
of like sitting there not doing anything


---------89:13----------
yeah so you're telling me you're not


---------89:16----------
good at sitting there or not doing


---------89:17----------
anything


---------89:18----------
no no i'm not okay so that's totally


---------89:21----------
cool so we'll teach you


---------89:22----------
a form of meditation that does not


---------89:24----------
involve you sitting there not doing


---------89:25----------
anything


---------89:26----------
okay sorry we were talking about monks


---------89:29----------
and then so i got in my head i was just


---------89:30----------
gonna


---------89:31----------
i don't just sit there and not do


---------89:32----------
anything yeah and so that's a reasonable


---------89:35----------
so that's why i challenged it jeremy


---------89:37----------
because that's


---------89:38----------
a completely reasonable response and


---------89:40----------
this is one of the things that frankly


---------89:42----------
infuriates me


---------89:43----------
is that somewhere along the way we


---------89:45----------
started to think that meditation was


---------89:46----------
only one thing


---------89:48----------
which is that you have to be tranquil


---------89:51----------
and you have to be still no [ __ ] that


---------89:53----------
okay i'm gonna blow my nose real quick i


---------89:55----------
encourage you to do the same


---------89:57----------
because i'm gonna ask you to breathe


---------89:59----------
okay this is gonna be kind of weird


---------90:00----------
okay all right i want you to sit forward


---------90:02----------
at the edge of your chair


---------90:07----------
okay and i want you to put your hands


---------90:11----------
on your knees and kind of lean forward


---------90:15----------
okay like you ever been sick to your


---------90:16----------
stomach


---------90:18----------
oh yeah yeah yeah like you know like


---------90:20----------
when you when you're sick to your


---------90:21----------
stomach and you're kind of like leaning


---------90:22----------
over


---------90:22----------
like you're trying to figure out if


---------90:24----------
you're gonna throw up or not yep yep so


---------90:26----------
that's the


---------90:26----------
the posture we're gonna we're gonna yeah


---------90:29----------
okay so


---------90:30----------
i want you guys to lean forward you all


---------90:31----------
can do this too i know it sounds it


---------90:32----------
feels kind of weird so now what we're


---------90:33----------
going to do is i'm going to


---------90:34----------
i'm going to demonstrate okay so i'm


---------90:36----------
going to put my head down i'm going to


---------90:37----------
let my head hang down


---------90:40----------
and then i'm going to breathe in and i'm


---------90:42----------
going to move my head up


---------90:47----------
and then as i exhale i'm going to come


---------90:49----------
back down


---------90:55----------
okay okay all right we don't need to sit


---------90:58----------
still


---------90:59----------
okay so head down and let your head hang


---------91:01----------
just feel that for a second okay just


---------91:02----------
let your head


---------91:03----------
really hang down sponsored by audio


---------91:06----------
technica


---------91:08----------
and now breathe so breathe in through


---------91:10----------
your nose


---------91:11----------
big breath and bring your head up


---------91:17----------
and then down


---------91:28----------
again


---------91:30----------
and out


---------91:35----------
three more breaths at your own pace


---------91:56----------
hmm


---------92:09----------
you're done just let your head hang


---------92:22----------
now we're going to do five more deep


---------92:25----------
breath


---------92:26----------
in go


---------92:30----------
now


---------92:38----------
in


---------92:40----------
out


---------92:46----------
in


---------92:52----------
out


---------92:56----------
in


---------93:00----------
out


---------93:05----------
last one


---------93:08----------
in and


---------93:11----------
out


---------93:17----------
now we're going to do the last round


---------93:19----------
last version


---------93:20----------
now we're going to do is we're going to


---------93:22----------
use our back too so i want you to hunt


---------93:24----------
your back


---------93:25----------
and then as you breathe in you're going


---------93:26----------
to move your head up and then you're


---------93:28----------
going to


---------93:28----------
raise your back and then as we breathe


---------93:31----------
out we're going to compress


---------93:32----------
and move our head down okay


---------93:36----------
okay okay so start from the


---------93:40----------
you know curve your back let your head


---------93:43----------
hang


---------93:44----------
and begin deep breath in


---------93:51----------
and then out


---------93:58----------
in as your head comes up straighten your


---------94:02----------
back and then curve the other way


---------94:04----------
all the way back and out


---------94:14----------
again deep breath in


---------94:17----------
head is up back straightens back curves


---------94:19----------
head is all the way


---------94:21----------
back and out


---------94:24----------
head starts to curve forward back starts


---------94:27----------
to straighten and then down


---------94:30----------
and then two more rounds


---------94:38----------
out


---------94:43----------
now with this last round really pay


---------94:45----------
attention to the signals in your body


---------95:03----------
and now sit up straight when you're done


---------95:20----------
how do you feel


---------95:23----------
yeah pretty good actually


---------95:28----------
yeah you gotta get gotta get that so


---------95:31----------
jeremy your emotion


---------95:33----------
is gonna be locked up not only in your


---------95:35----------
mind but in your body


---------95:37----------
so you gotta get that body moving


---------95:41----------
it's not just exercise so overwhelming


---------95:45----------
evidence suggests that mind body


---------95:46----------
practices


---------95:48----------
are superior to exercise when it comes


---------95:51----------
to physical and mental health


---------95:53----------
even things like arthritis tai chi is


---------95:56----------
superior to exercise


---------95:58----------
and it's not just about what you do with


---------96:00----------
your body it's about what you do with


---------96:01----------
your mind


---------96:03----------
and if you don't like to sit still don't


---------96:05----------
sit still


---------96:06----------
what were you thinking about or what was


---------96:09----------
your mind doing or focusing


---------96:11----------
on when you were doing the practice


---------96:15----------
nothing just there you go who's bad at


---------96:18----------
meditation now my dude


---------96:20----------
okay right yeah


---------96:24----------
that's the point to enter a no


---------96:27----------
mind state because the more time we


---------96:30----------
spend in a no mind state


---------96:32----------
imposter syndrome can't exist there


---------96:34----------
literally


---------96:35----------
it's thoughts it's emotions and the more


---------96:38----------
that you focus on the sensations in your


---------96:40----------
body


---------96:40----------
when you open yourself up when you start


---------96:43----------
to


---------96:44----------
channel your piranha and clean it out


---------96:48----------
okay i see what you mean so for you


---------96:52----------
it's not so much about meditating for


---------96:54----------
enlightenment it's really about


---------96:55----------
balancing your prana or your vital life


---------96:57----------
force


---------96:58----------
what's the uh


---------97:02----------
what's that clap the tension tension is


---------97:06----------
the two e class right


---------97:08----------
yeah yeah yeah these are like kenshin


---------97:11----------
exercises


---------97:12----------
it's nice to talk with a fellow boomer


---------97:14----------
who understands 2e because like i think


---------97:16----------
too he's the best system man


---------97:18----------
oh man oh it's so good


---------97:22----------
see here here's the interesting thing


---------97:24----------
everyone thinks like nowadays everyone's


---------97:26----------
like


---------97:26----------
caught up in balance and like tui wasn't


---------97:30----------
balanced at all but back in the day it


---------97:31----------
wasn't about balance it was about flavor


---------97:34----------
yeah haste aged you a year yeah dude


---------97:37----------
those are the days right like that [ __ ]


---------97:39----------
so good yeah every time you cast haste


---------97:42----------
you get aged for a year feels bad man


---------97:44----------
but that's the price you gotta pay


---------97:46----------
i'm human [ __ ] i'm elf nice


---------97:49----------
[Laughter]


---------97:52----------
that system was so broken man


---------97:56----------
being a bard you had to be three classes


---------97:58----------
leveled at the same time


---------98:00----------
uh yeah like a prestige class


---------98:04----------
it's good stuff no paladin there was no


---------98:07----------
such thing as a prestige class until you


---------98:08----------
do


---------98:10----------
well duel class is what you get and that


---------98:12----------
came out in uh


---------98:13----------
yeah dual class was op man yeah yeah


---------98:16----------
yeah


---------98:17----------
most op you can get because humans could


---------98:20----------
switch to a class


---------98:21----------
and then everybody else had yeah yeah


---------98:25----------
yeah humans were so op


---------98:28----------
stupid cheating humans do whatever they


---------98:30----------
want yep


---------98:31----------
yeah man they lived 40 years teehee


---------98:36----------
yeah cool dude so you you run 5e games


---------98:39----------
or what


---------98:41----------
oh i mean i


---------98:44----------
uh i've ran everything i i've i've


---------98:48----------
adverse but right now i run heavily


---------98:50----------
homebrewed fifth edition games


---------98:51----------
okay like it's um and i run it in a


---------98:55----------
custom


---------98:56----------
setting that i've worked on for well


---------98:57----------
since i was 13 so 18 years now


---------99:00----------
wow and yeah oh it's


---------99:03----------
it's definitely my life's work it's


---------99:05----------
awesome


---------99:06----------
that's great man i'm so happy about it


---------99:10----------
it's


---------99:13----------
fifth edition is a great system for


---------99:15----------
accessibility


---------99:16----------
but it lacks complexity to kind of hold


---------99:18----------
players in and to give them depth


---------99:20----------
so what i did was is i like tried to


---------99:23----------
i tried to augment that missing piece


---------99:26----------
and add it


---------99:27----------
through story elements and it's really


---------99:29----------
been working out i think


---------99:30----------
pretty pretty good the system still


---------99:32----------
limits the size of my


---------99:33----------
of my sandbox but yeah i can at least


---------99:36----------
build high


---------99:37----------
so it's pretty good yeah that's cool man


---------99:40----------
well listen dude


---------99:41----------
