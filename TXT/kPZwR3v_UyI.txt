---------00:00----------
so you guys think you're way up here and


---------00:02----------
then you beat yourself


---------00:03----------
up for being over here and so you kind


---------00:06----------
of think of yourself in like kind of a


---------00:08----------
negative way right but


---------00:09----------
at the end of the day like all of this


---------00:11----------
is built


---------00:12----------
upon the premise that you're up here


---------00:19----------
there we go welcome folks welcome


---------00:22----------
um so thank you guys very much for being


---------00:24----------
here let's go ahead


---------00:26----------
and start with um just introductions


---------00:29----------
so uh do you guys just want to tell us a


---------00:32----------
little bit about um so tell us what


---------00:34----------
you'd like to be referred to as


---------00:36----------
what you go by and then tell us a little


---------00:38----------
bit about um


---------00:40----------
kind of your story is like you're kind


---------00:42----------
of identifying as a gifted kid and what


---------00:44----------
that was like


---------00:47----------
okay um so i'm said i'm in


---------00:51----------
my final year of my college program


---------00:55----------
and so my story is in elementary school


---------00:57----------
in high school i was able to


---------00:59----------
like i didn't always hit it out of the


---------01:01----------
park but in the places that counted i


---------01:02----------
could always make things work


---------01:04----------
but then when i got to university there


---------01:06----------
were uh


---------01:08----------
there were so for example there were all


---------01:10----------
these other tasks like finding good


---------01:11----------
internships and


---------01:13----------
uh helping out professors with research


---------01:15----------
assistantships and


---------01:16----------
doing side projects and all of these


---------01:18----------
were things where i either


---------01:19----------
like did where my results were mediocre


---------01:22----------
compared to my peers or like i didn't do


---------01:24----------
them at all so


---------01:26----------
i went from a place where everything i


---------01:27----------
did like i could make work to


---------01:29----------
a state where everything i touched just


---------01:32----------
turned into ash


---------01:35----------
okay


---------01:38----------
uh i'm outcome uh do you want me to yeah


---------01:41----------
yeah


---------01:41----------
i'm outcome cool um so


---------01:44----------
and i was like labeled as like a gifted


---------01:47----------
kid like early on


---------01:48----------
uh when i was like in uh elementary


---------01:49----------
school um


---------01:51----------
and like throughout like elementary in


---------01:53----------
middle school i never really had any


---------01:54----------
problems with like any of my classes


---------01:56----------
um one of the feelings that i always


---------01:59----------
like associate with is like there was


---------02:00----------
kind of like this weird like


---------02:02----------
cast system where like i was like pulled


---------02:04----------
out of my classes and like


---------02:06----------
uh like taught different material uh and


---------02:09----------
i was always kind of like separated from


---------02:10----------
like everyone else who wasn't in like


---------02:12----------
the advanced classes and then coming


---------02:13----------
into like high school


---------02:14----------
when i had to like uh when i went to


---------02:16----------
like public high school in my second


---------02:18----------
year of high school


---------02:19----------
i had to like reintegrate so that was a


---------02:20----------
weird feeling and then on top of that


---------02:24----------
things just stopped coming as easily to


---------02:26----------
me and i realized that i never really


---------02:27----------
developed like


---------02:28----------
good study skills good time management


---------02:31----------
things like that and i was just


---------02:32----------
consistently falling behind


---------02:35----------
and this last semester in college has


---------02:36----------
kind of been like the


---------02:38----------
this uh it was my first semester in


---------02:40----------
college has been like the um


---------02:42----------
all of that like kind of conglomerating


---------02:44----------
together and i just did really poorly


---------02:45----------
and um


---------02:46----------
i'm actually dropping out this year and


---------02:48----------
i'm joining the military


---------02:52----------
okay um okay uh i'm


---------02:55----------
b i guess uh uh so basically


---------03:00----------
uh same story like uh labeled gifted kid


---------03:03----------
in like elementary school


---------03:05----------
um i did like pretty fine up until like


---------03:09----------
like pretty much until high school


---------03:10----------
finished um i graduated here early


---------03:13----------
um from like an aerospace academy uh


---------03:16----------
but i didn't really want to do like


---------03:18----------
aerospace stuff so


---------03:20----------
um i thought i might want to do


---------03:21----------
engineering things so


---------03:24----------
um i i had like a full ride scholarship


---------03:27----------
essentially


---------03:28----------
and i lost it because i um


---------03:31----------
like failed a couple of classes for


---------03:33----------
really silly reasons


---------03:34----------
um and so i decided to try to do like


---------03:39----------
engineering things so i got like a job


---------03:41----------
at an engineering firm


---------03:44----------
and um it's just not something i wanted


---------03:46----------
to do


---------03:47----------
so now i've just been doing nothing for


---------03:49----------
like the past year and a half


---------03:52----------
okay


---------03:56----------
um i can go um i go by seoul and um


---------04:00----------
yeah so i was like early on um labeled


---------04:03----------
as gift a kid or our school district had


---------04:04----------
a gifted and talented


---------04:06----------
education program uh they called it like


---------04:08----------
gate um


---------04:09----------
and yeah same story elementary middle


---------04:12----------
school high school or just like a breeze


---------04:14----------
um basically i put in minimal effort and


---------04:17----------
still got good grades which made it so


---------04:19----------
that


---------04:20----------
i didn't feel like i didn't even have


---------04:22----------
like the energy to try


---------04:24----------
uh at school and i i


---------04:29----------
that's basically where i'm at now in


---------04:31----------
university islam i'm still trying to do


---------04:33----------
the bare minimum to get good grades and


---------04:35----------
i can't find the energy to


---------04:37----------
pursue other things or like work on side


---------04:39----------
projects or try to find an internship um


---------04:42----------
yeah that's where i'm at okay


---------04:47----------
all right and i'm jacob um


---------04:50----------
yeah i grew up you know


---------04:53----------
there wasn't a gift and talented program


---------04:55----------
when i was growing up but like


---------04:57----------
kind of like forging went ahead um ended


---------05:00----------
up going to a prestigious college just


---------05:02----------
kind of


---------05:02----------
going down this constant


---------05:07----------
just kind of just going down this path


---------05:09----------
of like you know pursuing


---------05:11----------
like getting good academics and


---------05:15----------
you know just kind of going down this


---------05:17----------
vague stem


---------05:20----------
engineering path until like junior year


---------05:24----------
where all i was doing was massive and


---------05:27----------
massive massive tons of work


---------05:29----------
and like was not really socially


---------05:31----------
connected at all


---------05:32----------
and at that point i had like no


---------05:33----------
internships and whatnot it just kind of


---------05:35----------
broke down


---------05:36----------
um and then almost failed my thesis


---------05:39----------
senior year


---------05:40----------
and i had i got one job at like an


---------05:43----------
investment


---------05:44----------
firm for like four months that i ended


---------05:47----------
up like


---------05:48----------
having to leave because of anxiety and


---------05:51----------
yeah it's just


---------05:54----------
things just built up until it broke so


---------06:00----------
wow so


---------06:10----------
hmm can i think for a second


---------06:14----------
sure yeah absolutely we have to play


---------06:17----------
this card early today


---------06:23----------
um so i guess let me just think out loud


---------06:25----------
so i think they're kind of two


---------06:27----------
general we've got kind of a fork in the


---------06:29----------
road


---------06:30----------
one is how you got to be here


---------06:33----------
and the second is what you're doing


---------06:35----------
about it


---------06:36----------
right so like i'm hearing like different


---------06:39----------
things


---------06:40----------
like so some people have sort of you


---------06:42----------
know dropped out


---------06:43----------
haven't really been doing a whole lot


---------06:45----------
sort of didn't cut it some people are


---------06:47----------
sort of like


---------06:48----------
scraping by and then you've got alcohol


---------06:50----------
here who's like decided to drop out of


---------06:52----------
college and join the military


---------06:54----------
right and and so


---------06:57----------
you know i find myself kind of being


---------06:59----------
curious about


---------07:01----------
you know like and because you guys use


---------07:03----------
like some common terms right you guys


---------07:05----------
kind of talk about the extra stuff


---------07:07----------
like why it's hard to do the extra stuff


---------07:09----------
you guys talk about


---------07:10----------
lack of work ethic or like other things


---------07:13----------
that have sort of been responsible


---------07:15----------
for you know your struggles now


---------07:19----------
and then you guys also talk about um


---------07:24----------
you know the caste system and sort of


---------07:26----------
being treated differently so i think


---------07:28----------
those are all sort of things we can dig


---------07:29----------
into


---------07:30----------
i wonder a little bit about um


---------07:33----------
you know you guys talk about lacking


---------07:36----------
motivation and some of these other


---------07:37----------
things


---------07:38----------
but um i i wonder a little bit about


---------07:42----------
whether that's actually like a


---------07:44----------
misdiagnosis


---------07:45----------
and sort of digging into what it is that


---------07:47----------
like really holds you back


---------07:48----------
so if you think about applying for an


---------07:50----------
internship like literally what is the


---------07:52----------
problem that you run into


---------07:55----------
um so those are all kinds of directions


---------07:58----------
and


---------07:58----------
like i said we can sort of talk a little


---------07:59----------
bit about what it's like to be where you


---------08:01----------
are now and how you guys


---------08:02----------
made the decisions that you did yeah so


---------08:06----------
i mean is there anything that uh


---------08:08----------
actually so maybe this is a good way


---------08:10----------
so is there anything about anything else


---------08:13----------
did you hear anything from any of your


---------08:15----------
colleagues that you guys are kind of


---------08:16----------
curious about


---------08:20----------
yeah actually um the military thing


---------08:22----------
stood out like um


---------08:24----------
it's just a very big life change and


---------08:25----------
it's something that's like very scary


---------08:27----------
and


---------08:27----------
something i would never um probably


---------08:30----------
never consider doing so i'm curious


---------08:32----------
about what


---------08:32----------
made you decide to do that outcome


---------08:35----------
um yeah so one of the things like one


---------08:39----------
another like driving factor in me like a


---------08:41----------
lot of the anxiety i feel with like


---------08:42----------
going to college


---------08:43----------
is um i feel like


---------08:47----------
like i feel like in the non-stem fields


---------08:49----------
there's like a real


---------08:50----------
lack of like um like a defined path on


---------08:52----------
like how to get to like an established


---------08:54----------
career


---------08:55----------
like if you do like art drawing video


---------08:57----------
editing those can all be hard fields to


---------08:58----------
get into


---------08:59----------
because you have to go through like


---------09:01----------
independent people


---------09:02----------
like independent firms and things like


---------09:04----------
that and it's a very like


---------09:05----------
rigorous um something you like place


---------09:08----------
upon yourself like for like you you do


---------09:10----------
have to do like a lot of freelance for


---------09:11----------
like journalism and for uh drawing


---------09:13----------
and for video editing uh and then even


---------09:16----------
in the stem fields as well i feel like


---------09:17----------
there's a large over saturation


---------09:19----------
and so one of the driving forces for me


---------09:21----------
is like financial stability


---------09:23----------
and i live in the us and i mean we put a


---------09:26----------
lot of money into our military and


---------09:29----------
um you know whether or not that's a good


---------09:31----------
or bad thing is


---------09:32----------
kind of political but like at the end of


---------09:35----------
the day


---------09:36----------
that would get me you know established


---------09:38----------
as like having a career


---------09:39----------
and like kind of starting off um in a


---------09:42----------
way that like


---------09:43----------
college really doesn't give me that


---------09:45----------
level of like financial security um


---------09:50----------
and i'm doing like academic things as i


---------09:52----------
go into the navy


---------09:53----------
uh like i'm doing like a nuclear program


---------09:57----------
um and so i like i uh one of the things


---------10:00----------
like i hope that like um


---------10:01----------
i work i know that i work well with like


---------10:03----------
a very like regimented schedule


---------10:05----------
which is something that like military


---------10:06----------
academics is like notorious for


---------10:08----------
prescribing to its students


---------10:10----------
uh so i know i can like function well in


---------10:11----------
that type of environment


---------10:13----------
um and it is like a lot of hard stem


---------10:15----------
which is like something that i am good


---------10:17----------
at like just naturally


---------10:19----------
so it should come easier than if i was


---------10:21----------
doing like psychology major or something


---------10:22----------
like that


---------10:24----------
um but it's at the end of the day it


---------10:27----------
really is just kind of like


---------10:29----------
a deal of like financial security it's


---------10:31----------
available and it seems like a good


---------10:33----------
career path for me


---------10:35----------
a good way for me to get like


---------10:36----------
established as like


---------10:38----------
you know in my life


---------10:44----------
i think that makes you the bravest out


---------10:46----------
of all of us here because


---------10:49----------
the rest of us are like either we're


---------10:50----------
failing or just crawling by


---------10:52----------
and and you managed like you mentioned


---------10:54----------
before in one of our early


---------10:56----------
earlier conversations that your parents


---------10:57----------
were not really


---------10:59----------
on board with you joining the military


---------11:02----------
so


---------11:03----------
yeah i guess i commend you for having


---------11:05----------
the courage to make that move


---------11:07----------
thank you yeah that's i mean it's a lot


---------11:09----------
of it's like stressful i guess but it's


---------11:12----------
at the end of the day like it gives me a


---------11:15----------
lot of like


---------11:17----------
like i i so one of the things is like


---------11:19----------
i've never been like diagnosed with


---------11:20----------
anything but i've always struggled with


---------11:22----------
like anxiety like social anxiety


---------11:24----------
uh performance anxiety uh like


---------11:26----------
existential dread about like the future


---------11:27----------
and things like that


---------11:29----------
and so like the military just like


---------11:31----------
having like that thing where it's like


---------11:32----------
oh yeah you go in


---------11:33----------
and like after i get through basic


---------11:35----------
training like i'm kind of set


---------11:37----------
like i'm just kind of like i'm just in


---------11:39----------
there and i'm good to go for like the


---------11:41----------
next eight years of my life i'll have my


---------11:42----------
medical my


---------11:43----------
my dental and like everything covered


---------11:45----------
and that like like the amount of like


---------11:47----------
weight that that takes off of my chest


---------11:50----------
like like i can't even like


---------11:51----------
speak to how amazing that is to me


---------11:56----------
i didn't really relate to that like


---------11:57----------
wanting like um a step-by-step


---------11:59----------
sort of program that at the end will


---------12:01----------
give you security for sure i can uh


---------12:03----------
yeah i think that's really good


---------12:08----------
one of the things sorry


---------12:12----------
yeah uh one of the things that stood out


---------12:14----------
and uh this is just kind of like


---------12:16----------
i think it was uh i want to say it was


---------12:19----------
seoul that said it but it was like


---------12:21----------
or i think we all kind of like talked on


---------12:23----------
it but like like scraping by and like


---------12:25----------
doing the bare minimum


---------12:26----------
i didn't really like put words to that


---------12:27----------
but that's certainly like a feeling that


---------12:29----------
like resonates really well with me


---------12:31----------
of like i feel like through all like all


---------12:33----------
of my academics it's always just been


---------12:34----------
like a


---------12:36----------
like a very like um it's not so much


---------12:38----------
that i never had to try it's just that


---------12:40----------
like i only tried


---------12:42----------
to the point that it was like beneficial


---------12:44----------
to my grades


---------12:45----------
or the things that i could put like a


---------12:47----------
quantitative value on


---------12:49----------
where i could be like okay i sit down i


---------12:52----------
do my homework for an hour


---------12:53----------
i get like six study sheets done you


---------12:56----------
know that


---------12:56----------
that does x amount to my grade that


---------12:58----------
gives me you know


---------13:00----------
so much about like so much um


---------13:03----------
uh like points towards like the end of


---------13:05----------
my year total like if i need like a


---------13:07----------
thousand points for a semester then that


---------13:08----------
gives me like 100 points like


---------13:10----------
it's very easy for me to like


---------13:11----------
compartmentalize that and be like okay


---------13:13----------
this is how i do it


---------13:15----------
um and that's like not being able to do


---------13:17----------
that with like college


---------13:18----------
like for like a career goal that's what


---------13:20----------
scares me


---------13:22----------
um but like i think there are like other


---------13:24----------
examples of like


---------13:25----------
all of us growing up just kind of doing


---------13:26----------
the bare minimum of like that's just


---------13:28----------
kind of how we were raised


---------13:30----------
to some extent yeah so let me ask


---------13:34----------
let me ask y'all are you guys envious of


---------13:37----------
alchem


---------13:41----------
um i'm happy for him that he's found


---------13:44----------
something that he


---------13:45----------
feels comfortable doing and he's been


---------13:47----------
able to make a decision because i


---------13:49----------
haven't found that so i'm not envious


---------13:52----------
that um


---------13:53----------
like he's going to the military but i'm


---------13:56----------
i i really admire and maybe in some


---------13:58----------
aspects i'm jealous of being able to


---------14:01----------
just make a huge like decision like that


---------14:04----------
and and go through with it


---------14:05----------
i feel like like in my world or in my


---------14:09----------
mind the university is just like


---------14:12----------
a fact of reality like you ha i have to


---------14:14----------
go to university and i have to find a


---------14:16----------
job at the end of it with my degree


---------14:18----------
or like like what else is there in life


---------14:20----------
almost it feels


---------14:21----------
like that powerful to me as a construct


---------14:27----------
would you all say said jacob


---------14:31----------
what do y'all think


---------14:39----------
i mean i wouldn't say


---------14:43----------
i mean for me university wasn't that


---------14:46----------
so for me a lot of it was actually


---------14:48----------
trying to like


---------14:49----------
escape the ruts of the university


---------14:51----------
paradigm because it was like


---------14:54----------
my school is just very


---------15:00----------
much trying to


---------15:03----------
it like made everything competitive like


---------15:06----------
even the social scene


---------15:08----------
was like prestige oriented


---------15:14----------
which was yeah so it's like


---------15:21----------
so um maybe maybe at some point i was


---------15:23----------
but it's like maybe like in high school


---------15:25----------
i was but it's like


---------15:26----------
through college is kind of like


---------15:27----------
disillusioned to that


---------15:30----------
okay what were you saying said


---------15:33----------
i'm not i'm not envious of alchem in the


---------15:36----------
sense that i resent him


---------15:37----------
but uh but i guess hearing about


---------15:40----------
how well it's


---------15:43----------
i'm not envious in the sense that i


---------15:45----------
resent him but i look back on myself and


---------15:47----------
i think


---------15:48----------
goddammit said um what happened to you


---------15:55----------
and when you say what happened to you


---------15:57----------
what what


---------15:58----------
what are you what ballpark are you


---------16:00----------
pointing that question in


---------16:05----------
having taking steps towards


---------16:09----------
some semblance of a career being able to


---------16:11----------
do have some kind of


---------16:12----------
employable skill like i have i have like


---------16:14----------
a mixed bag but they're all sort of


---------16:17----------
like i obtained them just by chance i


---------16:19----------
stumbled into whatever


---------16:20----------
internships that would take me and


---------16:22----------
they're all like a mixed bag of niche


---------16:23----------
things that don't really fit together


---------16:24----------
whereas alchem seems to have taken


---------16:27----------
like a like a direct step that will


---------16:31----------
you know put some it'll add some


---------16:34----------
direction


---------16:34----------
into into his future i've just been like


---------16:37----------
sitting around here


---------16:38----------
not doing much so i i see that you guys


---------16:41----------
are steering clear basically of the word


---------16:43----------
envious but y'all are happy to use words


---------16:45----------
like admire


---------16:46----------
it has this negative connotation to it i


---------16:48----------
think it does


---------16:51----------
right and and so i think it's


---------16:53----------
interesting because like what's the


---------16:54----------
difference between admiration and envy


---------17:00----------
um well okay uh like you use the word


---------17:04----------
yourself right um it's if you resent the


---------17:06----------
other person


---------17:07----------
for their ability as well um and you


---------17:10----------
don't like


---------17:11----------
yeah interesting so you guys are you're


---------17:14----------
saying that envy


---------17:15----------
lead is coupled with resentment


---------17:19----------
i think so that's how i envision it okay


---------17:23----------
so i don't end i don't envy alkaline


---------17:25----------
that way i admire okay


---------17:27----------
so um and would you guys sort of


---------17:32----------
i thought sed did a pretty good job of


---------17:34----------
like voicing what he admires about


---------17:36----------
alchem would you guys agree with that


---------17:38----------
sentiment that like


---------17:39----------
basically alcum is like he's like taking


---------17:41----------
a step forward in a definitive way


---------17:44----------
yeah absolutely okay so if we're kind of


---------17:47----------
saying


---------17:48----------
i i want to be able to do that too


---------17:51----------
let's try to understand what how


---------17:54----------
what motivates alchem to take this step


---------17:58----------
forward


---------18:01----------
yeah how did you like start making that


---------18:04----------
decision


---------18:05----------
i guess i mean for i mean if i'm keeping


---------18:08----------
it a buck it was the


---------18:09----------
financial insecurity like um


---------18:13----------
like one of the things is i have like a


---------18:14----------
bit of a rocky relationship with my


---------18:16----------
parents and so i was moved out for a bit


---------18:18----------
and dealing with my own finances uh when


---------18:21----------
you don't have a college degree or like


---------18:23----------
any real


---------18:24----------
like uh superseding skills to merit the


---------18:26----------
only thing you can really go into


---------18:28----------
is the service industry and that [ __ ]


---------18:30----------
will like


---------18:31----------
work you dry and like you'll come home


---------18:35----------
at the end of your days


---------18:36----------
tired and beaten and it's sometimes like


---------18:38----------
60 hour work weeks


---------18:40----------
and i i was doing that on top of like


---------18:42----------
going to my community call it like my


---------18:44----------
community college and like


---------18:47----------
that shit's brutal that pardon my french


---------18:50----------
but that is brutal stuff to go through


---------18:51----------
and like


---------18:52----------
i kind of was coming towards the end of


---------18:54----------
this year and i was just like


---------18:56----------
i i can't do this like


---------18:59----------
the whatever it whatever this is like


---------19:01----------
it's not worth it


---------19:02----------
for me and so i was desperate to find


---------19:04----------
something and


---------19:06----------
um i like in the school that i went to


---------19:09----------
like my high school there was always a


---------19:11----------
strong presence of like military


---------19:12----------
recruitment


---------19:13----------
and i had like never seriously


---------19:15----------
considered it in the past past but i had


---------19:17----------
like


---------19:17----------
a few of my friends had gone into it um


---------19:19----------
and i know some people some guys in my


---------19:21----------
friends of mine who have been like


---------19:23----------
really happy with it and so that was


---------19:25----------
just like


---------19:27----------
it was kind of like there and available


---------19:28----------
and i you know sat down with my


---------19:30----------
recruiter and i talked to him about it


---------19:33----------
and i'm happy with the decision and a


---------19:36----------
lot of other


---------19:37----------
like the other people in my life were


---------19:38----------
pretty happy for me and so


---------19:41----------
i just kind of said you know


---------19:44----------
we ball and did it so what did you guys


---------19:48----------
hear


---------19:49----------
motivated outcome desperation


---------19:53----------
yep yeah that's yeah


---------19:56----------
so it's interesting right because we


---------19:57----------
think about motivation as a good thing


---------20:01----------
like we think about it as a positive


---------20:02----------
quality like we strive for motivation


---------20:05----------
but what alchem is telling us is that


---------20:07----------
his


---------20:08----------
motivation is born of desperation


---------20:13----------
and and what we're sort of hearing is


---------20:15----------
almost like a bottom of the barrel kind


---------20:17----------
of


---------20:18----------
story where like he like he hit rock


---------20:20----------
bottom like there's just


---------20:21----------
there's nowhere else to go but down and


---------20:23----------
it doesn't seem like


---------20:24----------
there's a whole lot of chance to go up


---------20:27----------
and oddly enough


---------20:29----------
i think that there's there's a lot about


---------20:31----------
alchem that i i think i can sort of


---------20:33----------
personally relate to as a gifted kid who


---------20:35----------
struggled i mean i think


---------20:36----------
out of all the groups that we've uh sort


---------20:38----------
of talked about i think you know i


---------20:40----------
identify with you all the most


---------20:42----------
and i think there's a certain


---------20:44----------
desperation to it


---------20:46----------
um i think they're also like elements of


---------20:48----------
like seeding control right so alchem


---------20:50----------
like you guys don't trust yourselves


---------20:52----------
because you're not gonna do any more


---------20:54----------
than the bare minimum


---------20:57----------
and so like all alchem has to do is like


---------20:59----------
sign up and then there's no take backs


---------21:02----------
right he he freezes absolutely he frees


---------21:05----------
himself of his mind


---------21:08----------
because it doesn't matter whether he


---------21:09----------
wants to or feels like it or whatever


---------21:11----------
because they're gonna


---------21:12----------
they're not gonna give him a choice and


---------21:16----------
and so he's like sort of seeding control


---------21:18----------
of his life and then like relying on


---------21:20----------
them to provide as he said he he


---------21:21----------
responds well to regimented structure


---------21:23----------
which i imagine actually all of you all


---------21:25----------
of y'all will


---------21:27----------
that if if there's a situation that's


---------21:29----------
challenging


---------21:30----------
and regimented and doesn't give you guys


---------21:32----------
a choice then y'all will actually do


---------21:34----------
really well


---------21:37----------
i i think though it's kind of


---------21:38----------
interesting because um


---------21:42----------
you know i'm kind of curious about


---------21:46----------
ego alchem do you think that your


---------21:49----------
your ego has anything to do with your


---------21:51----------
decision


---------21:55----------
can you elaborate a bit more on what you


---------21:57----------
like


---------21:58----------
i mean


---------22:01----------
i don't know could you could you like


---------22:02----------
ask the question a different way i'm


---------22:04----------
kind of confused by it


---------22:05----------
absolutely um


---------22:08----------
how do you feel about yourself joining


---------22:11----------
the military


---------22:16----------
i mean i'm i'm happy with the decision i


---------22:19----------
like i think it's a good decision yeah


---------22:23----------
like growing up


---------22:24----------
um i've always had like like i feel like


---------22:27----------
the reason i always did well in school


---------22:28----------
is because like it wasn't a choice


---------22:30----------
it was like you know you wake up like


---------22:33----------
you know and your mom is like all right


---------22:34----------
get in the car


---------22:35----------
or you know it's like hey the school


---------22:37----------
school bus is here


---------22:38----------
or like your dad takes you or whatever


---------22:40----------
the situation is and you go and you sit


---------22:42----------
you can't really like leave


---------22:44----------
right and your teachers are your


---------22:45----------
authority figures they tell you what to


---------22:47----------
do


---------22:48----------
and you just kind of you got the


---------22:50----------
regimented schedule


---------22:51----------
and it i mean it feels really good that


---------22:54----------
like


---------22:55----------
it's kind of like obviously it's not


---------22:57----------
like super self-imposed but the fact


---------22:58----------
that it's like


---------23:00----------
it's a decision that i'm making but i


---------23:02----------
also know that like once i


---------23:04----------
kind of like what you stick with what


---------23:05----------
you said once i signed that we know


---------23:06----------
whether or not i want to do it


---------23:08----------
i'm in i'm in for however many years i


---------23:10----------
signed up for right


---------23:12----------
um like at that point that's pretty like


---------23:14----------
it feels great


---------23:17----------
yeah so let me ask the question a


---------23:18----------
different way how do you feel telling


---------23:20----------
other people that you're joining the


---------23:21----------
military


---------23:25----------
kind of weird uh i so


---------23:28----------
um i mean the military is


---------23:31----------
is like a really good opportunity for me


---------23:33----------
but it's like out of


---------23:35----------
it's kind of out of pocket for me uh


---------23:37----------
it's not something that i would like


---------23:38----------
ever really consider doing um


---------23:42----------
it was kind of something like it was


---------23:43----------
born out of desperation and it's not


---------23:45----------
really like within


---------23:46----------
myself to do it like i wouldn't like


---------23:48----------
just by the choice between like going to


---------23:50----------
college like if you had asked me three


---------23:51----------
years ago i would have never said i was


---------23:52----------
going to the military


---------23:53----------
that would have been like the bottom of


---------23:55----------
the list um so i'm kind of apprehensive


---------23:57----------
about it


---------23:58----------
um but like the way i tell people about


---------24:01----------
it


---------24:02----------
um and how do people usually respond


---------24:07----------
they're normally like oh wow that's a


---------24:09----------
great decision you know that'll be great


---------24:10----------
for you


---------24:11----------
and all of that stuff so what did y'all


---------24:14----------
notice about everyone shared their story


---------24:17----------
and how did who did we gravitate towards


---------24:21----------
the one who'd made a decision or who'd


---------24:24----------
done something


---------24:24----------
right so what when alcam shares what


---------24:27----------
he's done what is he met with


---------24:31----------
praise praise


---------24:34----------
admiration and so let's just think a


---------24:37----------
little bit about


---------24:38----------
you know before the decision outcome so


---------24:41----------
where was he before he decided to join


---------24:42----------
the military where was he


---------24:46----------
very low spot right


---------24:50----------
so failed out of college sounds like or


---------24:52----------
dropped out or something


---------24:54----------
yeah and and so so i i think because


---------24:58----------
i i sort of saw pieces of this in myself


---------25:01----------
i don't think joining the military is a


---------25:02----------
bad idea by the way just for the record


---------25:04----------
but i want us to understand a little bit


---------25:05----------
about


---------25:06----------
why we make decisions and like what


---------25:08----------
drives us


---------25:10----------
so like alchem gives us a very logical


---------25:13----------
reason


---------25:14----------
the first reason he gave us was super


---------25:16----------
logical it's for financial security


---------25:19----------
it makes sense like if he's like anxious


---------25:20----------
about his financial security and whatnot


---------25:22----------
like it's a good reason


---------25:23----------
we dig a little bit further and we get


---------25:25----------
to desperation


---------25:28----------
right that like even though he sort of


---------25:30----------
talks about financial insecurity that


---------25:32----------
like


---------25:32----------
he's living this life and he wakes up


---------25:34----------
one day and he's like i can't live this


---------25:36----------
life anymore


---------25:37----------
i have to live a different one


---------25:40----------
and i think oddly enough what you guys


---------25:43----------
maybe admire about him


---------25:45----------
and here i could be projecting but i


---------25:48----------
almost remember like i used to wish for


---------25:50----------
catastrophe


---------25:52----------
i i used to wish for being tested you


---------25:56----------
know i


---------25:56----------
i wanted to like just like what i what i


---------26:00----------
was what i hated more than anything else


---------26:02----------
was like


---------26:02----------
limbo and like not needing to scrape by


---------26:05----------
like i would have been fine if if you


---------26:07----------
had said


---------26:08----------
i'm gonna drop you into an arena and you


---------26:10----------
have to fight a lion to the death and


---------26:12----------
i'm gonna give you a club i would have


---------26:14----------
been like


---------26:14----------
hell yeah let's go baby yeah


---------26:18----------
right give me death or give me glory


---------26:21----------
like i just can't stay stuck in between


---------26:23----------
anymore


---------26:26----------
you guys feel that way oh yes


---------26:30----------
tell me about that absolutely jacob


---------26:33----------
oh there's so many so i the the jo


---------26:37----------
like the weird thing i tell my friends


---------26:38----------
honestly i'd feel better when i'm sick


---------26:41----------
i'd actually be more productive when i


---------26:42----------
got


---------26:43----------
sick because like expectations would


---------26:45----------
drop and it's just like oh what can i


---------26:47----------
get done while i'm feeling crummy and i


---------26:49----------
actually get more done


---------26:50----------
but like there's so many i i there's


---------26:53----------
like


---------26:54----------
so many dimensions of like


---------26:59----------
like my anxiety dropped when cove had


---------27:02----------
happened


---------27:03----------
um i felt better and like more


---------27:06----------
eager to be productive when covet


---------27:08----------
occurred um


---------27:11----------
let's see what else uh


---------27:16----------
my mom recently got diagnosed with


---------27:19----------
cancer


---------27:21----------
and that wasn't great but it's like


---------27:26----------
it wasn't like crushing it was like


---------27:30----------
i think for like the week around that i


---------27:32----------
was like a little bit more productive


---------27:34----------
like it's it's very bizarre


---------27:38----------
like


---------27:42----------
is that something that you all can


---------27:43----------
relate to


---------27:47----------
maybe earlier i think um


---------27:50----------
i tried taking advantage of the fact


---------27:53----------
that i would act under


---------27:55----------
under um if i had no other choice and i


---------27:58----------
i tried i tried saying okay if i sign


---------28:00----------
myself for all these other things then


---------28:01----------
which will all be catastrophes if they


---------28:03----------
fail


---------28:04----------
then i'll do them but then i didn't and


---------28:07----------
then the catastrophe happened and i


---------28:08----------
survived and i realized that


---------28:10----------
i guess there is no way out maybe that's


---------28:14----------
just


---------28:17----------
yeah so like so so like you guys see


---------28:18----------
what y'all are doing is that you're not


---------28:21----------
it's actually brilliant and sad so like


---------28:24----------
what set is doing is he's


---------28:26----------
he recognizes that he can't motivate


---------28:28----------
himself


---------28:30----------
right so he like recruits the outside


---------28:32----------
world to put deadlines on to him


---------28:36----------
and the same thing that outcomes doing


---------28:40----------
it's like i'm gonna i can't control


---------28:42----------
myself so i'm going to create


---------28:44----------
a situation in which there's artificial


---------28:47----------
desperation and i'll be forced to act


---------28:51----------
and then sad really gets screwed because


---------28:54----------
he doesn't act


---------28:55----------
and then you know what the really


---------28:56----------
damning thing is about not acting


---------28:59----------
is that he survives


---------29:02----------
see if he had really been punished then


---------29:05----------
he would act the next time


---------29:08----------
does that make sense like the real


---------29:10----------
damning thing is that like the


---------29:12----------
consequences weren't bad enough


---------29:15----------
because if the consequences were bad


---------29:16----------
then if he did it again then he would


---------29:18----------
act


---------29:18----------
you all see that does that make sense


---------29:22----------
yeah so um yeah that's really what i'm


---------29:25----------
interested in is


---------29:26----------
um i feel like anyone if they're in a


---------29:28----------
life or death situation


---------29:29----------
gravitates towards life or if they're in


---------29:31----------
a catastrophic situation they do


---------29:33----------
anything they can to get out of it but


---------29:34----------
um


---------29:36----------
if you're not in that place how do you


---------29:39----------
go towards ambition or like success uh


---------29:43----------
yeah i i don't understand how people


---------29:45----------
have the energy for for that kind of


---------29:46----------
motivation and not not like um


---------29:48----------
just avoiding death


---------29:52----------
so tell us what it's like to not have


---------29:54----------
energy


---------29:55----------
right the extra stuff


---------30:00----------
i don't want revenge go ahead


---------30:04----------
okay um i um


---------30:07----------
oh well it doesn't feel great uh it's


---------30:09----------
like the days just kind of


---------30:12----------
slip by you do your work and then i


---------30:15----------
don't know you play some games um


---------30:17----------
and then like yeah the time just gets


---------30:19----------
filled with things that are


---------30:20----------
not really valuable to you but then you


---------30:23----------
don't even know what the things that


---------30:24----------
are valuable you don't know what is


---------30:26----------
valuable to you


---------30:27----------
so you just kind of


---------30:30----------
yeah time just looks fine that's the


---------30:32----------
best way i can describe it


---------30:36----------
it feels kind of like like monotonous or


---------30:39----------
anonymously monotonously not necessarily


---------30:41----------
flipping pages


---------30:42----------
like you're just kind of like going from


---------30:44----------
one day to the next


---------30:45----------
um like when i was going through this


---------30:47----------
last thing i was also working a lot and


---------30:49----------
it was just like this kind of like day


---------30:51----------
in day out


---------30:52----------
wake up do school go to work just like


---------30:56----------
kind of like this dread


---------30:57----------
and like whenever i had free time i was


---------31:00----------
like


---------31:01----------
like you know i was doing like partying


---------31:04----------
or like


---------31:04----------
doing drugs or like something to fill


---------31:07----------
the time


---------31:08----------
um and it was just like i don't know i


---------31:11----------
was like hellish


---------31:13----------
i could like feel myself kind of almost


---------31:14----------
like decaying


---------31:16----------
but it felt like i couldn't do anything


---------31:18----------
about it


---------31:19----------
like i couldn't take the first step


---------31:25----------
it's just like gray and dystopian


---------31:32----------
seriously like it is right oh yeah


---------31:34----------
absolutely


---------31:39----------
what i'm really appreciating is that


---------31:40----------
we're talking about this with a bunch of


---------31:42----------
[ __ ] gifted kids so the number of


---------31:43----------
syllables per word is so high


---------31:49----------
monotonously in dystopian


---------31:58----------
yeah it's just


---------32:01----------
it's rough out there for us yeah we are


---------32:04----------
we all just going through it


---------32:06----------
i said did you want to say something oh


---------32:10----------
um do you ever watch revenge of the sith


---------32:12----------
where anakin's


---------32:13----------
anakin's just burning up and obi-wan


---------32:15----------
screams at him for failing in his duties


---------32:17----------
to be the chosen one


---------32:19----------
it's like every day it's like i have two


---------32:21----------
choices it's either


---------32:22----------
it's either that or i numb myself and


---------32:25----------
there's


---------32:26----------
and there's no option to and like the


---------32:29----------
option to actually do


---------32:30----------
something is blocked by like a version


---------32:32----------
of me that that says


---------32:34----------
well we're not going to do that what are


---------32:35----------
you going to do about that said


---------32:37----------
and yeah so it's either numb myself or


---------32:40----------
screaming myself and nothing happens


---------32:42----------
either way


---------32:44----------
good you want to say something b


---------32:48----------
um i i don't know i i feel like


---------32:52----------
uh


---------32:55----------
any anything that i would say would be


---------32:56----------
kind of is kind of like really


---------32:57----------
overshadowed by


---------32:59----------
the kind of problems that i've like


---------33:01----------
heard i guess


---------33:03----------
um doesn't really feel relevant


---------33:08----------
say it anyway um


---------33:11----------
i it's just like basically echoing with


---------33:13----------
what they're saying and like to a lesser


---------33:14----------
extent


---------33:15----------
of um uh so like when i


---------33:20----------
got out of uh when i like lost my


---------33:22----------
scholarship and i'm like just basically


---------33:24----------
at home doing nothing um for like a year


---------33:27----------
and a half it's been


---------33:28----------
like awesome uh i haven't had to do


---------33:31----------
anything


---------33:31----------
right uh and just being able to coast


---------33:35----------
and


---------33:37----------
um play games all day and uh


---------33:40----------
you know maybe you know look for a job


---------33:42----------
sometimes and


---------33:43----------
or do something just to cast yeah


---------33:47----------
like i i there's no there's no


---------33:49----------
responsibility that i have to to take


---------33:52----------
care of


---------33:54----------
and it's kind of like scary that that


---------33:55----------
feels good so


---------33:57----------
i don't know so i have a question for


---------34:00----------
seth and the rest of all


---------34:01----------
who are you sad says i know who i am


---------34:06----------
right and it's either scream at myself


---------34:08----------
or be myself


---------34:10----------
so who are you


---------34:16----------
i wonder if that's a trick question


---------34:17----------
because um


---------34:19----------
who am i is a question i've been asking


---------34:21----------
myself for


---------34:22----------
every day for the past uh 19 years of my


---------34:24----------
life um


---------34:26----------
and it's and yeah it's evolved a lot


---------34:29----------
um but like at this point i kind of


---------34:32----------
separate myself from


---------34:33----------
the idea of like self or identity like i


---------34:37----------
separate identity and


---------34:38----------
what i consider to be the existence of


---------34:41----------
me if that makes any sense


---------34:45----------
i does it make sense to people


---------34:49----------
yeah well not really


---------34:52----------
not to me there's like two different


---------34:54----------
kinds of identities


---------34:56----------
i think there's one that you ascribe


---------34:57----------
yourself and then one that


---------34:59----------
other people ascribe you um


---------35:03----------
and it just depends which one you care


---------35:06----------
about more


---------35:08----------
will be uh more of who you are i don't


---------35:10----------
know


---------35:12----------
so not to get like overly philosophical


---------35:14----------
but the way that i see


---------35:16----------
like like there's like some like inner


---------35:19----------
me


---------35:19----------
that is just like experiences and


---------35:21----------
feelings


---------35:22----------
and then there's like an outer me that


---------35:24----------
is like actually can think and speak and


---------35:26----------
form thoughts and


---------35:27----------
has values beliefs ideas like ascribed


---------35:30----------
onto it


---------35:31----------
um and i want to be like


---------35:35----------
more i want to like dissolve all the


---------35:39----------
parts that are identity and just be like


---------35:42----------
okay existing


---------35:45----------
because i feel like identity puts a lot


---------35:46----------
of pressure on you too


---------35:48----------
well to be certain things


---------35:51----------
um and if you're not those things then


---------35:53----------
then who are you so like if you place


---------35:55----------
all


---------35:55----------
your value self-worth or who you are on


---------35:57----------
your identity then


---------35:59----------
when your identity is challenged you you


---------36:01----------
are challenged


---------36:03----------
so solely what is we'll get there


---------36:08----------
so who here resonates


---------36:12----------
with what soul is saying like who here


---------36:13----------
is like


---------36:15----------
sort of or like i'm not really too sure


---------36:17----------
or like yeah man


---------36:19----------
yeah i i didn't forget it the first but


---------36:22----------
the second time


---------36:23----------
i kind of like i kind of get it for me


---------36:26----------
the word i used to describe it is like a


---------36:27----------
mantle


---------36:28----------
it's like this i like this like ideal


---------36:31----------
self


---------36:32----------
that like i would love to live into that


---------36:33----------
i would love to be


---------36:35----------
uh but like and not even like in like


---------36:38----------
um like overly high standards sometimes


---------36:41----------
sometimes it's just like a pretty low


---------36:42----------
bar


---------36:44----------
um and it's sometimes it's just hard for


---------36:46----------
me to like live into that


---------36:47----------
like it's hard for me to reach there and


---------36:49----------
it feels kind of like defeating


---------36:51----------
and so i'd certainly get the feeling of


---------36:53----------
like kind of just wanting to be like


---------36:56----------
like detached from that or like like get


---------36:58----------
rid of it just kind of like cast it


---------37:00----------
aside


---------37:01----------
because i often feel like when i don't


---------37:03----------
live into it i'm disappointed with


---------37:04----------
myself


---------37:07----------
yeah and the hard thing about the mantle


---------37:09----------
i i really love that you tossed in that


---------37:10----------
detail outcome is that


---------37:12----------
oftentimes you expect so little from


---------37:15----------
yourself


---------37:16----------
and that's what's so crushing when you


---------37:18----------
can't even do that


---------37:20----------
yeah right it's like one thing to be


---------37:23----------
perfect but it's like another thing to


---------37:25----------
like okay let me just like work on my


---------37:26----------
resume for like 15 minutes today


---------37:30----------
and you can't even do that yeah


---------37:34----------
crushing so


---------37:38----------
i'll i'm gonna ask sad but you know once


---------37:40----------
again


---------37:41----------
anyone can kind of jump in i appreciate


---------37:42----------
when people do so sad when you say that


---------37:44----------
either you're screaming at yourself or


---------37:46----------
you're being yourself like what are


---------37:47----------
like who is that cell like what who are


---------37:49----------
you tell us about


---------37:51----------
who you are and how you view yourself


---------37:54----------
i guess i see myself as so like i had a


---------37:57----------
good shot


---------37:58----------
at i guess uh


---------38:02----------
i suppose i have a vision of of myself


---------38:04----------
that would get


---------38:05----------
things right you know like who would


---------38:07----------
have gotten the right internship or


---------38:09----------
who would have actually um put more


---------38:12----------
effort into those responsibilities or


---------38:14----------
would have prevented the catastrophe


---------38:16----------
and then there's but then who i am is


---------38:19----------
is the person who failed to do all of


---------38:21----------
that so


---------38:23----------
sometimes sometimes i feel like i'm just


---------38:26----------
a guy who


---------38:26----------
who had a shot and threw it away and now


---------38:29----------
i've just missed the boat


---------38:31----------
and i'm like stranded here in limbo


---------38:37----------
does anybody resonate with that feeling


---------38:44----------
b can you tell us like what your


---------38:46----------
experience of that is like or what you


---------38:48----------
think about yourself or what thoughts


---------38:50----------
you have


---------38:51----------
about yourself um


---------38:54----------
sure so um i guess


---------38:57----------
in terms of like missing missing the


---------38:59----------
shot right i had like this


---------39:01----------
you know full like full ride of you know


---------39:04----------
i can


---------39:04----------
pretty much get through all of college


---------39:06----------
and or at least four years and


---------39:08----------
um have no debt and you know that's what


---------39:12----------
everyone wants right so


---------39:14----------
i have this this you know ability to do


---------39:17----------
this


---------39:18----------
and you know i sleep in for a test


---------39:22----------
that's worth 30 percent of my grade


---------39:24----------
i just don't do any work in a class that


---------39:29----------
i don't think matters but uh then when


---------39:31----------
those two things add together the


---------39:33----------
you know i just lose my whole


---------39:34----------
scholarship right so


---------39:37----------
um it's


---------39:41----------
like i i still have this ego of oh i


---------39:43----------
know i can do it


---------39:45----------
uh but i didn't uh and this like doesn't


---------39:48----------
match up


---------39:49----------
uh of i don't know yeah


---------39:54----------
so yeah i missed i missed my shot


---------39:58----------
yeah so let's talk about that ego for a


---------40:00----------
second like i know i can do it


---------40:04----------
what do you guys think are you guys


---------40:06----------
capable


---------40:08----------
or not


---------40:12----------
depends


---------40:15----------
jacob you want to go yeah i i mean it


---------40:19----------
it depends on the task


---------40:22----------
and personally also depends whether i


---------40:24----------
can zone into it


---------40:26----------
like like in college in high school like


---------40:30----------
everything was like


---------40:31----------
kind of like if i could get into a flow


---------40:35----------
state and like focus on it i could


---------40:36----------
get it done and if i couldn't it was


---------40:39----------
just like


---------40:39----------
pulling teeth and


---------40:44----------
like as i got out of culture did more


---------40:46----------
and more stuff the proportion of things


---------40:48----------
that were


---------40:49----------
pulling teeth uh increased


---------40:53----------
um


---------40:56----------
and so it's like


---------41:00----------
yeah like i i'm not certain if i could


---------41:04----------
hold down like a full-time job right now


---------41:07----------
or like


---------41:10----------
yeah i feel like you know like certain


---------41:12----------
problems i like very good


---------41:15----------
like i feel like there's a very like


---------41:17----------
there's some set of things that i can do


---------41:18----------
very well and there's just like but like


---------41:20----------
a general holistic life probably not so


---------41:25----------
how does it feel to say that jacob to


---------41:27----------
say those words out loud


---------41:30----------
uh i mean i've been coming to terms with


---------41:34----------
it for like


---------41:36----------
the last few months so it's not


---------41:40----------
oh it's not like a huge shock at the


---------41:41----------
moment but


---------41:45----------
i don't know it's been relieving coming


---------41:46----------
to terms with that so


---------41:49----------
actually over time what is it what do


---------41:51----------
you guys think that jacob is coming to


---------41:53----------
terms with


---------41:58----------
his idea that he's in some sense like


---------42:01----------
short of his ideal self and that's who


---------42:03----------
he is now


---------42:08----------
what would you say jacob how how


---------42:10----------
accurate is that


---------42:12----------
um i mean the way i describe it with


---------42:15----------
people is that like


---------42:19----------
like the entire time like it's like


---------42:22----------
you're preparing for a war


---------42:23----------
like i've been making like a jet like


---------42:25----------
working really hard to make like


---------42:27----------
a giant like battleship turret and i get


---------42:30----------
to the end and they're like all right


---------42:31----------
are you ready to mount it on your


---------42:33----------
battleship it's like


---------42:34----------
no i don't it's i just have like this


---------42:36----------
massive gun that i have to like


---------42:37----------
carry around with like a little bicycle


---------42:40----------
and chain


---------42:41----------
because like there's nothing there to


---------42:43----------
actually support like you know


---------42:45----------
going through like four years of college


---------42:47----------
and developing like eight billion


---------42:48----------
technical skills and like


---------42:50----------
philosophy of the universe when it's


---------42:51----------
just like


---------42:53----------
you know i can't sleep and i like


---------42:57----------
struggle to take care of an apartment


---------42:59----------
and like


---------43:00----------
i can't network whatsoever and like


---------43:04----------
i have no like the i haven't even


---------43:06----------
started thinking about


---------43:08----------
like at no point was like developing the


---------43:09----------
navigation computer to figure out where


---------43:11----------
we're actually going with this thing


---------43:13----------
and it's like so


---------43:17----------
yes i can send a 500 kilogram projectile


---------43:22----------
very far


---------43:22----------
if it's like standing still placed right


---------43:25----------
in front of me


---------43:27----------
but we're not doing anything useful with


---------43:30----------
that thing


---------43:31----------
so what i'm hearing is that


---------43:36----------
jacob has faith that he can do it in a


---------43:39----------
perfect set of circumstances


---------43:44----------
right if the stars align and he's


---------43:48----------
but his his temperamental self otherwise


---------43:50----------
he feels somewhat


---------43:51----------
incapable you know when you factor in


---------43:54----------
like the real world and


---------43:56----------
all the problems that come with it yeah


---------43:58----------
yeah


---------44:00----------
right now i think there's a lot of like


---------44:03----------
powerful imagery there about the sense


---------44:05----------
of it slipping away


---------44:07----------
right because jacob used to be decent at


---------44:09----------
the flow state


---------44:10----------
and i don't know if you guys sort of


---------44:11----------
felt this but then like something


---------44:13----------
happens and it becomes harder


---------44:15----------
like and then each day becomes like like


---------44:18----------
you used to be okay


---------44:20----------
you used to be able to pull it off often


---------44:23----------
enough


---------44:24----------
and then you see yourself slipping then


---------44:27----------
like


---------44:28----------
you can barely pull it off often enough


---------44:30----------
and then you can't really pull it off


---------44:33----------
as much as you need to and then it


---------44:35----------
becomes less


---------44:36----------
and less and it's sort of like okay so


---------44:39----------
you're


---------44:39----------
you know i think someone used the phrase


---------44:41----------
like i missed the boat


---------44:43----------
right so like the boat is there and


---------44:44----------
you've got 15 minutes to board and


---------44:46----------
you're like okay that's no big deal and


---------44:47----------
then five minutes to board and it's like


---------44:49----------
oh god


---------44:50----------
and they're like pulling they're like


---------44:51----------
pulling the you know the walkway away


---------44:53----------
and like if you run right now you can


---------44:55----------
still like


---------44:56----------
jump across and like get on board and


---------44:59----------
then the jump becomes longer


---------45:01----------
and then you're like but you can still


---------45:02----------
do it and then like you like it starts


---------45:04----------
to pull away and maybe you can jump in


---------45:05----------
the water and even if you jump in the


---------45:06----------
water


---------45:07----------
like they'll throw you a line and you


---------45:08----------
can climb on board but like every day


---------45:10----------
goes by and it's like slipping away and


---------45:12----------
you're like


---------45:12----------
watching it slip


---------45:16----------
away


---------45:20----------
what's that like soul i see you nodding


---------45:23----------
emphatically


---------45:25----------
um yeah i definitely felt that um


---------45:28----------
during like early no last year when


---------45:32----------
i was in a class and like yeah the


---------45:34----------
classes are always so


---------45:35----------
easy at the beginning and you understand


---------45:37----------
everything


---------45:38----------
and you're doing the assignments


---------45:40----------
everything's just going well and then


---------45:42----------
each lecture gets a little more and more


---------45:44----------
abstract and difficult for you to


---------45:45----------
understand


---------45:46----------
and uh at the end you're like okay i


---------45:49----------
need to


---------45:49----------
like review everything study everything


---------45:51----------
make sure i have everything right so i


---------45:52----------
can actually


---------45:52----------
get past the final and um and pass and


---------45:55----------
maybe you don't even do that because


---------45:58----------
you are just procrastinating or


---------46:00----------
something


---------46:01----------
um i feel to the question you asked


---------46:04----------
earlier about like whether you're


---------46:05----------
capable


---------46:06----------
um i want to see if other people relate


---------46:07----------
to this too


---------46:09----------
i feel like i could learn to do anything


---------46:12----------
if i had the energy to that i don't have


---------46:16----------
like


---------46:16----------
the way it's modeled in my head is that


---------46:17----------
i don't have the energy to do


---------46:19----------
any of that or the passion whatever you


---------46:21----------
want to call it


---------46:24----------
yeah yeah i feel that


---------46:35----------
i don't know if that's exclusive to us


---------46:37----------
though um


---------46:38----------
i think uh


---------46:42----------
the difference between or or one of like


---------46:44----------
the major


---------46:45----------
differences between like uh like a


---------46:47----------
gifted kid or


---------46:48----------
like you know like an average kid i


---------46:49----------
don't know would be


---------46:51----------
one is told that they're


---------46:54----------
like like better basically from a young


---------46:57----------
age and


---------46:58----------
you know they have this ideology that


---------47:00----------
they get to keep up


---------47:02----------
they get to say oh i am this so i can


---------47:04----------
push forward with it


---------47:06----------
um and i think that that


---------47:10----------
that gets you so far uh or only so far


---------47:13----------
um could i um rephrase for a second um


---------47:18----------
yeah yeah so i i definitely understand


---------47:20----------
that like everyone has this problem


---------47:21----------
obviously but um what i mean


---------47:24----------
in the aspect that's particular to us is


---------47:25----------
that um


---------47:27----------
like do you guys like doubt your


---------47:30----------
intelligence or like your ability to


---------47:34----------
to learn things and process things


---------47:35----------
quickly because that's something that


---------47:37----------
stays like constant to me


---------47:39----------
and it's like the only barrier if i


---------47:42----------
could just unlock that potential by like


---------47:43----------
giving it a boost


---------47:44----------
with energy would be like that's like


---------47:47----------
the only barrier to me is the energy


---------47:48----------
thing and like


---------47:49----------
i have confidence in almost every other


---------47:51----------
aspect


---------47:52----------
of like being able to learn and do


---------47:55----------
things


---------47:57----------
yeah that's kind of what i mean when i


---------47:59----------
talk about like the battleship analogy


---------48:01----------
it's like


---------48:02----------
yes if i could support this i could


---------48:05----------
level


---------48:05----------
everything but i can't support it


---------48:08----------
and it sucks yeah like i i feel like


---------48:12----------
i've got like the like the


---------48:14----------
the baseline like like i feel like


---------48:17----------
maybe i don't know maybe that's like the


---------48:18----------
intuitive problem solving or like


---------48:20----------
something


---------48:21----------
like i've got the things that i need to


---------48:23----------
like like if i wanted to like learn a


---------48:25----------
new skill


---------48:26----------
or like like try to like you know um


---------48:29----------
like work on like marketing myself for


---------48:31----------
like marketing you know x product i'm


---------48:33----------
working on or whatever like i feel like


---------48:34----------
i could do that


---------48:35----------
but it just feels like i yeah like i


---------48:38----------
don't know the energy like i don't have


---------48:39----------
the passion for it like i just kind of


---------48:41----------
like


---------48:42----------
sit down and one of the things is like i


---------48:44----------
start asking myself like why am i


---------48:45----------
like why am i doing this you know like


---------48:47----------
what for what reason and i get bogged


---------48:49----------
down in like this endless loop of like


---------48:51----------
well


---------48:52----------
you know like why is it important to me


---------48:54----------
and then like i come upon like


---------48:55----------
self-identity like who am i


---------48:57----------
why is it important to like me why it's


---------48:58----------
important to like my ideal self and i


---------49:00----------
just get like


---------49:01----------
shut down and i kind of like shut myself


---------49:03----------
down before i even have the ability to


---------49:05----------
like


---------49:05----------
engage with like the the critical


---------49:07----------
thinking skills that like


---------49:09----------
that i know or at least i hope that i


---------49:10----------
have


---------49:14----------
for you guys kind of relate to this idea


---------49:17----------
of like shutting yourself down before


---------49:19----------
you even get started


---------49:24----------
yeah can you guys share what that what


---------49:27----------
your experience of that is


---------49:31----------
so it starts with like an idea and


---------49:33----------
you're very excited about it


---------49:35----------
and then you think about every other


---------49:37----------
idea you've had in the past


---------49:38----------
and it tapering off and failing in the


---------49:41----------
middle of it or towards the end


---------49:42----------
and you're like you know let's get ahead


---------49:44----------
of the curve on this one and not waste


---------49:45----------
all that time


---------49:50----------
and by waste that time you mean try yeah


---------49:57----------
yeah it's not quite the same for me but


---------50:00----------
it'll be like


---------50:01----------
i have like i have like


---------50:04----------
several projects that i've been like


---------50:05----------
working on over like the whole


---------50:08----------
few years and it's like you know it's


---------50:12----------
like


---------50:12----------
if i really want like one of these


---------50:15----------
things to go like i have to sacrifice


---------50:18----------
and it's like do i really want to like


---------50:20----------
is this worth sacrificing devoting


---------50:22----------
myself to and it's like


---------50:24----------
and then like you know i'll get into


---------50:25----------
like that mindset where it's like well


---------50:27----------
previously like you know sacrificing


---------50:29----------
like devoting yourself single-mindedly


---------50:31----------
has


---------50:31----------
you know landed me in very miserable


---------50:34----------
deen states and


---------50:35----------
or situations where i'm like unbalanced


---------50:38----------
and miserable and so it's just like


---------50:40----------
i kind of linger in that


---------50:43----------
state of like you know kind of


---------50:46----------
poking at a bunch of different things


---------50:48----------
and like kind of keeping the dream alive


---------50:50----------
kind of


---------50:52----------
but


---------50:54----------
said it sounded like you had something


---------50:55----------
to say oh


---------50:57----------
um i guess for me it's like


---------51:01----------
uh maybe it was easier earlier but now


---------51:03----------
that i've had i guess


---------51:05----------
uh four or five years of seeing


---------51:08----------
myself being able to do things but just


---------51:10----------
not doing them


---------51:12----------
it's like when i try something when i


---------51:14----------
think about trying something new it's


---------51:15----------
like i see


---------51:16----------
the whole history of all of all my


---------51:18----------
failures staring back at me and accusing


---------51:20----------
me


---------51:21----------
so i just don't start because facing


---------51:24----------
that is just too terrifying


---------51:26----------
what's terrifying about it


---------51:34----------
i guess so there's there's the numbing


---------51:37----------
path and there's the screaming path and


---------51:39----------
so i can i can keep myself kind of


---------51:42----------
stable


---------51:43----------
when when i'm numbing myself but then to


---------51:46----------
to get to face that history again then


---------51:49----------
like


---------51:50----------
all the old voices that scream at me and


---------51:52----------
say like


---------51:53----------
why did you [ __ ] this up this is so easy


---------51:56----------
um


---------51:57----------
that just it's just too harsh


---------52:00----------
i can't i can't like function when


---------52:05----------
when when it feels like


---------52:08----------
yeah i'm not i'm not too sure how to put


---------52:10----------
it towards but it it feels like i


---------52:12----------
it feels like reality changes and i see


---------52:15----------
myself for what i am and what i am is


---------52:17----------
like someone who has failed and will


---------52:19----------
fail


---------52:20----------
and like every step of the way i'm doing


---------52:23----------
things imperfectly is like


---------52:24----------
and a voice in my mind says ah yes you


---------52:26----------
see i was right all along


---------52:28----------
we've been through this before i know


---------52:30----------
you we've seen this


---------52:32----------
i know what you're doing


---------52:37----------
it gets even harder because it's like


---------52:39----------
you get stuck in this numbing space and


---------52:40----------
the only thing


---------52:41----------
to like you know you have to get out of


---------52:43----------
that numbing space but the only thing


---------52:44----------
waiting there is this onslaught of pain


---------52:47----------
and it's like


---------52:58----------
hmm


---------53:02----------
so you know


---------53:06----------
there's a part of me like there are a


---------53:07----------
lot of questions i still want to ask but


---------53:08----------
i i sort of feel like


---------53:10----------
if we start asking questions about you


---------53:12----------
know i really liked what bee said about


---------53:15----------
sort of the expectations that you grew


---------53:17----------
up with and like how you were


---------53:19----------
taught to expect things from yourself


---------53:22----------
you know what the impact of being told


---------53:25----------
that you're capable and bright and


---------53:27----------
talented like


---------53:28----------
i think that's really important to talk


---------53:29----------
about but i


---------53:32----------
i also feel like we're sort of bizarrely


---------53:34----------
kind of at the climax of the discussion


---------53:36----------
right now because this is


---------53:37----------
it right i feel like we have found


---------53:40----------
the problem do you guys feel that


---------53:47----------
i can't really put a name to it yeah


---------53:51----------
i i mean i can't put a name to the


---------53:52----------
problem at least but i mean do you guys


---------53:54----------
feel like


---------53:55----------
this is the problem like whatever we're


---------53:57----------
talking about right now


---------53:59----------
is the problem yeah right so you can


---------54:02----------
call it like motivation you can call it


---------54:04----------
passion you can call it whatever


---------54:07----------
but like there's this idea of like


---------54:09----------
decaying


---------54:10----------
right that you're like stuck in this


---------54:12----------
place and like


---------54:14----------
you're like at some halfway point


---------54:17----------
and outside there's a terrible storm and


---------54:19----------
either you open the door and then like


---------54:23----------
you face the storm and then you like


---------54:25----------
walk for a little while and there's no


---------54:27----------
end in sight the storm is going back so


---------54:28----------
you turn around and you kind of like


---------54:30----------
you go back to your like halfway point


---------54:34----------
you know the save zone like and then you


---------54:37----------
you save and then you're at the end


---------54:39----------
you refill your hp and then you just


---------54:40----------
hang out there because there's nothing


---------54:42----------
there's nothing on the outside


---------54:45----------
and then what happens is since y'all are


---------54:46----------
smart like every time


---------54:48----------
you leave and you don't get anywhere


---------54:53----------
then you stop wanting to leave because


---------54:55----------
what's the point


---------54:58----------
like said said we've been here before


---------55:01----------
what did you expect dumbass


---------55:04----------
did you expect the hurricane to stop at


---------55:06----------
some point


---------55:10----------
this is who you are this is what your


---------55:12----------
life has become


---------55:15----------
why bother and then we get to be


---------55:19----------
like actually this life is pretty sweet


---------55:23----------
like sure i feel like a failure as a


---------55:26----------
human being


---------55:28----------
but i've got my snug blanket pretty


---------55:30----------
comfortable it's all good


---------55:33----------
to stop some noobs from time to time


---------55:35----------
it's not that bad


---------55:38----------
so then what happens is you guys start


---------55:40----------
making this halfway point your own


---------55:43----------
right it's not transient for you anymore


---------55:45----------
it starts to become a home


---------55:48----------
you start to decorate and turn it into


---------55:51----------
your own place


---------55:54----------
and then you start to feel stuck


---------55:57----------
because like the longer you stay there


---------55:59----------
like the more comfortable it becomes


---------56:02----------
and then there's like there's just


---------56:04----------
something and then like now this is


---------56:05----------
where you guys are


---------56:07----------
where like you wish what would happen is


---------56:09----------
like some kind of dragon would show up


---------56:11----------
and like knock down your


---------56:12----------
temporary shelter and then you guys


---------56:14----------
would have no choice


---------56:17----------
you know it's like the at the end of


---------56:18----------
metroid have you guys played metroid any


---------56:20----------
of the metroids


---------56:21----------
it's boomers now see it's [ __ ] sad


---------56:24----------
i've played tons of


---------56:25----------
right right so at the end of metroid


---------56:28----------
they have this really cool mechanic


---------56:29----------
where like everything


---------56:30----------
starts falling apart you have three


---------56:31----------
minutes to get out


---------56:33----------
like it happens at the end of all the


---------56:34----------
metroid games you have to escape like


---------56:36----------
after you beat the last boss you have to


---------56:38----------
escape in time


---------56:39----------
and like that's what you guys want you


---------56:40----------
want like you know flooding where you


---------56:42----------
have no choice where you've got to go


---------56:44----------
like you've just got to go


---------56:46----------
give me death or give me glory


---------56:47----------
absolutely


---------56:50----------
because this sort of like weird comfort


---------56:52----------
limbo kind of place and there's like


---------56:54----------
and every i like the the problem is that


---------56:56----------
the longer you stay


---------56:58----------
the stronger the hurricane outside


---------57:00----------
becomes because you are the hurricane


---------57:03----------
right the the longer you stay there the


---------57:06----------
more you beat yourself


---------57:07----------
up when you try to leave what did you


---------57:10----------
expect


---------57:10----------
dumbass and so each time you guys


---------57:15----------
try it's like it's terrible because like


---------57:17----------
each failure doesn't make you stronger


---------57:19----------
so you know we we say that what kills


---------57:21----------
you what doesn't kill you makes you


---------57:22----------
stronger right you guys heard that


---------57:23----------
phrase


---------57:25----------
i've heard it and strongly disagree what


---------57:28----------
would you say jacob


---------57:30----------
um


---------57:36----------
i'll know it just depends on what the


---------57:38----------
thing is


---------57:40----------
so i'll tell you what we say in medicine


---------57:42----------
which is quite bleak and we don't


---------57:43----------
advertise this very much


---------57:46----------
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger


---------57:48----------
or cripples you for life


---------57:52----------
because that's what happens in medicine


---------57:53----------
like when you get someone with a motor


---------57:54----------
vehicle accident


---------57:56----------
they survived and they have no legs


---------57:59----------
gg good job right because that's really


---------58:03----------
what life is like like life leaves marks


---------58:07----------
like trauma doesn't always result in


---------58:10----------
triumph like we see in the movies


---------58:12----------
sometimes what it results in is like


---------58:13----------
debilitating


---------58:14----------
complex ptsd in which people like suffer


---------58:17----------
for years


---------58:22----------
i guess this isn't sounding very hopeful


---------58:28----------
but i i think it's important to


---------58:30----------
understand


---------58:31----------
you know what you guys are facing


---------58:33----------
because i'm going to try to trick you in


---------58:34----------
a second


---------58:35----------
because i want you guys to like like i


---------58:36----------
think part of this pro part of the


---------58:38----------
problem here is that you guys are like


---------58:39----------
thinking about potential


---------58:41----------
and i think a lot of this stuff has to


---------58:42----------
do with like ego and identity in who you


---------58:45----------
think you are


---------58:45----------
and what you think you're capable of and


---------58:48----------
it's like not


---------58:49----------
respecting what your challenges are


---------58:53----------
it's like you guys don't respect what


---------58:57----------
you're actually fighting against you


---------58:59----------
think it's easy


---------59:00----------
you think it's minimal and therein lies


---------59:04----------
the problem


---------59:05----------
because like instead of treating it like


---------59:07----------
a lion you feel like you're losing to a


---------59:09----------
mouse


---------59:10----------
even though it's a lion and the more


---------59:12----------
that you recognize that it's actually a


---------59:13----------
lion and not a mouse


---------59:17----------
the funny thing is like that's gonna


---------59:18----------
create your best self


---------59:21----------
right that's gonna actually recruit like


---------59:23----------
give me death or give me glory


---------59:26----------
but the problem is that you guys don't


---------59:28----------
think you're facing a line like you you


---------59:30----------
you devalue your failures


---------59:33----------
so if you lose to something strong that


---------59:36----------
doesn't make you weak


---------59:38----------
but you guys think you're weak


---------59:42----------
does that make sense like it's a truth


---------59:45----------
of yourself that


---------59:46----------
like and and i think you guys have


---------59:47----------
started to realize this


---------59:49----------
right you all sort of started to figure


---------59:51----------
this out that like that's not really you


---------59:53----------
but that


---------59:53----------
you guys have been given this mantle


---------59:55----------
right like you guys have been given this


---------59:57----------
burden you're gifted things should be


---------60:00----------
easy for you dumbass


---------60:03----------
and so there's something that's actually


---------60:05----------
really devastating about gifted kids is


---------60:07----------
that they


---------60:07----------
they're not allowed to make mistakes


---------60:12----------
so if i i'd say there's one thing that's


---------60:13----------
holding you guys back it's that you guys


---------60:15----------
don't allow yourself to make a mistake


---------60:19----------
if you're stupid and you fail is that


---------60:20----------
okay


---------60:26----------
it depends on the failure okay


---------60:30----------
[ __ ] jacob with his five-head answer


---------60:33----------
overthinking things well i mean that


---------60:34----------
that like so like you know there's


---------60:36----------
something which you're just okay for me


---------60:38----------
to fail


---------60:39----------
but like you know like i'm considering


---------60:41----------
like career options and you know like


---------60:44----------
some of them are you know more stable


---------60:45----------
and like there's some of them are more


---------60:47----------
creative and you know like


---------60:49----------
running out my finances and like like


---------60:53----------
like getting evicted is not like


---------60:56----------
like there's certain like i have a hard


---------60:58----------
time determining whether potential


---------61:00----------
failures are worth it or not


---------61:03----------
are you allowed to fail jacob


---------61:09----------
am i allowed to fail


---------61:14----------
it's very esoteric they're like weird


---------61:17----------
for champ


---------61:21----------
yeah who's judging whether we're allowed


---------61:24----------
or not i guess it's us


---------61:25----------
right so this is the problem


---------61:29----------
i'm asking a yes or no question and what


---------61:32----------
are you guys


---------61:33----------
answering with


---------61:36----------
i don't know open response open response


---------61:41----------
i'm not allowed to fail too badly


---------61:48----------
okay right so i think the first thing


---------61:51----------
that you guys need


---------61:52----------
to let yourselves do is fail


---------61:55----------
but you don't like you guys can't even


---------61:57----------
[ __ ] for all your five-headedness


---------62:00----------
you guys can't even comprehend the


---------62:01----------
question like what does that mean


---------62:03----------
like do you guys see how foreign the


---------62:04----------
concept is to you


---------62:08----------
like well i understand the question i


---------62:11----------
just have a hard time answering it


---------62:12----------
because


---------62:12----------
um if i'm asked are you allowed to fail


---------62:15----------
i i guess i would um be like uh like if


---------62:20----------
i made a mistake or if i failed i would


---------62:22----------
be like oh dumbass don't do it again and


---------62:24----------
then


---------62:25----------
i actually move on pretty quickly after


---------62:27----------
that so i'm not sure that i'm


---------62:29----------
similar to everyone in that regard


---------62:33----------
okay so what i'm hearing from seoul is


---------62:36----------
yes i feel like i know that i can fail


---------62:42----------
but i i still always i just


---------62:45----------
like what said said like it goes back


---------62:47----------
it's like it goes into the repertoire of


---------62:48----------
like the


---------62:49----------
the however many years of [ __ ] that like


---------62:51----------
looks back at you and screams


---------62:54----------
yep like right so i can but it'll come


---------62:57----------
back and haunt me


---------62:58----------
no no but see that's the thing is you're


---------63:00----------
not allowing yourself


---------63:02----------
to fail so like like understand this so


---------63:04----------
the first thing is that


---------63:07----------
stock answer but generally speaking what


---------63:09----------
holds you back in life is you


---------63:12----------
right like that's just how it works


---------63:15----------
generally speaking and so what is it


---------63:18----------
about you that's holding yourself back


---------63:20----------
and you guys have done a beautiful job


---------63:21----------
of like describing it


---------63:22----------
right it's like the way that you


---------63:26----------
punish yourself in the way that you view


---------63:28----------
yourself you make a mistake


---------63:31----------
and then you yell at yourself for that


---------63:33----------
and then you start to believe


---------63:35----------
that you're someone who makes mistakes


---------63:39----------
you are a [ __ ] up you are a dumb ass


---------63:41----------
you're incapable


---------63:42----------
you're not going to be able to do it why


---------63:44----------
bother


---------63:46----------
and now suddenly like you're you know


---------63:50----------
you just don't realize who you are and


---------63:52----------
like you're playing the game with a


---------63:53----------
different character


---------63:55----------
and if you're playing the game with like


---------63:56----------
a different character like the character


---------63:57----------
who has like


---------63:58----------
two scales he has two skills instead of


---------64:01----------
like succeed or fail he has fail or fail


---------64:03----------
harder


---------64:04----------
it's like you can hit button one and you


---------64:05----------
can fail you can hit button two and fail


---------64:07----------
harder and like that's the


---------64:08----------
that's the game you guys are playing


---------64:12----------
and then the more you play that


---------64:14----------
character the more you level up your two


---------64:15----------
skills


---------64:17----------
which are fail and fail harder


---------64:21----------
and that's the voice right you're


---------64:24----------
leveling up that skill and then like you


---------64:26----------
beat yourself


---------64:27----------
up even more and then you tell yourself


---------64:30----------
like why bother you're a failure like


---------64:31----------
you're not able to do it see


---------64:33----------
i told you so


---------64:37----------
and so like you guys are operating under


---------64:41----------
the belief and i don't blame you for


---------64:43----------
this it's just like let's understand


---------64:44----------
right and i'm gonna i'm gonna zero in on


---------64:46----------
sad because i think


---------64:47----------
he's used like really good language to


---------64:49----------
describe this which is like


---------64:50----------
he's got two choices either fail or yell


---------64:53----------
at himself


---------64:56----------
and so what i'm hearing from you guys is


---------64:58----------
that you guys aren't allowed to fail and


---------64:59----------
there's a damn good reason that you guys


---------65:01----------
have been conditioned


---------65:02----------
like i don't think it's a coincidence


---------65:05----------
that all of you guys don't allow


---------65:06----------
yourself to fail


---------65:08----------
and i think like maybe alcum is letting


---------65:10----------
himself do that a little bit and i think


---------65:12----------
jacob's sort of getting there


---------65:16----------
but generally speaking i think that


---------65:18----------
there's there's like a reason why this


---------65:20----------
is a common pattern


---------65:22----------
i think it goes back to like what your


---------65:23----------
expectations were because early on


---------65:26----------
you weren't allowed to fail and so you


---------65:28----------
didn't understand what failing


---------65:30----------
looked or felt like right so like if i'm


---------65:33----------
feeding my three-year-old and she like


---------65:35----------
dropped something


---------65:36----------
on the floor that's something she's


---------65:37----------
allowed to do


---------65:39----------
like she's allowed to make mistakes


---------65:42----------
and it's like acceptable but i think the


---------65:45----------
challenge is that you guys were given i


---------65:47----------
love this


---------65:47----------
this phrase that malcolm said you guys


---------65:49----------
were given a mantle


---------65:53----------
right here we have b graduated one year


---------65:56----------
early


---------65:57----------
from an aerospace academy i don't even


---------65:59----------
understand what the [ __ ] what is that


---------66:01----------
i don't even heard of that it's just


---------66:03----------
like a


---------66:05----------
like a specialized academy so like i


---------66:07----------
mean


---------66:08----------
first of all they call it an academy


---------66:11----------
right it's not a school i haven't gone


---------66:14----------
to a school that's not an academy but


---------66:16----------
cases right so what kind of


---------66:19----------
expectations does he put him on himself


---------66:22----------
when he's like i haven't gone to a


---------66:24----------
school that


---------66:24----------
isn't i haven't gone to a school that


---------66:26----------
isn't an academy


---------66:30----------
right and like i don't blame b for that


---------66:33----------
but like just think about what that does


---------66:34----------
to the psychology of a child like i'm


---------66:36----------
not going to send my


---------66:36----------
son to a [ __ ] school that's not an


---------66:38----------
academy with the plebs


---------66:44----------
y'all are different y'all are gifted


---------66:48----------
failure's not an option


---------66:51----------
gg too hot to handle percent


---------66:56----------
f felt felt too targeted


---------67:01----------
maybe he felt shame because he went to


---------67:03----------
school with cinnamon again


---------67:07----------
oh so said bro


---------67:13----------
yeah um welcome back yeah loading back


---------67:16----------
up


---------67:18----------
right so like i think it starts with


---------67:20----------
with sort of this idea that you guys


---------67:21----------
aren't


---------67:21----------
allowed to fail and then what happens is


---------67:23----------
you guys kind of get into this cycle


---------67:25----------
which is like every failure adds to the


---------67:28----------
voice that screams at you


---------67:31----------
but like do you guys see how like that


---------67:33----------
voice can only scream at you if you like


---------67:35----------
you're to blame or the outcome wasn't


---------67:37----------
acceptable


---------67:38----------
does that make sense or did i lose you


---------67:40----------
guys there i don't know how to explain


---------67:41----------
this but like


---------67:42----------
if you're allowed to fail there's no


---------67:44----------
reason for the voice to yell at you


---------67:47----------
because it's an acceptable outcome


---------67:52----------
yeah can somebody yeah


---------67:57----------
i was gonna say just like because when


---------67:58----------
you ask the question like are you


---------67:59----------
allowed to fail


---------68:01----------
uh who's who's judging whether you're


---------68:02----------
allowed or not and


---------68:04----------
if it's you then you just have to you


---------68:07----------
have to be okay with it


---------68:09----------
yeah so i'll ask you guys so like let's


---------68:11----------
assume for a moment it's you and we'll


---------68:13----------
it's always you by the way


---------68:15----------
but we'll we'll get to you know even


---------68:17----------
like the identity that you show other


---------68:19----------
people


---------68:21----------
like that's still you doing the judgment


---------68:22----------
it's that you're putting on the mask of


---------68:25----------
other people before you judge yourself


---------68:28----------
right yeah it's weird


---------68:32----------
it's always you doing judging i mean


---------68:34----------
sometimes you guys may have grown up


---------68:35----------
with people like and i mean


---------68:37----------
sort of untrue too because you guys did


---------68:40----------
grow up with people


---------68:41----------
judging you and then that's how you


---------68:43----------
learn how to judge yourself but like you


---------68:46----------
perceive it as being them but it's not


---------68:47----------
really them it's you it was them at some


---------68:49----------
point


---------68:50----------
but now it's not


---------68:54----------
right so like if we think about social


---------68:55----------
anxiety you think


---------68:57----------
other people are going to judge you that


---------68:58----------
way but other people are too busy


---------69:00----------
thinking about the way you're judging


---------69:01----------
them


---------69:03----------
they're not actually judging you but you


---------69:06----------
put yourself


---------69:07----------
you put on their mask when you judge


---------69:09----------
yourself


---------69:13----------
so now i'll ask you so like


---------69:16----------
whose judgment are you guys really


---------69:18----------
facing


---------69:22----------
right like think about your own life and


---------69:25----------
like your experience of the day to day


---------69:32----------
fine


---------69:36----------
and what do you say about yourself what


---------69:38----------
do you think about yourself


---------69:43----------
and not always the best things sometimes


---------69:45----------
of a dick to myself


---------69:51----------
i know but i feel like i deserve it


---------69:55----------
that's it


---------70:00----------
right and so you guys wonder why you're


---------70:04----------
stuck


---------70:06----------
so like


---------70:10----------
you know the quickest way to get rid of


---------70:12----------
motivation is to explain to people


---------70:14----------
that they don't deserve something


---------70:16----------
because then they'll stop asking for it


---------70:22----------
right if you don't think that something


---------70:23----------
is actually a possibility for you you're


---------70:25----------
not going to try it because you're smart


---------70:32----------
and i think that like when we kind of


---------70:33----------
talk about passion


---------70:35----------
and motivation and energy so i think


---------70:38----------
these are all umbrella terms


---------70:42----------
it's like what i need is like i would i


---------70:44----------
would be


---------70:46----------
i just need that magic bullet but like


---------70:48----------
there aren't magic bullets like human


---------70:50----------
beings are complicated


---------70:53----------
right so you guys are like like i need


---------70:55----------
more motivation i can't find


---------70:56----------
motivation whereas it's like i i don't i


---------70:59----------
j in seoul you may be a little bit


---------71:01----------
different but


---------71:02----------
um but i think for the most part


---------71:05----------
what i want you guys to really


---------71:06----------
understand is that like


---------71:08----------
it's your own judgment that creates the


---------71:11----------
hurricane that


---------71:12----------
keeps you trapped where you are


---------71:15----------
and that that hurricane like you taught


---------71:17----------
you are conditioned to judge yourself


---------71:19----------
that way so it's not in a sense it's not


---------71:20----------
your fault


---------71:21----------
it's just like other people place this


---------71:23----------
mantle upon you


---------71:24----------
and then you've like learned how to like


---------71:26----------
put it on every day


---------71:29----------
and then what happens is like they're so


---------71:31----------
so this is the real challenge is that if


---------71:32----------
you're


---------71:33----------
if you're stupid you're allowed to fail


---------71:35----------
and you can get up tomorrow and you can


---------71:37----------
try


---------71:39----------
right if you like i played a a game of


---------71:41----------
dota recently like


---------71:42----------
against a pro gamer like a good pro


---------71:46----------
gamer and boy did i get


---------71:47----------
i mean i got crushed it was like


---------71:49----------
laughable


---------71:51----------
and then after i was done i was like


---------71:53----------
let's play again


---------71:58----------
right because give me glory or give me


---------71:59----------
death like that's cool man


---------72:03----------
like all i and this is the thing is like


---------72:05----------
this is what i think is really awesome


---------72:07----------
about like our community and the way


---------72:08----------
that


---------72:09----------
we get misjudged by the world is like


---------72:11----------
they look at us


---------72:12----------
and they think we're pathetic and we


---------72:15----------
look at ourselves and we think we're


---------72:16----------
pathetic but i don't think we're


---------72:17----------
pathetic at all i think we're actually


---------72:19----------
awesome like we're


---------72:20----------
gonna be wrecking shitties real soon


---------72:22----------
here


---------72:23----------
right and and like what


---------72:27----------
the thing is but but if i if i have


---------72:29----------
expectations that i


---------72:31----------
like i am amazing


---------72:34----------
and then i like lose a game like then


---------72:36----------
it's so much more devastating right i


---------72:38----------
can't pick myself up off the mat


---------72:41----------
and that's what you guys can't do like


---------72:43----------
as the boat


---------72:45----------
like gets inches further and further


---------72:47----------
away from the dock like you can't pick


---------72:50----------
yourself


---------72:50----------
up off the mat


---------72:53----------
does that make sense like you can't


---------72:56----------
queue up again


---------72:58----------
it's like each time you fail it doesn't


---------73:01----------
help you


---------73:02----------
grow it like cripples you further


---------73:08----------
y'all with me yeah yes


---------73:11----------
and so then the question is like why is


---------73:14----------
that and i think it all has to do with


---------73:15----------
this expectation of what you're capable


---------73:17----------
of because if you flip it on its head


---------73:19----------
like let's say you


---------73:20----------
flip it and you say that all of you guys


---------73:23----------
are


---------73:23----------
you know suck at life


---------73:27----------
and you start with that and the funny


---------73:30----------
thing is jacob is like slowly working


---------73:32----------
his way there


---------73:33----------
right it's like relieving it's relieving


---------73:35----------
when you start begin to realize that


---------73:38----------
success in life is not based on one stat


---------73:42----------
that you guys have all these other stats


---------73:44----------
and actually despite having


---------73:46----------
one stat and you guys sort of understand


---------73:48----------
this intellectually but i don't think


---------73:49----------
you


---------73:50----------
feel it when you get up on a day-to-day


---------73:52----------
basis is that like you guys were given a


---------73:54----------
stat


---------73:55----------
that was so high that you didn't have to


---------73:57----------
develop these other things then you


---------73:58----------
blame yourself for like


---------73:59----------
not being able to succeed when it


---------74:01----------
depends on more than intellect


---------74:05----------
and i think our value our society in


---------74:07----------
general overvalues intellect because


---------74:09----------
intellect in and of itself is an


---------74:11----------
umbrella term


---------74:13----------
we call kids smart even if they're


---------74:14----------
hardworking


---------74:16----------
it's like what we say about people right


---------74:18----------
like oh you're smart things should be


---------74:20----------
easy for you and then if you start to


---------74:23----------
stumble what is wrong with you dumbass


---------74:25----------
things should be easy for you


---------74:27----------
and it's that part that keeps you guys


---------74:29----------
stuck


---------74:33----------
does that make sense yeah


---------74:37----------
yeah yeah i just have not figured like


---------74:40----------
i get that consciously but it's like


---------74:44----------
subliminally it still happens even if


---------74:46----------
i'm consciously telling myself that


---------74:48----------
absolutely i've been trying to like


---------74:50----------
clear up my house and like make it


---------74:51----------
better and then like


---------74:53----------
two days ago like my drain got clogged


---------74:56----------
and like the grinder got like shorted


---------74:58----------
and it's like


---------74:59----------
like not even my fault but it's like i


---------75:02----------
was still out for like the day just


---------75:04----------
emotionally yeah


---------75:07----------
right so so now you guys have a couple


---------75:09----------
of problems


---------75:11----------
which is that you all have been sitting


---------75:12----------
at this like halfway point for so long


---------75:14----------
that you all have become deconditioned


---------75:16----------
you've rusted


---------75:19----------
right so i want you guys to start


---------75:21----------
thinking of yourselves in a bizarre way


---------75:23----------
is like way worse than what you think of


---------75:25----------
yourself


---------75:27----------
like i know that sounds weird i know it


---------75:29----------
sounds weird so let me explain


---------75:30----------
so you guys think you're way up here and


---------75:33----------
then you beat yourself


---------75:34----------
up for being over here and so you kind


---------75:37----------
of think of yourself


---------75:38----------
in like kind of a negative way right but


---------75:40----------
at the end of the day like


---------75:41----------
all of this is built upon the premise


---------75:44----------
that you're up here


---------75:46----------
you guys get that you can't be a


---------75:49----------
disappointment without a high


---------75:50----------
expectation of yourself


---------75:53----------
and so what are you what do we do huh is


---------75:56----------
it true


---------75:57----------
w oh yeah not true


---------76:00----------
i'm a boomer um


---------76:04----------
so what i want you guys to do is start


---------76:05----------
like lowering your expectations


---------76:09----------
right and i know it sounds kind of weird


---------76:10----------
but like i think in general like i'm a


---------76:12----------
big fan if you guys have watched


---------76:13----------
me before of like letting go of


---------76:14----------
expectations and so like really meet


---------76:17----------
yourself where you're at


---------76:20----------
right and like understand that like some


---------76:23----------
of y'all are gonna be like y'all are all


---------76:25----------
like so the big so here's the biggest


---------76:27----------
scam of being a gifted kid


---------76:30----------
you know so you guys you guys familiar


---------76:31----------
with like league of legends and dota


---------76:34----------
oh yeah yes yeah okay oh yeah so let me


---------76:36----------
ask you guys something gifted kid


---------76:38----------
what position are they in league of


---------76:39----------
legends


---------76:42----------
mid laner


---------76:45----------
incorrect y'all are all adc's


---------76:49----------
you come online late disrespectful


---------76:54----------
and this is the big thing right is we


---------76:55----------
all assume that we should come on


---------76:57----------
online fast and early as gifted and


---------77:00----------
talented kids


---------77:01----------
hell be skip degrade


---------77:05----------
right so we think that like we're we're


---------77:06----------
like upfront powerhouses and it should


---------77:08----------
be easy for us


---------77:09----------
and it's not untrue but in my experience


---------77:14----------
you guys come online late and when you


---------77:17----------
hit the ground


---------77:18----------
running like it's gonna be like a sight


---------77:20----------
to see


---------77:22----------
and you will be all of the things that


---------77:24----------
you think you are but in order to get


---------77:26----------
there you have to start by not being any


---------77:28----------
of those things


---------77:30----------
you guys don't understand that like


---------77:31----------
y'all are actually playing


---------77:33----------
a handicapped class


---------77:37----------
it's not a gifted class y'all are


---------77:39----------
[ __ ] handicapped


---------77:41----------
and that's why like my my one of my


---------77:42----------
teachers told me like a special needs i


---------77:45----------
mean


---------77:45----------
a gifted child is a special needs child


---------77:47----------
and i was like what are you talking


---------77:48----------
about and then she like


---------77:49----------
sat down and explained to me blew my


---------77:50----------
mind that y'all literally have needs


---------77:53----------
that are different from other people


---------77:57----------
right like you guys have challenges that


---------77:59----------
are different from other people and sure


---------78:00----------
a lot of this is shared and stuff like


---------78:02----------
that


---------78:04----------
but i genuinely do think like y'all's


---------78:06----------
needs in the way that you need to be


---------78:07----------
challenged and stuff like that and


---------78:09----------
and that's why like the only source of


---------78:10----------
of like success for


---------78:12----------
gifted people is usually desperation


---------78:15----------
because that creates the environment


---------78:17----------
that is necessary for you


---------78:18----------
to thrive but if you just stop and think


---------78:20----------
about that like that's one hell of a


---------78:22----------
handicap right it's like


---------78:23----------
one hell of a way to min max your


---------78:25----------
character


---------78:27----------
my motivation is going to be purely


---------78:29----------
dependent on my circumstances and


---------78:30----------
whether i'm waiting tables and failing


---------78:32----------
out of college


---------78:35----------
it's like some hyper-specialized like


---------78:37----------
character that has like


---------78:38----------
plus a thousand percent damage and


---------78:40----------
resistance towards one enemy type and


---------78:42----------
does zero damage


---------78:43----------
and has vulnerability to all the others


---------78:45----------
that's what you guys are playing


---------78:49----------
and we can hear it from you right we


---------78:52----------
heard it from jacob


---------78:54----------
he's like if all the stars align i can


---------78:57----------
one shot


---------78:58----------
this shitty


---------79:02----------
but otherwise i'm gonna get wrecked


---------79:06----------
bros you guys are gifted y'all are


---------79:08----------
handicapped


---------79:12----------
wonderful and honestly that was my big


---------79:15----------
realization


---------79:16----------
it was like i'm not gifted


---------79:19----------
i'm dumb and then you're playing a


---------79:22----------
completely different game becomes way


---------79:24----------
more fun


---------79:27----------
because then like you don't beat


---------79:28----------
yourself up for your failures


---------79:31----------
it's like if you guys play dark souls


---------79:34----------
yeah


---------79:35----------
okay not most people you guys know what


---------79:36----------
a deprived is


---------79:39----------
sorry i get the deuce


---------79:43----------
right so like like there are different


---------79:44----------
characters you can be in dark souls like


---------79:45----------
you could be like a knight


---------79:47----------
have like armor and a sword and you can


---------79:50----------
be


---------79:51----------
like a mage and have like a staff and


---------79:53----------
stuff right like pretty straightforward


---------79:54----------
then you could be deprived which is a


---------79:56----------
dude with like


---------79:56----------
tiny whities in a club just like a naked


---------80:00----------
dude with a club like that's the way


---------80:01----------
we're gonna play this game


---------80:04----------
so my first round of dark souls i was


---------80:06----------
like i'm going to try to be as powerful


---------80:07----------
as possible and then i did terribly


---------80:09----------
second time i played i was like i'm


---------80:11----------
going to play deprived because [ __ ] yeah


---------80:13----------
give me a club give me a pair of undies


---------80:15----------
and let's go [ __ ]


---------80:21----------
and so what i'm not hearing from you


---------80:23----------
guys is let's go [ __ ]


---------80:27----------
right like when you when you think about


---------80:28----------
like applying to a job or working on


---------80:30----------
your resume or anything like that it's


---------80:32----------
like


---------80:33----------
oh my god you have to succeed like oh my


---------80:35----------
god you suck


---------80:36----------
oh my god you should be able to do this


---------80:39----------
better


---------80:41----------
why do you suck so hard you're so smart


---------80:43----------
i hear all that stuff what i don't hear


---------80:46----------
is like let's go [ __ ]


---------80:48----------
let's see what we can do


---------80:52----------
right like if you guys start to like say


---------80:55----------
that about yourself


---------80:56----------
think that about yourself like start to


---------80:58----------
get to know


---------80:59----------
who you really are because i think you


---------81:01----------
guys are also stumbling on this idea


---------81:02----------
that like


---------81:03----------
this person that i think i am is like


---------81:05----------
not who i am


---------81:07----------
this person that like society has


---------81:08----------
constructed for me is like not who i am


---------81:12----------
so who are you like you don't know yet


---------81:15----------
so like


---------81:15----------
try to learn


---------81:22----------
i feel like i've talked the most that i


---------81:24----------
have during any of these group


---------81:25----------
interviews so i'm gonna pause for a


---------81:27----------
second and check in with you guys


---------81:30----------
i have a question yeah so um generally


---------81:35----------
uh if i'm getting this right like our


---------81:36----------
problem is that our or one of our


---------81:38----------
problems is that like uh we're setting


---------81:39----------
our expectations too high and they


---------81:41----------
should be lowered because we're not


---------81:42----------
we think we're up here but we're


---------81:43----------
actually down here or something like


---------81:44----------
that yep how do we


---------81:46----------
how do we know where to lower our


---------81:47----------
expectations to how can we


---------81:50----------
possibly be objective about where they


---------81:51----------
should land you don't


---------81:53----------
need to be objective do we just start at


---------81:56----------
rock bottom


---------81:57----------
or not like rock bottom sure as low as


---------81:59----------
you can go okay


---------82:01----------
also uh i thought i thought earlier you


---------82:03----------
were saying um


---------82:05----------
that like with the analogy of fighting a


---------82:07----------
mouse


---------82:08----------
uh or like we think we're fighting a


---------82:10----------
mouse but it's actually a line


---------82:12----------
i thought you were going to go down the


---------82:13----------
route of like we'll raise the


---------82:15----------
raise the level of your problem like say


---------82:17----------
that it's


---------82:18----------
or realize that it's a bigger problem


---------82:20----------
than it actually is [ __ ] you and your


---------82:22----------
five heads


---------82:22----------
the result is the same right whether i


---------82:25----------
transform a


---------82:26----------
mouse into a lion or i turn myself


---------82:30----------
into a hobbit like the result is the


---------82:32----------
same


---------82:33----------
right right but one i have to like i


---------82:35----------
have to ruin my ego and that's really


---------82:36----------
hard you know


---------82:37----------
yeah so that's that's the that's the


---------82:40----------
other thing which is holding you guys


---------82:41----------
back


---------82:42----------
like i don't buy for a second that alcom


---------82:44----------
part of the reason he's joining the


---------82:46----------
military


---------82:47----------
is because he gets to be the person that


---------82:49----------
he always wanted to be


---------82:51----------
there is no way that you guys being as


---------82:54----------
five-head as you all are


---------82:56----------
on some subconscious level alchem


---------82:58----------
realizes that when he mentions military


---------83:00----------
everyone is gonna admire him i'm not


---------83:02----------
saying it's a bad decision i'm not


---------83:04----------
saying that it's


---------83:04----------
isn't genuine but i think that like


---------83:07----------
there's a reason why he's joining the


---------83:08----------
military after failing out of college


---------83:10----------
instead of before


---------83:15----------
right and i'm not saying i really really


---------83:17----------
do i'm not trying to no yeah absolutely


---------83:19----------
you're on the money on that one i think


---------83:20----------
yep


---------83:22----------
it's a it's [ __ ] ego because i i know


---------83:24----------
because i felt this like i see


---------83:26----------
myself in all of you to begin with but


---------83:28----------
especially


---------83:29----------
that's why i went to india and i was


---------83:30----------
like i'm gonna become a monk


---------83:32----------
because then i'll be better in all all


---------83:34----------
you noobs


---------83:37----------
so rather than be stupid even though


---------83:39----------
i've told i i was smart and i skipped a


---------83:41----------
grade


---------83:42----------
i remember like walking into my first


---------83:44----------
grade class but


---------83:45----------
in first grade i walked into the


---------83:47----------
classroom on the first day


---------83:49----------
and then the teacher like gave us a


---------83:50----------
worksheet and i did it in five minutes i


---------83:52----------
handed to her and i was like can i have


---------83:53----------
the next one


---------83:54----------
then she gave me the next one i did that


---------83:55----------
one in five minutes and then she gave me


---------83:57----------
like


---------83:58----------
the one from like two months from now


---------84:00----------
and i did that one and then she gave me


---------84:01----------
the next one the next one i was like oh


---------84:03----------
and then they moved me to the second


---------84:05----------
grade


---------84:06----------
and like back then i didn't have an ego


---------84:08----------
but like sure like as i grew up i was


---------84:10----------
like oh yeah i'm smarter than everyone


---------84:11----------
else


---------84:14----------
and so i know what it's like to not live


---------84:17----------
up to the expectations that you set for


---------84:19----------
yourself


---------84:19----------
and choose an alternate path that gives


---------84:21----------
you a sense of self


---------84:22----------
self worth i think it's good i think you


---------84:26----------
should do it bro it sounds like a good


---------84:27----------
decision and i think you'll


---------84:28----------
you know i'm not trying to but i think


---------84:31----------
all of you guys have to wrestle with ego


---------84:34----------
with identity and there are weird


---------84:36----------
versions of it


---------84:38----------
right like like said your ego


---------84:42----------
is kind of warped but like you still


---------84:44----------
think very


---------84:45----------
strongly about who you are and that


---------84:48----------
needs to be done away with


---------84:53----------
because you aren't who you think you are


---------84:59----------
oh how do i begin to do that


---------85:02----------
good question one that i don't know if i


---------85:06----------
have an answer


---------85:10----------
so so what what i've gotten so far like


---------85:12----------
if i'm putting this into like coding


---------85:14----------
it's like


---------85:15----------
like um if expectation too high


---------85:19----------
lower expectation forehead yes that's


---------85:22----------
that's the maneuver


---------85:23----------
or if expectation like so it


---------85:26----------
like be sort of pointed out there are


---------85:28----------
two sides of the equation right there's


---------85:30----------
the way that you rate yourself


---------85:33----------
and there's the way that you rate your


---------85:35----------
problem


---------85:37----------
and you can either respect so this this


---------85:40----------
is where like i love that you guys said


---------85:41----------
like i can't even do the most


---------85:43----------
basic thing and so then what you


---------85:46----------
conclude is if i can't do the most basic


---------85:48----------
thing


---------85:49----------
i must be really dumb


---------85:52----------
but what y'all need to understand is


---------85:54----------
that most basic thing is the most


---------85:56----------
difficult thing


---------85:57----------
that's not a level one problem that's a


---------85:59----------
level 99 problem


---------86:01----------
and there are reasons for that the


---------86:03----------
simplest of which is that you begin to


---------86:04----------
realize that actually the big and


---------86:06----------
desperate things are easy to do


---------86:08----------
it's the little things that are hard to


---------86:09----------
do it's the things that are irrelevant


---------86:12----------
that are the most difficult to do


---------86:16----------
it's easy to eat when you're hungry it's


---------86:19----------
hard to eat when you're hungry when


---------86:21----------
you're not hungry


---------86:24----------
it's easy to go to the bathroom when you


---------86:25----------
need to pee it's harder to go to the


---------86:26----------
bathroom when you need to be


---------86:31----------
it's easier to help someone when they


---------86:33----------
need your help


---------86:34----------
it's harder to help someone when they


---------86:36----------
don't


---------86:40----------
right so desperation is i get that you


---------86:43----------
guys long for it but like what y'all


---------86:44----------
need to understand is that


---------86:45----------
each of these little battles that you


---------86:47----------
guys are choosing to fight are actually


---------86:48----------
not easy battles they're very hard


---------86:52----------
like if you just think about it


---------86:53----------
logically like the fewer reasons there


---------86:55----------
are to do something the harder it is to


---------86:57----------
do them


---------86:58----------
and you guys have created like let's


---------86:59----------
take b for example like he doesn't have


---------87:01----------
a reason to leave the comfort of his


---------87:03----------
home


---------87:04----------
and so leaving the comfort of his home


---------87:06----------
isn't easy it's incredibly hard


---------87:09----------
so you need to respect the problems that


---------87:12----------
you guys face


---------87:13----------
instead of disrespecting them and


---------87:15----------
thereby like shaming yourself


---------87:20----------
if that sort of makes sense yeah


---------87:24----------
so how do i tell the difference between


---------87:26----------
me you know


---------87:28----------
setting my expectations lower in a


---------87:29----------
healthy way and


---------87:31----------
me saying well i guess this is a really


---------87:33----------
hard problem let's run away and play


---------87:34----------
video games for a week


---------87:36----------
so how do i differentiate between


---------87:39----------
lowering my expectations in a healthy


---------87:40----------
way and just using it as a way to


---------87:42----------
ignore the problem and also i think like


---------87:45----------
self-deprecating can kind of come eat


---------87:47----------
like if you like


---------87:48----------
if you're thinking about like lowering


---------87:49----------
yourself like it's it's i mean


---------87:52----------
like i'm i'm like i can be pretty doomer


---------87:54----------
sometimes like pretty like down in the


---------87:55----------
dumps and so i think it's easier for me


---------87:57----------
to like


---------87:58----------
sometimes just be like i suck but like


---------88:01----------
my ego doesn't really change i don't


---------88:02----------
really lower the bar i'm just kind of


---------88:04----------
like self-deprecating yeah so so there's


---------88:06----------
a difference between


---------88:07----------
having an expectation of yourself and


---------88:10----------
not living up to it


---------88:12----------
and lowering the expectation of yourself


---------88:16----------
do you guys understand you all do the


---------88:17----------
first one y'all don't do the second one


---------88:21----------
and the problem is that despite multiple


---------88:23----------
failures


---------88:25----------
your bar of potential never changes


---------88:30----------
what you're capable of never changes


---------88:34----------
and therefore each failure hurts more


---------88:36----------
and more and more


---------88:42----------
so i'm sorry said you had a question can


---------88:44----------
you ask it again


---------88:45----------
really good question by the way so


---------88:47----------
what's the difference between


---------88:49----------
um setting that you know setting my


---------88:51----------
expectations lower


---------88:52----------
or you know setting the problem higher


---------88:54----------
in a healthy way like you're describing


---------88:56----------
and just using that as uh an excuse to


---------88:59----------
run away from the problem entirely


---------89:01----------
i don't understand how those two are


---------89:02----------
like on opposite like


---------89:06----------
how does how does running away enter the


---------89:08----------
equation


---------89:09----------
oh so i could i could say oh man this


---------89:12----------
this is


---------89:12----------
this is indeed like way too hard for me


---------89:15----------
i guess i'll


---------89:15----------
i guess it's an acceptable outcome for


---------89:17----------
me to just stay in my room for


---------89:19----------
the next few years and play video games


---------89:24----------
i see so if you lower your expectations


---------89:29----------
and you and failure is to be expected


---------89:32----------
then it's okay to not try


---------89:36----------
yes what's staving off hopelessness


---------89:40----------
uh yeah


---------89:46----------
good questions let me think about this


---------89:53----------
so staving off hopelessness is a


---------89:55----------
separate issue


---------89:57----------
well i guess it's not actually i guess


---------89:59----------
that is the same question


---------90:01----------
so let me start by saying said that's


---------90:02----------
what you already do


---------90:05----------
right so like already you guys have a


---------90:07----------
there's no point in trying because


---------90:09----------
failure is inevitable and here's okay


---------90:12----------
this is tricky


---------90:15----------
it depends on where you are in time


---------90:18----------
okay so it's it's about being i know


---------90:20----------
this sounds weird but like


---------90:22----------
if you guys really want to know the


---------90:23----------
answer and y'all are [ __ ] being five


---------90:24----------
heads fine


---------90:25----------
because i wanna doozy you guys wanna


---------90:27----------
give me a hard question i'll give you


---------90:29----------
guys a hard answer okay


---------90:30----------
so hopelessness is your mind in the past


---------90:34----------
the


---------90:34----------
present or the future when you are


---------90:36----------
hopeless


---------90:39----------
in the future future good


---------90:43----------
next question is your mind in the past


---------90:45----------
the present or the future when you have


---------90:47----------
hope


---------90:54----------
present my experience the present


---------90:58----------
[ __ ] weird right who thinks future


---------91:02----------
i do i think it would be talk it out


---------91:05----------
amongst yourselves


---------91:07----------
because if you have hope um you


---------91:11----------
you think that there is something that


---------91:13----------
will happen


---------91:15----------
that is that what hope is that's not


---------91:17----------
what hope is


---------91:18----------
okay let's define hope if i think


---------91:22----------
something will happen


---------91:23----------
what's the word we use for that are you


---------91:26----------
predicting


---------91:28----------
certainty yeah certainty okay so


---------91:32----------
you guys are saying certainty or predict


---------91:34----------
i'm gonna toss out


---------91:35----------
wildword you guys may not be familiar


---------91:37----------
with it i'm gonna toss out expectation


---------91:42----------
okay so let's go back to


---------91:47----------
um bees so


---------91:50----------
tell us now i hope there's hope in the


---------91:53----------
past present future


---------91:54----------
what do you think where are you


---------91:58----------
when you hope oh i mean i well i'm in


---------92:02----------
the present


---------92:03----------
i hope but right


---------92:08----------
so this is really confusing because


---------92:10----------
hopelessness is about the future hope is


---------92:12----------
about the present


---------92:14----------
hopelessness is about an outcome or the


---------92:17----------
inability to attain an outcome


---------92:19----------
hope is acknowledging that we don't know


---------92:22----------
whether the outcome is there or not but


---------92:24----------
i


---------92:24----------
i want it so you're actually in the


---------92:27----------
present you're in the present looking


---------92:29----------
forward


---------92:31----------
hopelessness is about the future looking


---------92:34----------
back


---------92:35----------
and if you really tunnel down that's


---------92:37----------
where you guys


---------92:38----------
live right so when like said wakes up in


---------92:41----------
the morning and is like let me apply for


---------92:43----------
a job


---------92:44----------
his mind isn't thinking about the


---------92:46----------
present his mind is thinking about the


---------92:47----------
future


---------92:49----------
failure is inevitable there's no point


---------92:50----------
in trying it is a mind that is in the


---------92:52----------
future


---------92:54----------
that's what engenders hopelessness


---------92:57----------
why bother we're gonna screw up anyway


---------92:59----------
it's too hard


---------93:02----------
the common element here is a mind in the


---------93:06----------
future


---------93:08----------
now the real problem the real reason you


---------93:10----------
guys suffer from this is because the


---------93:12----------
more intelligent you are


---------93:14----------
the more the deeper into the future your


---------93:18----------
mind can go


---------93:19----------
and that's what really screws you guys


---------93:23----------
right so your predictive capability


---------93:25----------
increases


---------93:28----------
neuroticism or anxiety increases


---------93:30----------
generally speaking with iq


---------93:32----------
i think actually that's not true


---------93:36----------
well yeah that's not technical the way i


---------93:38----------
phrased it


---------93:40----------
i will say this anxiety


---------93:43----------
is worse in people who are smart


---------93:47----------
cognitive anxiety anyway


---------93:50----------
does that answer your question about


---------93:52----------
hopelessness or


---------93:54----------
no actually i guess i haven't answered


---------93:56----------
yet yet


---------93:57----------
so i just started with this right so


---------93:59----------
like okay who here still thinks that


---------94:00----------
hope is about the future


---------94:02----------
or that your mind is in the future when


---------94:04----------
you are hoping


---------94:08----------
okay i still think that but i i i'll


---------94:09----------
this will be like where i rewind the


---------94:11----------
video and


---------94:12----------
okay so let me let me explain it again


---------94:14----------
okay so for those of you who think that


---------94:15----------
hope is in the present help


---------94:16----------
help help us understand what your


---------94:18----------
perspective is


---------94:21----------
i mean to me hope is like an


---------94:22----------
experiential thing it's also a religious


---------94:25----------
thing but it's like


---------94:27----------
i don't know i i only think it could be


---------94:29----------
in the present because it's just like an


---------94:30----------
experience


---------94:32----------
strangely enough yeah like it's


---------94:34----------
something you feel like it's something


---------94:36----------
you


---------94:36----------
go through yeah you experience hope


---------94:40----------
you're like thinking about the future


---------94:42----------
like the subject is the future and what


---------94:44----------
could happen in it but like the


---------94:45----------
experience or the feelings you have that


---------94:47----------
come along with hope happen in the


---------94:48----------
moment


---------94:49----------
i is i think how i would describe it i


---------94:51----------
hope it's like a feeling


---------94:53----------
yeah but playing devil's advocate or


---------94:55----------
peace advocate you could also say the


---------94:56----------
same about hopelessness i think


---------94:58----------
yeah like it's thoughts about the future


---------95:00----------
but it's


---------95:02----------
in the present experience in the


---------95:04----------
presence oh but um the difference i feel


---------95:05----------
like is


---------95:06----------
with hopelessness you well when you're


---------95:08----------
hopeless you're


---------95:09----------
like almost certain or you have an


---------95:10----------
expectation even if it's not like a


---------95:12----------
correct one that um


---------95:13----------
everything's just gonna so turn to [ __ ]


---------95:16----------
this is this is


---------95:17----------
not certain so b this is how i'd explain


---------95:20----------
it


---------95:21----------
hope is you standing in the present and


---------95:23----------
looking towards the future


---------95:25----------
hopeless is you standing in the future


---------95:27----------
and looking towards the present


---------95:32----------
okay i'll have to think about it more


---------95:35----------
that's fine okay right so so if you guys


---------95:38----------
are talking about like you know how to


---------95:40----------
manage


---------95:41----------
this i think the the biggest thing is to


---------95:43----------
be present


---------95:44----------
focused because what holds you guys back


---------95:47----------
is like


---------95:47----------
a certainty or expectation of the future


---------95:50----------
that precludes action in the present


---------95:56----------
like your mind is literally making a


---------95:58----------
risk reward


---------96:00----------
cost benefit analysis and your


---------96:03----------
motivation so this is literally how your


---------96:05----------
work


---------96:05----------
your mind works okay so it's kind of


---------96:08----------
confusing


---------96:09----------
but you guys have this thing so we have


---------96:14----------
okay i'm gonna explain some neuroscience


---------96:16----------
okay


---------96:17----------
so since you all want to be five head


---------96:19----------
okay so we have


---------96:21----------
we have two systems in our mind that are


---------96:23----------
in our brain that tend to


---------96:25----------
like people get confused about because


---------96:27----------
everyone thinks about


---------96:28----------
motivation and reward okay so when we


---------96:32----------
think about like


---------96:32----------
motivation we think about the reward


---------96:34----------
circuitry of the brain and we think


---------96:36----------
about dopamine y'all are familiar with


---------96:38----------
this stuff


---------96:38----------
like most people are like amateur


---------96:40----------
neuroscientists


---------96:42----------
so like the idea is that we have a


---------96:43----------
reward structure and that dopamine is


---------96:45----------
the neurotransmitter that like


---------96:47----------
supports our reward structure and that


---------96:50----------
when we


---------96:51----------
get a reward it reinforces the behavior


---------96:54----------
and motivates us to act


---------96:58----------
right familiar with this okay


---------97:01----------
so we have a couple of different so the


---------97:04----------
reward structure


---------97:06----------
the risk benefit part of the brain is


---------97:09----------
actually not dopamine


---------97:10----------
it's actually a cannabinoid structure so


---------97:13----------
there's a different part of our brain


---------97:14----------
that does our risk benefit analysis


---------97:17----------
and we actually understand this because


---------97:19----------
people in schizophrenia or in some kinds


---------97:22----------
of neurodegenerative disorders


---------97:24----------
have something called abulia or a


---------97:26----------
motivation


---------97:27----------
and the really interesting thing is that


---------97:29----------
the people who are a bulic are a


---------97:31----------
motivational


---------97:32----------
their problem isn't necessarily in the


---------97:34----------
dopamine reward circuitry which is what


---------97:35----------
we think of it's actually in like this


---------97:38----------
risk benefit i mean uh yeah risk benefit


---------97:41----------
sort of


---------97:42----------
cost like analysis that you constantly


---------97:45----------
is active in your brain


---------97:46----------
that's the problem that you guys have


---------97:49----------
it's not about


---------97:50----------
a lack of reward it's like the


---------97:52----------
calculation that you all perform


---------97:54----------
about whether an action is worth taking


---------97:57----------
it's actually a separate circuit of the


---------97:59----------
brain and right now what happens is you


---------98:01----------
guys


---------98:02----------
make a calculation about the utility of


---------98:05----------
your action


---------98:07----------
and then you conclude that it's not


---------98:09----------
worth it to do


---------98:10----------
so it's not that you guys lack energy


---------98:12----------
and in fact you guys aren't you don't


---------98:14----------
guys don't even lack motivation


---------98:15----------
technically


---------98:16----------
what's happening is your brain is


---------98:18----------
motivating you to not act


---------98:22----------
does that make sense like if we think


---------98:25----------
about said what set is saying is that


---------98:27----------
there's no point in me leaving the


---------98:28----------
halfway point because


---------98:30----------
there's nothing good down the road


---------98:34----------
and so it's a risk benefit analysis that


---------98:36----------
motivates you to inaction


---------98:40----------
and this is why like all these like


---------98:42----------
[ __ ] videos on motivation don't help


---------98:43----------
people because you guys don't


---------98:44----------
you don't lack motivation what you guys


---------98:46----------
need to understand is that you're


---------98:47----------
motivated to stay put


---------98:50----------
you don't lack motivation to move


---------98:51----------
forward different


---------98:54----------
so then the question okay questions


---------98:56----------
about that clarifications


---------99:04----------
all good with me okay


---------99:07----------
i'm afraid that i may have bombarded you


---------99:09----------
guys with too much tangential


---------99:11----------
information without actually answering


---------99:12----------
your question


---------99:16----------
i mean it's a complicated question so


---------99:17----------
sometimes you have to go into tangents


---------99:19----------
to yeah


---------99:19----------
okay so let me try to like re-explain


---------99:22----------
okay


---------99:23----------
so um i'm gonna go back to sed's


---------99:27----------
question which is like how do i


---------99:29----------
if i lower my expectations so low


---------99:33----------
then what i'll do is make a prediction


---------99:36----------
that i'm gonna fail anyway so there's no


---------99:38----------
point in trying because i suck so hard


---------99:40----------
at life


---------99:41----------
right yeah so so the funny thing is


---------99:45----------
that's


---------99:45----------
already what scent does so he's making


---------99:48----------
it sound like it's a different thing but


---------99:49----------
it's actually the same damn thing


---------99:50----------
because right now he already does a risk


---------99:53----------
benefit analysis and chooses an action


---------99:55----------
you guys see that whether you think high


---------99:58----------
of yourself or you think low of yourself


---------100:00----------
he's coming to the same damn conclusion


---------100:01----------
even though i'm telling you guys to come


---------100:03----------
from a different starting place


---------100:05----------
does that make sense y'all really got to


---------100:07----------
follow me there


---------100:09----------
that at the end of the day he's saying


---------100:10----------
i'm going to fail anyway there's no


---------100:11----------
point in action so that's why i sort of


---------100:13----------
talk about this cannabinoid


---------100:15----------
risk benefit structure because it's the


---------100:17----------
same part of his brain that is still


---------100:21----------
running the show so he's not actually


---------100:24----------
adopting my premise


---------100:28----------
okay so and i'll get to that in a second


---------100:31----------
so


---------100:31----------
then sen's next question is then how do


---------100:33----------
i adopt your premise right said


---------100:36----------
you got me okay i i get that so like


---------100:39----------
we're walking you to that


---------100:41----------
so what i want you guys to still notice


---------100:43----------
is that as long as the risk


---------100:45----------
reward structure is


---------100:49----------
determining whether you act or don't act


---------100:52----------
you will be motivated towards an action


---------100:56----------
got it so now let me ask you guys a


---------100:59----------
question okay this is a hard one


---------101:01----------
let's go [ __ ] is that present


---------101:04----------
thinking or future thinking


---------101:07----------
present absolutely


---------101:11----------
but that's like literally not the


---------101:13----------
thought that you have right like


---------101:15----------
literally in your mind you guys don't


---------101:17----------
have the present thought you have the


---------101:18----------
future thought


---------101:20----------
there's no point present thinking or


---------101:23----------
future thinking


---------101:25----------
future thing you're thinking absolutely


---------101:29----------
so some of this so now the question is


---------101:32----------
okay what do we do


---------101:33----------
about it right so some of this literally


---------101:36----------
is controlling your mind because i want


---------101:39----------
you guys to understand that


---------101:40----------
you can cultivate particular kinds of


---------101:43----------
thoughts


---------101:43----------
okay now we're really going on a tangent


---------101:45----------
but i want you guys to


---------101:47----------
understand this for a moment that your


---------101:50----------
mind


---------101:50----------
gets conditioned what is it that


---------101:53----------
conditions your mind


---------101:56----------
our environment what impact is our


---------101:59----------
experience


---------102:00----------
okay so like how does our enviro so


---------102:03----------
there's the environment right so like


---------102:05----------
but environment itself doesn't do any


---------102:07----------
conditioning


---------102:10----------
when something happens to you you learn


---------102:13----------
about like


---------102:14----------
or you learn like you you interpret some


---------102:16----------
sort of meaning from something happening


---------102:17----------
to you that caused some sort of effect


---------102:19----------
and that


---------102:20----------
changes how you think exactly right so


---------102:22----------
it's the environment's


---------102:24----------
effect on you like it's not literally


---------102:26----------
the environment the environment


---------102:28----------
has to impact you there's like a there's


---------102:30----------
a there's like


---------102:31----------
the outside and the inside so for


---------102:34----------
example like if i have ear plugs on and


---------102:36----------
someone is talking to me


---------102:37----------
even though the environment is the same


---------102:39----------
like whether i have ear plugs in or out


---------102:42----------
the environment is not reaching me does


---------102:44----------
that make sense


---------102:46----------
so let's like think a little bit about


---------102:48----------
like you know if you were raised like


---------102:50----------
how have you guys been conditioned


---------102:51----------
you're gifted so literally what happens


---------102:55----------
is this like


---------102:56----------
stimuli from the outside create certain


---------102:59----------
thought patterns


---------103:01----------
and then you guys have beliefs about


---------103:03----------
yourself and those beliefs


---------103:05----------
live in your subconscious and generate


---------103:07----------
thoughts


---------103:08----------
so if we think about a phobia for


---------103:10----------
example like let's say i have a phobia


---------103:12----------
of snakes because i got bit by a snake


---------103:14----------
when i was a kid


---------103:15----------
how does that work like literally in the


---------103:16----------
way that like how does that work


---------103:19----------
so i get bit by a snake it generates an


---------103:22----------
experience the experience lives in my


---------103:24----------
subconscious


---------103:25----------
and then that subconscious experience is


---------103:27----------
a thought generator


---------103:29----------
which then like spawns it's like a


---------103:31----------
portal and it's like spawning


---------103:33----------
certain thoughts you guys get that


---------103:37----------
so now the question is okay if i want to


---------103:39----------
be present focused instead of future


---------103:41----------
focused


---------103:42----------
how do i spawn present focused thoughts


---------103:47----------
is that a good question that y'all are


---------103:50----------
interested in yeah yes


---------103:52----------
yes how do i change from there's no


---------103:55----------
point to let's go


---------103:56----------
[ __ ] and


---------104:00----------
part of that literally is that you can


---------104:02----------
condition your own mind by cultivating a


---------104:05----------
particular kind of thought


---------104:06----------
right so what we can say is that if i if


---------104:08----------
you guys like for example


---------104:11----------
all live in a house and i show up every


---------104:13----------
day and i gass you all up


---------104:16----------
i'm like believe in yourself man you can


---------104:18----------
do it bro


---------104:20----------
that's going to create a different kind


---------104:21----------
of conditioning right because like


---------104:24----------
the reason you guys don't believe in


---------104:25----------
yourself now is because you've been


---------104:26----------
conditioned to believe that you're a


---------104:27----------
failure


---------104:29----------
but at the end of the day what i want


---------104:30----------
you guys to realize is that whether i'm


---------104:32----------
there or not there the operative thing


---------104:34----------
is that what sinks in so if i show up


---------104:37----------
and i'm gassing you guys up but i'm


---------104:39----------
gujarati


---------104:46----------
okay


---------104:50----------
and so like it's what enters your mind


---------104:54----------
that's important do y'all


---------104:57----------
get that yeah


---------105:00----------
and so then comes the key thing which is


---------105:03----------
the cultivation of your own


---------105:04----------
thoughts and this is what really holds


---------105:07----------
you guys back


---------105:08----------
because i've been saying all along this


---------105:10----------
is basically the same thing that the


---------105:11----------
hurricane outside is created by you


---------105:16----------
it's the self-conditioning that gets


---------105:18----------
imposed every day when you wake up and


---------105:20----------
you think particular thoughts about


---------105:22----------
yourself


---------105:23----------
these neurons literally form channels in


---------105:26----------
your brain that are connections


---------105:28----------
and start firing more commonly so it's


---------105:31----------
kind of like a game trail like if i have


---------105:33----------
a field of grass


---------105:34----------
and then i run across it the grass gets


---------105:37----------
put down a little bit


---------105:38----------
and then like a deer walks by and it's


---------105:40----------
like oh there's like there's a path


---------105:42----------
that's a little bit easier to walk


---------105:43----------
across


---------105:44----------
and then the deer goes down that and the


---------105:45----------
grass gets trampled the grass gets


---------105:47----------
trampled and the grass gets trampled


---------105:49----------
your brain literally works the same way


---------105:51----------
that's literally the mechanism of


---------105:52----------
learning


---------105:55----------
right so like when i when we think about


---------105:57----------
memorization it's like we're running


---------105:59----------
that game trail


---------106:00----------
we're flattening that grass and then you


---------106:01----------
know something and it becomes


---------106:02----------
instinctive


---------106:04----------
so the problem is that y'all's neurons


---------106:06----------
have


---------106:07----------
been condit and that's what we call


---------106:08----------
conditioning so your neurons have like


---------106:11----------
cultivated a particular thought pattern


---------106:14----------
and so literally what you need to do is


---------106:16----------
cultivate a different one


---------106:18----------
and so how does that work that's because


---------106:21----------
you guys ultimately have some control


---------106:23----------
over your mind


---------106:25----------
right so i know this also gets weird but


---------106:26----------
there's the true self and then there's


---------106:28----------
mental activity


---------106:30----------
which are separate so there's


---------106:32----------
consciousness


---------106:33----------
and there's thinking and we'll get to


---------106:35----------
that in a second when i teach you guys


---------106:36----------
how to meditate


---------106:38----------
so what y'all need to do is like


---------106:40----------
literally in a moment in time


---------106:42----------
you can change your thought with intense


---------106:44----------
willpower


---------106:45----------
and a mana bar that's going to be


---------106:47----------
depleted every time you do it


---------106:49----------
but you're laying down a new game trail


---------106:53----------
so it's gonna be exhausting so like you


---------106:56----------
guys are literally gonna be faced with a


---------106:58----------
task


---------106:59----------
and you're gonna say there's no point


---------107:01----------
and the question is in that moment


---------107:03----------
can you tell yourself let's go [ __ ]


---------107:08----------
and now you guys have to be careful


---------107:10----------
because


---------107:11----------
you're still gonna fail and now we get


---------107:15----------
to


---------107:15----------
you have to allow yourself to fail you


---------107:17----------
have to be patient with yourself


---------107:19----------
understand that a tiny little mouse has


---------107:21----------
run through the grass


---------107:23----------
when you say let's go [ __ ] and then


---------107:25----------
tomorrow comes and there's like there's


---------107:27----------
like a


---------107:28----------
super highway which is i have so much


---------107:31----------
potential and i suck at life


---------107:33----------
and then there's this tiny little game


---------107:34----------
trail which a mouse has gone down


---------107:36----------
and then it's like hey let's do a few


---------107:38----------
push-ups today ah [ __ ] it i'm never


---------107:40----------
gonna be in shape


---------107:41----------
let's go [ __ ]


---------107:44----------
and then it's a rabbit and then it's a


---------107:46----------
deer and this is how


---------107:48----------
change happens and we see that process


---------107:51----------
going on with jacob


---------107:53----------
right like he's been in the [ __ ] for


---------107:55----------
a while but he's like getting some kind


---------107:56----------
of relief and acceptance


---------107:58----------
and i'd guess that that's like that's


---------107:59----------
not something that like he wakes up and


---------108:01----------
he's like


---------108:02----------
ah it's like i'm accepting where i am


---------108:04----------
it's like it's a slog


---------108:08----------
right like it's a slog and that's why


---------108:11----------
you guys have to be patient with


---------108:13----------
yourselves and you have to give yourself


---------108:14----------
time to change and you have to


---------108:17----------
understand that that


---------108:18----------
y'all are you know undoing anywhere


---------108:20----------
between 18 and 20 some odd years of


---------108:22----------
conditioning


---------108:24----------
and that the neurons in your in your


---------108:26----------
brain have have taught you to believe


---------108:28----------
this thing about yourself but this is


---------108:30----------
the other really important thing to


---------108:31----------
understand


---------108:32----------
is to have the revelation that this is


---------108:34----------
not


---------108:35----------
truth i don't know if you guys get this


---------108:37----------
you guys have


---------108:38----------
thoughts about yourself right


---------108:41----------
are those thoughts true


---------108:46----------
maybe not exactly true mostly


---------108:50----------
no so now i'm going to ask y'all because


---------108:52----------
y'all are gifted and talented


---------108:55----------
are thoughts accurate representations of


---------108:58----------
reality no


---------109:00----------
no sometimes


---------109:03----------
right


---------109:07----------
like if they were [ __ ] unicorns baby


---------109:13----------
so the first thing that like another


---------109:14----------
thing that you need to understand is


---------109:15----------
that you think all these things about


---------109:16----------
you but there's just thoughts like what


---------109:18----------
truth is there in the thought i had a


---------109:20----------
thought today that i was president of


---------109:21----------
the united states


---------109:25----------
i had a thought today that


---------109:29----------
cd projekt red mailed me cds


---------109:33----------
that have cyberpunk on them i can have


---------109:36----------
like thoughts just the [ __ ] thoughts


---------109:40----------
they have no bearing in real like real


---------109:42----------
literally like they have like no bearing


---------109:43----------
in reality


---------109:45----------
yeah i know you guys think they have


---------109:46----------
some bearing in reality that's a


---------109:47----------
conversation for a different day


---------109:48----------
experience has a bearing in reality


---------109:51----------
thoughts don't


---------109:56----------
so it's just thoughts that you can


---------109:58----------
cultivate thoughts


---------109:59----------
that the cultivation of thoughts is like


---------110:02----------
a slow process


---------110:04----------
and then along the way you if you are


---------110:07----------
expecting results


---------110:09----------
then you're going to be future focused


---------110:11----------
and you will not


---------110:12----------
continue the cultivation of thoughts


---------110:16----------
does that make sense


---------110:20----------
and furthermore so the reason i use the


---------110:22----------
word cultivation


---------110:23----------
what is cultivation


---------110:26----------
you sow the seeds and then come back for


---------110:28----------
them later absolutely


---------110:30----------
and what if there's nothing there did


---------110:33----------
you


---------110:34----------
did you cultivate incorrectly


---------110:38----------
yes no maybe incorrect


---------110:42----------
right so that that's the whole point is


---------110:44----------
cultivation


---------110:45----------
implies it's not creation


---------110:48----------
there's a difference between creating


---------110:50----------
and cultivating what's the difference


---------110:54----------
like it takes time to cultivate


---------110:56----------
something


---------110:58----------
creative and it's not cultivating you


---------111:01----------
absolutely so it's about certainty right


---------111:05----------
like creation is something i have


---------111:06----------
control over


---------111:08----------
cultivating is something that i don't so


---------111:11----------
i use some of this language like


---------111:13----------
very carefully because this language


---------111:16----------
like there's a correlation between hope


---------111:18----------
and cultivation you guys get that like


---------111:20----------
if you cultivate a plate like if i plant


---------111:22----------
a seed


---------111:24----------
like i hope it's gonna grow but that's


---------111:26----------
the most that i can do is hope


---------111:29----------
and the more you start living present


---------111:31----------
focus the more you say to yourself let's


---------111:33----------
go [ __ ] something magical will happen


---------111:35----------
which is that hope will start to be born


---------111:39----------
and the reason that hope will be born is


---------111:40----------
because you are creating


---------111:42----------
the circumstance which which hope


---------111:44----------
requires to be born


---------111:46----------
which is to have a mind in the present


---------111:48----------
hopelessness is


---------111:50----------
is a child of the future like by


---------111:53----------
definition you cannot be hopeless unless


---------111:57----------
you are thinking about the future


---------111:58----------
if the focus of your mind is on the


---------112:00----------
future you can be hopeless


---------112:03----------
if i'm eating a sandwich


---------112:06----------
and it's like tasty and i'm just eating


---------112:09----------
it can i be hopeless


---------112:13----------
not really it's like literally


---------112:15----------
impossible i want you guys to understand


---------112:17----------
this


---------112:18----------
it is literally impossible to be


---------112:20----------
hopeless if you were eating a sandwich


---------112:22----------
as long as your mind is on the sandwich


---------112:23----------
you're like damn this is a delicious


---------112:24----------
sandwich it can be a disgusting sandwich


---------112:28----------
but so so here's where the hopelessness


---------112:30----------
comes in if you start to think yourself


---------112:32----------
man i have to finish this sandwich


---------112:34----------
hopelessness boom


---------112:38----------
you guys see that god this sandwich is


---------112:41----------
[ __ ] disgusting


---------112:43----------
no hopelessness i have to finish it


---------112:47----------
[ __ ] hopelessness


---------112:52----------
so how do you be hopeful if you lower


---------112:55----------
expectations how do you fight against


---------112:57----------
the idea of not needing to do it anymore


---------112:58----------
you just stick your [ __ ] mind in the


---------113:00----------
present as best as you can let's go


---------113:02----------
[ __ ] you try to tell yourself that


---------113:05----------
third thing and we'll get to this now is


---------113:07----------
that like you can start there are other


---------113:08----------
things you can do


---------113:10----------
third thing is that you can train your


---------113:11----------
mind to be in the presence so that's


---------113:13----------
like


---------113:13----------
like you know it's like focusing your


---------113:16----------
mind on the present


---------113:17----------
is just like focusing your gaze it's


---------113:18----------
something you it's a skill that can be


---------113:20----------
acquired


---------113:21----------
and meditation is basically the most


---------113:23----------
direct skill that we use


---------113:25----------
to train your mind to be in the present


---------113:30----------
do you guys feel hopeless when you're


---------113:32----------
playing a video game


---------113:34----------
that's a good question


---------113:37----------
what if i'm thinking about the game


---------113:39----------
exactly


---------113:43----------
i'm thinking about the results of the


---------113:44----------
game exactly so you guys know this like


---------113:46----------
you guys know this [ __ ] man


---------113:48----------
when you're playing a league of legends


---------113:50----------
game and i you look at your draft


---------113:55----------
do you feel hopeless or not because if


---------113:57----------
you're if you're like if you're like if


---------113:58----------
you're thinking about how the game is


---------114:00----------
going to play out ah there comes the


---------114:01----------
hopelessness


---------114:04----------
you guys see that and then there are


---------114:06----------
times where you're like it's an


---------114:07----------
even game and you're not thinking you're


---------114:08----------
like okay let's do it like there's a


---------114:10----------
five-on-five engagement


---------114:12----------
around baron and like in that moment


---------114:15----------
you're not


---------114:16----------
like that's what's fun right and like


---------114:17----------
that's why it serves as an escape


---------114:19----------
because video games put your mind in the


---------114:21----------
present


---------114:23----------
that's why they're fun and video games


---------114:25----------
cause you to suffer


---------114:26----------
and that's when you're thinking about


---------114:27----------
the future in the video game


---------114:31----------
it's like a microcosm for reality which


---------114:33----------
is wild i love it so you can even track


---------114:37----------
your like enjoyment of games and you'll


---------114:38----------
see that like when your mind is in the


---------114:40----------
present


---------114:41----------
you'll be having fun


---------114:44----------
i have a question yeah so


---------114:48----------
i feel like well i mean every decision


---------114:50----------
made is um


---------114:52----------
for like some outcome in the future


---------114:54----------
right


---------114:55----------
how do you like how do you decide to do


---------114:58----------
things


---------114:59----------
and not think about the future like you


---------115:01----------
do you


---------115:02----------
apply to college because you have the


---------115:04----------
expectation that in four years you're


---------115:05----------
gonna graduate with a degree


---------115:07----------
how do you keep your mind in the present


---------115:10----------
always or like


---------115:11----------
how do you consider what you should do


---------115:12----------
in the future


---------115:16----------
good question unfortunately the answer


---------115:19----------
is roughly the same but i'll explain it


---------115:20----------
in a different way


---------115:21----------
so you can consider the future


---------115:26----------
but it's about expectation versus like


---------115:30----------
hope right so like i can say so like


---------115:32----------
let's just take like a


---------115:34----------
like so i'm going to talk about dota for


---------115:35----------
example because i don't know league that


---------115:36----------
well


---------115:37----------
so there's a hero dota called pudge


---------115:39----------
anyone know pudges


---------115:41----------
punch is like a fat guy that hooks


---------115:43----------
things okay and like pudge is the kind


---------115:45----------
of hero that like


---------115:46----------
has a skill shot which there are fewer


---------115:48----------
of in donut and then like the pudge is


---------115:50----------
like


---------115:50----------
the the pick that ruins your games


---------115:53----------
because you get a bad punch and then


---------115:55----------
he's like useless like he can't do


---------115:57----------
anything except for hook people and then


---------116:00----------
occasionally on the other team you'll


---------116:02----------
get a good punch and he's hooking the


---------116:03----------
[ __ ] out of you guys and pulling you


---------116:04----------
guys out of position it's like is the


---------116:06----------
kind of


---------116:07----------
gay hero that just ruins your games


---------116:10----------
because the enemy has a good one you've


---------116:12----------
got a bad one


---------116:14----------
okay so like when you play a game of


---------116:16----------
dota like


---------116:17----------
you can think about trying to win or you


---------116:19----------
can say to yourself


---------116:21----------
let's go [ __ ] right it's not really


---------116:25----------
about


---------116:26----------
winning or losing it's not like we're


---------116:28----------
gonna draft to win it's like


---------116:29----------
let's pick this [ __ ] meme combo and


---------116:32----------
wreck these shitties


---------116:35----------
and like when you play the game like


---------116:37----------
that it becomes more fun


---------116:39----------
like sure you have a calculation


---------116:41----------
somewhere in your mind about like what


---------116:43----------
the game is going to look like


---------116:45----------
but that's not where you sit you don't


---------116:48----------
sit in the future you sit in the present


---------116:50----------
and you're looking forward


---------116:52----------
does that make sense so our outlook on


---------116:56----------
the future


---------116:56----------
should be that we hope things go a


---------116:59----------
certain way


---------117:00----------
and then not really like put too much


---------117:02----------
pressure to


---------117:03----------
have them go a certain way and just


---------117:05----------
think about what we're doing now


---------117:07----------
exactly so focus on action


---------117:11----------
right like if the question isn't are we


---------117:14----------
gonna wreck these shitties


---------117:15----------
the question is let's try to wreck these


---------117:17----------
shitties like how do we wreck this [ __ ]


---------117:19----------
let's do it go for it and that's like


---------117:22----------
that's literally how like so


---------117:24----------
you guys understand this like if you


---------117:25----------
play a game like that if you play a game


---------117:27----------
to have fun like let's pick some meme


---------117:29----------
combo


---------117:30----------
and stomp these noobs and then even if


---------117:32----------
you guys get crushed you're like let's


---------117:33----------
do it again


---------117:37----------
right and like literally that's what


---------117:40----------
buddha discovered about life


---------117:41----------
is there two ways to live life


---------117:44----------
and when you start living life like


---------117:47----------
you're a meme lord


---------117:48----------
like it becomes fun and blissful


---------117:52----------
because every day it's like let's see


---------117:54----------
like what we're eating for lunch oh god


---------117:57----------
this sandwich is awful


---------118:00----------
let's see if we get wrecked tomorrow by


---------118:02----------
another awful sandwich


---------118:04----------
lulz that's literally what enlightenment


---------118:08----------
is


---------118:08----------
it's to treat good actions and bad


---------118:11----------
actions in equanimity


---------118:15----------
right because you guys know this that


---------118:16----------
like even if you get


---------118:18----------
trolled really really hard you can still


---------118:21----------
appreciate it


---------118:26----------
right and like that's it's silly but


---------118:27----------
like that's actually like the big thing


---------118:29----------
like


---------118:30----------
that's what they discovered that buddha


---------118:32----------
was like the ultimate


---------118:34----------
meme lord and he was realized he


---------118:36----------
realized that if you live your life like


---------118:38----------
a meme like you're gonna


---------118:39----------
there's nothing can touch you and you'll


---------118:42----------
be blissful irrespective of what happens


---------118:48----------
so you can think about the future and


---------118:51----------
this gets also into like ambition and


---------118:53----------
detachment which maybe we can do a video


---------118:55----------
on one day


---------118:56----------
but a lot of people like ask me like if


---------118:58----------
i become detached from the outcome of my


---------119:00----------
actions


---------119:01----------
how do i act because usually it's


---------119:02----------
ambition that motivates me


---------119:04----------
and ambition is based on outcomes


---------119:07----------
and the short answer is try it you'll be


---------119:09----------
amazed


---------119:12----------
because what you'll realize is that like


---------119:14----------
your actions don't have to be motivated


---------119:16----------
by ambition they can be emoted


---------119:17----------
motivated by like excitement and


---------119:19----------
curiosity


---------119:21----------
and all kinds of other stuff and just an


---------119:23----------
appreciation for doing what you're doing


---------119:28----------
right and like the people who are


---------119:29----------
happiest are the ones that enjoy their


---------119:31----------
work


---------119:32----------
because they're not thinking about it


---------119:34----------
like i work with a bunch of investment


---------119:35----------
bankers


---------119:36----------
and they hate their job and they like


---------119:39----------
do it for the money like that's no way


---------119:41----------
to live i mean


---------119:43----------
it is a way to live it's a comfortable


---------119:45----------
way to live but


---------119:47----------
and so like you can enjoy an action in


---------119:49----------
and of itself


---------119:51----------
if you just devote yourself to the


---------119:56----------
action


---------120:03----------
turning into a lecture other questions


---------120:12----------
um so i think we've like kind of


---------120:17----------
uh we've touched like around it but like


---------120:19----------
uh so


---------120:20----------
when uh i i think like for


---------120:24----------
for probably a lot of people in general


---------120:27----------
but but definitely for gifted kids we


---------120:29----------
kind of put down this


---------120:30----------
this like predetermined quest line of


---------120:33----------
you're going to do you're going to take


---------120:35----------
these classes in elementary school


---------120:37----------
they're going to take like honors


---------120:38----------
classes in middle school and then ap or


---------120:40----------
you're going to go to a collegiate high


---------120:41----------
school or something like that


---------120:42----------
um and then maybe like


---------120:46----------
more if you're like an immigrant kid


---------120:47----------
you're probably going to get pushed on


---------120:48----------
another questline of


---------120:50----------
lawyer doctor engineer um but


---------120:54----------
if you're not or once you're past that


---------120:56----------
how do you


---------120:57----------
start making choices um when you've


---------121:00----------
never made any


---------121:03----------
what paralyzes you from making a choice


---------121:06----------
b


---------121:09----------
the future yeah there you go


---------121:18----------
very good


---------121:26----------
so can you guys turn that into an answer


---------121:32----------
i see that you've connected those two


---------121:33----------
dots but i think it's hard to turn that


---------121:35----------
into an answer


---------121:36----------
so like do you guys have a sense


---------121:41----------
right so you just have to free yourself


---------121:43----------
from consequences


---------121:47----------
so it's like it's the difference between


---------121:48----------
studying for an a and studying to


---------121:50----------
understand the material


---------121:54----------
like why are you guys studying


---------121:58----------
and the more that you devote yourself to


---------122:00----------
like learning the material this is like


---------122:04----------
a big scam


---------122:05----------
in life right is that like


---------122:10----------
how let me think about how to say this


---------122:15----------
we devalue the thing that leads to the


---------122:18----------
result


---------122:19----------
and instead we value the result


---------122:23----------
as a proxy to the thing


---------122:27----------
right so like what we really care about


---------122:30----------
is like learning


---------122:31----------
like if you get hired for a job as an


---------122:33----------
engineer


---------122:34----------
what we care about is that you know you


---------122:37----------
understand engineering


---------122:39----------
but what society conditions us to place


---------122:42----------
value on


---------122:42----------
is great because grades are a proxy for


---------122:47----------
knowledge


---------122:49----------
and so the more that we get wrapped up


---------122:51----------
in like this


---------122:52----------
false thing it's just like all ego and


---------122:55----------
comparison


---------122:57----------
it's not actually about knowledge at all


---------123:01----------
and so the more that you kind of focus


---------123:03----------
on the thing itself like how do you act


---------123:05----------
how do you choose


---------123:06----------
you've been conditioned i get you be


---------123:08----------
like i was conditioned too


---------123:10----------
and despite my best attempts i still


---------123:12----------
wound up as a doctor


---------123:16----------
right and like the reason i'm a good


---------123:18----------
doctor is because i


---------123:20----------
didn't want to be a doctor and then like


---------123:22----------
at the age of like 25 i was like oh [ __ ]


---------123:24----------
maybe i actually want to be actually i


---------123:26----------
don't even want to be a doctor when i


---------123:27----------
went to med school


---------123:28----------
to tell you guys the truth that's


---------123:30----------
probably why i'm doing a good job


---------123:31----------
because i didn't


---------123:32----------
care about it like i became a doctor


---------123:35----------
because my teachers were like


---------123:36----------
go get a doctoral degree and i was like


---------123:39----------
eh


---------123:40----------
okay and oddly enough it's like doing it


---------123:44----------
for no reason so i was like


---------123:45----------
you know or doing it for my own it


---------123:47----------
wasn't about the prestige or anything


---------123:49----------
like that it was just like


---------123:51----------
i have to do this if i want to take my


---------123:52----------
vows and become a monk so okay


---------123:54----------
i guess i'll do that and then like i


---------123:57----------
failed right so i got rejected from like


---------123:59----------
130


---------124:00----------
20 medical schools a lot and then like


---------124:03----------
each of those failures it doesn't matter


---------124:04----------
because like i'm not going to really be


---------124:06----------
a doctor anyway i'm just like doing this


---------124:07----------
for the sake of like doing it so that my


---------124:08----------
teachers can be happy whatever


---------124:10----------
maybe there's an outcome somewhere in


---------124:11----------
there but i think i train myself to be


---------124:13----------
like present focused it's like okay


---------124:15----------
you get 40 rejections


---------124:18----------
like none of those rejections really


---------124:20----------
influence like whether i apply the 41st


---------124:22----------
time


---------124:23----------
i can take that information i can


---------124:25----------
integrate it i can get feedback


---------124:27----------
but i'm still going to apply again like


---------124:29----------
you can wipe a thousand times on a boss


---------124:31----------
and you can still like go in the next


---------124:33----------
day and like try to wipe again


---------124:36----------
right you guys have played dark souls


---------124:37----------
you understand what that's like


---------124:40----------
like it's very frustrating that you're


---------124:42----------
gonna wipe over and over and over again


---------124:43----------
but like


---------124:44----------
that's not the point it's not like you


---------124:45----------
don't you don't go into a boss in dark


---------124:47----------
souls and expect it down at the first


---------124:49----------
time


---------124:50----------
or a wow rate for that matter or ff14


---------124:53----------
you know that wiping is part of the


---------124:55----------
process but each time you wipe


---------124:57----------
if it doesn't [ __ ] you it makes you


---------124:59----------
stronger


---------125:01----------
right each time you wipe what i want you


---------125:03----------
guys to understand is that like


---------125:05----------
each failure in your life is gaining xp


---------125:10----------
and so it's about learning not about


---------125:13----------
performance


---------125:16----------
and that's why you guys are adcs


---------125:20----------
so what happened in my case is like i


---------125:23----------
was a no one for a while


---------125:25----------
and then i was an average person and now


---------125:27----------
like people think i'm


---------125:28----------
someone


---------125:33----------
i'm no different from you guys i'm like


---------125:34----------
probably just about where y'all were


---------125:36----------
when y'all are y'alls age


---------125:38----------
like we're no different the thing is


---------125:41----------
society


---------125:42----------
looks at me differently but like that's


---------125:43----------
because society is dumb


---------125:46----------
and you guys look at me differently


---------125:48----------
because that's y'all y'all are dumb too


---------125:51----------
seriously thank you because you guys


---------125:54----------
adopt the conditioning of society which


---------125:56----------
i don't blame you for but let's not call


---------125:58----------
it smart


---------126:02----------
because capability to you guys thus far


---------126:04----------
has been a burden


---------126:06----------
right it's a potential let me ask you


---------126:09----------
guys this where is potential in the


---------126:11----------
present or in the future


---------126:13----------
the future there we go


---------126:17----------
you guys are trapped in the future


---------126:19----------
there's


---------126:20----------
literally show me potential


---------126:24----------
what is potential in the universe


---------126:28----------
it doesn't exist absolutely there is


---------126:31----------
just what is


---------126:36----------
and so if there's no potential how can


---------126:38----------
you be failures


---------126:42----------
seriously if any of you guys can answer


---------126:46----------
that question


---------126:46----------
i will stop streaming


---------126:50----------
because if i'm wrong about this like


---------126:52----------
this is the foundation upon which


---------126:54----------
all of what i all the work that i do is


---------126:56----------
built


---------127:00----------
well i guess the only weird thing is


---------127:03----------
like by by that logic


---------127:04----------
uh no one can ever be a failure i guess


---------127:07----------
that is correct


---------127:10----------
okay


---------127:13----------
can you fail at stuff sure can i fail


---------127:15----------
can i get an f on a test


---------127:16----------
absolutely i've done it before trust me


---------127:21----------
but like this is the concept of advaith


---------127:23----------
vedanta


---------127:24----------
non-dualism so is there a good sandwich


---------127:28----------
or a bad sandwich


---------127:33----------
there is just sandwich


---------127:37----------
convince me otherwise right so the good


---------127:39----------
or the bad is what


---------127:40----------
we apply to it there's just a sandwich


---------127:47----------
is it blasphemy or delicious depends on


---------127:49----------
whether it's a blt and you're muslim


---------127:52----------
like you know like the the blt is the


---------127:55----------
blt


---------127:58----------
and like where we end up with it is like


---------128:01----------
wildly different based on some [ __ ] in


---------128:05----------
here


---------128:07----------
and you guys think you're failures


---------128:08----------
because of some [ __ ] in here you guys


---------128:10----------
aren't failures


---------128:11----------
there's no such thing you guys are just


---------128:13----------
where you are on your journey


---------128:17----------
like this is the only place you can be


---------128:19----------
how can you uh that's silly


---------128:20----------
i could have been in a different place


---------128:22----------
if i had done things like how is that


---------128:24----------
like show me anyone who's been in a


---------128:26----------
different place because they did


---------128:27----------
anything differently


---------128:31----------
reality is like one thing bros at least


---------128:34----------
until we prove like alternate universes


---------128:39----------
you guys start like dimensional shifting


---------128:40----------
to like other places like then i'll


---------128:42----------
eat my words


---------128:46----------
but until that [ __ ] is proven and maybe


---------128:48----------
one of y'all gifted and talented


---------128:50----------
aerospace academy kids will discover


---------128:52----------
this


---------128:55----------
you know so like that whole concept of


---------128:57----------
y'all being a failure is just wrong man


---------129:04----------
no such thing


---------129:13----------
enough for today


---------129:17----------
yeah i'm good awesome yeah


---------129:21----------
i learned that buddha is a meme lord


---------129:24----------
yes one of the greatest tricks he's ever


---------129:28----------
pulled on the world is convincing people


---------129:29----------
that he was something special


---------129:33----------
you guys know this like i'll leave you


---------129:35----------
guys with one last story you guys know


---------129:36----------
what zen masters do when they


---------129:38----------
when they uh attain enlightenment the


---------129:41----------
first thing that they do


---------129:44----------
laugh what because literally what this


---------129:47----------
zen tradition teaches you is that none


---------129:49----------
of it is necessary


---------129:52----------
none of the meditation is necessary it's


---------129:54----------
all scam that's literally what zen


---------129:56----------
buddhism teaches


---------129:58----------
because we're all already enlightened


---------130:01----------
and it's all a big meme like i kid you


---------130:04----------
guys not like if you go and study


---------130:05----------
buddhism that is what they will tell you


---------130:09----------
there's no such thing as like not being


---------130:10----------
enlightened we're all enlightened anyway


---------130:12----------
and it's like all just a scam


---------130:15----------
if people have you know studied with


---------130:18----------
this they'll understand that but it's


---------130:19----------
bizarre they even say they're meme words


---------130:23----------
like buddha was the original meeblor


---------130:25----------
it's like the original troll


---------130:28----------
i'm gonna teach you guys a bunch of


---------130:29----------
stuff that's really hard that you never


---------130:30----------
needed anyway


---------130:34----------
and then the his story of enlightenment


---------130:35----------
you guys know this


---------130:37----------
so he likes like meditates for a really


---------130:39----------
long time and he does all these really


---------130:40----------
harsh systems of meditation


---------130:42----------
he's like [ __ ] it i'm done then he goes


---------130:45----------
and he sits under the tree he's like


---------130:46----------
[ __ ] this [ __ ] and then he becomes


---------130:47----------
enlightened


---------130:50----------
it's when he abandons everything that he


---------130:53----------
gains his enlightenment


---------130:55----------
it's like this is all dumb


---------130:58----------
anyway a lot of good stories


---------131:02----------
okay so we've been at


---------131:05----------
uh um i i do have one thing


---------131:08----------
yeah that so like


---------131:12----------
the idea of like buddhist teaching is to


---------131:14----------
like not take anything too seriously


---------131:16----------
uh and like the thing that you're kind


---------131:18----------
of telling us is like something


---------131:19----------
the same like you know live in the


---------131:21----------
present you know


---------131:23----------
uh like what about like commitments


---------131:26----------
and like not necessarily commitments to


---------131:28----------
like like um


---------131:31----------
i don't know like if you have like a


---------131:32----------
family like have kids and like you can't


---------131:34----------
always


---------131:35----------
you can't always be like you know [ __ ]


---------131:38----------
it we ball


---------131:39----------
sometimes you got to be like okay like i


---------131:42----------
need to like think about the future of


---------131:43----------
my kid and like that can be


---------131:46----------
you know worrisome is that like a


---------131:48----------
healthy worry


---------131:50----------
good question so first of all buddhism


---------131:52----------
never says don't take things seriously


---------131:55----------
okay in fact it says the opposite but so


---------131:58----------
so like and


---------131:59----------
that's that may sound like a


---------132:00----------
contradiction with being a meme lord but


---------132:02----------
like


---------132:05----------
this may sound like a profound statement


---------132:06----------
but like


---------132:10----------
a meme is actually a very serious thing


---------132:13----------
right it's like actually very profound


---------132:16----------
but anyway so to answer your question so


---------132:18----------
this is where like we


---------132:19----------
we bring in dharma right so dharma or


---------132:21----------
duty or responsibility


---------132:23----------
so this is where a lot of people like


---------132:25----------
slip up because they think like


---------132:27----------
you know when i when i say let's go


---------132:29----------
[ __ ] that doesn't mean


---------132:31----------
that i get to do whatever i want to in


---------132:32----------
fact it means the opposite


---------132:35----------
so like what i would say about let's say


---------132:36----------
for example family attachments and


---------132:38----------
parenthood so i'm


---------132:39----------
a parent and i have children so i love


---------132:42----------
my children i'm attached to my children


---------132:45----------
i was pretty good at the detachment


---------132:46----------
thing until i had kids


---------132:48----------
and then actually what i realized like


---------132:50----------
oh this is pretty cool because then


---------132:52----------
i realized this is actually part of my


---------132:53----------
karma and this is the next level


---------132:55----------
because then what i did is become


---------132:56----------
detached from my attachment


---------132:59----------
and i i kid you guys not this i know


---------133:00----------
this sounds weird i had worked so hard


---------133:02----------
to be detached and then i had kids and


---------133:03----------
then i was like oh [ __ ] i'm attached now


---------133:06----------
all of my detachment has gone down the


---------133:08----------
drain now that i'm like loving and


---------133:09----------
investing my kids and then one day i was


---------133:11----------
meditating i started laughing i was like


---------133:13----------
is it that silly how attached i


---------133:16----------
am to losing my detachment


---------133:20----------
and so then i was like [ __ ] it i'm gonna


---------133:22----------
be attached i'm gonna love my kids


---------133:24----------
so be it and then it's been fun since


---------133:26----------
then and i just let myself


---------133:29----------
be invested in them i let myself


---------133:33----------
be worried i let myself stay up late at


---------133:36----------
night because one of them has a fever


---------133:39----------
and what i realized is like you actually


---------133:41----------
live life more fully


---------133:44----------
like let yourself be swept away by your


---------133:46----------
family responsibilities


---------133:48----------
so be it like it it makes no difference


---------133:52----------
like you can you can still


---------133:53----------
live up to your dharma and i think you


---------133:57----------
should live up to your time and like


---------133:58----------
living up to your autonomous simply it's


---------134:00----------
like taking a test i'm not saying


---------134:02----------
sit around and do nothing and don't take


---------134:03----------
tests i'm saying that you guys should go


---------134:05----------
out and you should act


---------134:06----------
but when i'm raising my kids i don't get


---------134:10----------
bent out of shape about whether i'm


---------134:11----------
doing a bad job


---------134:13----------
and now this is important to understand


---------134:14----------
so hopefully you guys can understand


---------134:15----------
this distinction


---------134:16----------
i've tried to do the best that i can and


---------134:18----------
i don't get that out of shape


---------134:19----------
about doing a bad job so i'm not saying


---------134:23----------
absolve yourself of all responsibility


---------134:25----------
and i'm i'm not saying


---------134:26----------
stop trying does that make sense


---------134:29----------
there's a huge there's an entire gulf


---------134:32----------
between


---------134:33----------
doing the best that you can and getting


---------134:36----------
bent out of shape


---------134:38----------
and what you guys do is the opposite


---------134:43----------
because y'all get bent out of shape and


---------134:44----------
don't do the best that you can


---------134:48----------
you'll see that


---------134:51----------
so oddly enough like you can commit to


---------134:54----------
your dharma


---------134:55----------
and this is the power of dharma is that


---------134:57----------
it flips those around for you


---------135:00----------
so a lot of other things that we haven't


---------135:01----------
talked about today the dharma is one


---------135:03----------
ego's one


---------135:04----------
dissolution of ego but if you start


---------135:06----------
living your time because then it's about


---------135:07----------
doing the action right like if your


---------135:08----------
family is depending on you


---------135:10----------
case in point so like what we see in in


---------135:12----------
uh


---------135:14----------
alchem is is like a sense of dharma he's


---------135:17----------
like i've got to do this


---------135:20----------
this is what i have this is what i owe


---------135:22----------
myself to take care of myself


---------135:24----------
and i can't live like this anymore


---------135:26----------
that's actually


---------135:27----------
on its deepest level it's a duty to


---------135:29----------
himself


---------135:32----------
that he deserves more and so he's


---------135:34----------
devoting himself to that


---------135:39----------
hope that answers your question


---------135:44----------
okay cool so i'm spent i'm sure you guys


---------135:48----------
are too


---------135:50----------
yeah so i think maybe we'll have to skip


---------135:52----------
meditation for today


---------135:53----------
i let me just ask you guys real quick i


---------135:55----------
mean like i usually don't talk this much


---------135:58----------
how do y'all feel about that


---------136:01----------
i think it was awesome yeah yeah okay


---------136:04----------
yeah okay


---------136:08----------
took a lot of the pressure off to


---------136:09----------
perform


---------136:12----------
well listen so so actually i have to


---------136:15----------
commend you guys and so like


---------136:16----------
be careful okay so watch what happens


---------136:18----------
when i say this last thing i'll tell you


---------136:19----------
guys i'll leave you hanging after this


---------136:21----------
so i think you guys are so smart that


---------136:22----------
like i didn't need to ask you guys


---------136:25----------
questions you guys asked such insightful


---------136:26----------
questions that i could give you answers


---------136:28----------
y'all are so smart that i knew you could


---------136:30----------
kind of keep up so it's actually really


---------136:32----------
fun for me


---------136:35----------
what does that do to you can't tell if


---------136:38----------
that's a meme


---------136:38----------
[Laughter]


---------136:40----------
i prefer when you're calling us stupid


---------136:44----------
yes right so there's a whole other


---------136:47----------
bucket of stuff like why is it that you


---------136:48----------
guys can't sit with


---------136:50----------
authentic praise


---------136:53----------
a lot of stuff you guys need to work on


---------136:55----------
but


---------136:57----------
and i don't know that you guys can't sit


---------136:58----------
with authentic praise i'm just making


---------137:00----------
assumptions


---------137:00----------
here but anyway strong work today


---------137:05----------
my dudes even if i did most of the


---------137:07----------
talking it's hard to get me to talk


---------137:09----------
so well played um


---------137:13----------
any kind of closing thoughts or


---------137:14----------
questions before we wrap up


---------137:20----------
um just thank you yeah this is like


---------137:22----------
really insightful and a good discussion


---------137:24----------
definitely learned a lot um so i just


---------137:27----------
yeah thank you thank you for having us


---------137:28----------
on here


---------137:30----------
um yeah yeah i'm not super familiar with


---------137:33----------
like


---------137:33----------
your work i've heard like a little bit


---------137:35----------
about it um dr k but


---------137:37----------
um do you have uh any recommendations


---------137:40----------
for like i know you said meditation


---------137:41----------
i have never heard anything about like


---------137:42----------
you doing meditation before do you have


---------137:44----------
any recommendations for things that we


---------137:45----------
could look at for that


---------137:50----------
yeah so we have a lot of like different


---------137:52----------
meditations on our youtube channel you


---------137:53----------
guys like they're just kind of there


---------137:55----------
i think for y'all i don't think it's a


---------137:58----------
good time to teach meditation right now


---------138:01----------
um just because you have to be sort of


---------138:03----------
cognitively there


---------138:05----------
but um i will think a little bit about


---------138:08----------
what kind of meditation for y'all


---------138:11----------
specifically


---------138:12----------
and and maybe we'll pop that up on


---------138:14----------
youtube once i think about it so like


---------138:15----------
what's a good


---------138:17----------
ego dissolving meditation but that


---------138:19----------
doesn't feel quite right to me


---------138:22----------
okay cool i guess i i can give you guys


---------138:26----------
sort of a meditation so there are


---------138:27----------
different kinds of meditations one is a


---------138:29----------
formal meditation practice


---------138:31----------
and one is something that is like more


---------138:33----------
of a


---------138:34----------
it's a different it's not an alum but


---------138:36----------
not so there's like alumni's are like


---------138:38----------
meditative techniques


---------138:40----------
so i'm going to give you guys a


---------138:42----------
meditative a meditation that is not a


---------138:44----------
technique so i know it sounds weird


---------138:46----------
i want you guys to eat something that


---------138:48----------
you dislike and appreciate it


---------138:53----------
so try that okay


---------138:56----------
