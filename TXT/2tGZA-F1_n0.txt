---------00:03----------
all righty


---------00:05----------
let's get started so okay oh my goodness


---------00:12----------
alright let's get started let me see if


---------00:15----------
there's some I need to record so welcome


---------00:27----------
guys to the first official healthy gamer


---------00:29----------
webinar so we're gonna be so this


---------00:33----------
webinar is gonna be a little bit about


---------00:34----------
what I call the science of the self so


---------00:37----------
what I mean by that is that we don't


---------00:39----------
usually learn how we work right so there


---------00:42----------
are a lot of like principles about how


---------00:44----------
human beings function whether it be


---------00:46----------
neuroscience or psychology or yoga or


---------00:50----------
meditation like what we learned from


---------00:51----------
Buddhism or things like that and so


---------00:54----------
we're kind of going through life without


---------00:56----------
understanding like the mechanics or how


---------00:59----------
to use the controller or like the mouse


---------01:01----------
and keyboard for like who we are


---------01:03----------
alright so where did desires come from


---------01:05----------
where does ego come from how does


---------01:07----------
behavior work how does motivation work


---------01:09----------
like no one ever teaches us these things


---------01:10----------
how do you learn how to concentrate how


---------01:12----------
do you focus your mind on one thing had


---------01:15----------
like you know what is the nature of


---------01:16----------
procrastination so this webinar is


---------01:20----------
actually designed to offer you guys sort


---------01:22----------
of a comprehensive answer to a lot of


---------01:25----------
those questions and the structure of the


---------01:28----------
webinar is going to be as follows so


---------01:29----------
every day we're gonna do yoga for about


---------01:31----------
10 minutes so I'm about to shift my


---------01:34----------
camera and we're gonna do something


---------01:35----------
called Surya Namaskar the next and then


---------01:39----------
each day we're gonna have a 30 to 40


---------01:40----------
minute lecture and today's lecture is


---------01:43----------
going to be about motivation and how


---------01:45----------
motivation works where it comes from


---------01:46----------
what's the neuroscience of motivation


---------01:48----------
how to create motivation in your life


---------01:51----------
which is actually incorrect it's really


---------01:52----------
about unlocking or redirecting


---------01:53----------
motivation and then we're gonna have


---------01:56----------
about 10 to 15 minutes for Q&A and we're


---------01:58----------
gonna end with meditation so my goal


---------02:01----------
here is to give you guys kind of a


---------02:02----------
chance to start your day off right


---------02:04----------
during kovat and because everyone's


---------02:06----------
gonna be at home and stuff like that so


---------02:08----------
how can we sort of behaviorally anchor


---------02:10----------
you to doing something like properly on


---------02:12----------
a daily basis how


---------02:13----------
you learn something how can we make it


---------02:15----------
concrete how can we make it


---------02:16----------
comprehensive so I encourage all of you


---------02:19----------
guys to not just watch but to


---------02:23----------
participate in you know the yoga that


---------02:28----------
we're about to do so the first thing


---------02:30----------
that we're going to do is something


---------02:31----------
called Surya namaskara and Surya


---------02:33----------
namaskara is the Sanskrit phrase for Sun


---------02:37----------
Salutation so it's a sequence of yoga


---------02:39----------
poses that is designed to kind of start


---------02:43----------
your day off so you're supposed to do it


---------02:45----------
like in the morning like facing the


---------02:46----------
sunrise ideally and what I like about


---------02:49----------
the Surya Namaskar is that it's kind of


---------02:51----------
like a complete set of yoga poses that


---------02:53----------
you can kind of stick with so when I


---------02:56----------
first started learning yoga back in 2003


---------02:59----------
you know Surya Namaskar actually even


---------03:01----------
before 2003 like when I was a kid and I


---------03:04----------
would go to like Sunday school like


---------03:05----------
Surya Namaskar were the poses that they


---------03:07----------
taught us at the age of 10 and then I


---------03:09----------
went to India and you know started


---------03:11----------
learning I mean relearn Surya Musco and


---------03:14----------
then learned all this advanced yoga and


---------03:15----------
basically now my main yoga practice is


---------03:17----------
like back to pseudonymous car because


---------03:19----------
it's kind of a complete sort of yoga


---------03:21----------
practice and so what so want one or two


---------03:29----------
preparatory things about the suit in a


---------03:31----------
mosque are so the first is that the goal


---------03:33----------
of yoga is not to become a human pretzel


---------03:35----------
so the goal of yoga is not to stretch as


---------03:39----------
much as possible or increase your


---------03:41----------
flexibility Yoga is actually a


---------03:43----------
preparatory practice or Ahsan which are


---------03:46----------
yoga postures or preparatory practices


---------03:48----------
for meditation so the goal of yoga is


---------03:50----------
actually to prepare your mind for


---------03:54----------
meditation or even enter a premeditative


---------03:56----------
state so what do I mean by that so what


---------04:00----------
that means is that when you guys are


---------04:01----------
doing this practice what I want you to


---------04:03----------
notice is what your mind is doing so the


---------04:05----------
goal of these postures is to stress you


---------04:08----------
out enough so that your your mind cannot


---------04:11----------
wander so the reason that the practices


---------04:14----------
are difficult is because your your brain


---------04:16----------
is going to be your somatosensory cortex


---------04:18----------
which is the part of your brain that you


---------04:20----------
know gives you information about your


---------04:22----------
body is going to be sending you so many


---------04:24----------
signals that you're not going to be


---------04:27----------
able to have your mind wander right so


---------04:29----------
if we think about when does the mind


---------04:31----------
wander the mind wanders when we are


---------04:34----------
physically relaxed so if you're


---------04:36----------
physically stressed out it's actually


---------04:37----------
very hard for the mind to wander and if


---------04:39----------
you have a physical demand then the mind


---------04:42----------
is going to focus on that thing so the


---------04:44----------
goal of yoga practice I want you guys to


---------04:46----------
find the point in the yoga practice so


---------04:49----------
if I tell you know for example bend down


---------04:50----------
and touch your toes the goal is not to


---------04:53----------
actually touch your toes the goal is to


---------04:55----------
go down as far as you can to the point


---------04:58----------
that your mind is focused on touching


---------05:01----------
your toes okay yeah I know you guys are


---------05:05----------
so some of y'all are in the EU and


---------05:07----------
things like that so you know hopefully


---------05:09----------
if y'all are here live that's fantastic


---------05:11----------
so do yoga in the middle of the day and


---------05:13----------
yeah so we're gonna go ahead and start


---------05:16----------
[Music]


---------05:32----------
[Music]


---------05:36----------
we're gonna do three so we're gonna


---------05:50----------
start so start by putting your hands


---------05:53----------
this guys can still hear me okay so


---------06:02----------
start by putting your hands so put your


---------06:05----------
feet together and stand up straight and


---------06:09----------
your angles should be touching so you


---------06:13----------
don't want your feet spread apart you


---------06:14----------
want two right next to each other


---------06:15----------
and then place your hands in front of


---------06:18----------
you like this close your eyes and notice


---------06:24----------
that when you close your eyes you be can


---------06:26----------
begin to be unstable that's the first


---------06:30----------
step right if you open your eyes


---------06:32----------
stability returns and then go ahead and


---------06:36----------
close your eyes again


---------06:37----------
and instability returns


---------06:41----------
so just feel that instability focus on


---------06:45----------
stabilization and notice that your mind


---------06:48----------
focuses as soon as the instability


---------06:50----------
returns open your eyes


---------06:52----------
is instability goes away the mind


---------06:55----------
becomes free once again and then go


---------06:58----------
ahead and close your eyes feel that


---------07:03----------
instability and now we'll begin the


---------07:06----------
practice of subió Namaskar


---------07:08----------
so the first step is to raise your hands


---------07:10----------
hands above your head you can open your


---------07:13----------
eyes now and go ahead and let your


---------07:17----------
biceps touch your ears so the goal here


---------07:22----------
is to keep your biceps touching your


---------07:24----------
ears and that's really the posture that


---------07:27----------
you want and just go ahead and feel this


---------07:29----------
for a second feel the stretch in your


---------07:31----------
back the pull excellent go ahead and


---------07:35----------
feel that as you hold it you may begin


---------07:38----------
to quaint a little bit that's perfectly


---------07:40----------
okay and now we're going to go down to


---------07:42----------
step two which is to touch your toes now


---------07:46----------
in this posture we're gonna have to be


---------07:47----------
very careful because the goal actually


---------07:49----------
is not to touch your toes the goal is to


---------07:52----------
hang your head and hang your body down


---------07:55----------
and I want you guys to notice that


---------07:57----------
there's tightness maybe in the back of


---------07:58----------
your legs or in your back or even in


---------08:00----------
your neck and now what I want you to do


---------08:03----------
is let gravity pull you forward let


---------08:09----------
gravity pull you forward keep your legs


---------08:11----------
straight let your head hang and we're


---------08:13----------
just gonna hang like this for a second


---------08:15----------
you notice all the sensations that arise


---------08:18----------
in your body your body's like hey man


---------08:20----------
what are we doing why are we doing this


---------08:24----------
then notice go ahead and come up a


---------08:26----------
little bit


---------08:27----------
and then notice how it's easier and as


---------08:31----------
you go down let your your body hang let


---------08:35----------
your head hang hold that for a second


---------08:38----------
and now we're gonna do step three so


---------08:44----------
what I want you guys to do is put your


---------08:46----------
palms face down right next to your feet


---------08:49----------
so you're kind of squatting right so


---------08:51----------
you're pop the palms of your hands or


---------08:53----------
face like


---------08:54----------
touching the ground just like your feet


---------08:57----------
you may feel a little bit of a stretch


---------08:59----------
and I want you to take your right leg


---------09:01----------
and put it back behind you like this so


---------09:05----------
as you look down you should be able to


---------09:08----------
see actually so as you look down I


---------09:12----------
see that as you look down you should be


---------09:15----------
able to see you know your palms and your


---------09:20----------
your left foot in a straight line your


---------09:23----------
knee is gonna kind of be in your next to


---------09:25----------
your shoulder and then you got this this


---------09:29----------
stretch in the back and notice that you


---------09:31----------
can maybe move your leg up or down a


---------09:33----------
little bit and it kind of enhances the


---------09:34----------
stretch you can kind of go down and lean


---------09:37----------
into it right and then you can kind of


---------09:40----------
go up and just hold that for a second


---------09:45----------
now put the other leg back okay and now


---------09:49----------
we're gonna kind of enter push-up


---------09:50----------
position and hold this for a moment


---------09:53----------
notice it and then we're gonna lay down


---------10:03----------
on the floor and this part is gonna be a


---------10:05----------
little bit weird so what I want you guys


---------10:07----------
to do is I want your toes on the floor


---------10:09----------

---------10:12----------

---------10:14----------
touching the floor chest touching the


---------10:17----------

---------10:22----------
so you're kind of touching the floor on


---------10:25----------
four points forehead chest knees and


---------10:27----------
toes and that's going to create like


---------10:31----------
notice what happens if you just like lay


---------10:32----------

---------10:48----------

---------10:55----------

things about your arms and body when you


---------17:33----------
do yoga okay so let's just start this


---------17:40----------
testing testing testing okay all right


---------17:43----------
so let's go ahead and switch so today


---------17:48----------
[Music]


---------17:51----------
we're gonna talk about motivation so


---------17:54----------
let's start with this this over here


---------18:01----------
okay so how are we gonna understand


---------18:05----------
motivation okay so the first thing that


---------18:08----------
I want to share with you guys is that


---------18:10----------
we're going to talk about motivation


---------18:11----------
okay so the first thing is we're going


---------18:15----------
to talk a little bit about our approach


---------18:17----------
and how this seminar is structured so


---------18:20----------
the first thing is that I want us to


---------18:22----------
draw on a couple of sources of


---------18:24----------
information the first is going to be


---------18:26----------
observation so rather than rely on


---------18:30----------
science or what we know or what we've


---------18:32----------
read we're actually going to focus on


---------18:35----------
observation so we're gonna develop


---------18:37----------
hypotheses and we're gonna make


---------18:39----------
observations about ourself and see if we


---------18:41----------
can uncover things about motivation to


---------18:43----------
better understand how it works the


---------18:45----------
second source of knowledge that we're


---------18:47----------
going to rely on is actually like the


---------18:49----------
yogic or meditative tradition so this is


---------18:55----------
kind of where I learned a lot of this


---------18:56----------
stuff and what I mean by that is that


---------18:59----------
you know Yogi's like basically we're


---------19:02----------
experts at observing the self and


---------19:03----------
through observing the self they made


---------19:05----------
certain observations or conclusions and


---------19:08----------
that's going to be a lot of what we draw


---------19:09----------
on the third thing that we're gonna draw


---------19:12----------
on is neuroscience and I know I just


---------19:15----------
said we're not gonna rely on science but


---------19:16----------
what I mean by that is that I don't want


---------19:18----------
you guys when when I'm asking you a


---------19:20----------
question


---------19:21----------
I don't want your answer to be what


---------19:23----------
you've read I want it to be what you've


---------19:25----------
experienced because here's the thing out


---------19:28----------
like reading


---------19:29----------
something right so you can read a book


---------19:30----------
that explains to you how alcoholism


---------19:33----------
works in the brain and that doesn't


---------19:35----------
necessarily change your ability to


---------19:36----------
control whether you have a drink or not


---------19:38----------
so what's more important than what


---------19:41----------
experts say is what you discover about


---------19:43----------
yourself okay and this is going to be


---------19:46----------
true this segment is gonna be true for


---------19:48----------
basically every part of the webinar that


---------19:49----------
we do that the most important thing is


---------19:52----------
what do you observe or what do you


---------19:54----------
experience and if it's contrary to what


---------19:56----------
the most brilliant neuroscientist says


---------19:58----------
that's fine forget about the


---------20:00----------
neuroscience because you've got to deal


---------20:01----------
with you okay so that's just kind of a


---------20:07----------
quick kind of background about how this


---------20:09----------
is structured okay so now our discussion


---------20:12----------
on motivation is going to have four


---------20:13----------
segments the first segment is do we


---------20:18----------
really lack motivation so we're gonna


---------20:24----------
spend a few minutes talking about you


---------20:26----------
know what's the actual problem like


---------20:28----------
what's going on here like how like what


---------20:30----------
is motivation do we really lack it how


---------20:32----------
do we determine that we lack it or not


---------20:34----------
and the second thing that we're gonna


---------20:36----------
ask is how does motivation work so once


---------20:46----------
we define our problems so this is


---------20:48----------
defining our problem okay this is going


---------20:54----------
to be like understanding or problem the


---------21:01----------
next thing is what does this mean for us


---------21:12----------
right so this is applying you know our


---------21:19----------
understanding of things to us and the


---------21:22----------
fourth thing is what do we do about it


---------21:30----------
right so this is kind of actions or


---------21:34----------
moving forward and this is what everyone


---------21:37----------
everyone wants number four but we're


---------21:38----------
gonna take our time in getting there


---------21:40----------
okay because I think jumping straight to


---------21:43----------
solution actually isn't as important as


---------21:45----------
you know really understanding what the


---------21:47----------
problem is so let's start with number


---------21:49----------
one okay so do you lack motivation so


---------22:01----------
let's just think a little bit about


---------22:02----------
motivation so people tend to say that


---------22:07----------
okay like especially in kind of Gen Z


---------22:09----------
Millennials right we kind of say oh I


---------22:10----------
lack motivation I don't have any


---------22:12----------
motivation I'm lazy I'm undisciplined


---------22:13----------
whatever so let's just think about that


---------22:15----------
for a second so the first thing is that


---------22:18----------
this is a very very common problem right


---------22:21----------
so lacking motivation is common that's


---------22:25----------
number one so what is that what's the


---------22:29----------
significance of that so the first thing


---------22:33----------
that I want you guys to understand so


---------22:34----------
I'm a physician right so I think about


---------22:36----------
things kind of from a medical standpoint


---------22:37----------
and what I want to share with you guys


---------22:39----------
is that pathology is rare what do I mean


---------22:44----------
by that if we look at actual diseases or


---------22:47----------
things that are broken within people


---------22:49----------
those tend to be rare for example like


---------22:52----------
cancer like not everyone doesn't have


---------22:54----------
cancer like cancer is a rare rare thing


---------22:56----------
and and if you're unlucky it kind of


---------22:59----------
happens to you or someone that you love


---------23:00----------
but generally speaking the body works


---------23:02----------
the way it's supposed to so if there's a


---------23:04----------
common problem I don't actually think of


---------23:07----------
it as a problem if an entire generation


---------23:10----------
of people are facing a common shared


---------23:13----------
problem which is that you know we all


---------23:16----------
lack motivation it's not that we lack


---------23:19----------
motivation it's not actually a problem


---------23:21----------
it's actually the way that we're wired


---------23:23----------
right does that make sense


---------23:24----------
like if everyone shares a particular


---------23:27----------
thing like everyone can use their left


---------23:29----------
and right hand or presumably most people


---------23:30----------
can use their left or right hand and if


---------23:33----------
everyone can do it earth it's a common


---------23:35----------
issue with most people then that's sort


---------23:37----------
of how we're designed so the first thing


---------23:39----------
to understand is that


---------23:50----------
okay how do I there we go okay so the


---------23:57----------
first thing to uncannily that


---------24:05----------
fascinating no problem okay so the first


---------24:07----------
thing no okay


---------24:11----------
so pathology is rare we all we all lack


---------24:21----------
motivation okay so then what this means


---------24:28----------
is that actually our brain makes us


---------24:35----------
unmotivated and I'm sorry guys I'm a


---------24:41----------
doctor which means I have terrible


---------24:42----------
handwriting right so even though we


---------24:43----------
we're using electronic medical records


---------24:45----------
we still have terrible handwriting and


---------24:49----------
so so our brain actually makes us


---------24:51----------
unmotivated and that this isn't actually


---------24:53----------
this is not broken I want you guys to


---------24:56----------
really understand this that your lack of


---------24:59----------
motivation is not a problem it's


---------25:01----------
actually how your brain is wired and so


---------25:04----------
the first thing that this kind of clues


---------25:06----------
us into is if everyone's doing it and it


---------25:09----------
seems to be like really really common


---------25:10----------
then like that's what our brain is


---------25:11----------
designed to do it's how our brain is


---------25:13----------
supposed to be and so like this this I


---------25:16----------
think is really important because the


---------25:18----------
basic reason that I think so many people


---------25:20----------
struggle to fix their motivation is that


---------25:23----------
they're defining the problem incorrectly


---------25:25----------
we're trying to fix something that


---------25:27----------
fundamentally is not broken where our


---------25:29----------
brain is designed a particular way and


---------25:31----------
so you're trying to redesign the


---------25:35----------
function of your brain which is like not


---------25:37----------
possible so instead what you should do


---------25:40----------
is like understand how your brain works


---------25:43----------
and then create a life that sort of uses


---------25:46----------
your brain for you instead of trying to


---------25:50----------
reprogram your brain okay so what do we


---------25:56----------
kind of do with this okay this second


---------25:59----------
thing I'm good


---------26:02----------
[Music]


---------26:05----------
okay there we go


---------26:06----------
so the second thing is do you really


---------26:10----------
Mack lack motivation so let's just think


---------26:12----------
about this for a second are you you


---------26:15----------
motivated so what people usually say is


---------26:18----------
that people usually say like no I'm not


---------26:23----------
motivated and let's think about this for


---------26:25----------
a second


---------26:26----------
so when you wake up every day and you


---------26:29----------
kind of feel bad about yourself and


---------26:30----------
let's say I'm just assuming for a moment


---------26:31----------
that you spend your whole day kind of on


---------26:33----------
social media reddit Instagram YouTube


---------26:36----------
gaming etc like you wake up every day


---------26:39----------
and you feel terrible about yourself so


---------26:41----------
you have all of this like shame and and


---------26:43----------
like all these like you know negative


---------26:45----------
feelings which we hate having and


---------26:47----------
despite having all those negative


---------26:49----------
feelings and suffering we continue to do


---------26:51----------
the same thing so I want you guys to


---------26:53----------
think a little bit about suffering and


---------26:55----------
how suffering motivates us right and if


---------26:59----------
we think about it usually like we try we


---------27:01----------
try very hard to avoid suffering like if


---------27:06----------
I have you know if I go to school and I


---------27:09----------
get bullied and people beat me up


---------27:10----------
everyday like it's really hard for me to


---------27:12----------
go to school and so even if we think


---------27:15----------
about it


---------27:15----------
despite daily suffering we continue in


---------27:28----------
our patterns in our patterns so what


---------27:40----------
that means


---------27:41----------
so usually suffering causes us to change


---------27:44----------
our behavior but what this means is our


---------27:46----------
suffering is actually less than our


---------27:50----------
motivation just think about that for a


---------27:52----------
second right in order for you to


---------27:53----------
continue doing something that causes you


---------27:57----------
so much pain and suffering you actually


---------27:59----------
have to be highly highly motivated to do


---------28:01----------
it so when people tell me oh I have no


---------28:03----------
motivation in life all I want to do is


---------28:05----------
play video games what I really interpret


---------28:08----------
is I have a high high high amount of


---------28:10----------
motivation to play video games all the


---------28:12----------
time it's not that you lack motivation


---------28:13----------
it's that your motivation


---------28:17----------
is pointed in the wrong direction so


---------28:26----------
just think about this for a second how


---------28:28----------
hard is it for you to stop playing video


---------28:30----------
games it can be really really hard and


---------28:32----------
if it's it's really really hard that


---------28:33----------
means you're like highly highly


---------28:35----------
motivated to play video games


---------28:36----------
so let's first understand that the


---------28:38----------
problem isn't that we lack motivation


---------28:40----------
the problem is that our motivation is


---------28:44----------
pointed in the wrong direction and


---------28:45----------
furthermore we don't really think we


---------28:48----------
don't really think about how complicated


---------28:51----------
tasks are and we actually have a lot of


---------28:53----------
different kinds of motivation but this


---------28:56----------
is the main thing to understand so now


---------28:58----------
if we kind of accept this premise and if


---------29:00----------
you guys you know I encourage you to


---------29:03----------
observe yourself and ask yourself do you


---------29:05----------
continue doing a behavior despite it


---------29:07----------
causing you suffering and if the answer


---------29:09----------
is yes that means your motivation


---------29:11----------
circuitry is actually really hardcore


---------29:13----------
geared towards that behavior and so then


---------29:17----------
the question becomes like okay so then


---------29:18----------
then you know why do people struggle to


---------29:20----------
fix it and I think the reason people


---------29:22----------
struggle to fix it is because they


---------29:24----------
conceived of it is a lack of something


---------29:26----------
whereas like it's not that it's a lack


---------29:28----------
of something it's just that that thing


---------29:29----------
is there and and it's pointed in the


---------29:31----------
wrong direction so what people try to do


---------29:34----------
is create motivation instead of shifting


---------29:36----------
motivation and I don't know if you guys


---------29:38----------
realize this but like creating something


---------29:40----------
that already exists is like really


---------29:42----------
really hard but if the problem is not is


---------29:44----------
not that you lack it the problem is that


---------29:46----------
like it's an issue of direction not an


---------29:49----------
issue of like absence or presence and


---------29:52----------
this is the first fundamental mistake


---------29:54----------
that people make right as they try to


---------29:55----------
fix something that isn't broken


---------29:58----------
right your effort is completely wasted


---------30:01----------
because actually your motivation


---------30:02----------
circuitry is intact and you're highly


---------30:04----------
highly motivated you're just motivated


---------30:06----------
towards the wrong thing so instead of


---------30:08----------
making motivation what you really need


---------30:10----------
to do is like learn how to turn the


---------30:11----------
steering wheel and then you're going to


---------30:13----------
be in a far better place so my answer to


---------30:16----------
this question is do you lack motivation


---------30:17----------
my answer is no I actually think that


---------30:20----------
most people in our generation are highly


---------30:22----------
highly motivated did they're just highly


---------30:25----------
motivated in a direction they don't want


---------30:27----------
to be if you think about people who like


---------30:29----------
play tons of video


---------30:30----------
like grind stuff right like they're


---------30:32----------
dedicated to playing 10 hours 12 hours


---------30:35----------
18 hours a day day after day after day


---------30:38----------
week after week after week you know


---------30:40----------
people who are sort of addicted to


---------30:42----------
social media and are dedicated to making


---------30:44----------
posts and crafting their posts and


---------30:46----------
getting likes and getting follows


---------30:49----------
they're like so dedicated to it they're


---------30:51----------
highly highly motivated and so you know


---------30:56----------
that the answer is do you lack


---------30:58----------
motivation no so let's start there so on


---------31:01----------
to number two


---------31:03----------
okay how does motivation work okay so


---------31:15----------
the first thing is that motivation isn't


---------31:18----------
binary and what I mean by that is if you


---------31:23----------
think about motivation we talk about


---------31:25----------
motivation in a way that is like I lack


---------31:28----------
motivation or I have motivation but


---------31:29----------
that's not actually how motivation works


---------31:33----------
it's not binary right if you think about


---------31:34----------
your day like let's say so I have a I


---------31:36----------
have a glass of water right so I have a


---------31:39----------
glass of water here and if I have a


---------31:41----------
glass of water then you know my


---------31:43----------
motivation to drink it is like one type


---------31:47----------
of motivation my motivation to make


---------31:48----------
money is separate my motivation to work


---------31:50----------
out a separate my motivation to play


---------31:52----------
video games is separate motivation is


---------31:55----------
not one thing there are a thousand


---------31:56----------
different things that calculations that


---------31:59----------
our brain is brain is performing all the


---------32:01----------
time and depending on those calculations


---------32:05----------
we actually engage in the action or we


---------32:07----------
don't engage in the action so that mean


---------32:09----------
is that we have thousands of motivation


---------32:15----------
calculations and why is this an


---------32:18----------
important point so I believe that in


---------32:23----------
order to move forward in life you need


---------32:25----------
to understand and define your problem


---------32:28----------
and this is also something that comes


---------32:29----------
from medicine which is that if you want


---------32:31----------
to appropriately treat a disease you


---------32:34----------
have to appropriately diagnose a disease


---------32:35----------
so I think a big problem that people


---------32:38----------
face is of inappropriate diagnosis so


---------32:40----------
they say I lack motivation but that's


---------32:43----------
not really


---------32:43----------
actionable like you can't flip a switch


---------32:45----------
in your brain to create more motivation


---------32:47----------
and that's why they fundamentally fail


---------32:49----------
because they're trying to solve a


---------32:51----------
problem that doesn't exist so of course


---------32:53----------
that's going to lead to failure they're


---------32:54----------
developing treatments with an improper


---------32:56----------
diagnosis so what we have to understand


---------32:59----------
is that motivation is actually a


---------33:00----------
thousand different calculations kind of


---------33:03----------
constantly going on and so let me just


---------33:08----------
kind of put that down so motivation


---------33:09----------
really is an ongoing calculation about


---------33:19----------
likelihood of success this is what


---------33:27----------
motivation is and now we're gonna switch


---------33:29----------
gears for a second okay so application


---------33:45----------
window interesting let's do this then


---------33:55----------
okay so now we're gonna do a little bit


---------33:58----------
of we're gonna take a look at


---------33:59----------
neuroscience okay all right great okay


---------34:11----------
so I want to we're gonna see a little


---------34:13----------
bit about what what this means for us


---------34:15----------
and we're gonna look a little bit at


---------34:17----------
science so this is a paper by actually a


---------34:21----------
good friend of mine dr. Daoud who we


---------34:24----------
trained together and so this is a paper


---------34:26----------
about schizophrenia and I think it's


---------34:29----------
bizarre but one of the best ways to


---------34:30----------
learn about motivation is through


---------34:32----------
studying schizophrenia and why is that


---------34:34----------
so if we want to understand how


---------34:36----------
something works one of the best ways to


---------34:38----------
understand the function of something is


---------34:40----------
to look at cases where it's broken right


---------34:43----------
so if we want to like understand okay


---------34:45----------
how does an engine work if we remove one


---------34:48----------
piece of the engine and the engine no


---------34:50----------
longer turns on we can study the engine


---------34:53----------
and sort of figure out okay what is the


---------34:55----------
role of that one piece does that make


---------34:57----------
sense


---------34:57----------
we want to understand something looking


---------34:59----------
at a broken version actually give us a


---------35:02----------
lot of insight into what you know what


---------35:04----------
is broken and what influence that part


---------35:06----------
has and so why do we look at


---------35:08----------
schizophrenia because in schizophrenia


---------35:10----------
people have two major things going on


---------35:12----------
one is something that we call positive


---------35:14----------
symptoms and this is usually what the


---------35:16----------
media portrays which is that people will


---------35:19----------
sometimes become paranoid or hallucinate


---------35:21----------
or have delusions and we actually have


---------35:23----------
decent medications for that the real


---------35:25----------
problem in schizophrenia is actually


---------35:27----------
something that's better called negative


---------35:29----------
symptoms which are over time people with


---------35:32----------
schizophrenia start to become like


---------35:34----------
really really a motivated so when you


---------35:37----------
kind of think about the quintessential


---------35:38----------
crazy homeless person I'm not trying to


---------35:40----------
be judgmental or anything but a lot of


---------35:43----------
times people with schizophrenia end up


---------35:45----------
in like bad social situations because


---------35:47----------
their motivational drives aren't


---------35:49----------
functioning properly and so what we know


---------35:52----------
from schizophrenia is that that


---------35:58----------
basically like some of their


---------36:00----------
motivational circuitry doesn't work


---------36:01----------
properly so let's just define you know


---------36:03----------
as we look at the paper


---------36:06----------
so what we see from negative symptoms is


---------36:09----------
aspects of schizophrenia include


---------36:11----------
constructs such as a sociality which


---------36:13----------
that what that means is people like are


---------36:15----------
not social a volition a reduction in the


---------36:18----------
motivation to initiate or persist in


---------36:21----------
goal directed behavior this is exactly


---------36:23----------
what we're talking about and anhedonia


---------36:25----------
reduction in the ability to experience


---------36:27----------
pleasure


---------36:27----------
so a volition is something that we see a


---------36:30----------
lot in schizophrenia and I think is a


---------36:31----------
lot you also see it in our generation so


---------36:34----------
let's try to understand how evolution


---------36:35----------
works and so what we're gonna do in this


---------36:38----------
paper is we're really gonna look at this


---------36:39----------
figure okay and the first thing that I


---------36:43----------
want you guys to notice is that the


---------36:46----------
behavioral response is over here and you


---------36:49----------
know when we think about motivation we


---------36:50----------
think about okay no motivation means


---------36:54----------
kind of so the first thing is that no


---------37:00----------
one really appreciates that there's a


---------37:01----------
lot of complicated stuff that goes into


---------37:04----------
a behavioral response that's the first


---------37:06----------
issue right so you guys say oh I'm not


---------37:08----------
motivated I need motivation it's not


---------37:10----------
like a leads to be


---------37:11----------
there's actually a lot of different


---------37:13----------
things that happen in the brain that


---------37:14----------
lead to a behavioral response and create


---------37:16----------
motivation so what we're gonna focus on


---------37:19----------
today so I can run through these so the


---------37:21----------
first thing is hedonics so what that


---------37:23----------
means is how likeable the behavior is so


---------37:28----------
how pleasurable the behavior is the


---------37:30----------
second thing that kind of goes into this


---------37:32----------
input is how much you want it so I want


---------37:34----------
you guys to understand this for a second


---------37:36----------
wanting and liking or two different


---------37:38----------
things


---------37:38----------
okay we oftentimes conflate the two but


---------37:41----------
there are actually completely different


---------37:43----------
circuits in the brain your desires and


---------37:46----------
pleasure are actually different things


---------37:49----------
even though they're they're tightly


---------37:51----------
related reinforcement through


---------37:55----------
reinforcement learning through reward is


---------37:57----------
dopaminergic and this is wanting and


---------37:59----------
actually enjoying something is different


---------38:02----------
anyway we're not gonna go too much into


---------38:04----------
that what I really want to focus on is


---------38:07----------
this stuff so the first thing is that


---------38:10----------
our brain is constantly performing a


---------38:12----------
cost-benefit analysis and what that


---------38:16----------
means is that we're like int we're


---------38:17----------
taking in new information we're


---------38:19----------
computing some kind of like we're


---------38:22----------
performing a computation and then based


---------38:24----------
on like new information in a computation


---------38:27----------
that we're doing we construct a plan and


---------38:31----------
then it leads to a behavioral response


---------38:32----------
okay so what does that mean so we're


---------38:36----------
gonna kind of go back to all right so my


---------38:42----------
point and kind of diving into that


---------38:44----------
neuroscience for a second is simply that


---------38:50----------
let's hold on okay my screen there just


---------39:07----------
got restart my screen mirroring there we


---------39:12----------
go


---------39:12----------
[Music]


---------39:15----------
so now going back to this okay so what


---------39:20----------
does this mean for us so the main thing


---------39:26----------
to understand is that motivation is not


---------39:27----------
binary and that actually there's a


---------39:31----------
constant calculation that's going in our


---------39:33----------
in our brain about what we should do and


---------39:37----------
what we should not do so if I think


---------39:39----------
about like drinking a glass of water you


---------39:41----------
know right now I don't feel like


---------39:45----------
drinking the glass of water and my brain


---------39:47----------
is performing a calculation as my sodium


---------39:50----------
level rises in my bloodstream it sends


---------39:53----------
signals to my brain that make me crave


---------39:56----------
water and get thirsty and whether I


---------39:59----------
respond to those signals or not


---------40:01----------
depends on all kinds of things like the


---------40:02----------
availability of water so if water is


---------40:04----------
close by and I'm not very thirsty I'm


---------40:07----------
likely to drink it but if water is not


---------40:09----------
close by then the thirst actually has to


---------40:12----------
increase to change my behavior to get me


---------40:15----------
to go drink water you guys got that so


---------40:16----------
like there are all kinds of like


---------40:18----------
processes that are going on about


---------40:20----------
availability of water what's my thirst


---------40:22----------
level what am i doing right now am I


---------40:24----------
going to be able to drink water later


---------40:25----------
should I drink water now there are all


---------40:30----------
kinds of things that kind of even go


---------40:31----------
into something as simple as drinking


---------40:33----------
water and so what does that mean for us


---------40:35----------
like why do we care about understanding


---------40:37----------
motivation that way and so I'll kind of


---------40:41----------
give you guys an example so like I think


---------40:43----------
understanding the complexity of


---------40:44----------
motivation helps us understand the


---------40:47----------
different components we can act on to


---------40:50----------
increase motivation if we think about it


---------40:52----------
as 100% or 0% then it's like hard to act


---------40:57----------
right but if we think about motivation


---------40:58----------
is 90% and there's like kind of a 60%


---------41:03----------
30% then like how do we navigate between


---------41:06----------
these how does our brain sort of decide


---------41:09----------
like if you know how do we move from 30


---------41:12----------
to 60 to 90 and as we understand more


---------41:14----------
variables we can actually start to make


---------41:17----------
changes in our life to move in this


---------41:19----------
direction so let me give you guys kind


---------41:22----------
of an example of this process and how


---------41:25----------
understanding complexity of something


---------41:27----------
how


---------41:28----------
sus do a better job ah so sometimes


---------41:31----------
people come to me and they say I want to


---------41:34----------
be healthy and then what's my answer


---------41:39----------
that do I say okay here's how you be


---------41:41----------
healthy like okay let me just give you


---------41:43----------
health and people walk around they say


---------41:45----------
oh I want to be healthy I want to be


---------41:46----------
healthy I want to be healthy I want to


---------41:47----------
be healthy I'm not healthy I'm not


---------41:48----------
healthy I'm not healthy I'm not healthy


---------41:50----------
and so how do you become healthy is


---------41:52----------
healthy something you can become like


---------41:54----------
you just become healthy no but that's


---------41:56----------
the way that we talk about motivation we


---------41:58----------
say oh I want to be motivated I lack


---------41:59----------
motivation I have a motivation other


---------42:01----------
people have motivation I don't have


---------42:02----------
motivation I need motivation I need


---------42:04----------
motivation and people can walk around


---------42:06----------
and they say oh I want to be healthy I'm


---------42:08----------
not healthy other people are healthy I


---------42:09----------
wish I was like them if I was luckier in


---------42:12----------
life I would have been born healthy just


---------42:14----------
like they're born healthy but instead


---------42:16----------
I'm lazy and they got the they got dealt


---------42:19----------
a good hand in life where their laziness


---------42:20----------
level is low and my laziness level is


---------42:22----------
high and so I don't have motivation I


---------42:25----------
wish I could be motivated right so this


---------42:29----------
is where I think like if we think about


---------42:32----------
this like it's absurd like you don't


---------42:33----------
become healthy well okay


---------42:40----------
you don't really become healthy what you


---------42:42----------
do is you understand that health so


---------42:48----------
health is an emergent property based on


---------43:01----------
multiple variables and now what I want


---------43:07----------
you I want you guys to just think about


---------43:08----------
that like that makes sense right


---------43:10----------
health is a function of whether you


---------43:12----------
exercise what you eat whether you see a


---------43:15----------
therapist whether you meditate whether


---------43:16----------
you spend out time outdoors whether you


---------43:18----------
socialize health is a really really


---------43:20----------
complicated process and if someone comes


---------43:22----------
to me and says I want to be healthy can


---------43:24----------
you give me a pill to make me healthy or


---------43:26----------
what is the strategy to uncover health


---------43:29----------
my answer is there isn't one there are


---------43:31----------
actually a dozen strategies and the more


---------43:33----------
you understand the components of health


---------43:35----------
the easier it is to be healthy so what


---------43:38----------
we're gonna do is replace this word with


---------43:43----------
motivation right is an emergent property


---------43:48----------
that's based on multiple variables is an


---------43:52----------
ongoing calculation about the likelihood


---------43:56----------
of success and this calculation has many


---------44:00----------
variables okay so then the question


---------44:04----------
becomes part three what does this mean


---------44:08----------
for us okay so what we do is we do a


---------44:21----------
likelihood of success calculation okay


---------44:31----------
so I want you guys to think about this


---------44:34----------
for a second our brains evolved not in


---------44:36----------
our current society but in a society


---------44:38----------
where we were like hunter-gatherers


---------44:40----------
cavemen whatever so I want you to


---------44:41----------
imagine that there was there's a there's


---------44:44----------
a caveman with a spear right and the


---------44:46----------
caveman wants to go hunting and he wants


---------44:48----------
to go look for food so he like leaves


---------44:50----------
his hot in the morning and then he looks


---------44:52----------
at different trails he sees lots of


---------44:56----------
different trails right how does he


---------44:58----------
determine which trail to go down so he


---------45:01----------
looks at five trails and he's like oh I


---------45:03----------
don't really know like what to do but


---------45:04----------
then he sees let's say that he sees


---------45:07----------
tracks over here so see as he sees


---------45:12----------
tracks over here what does that do to


---------45:14----------
his likelihood of success calculation


---------45:17----------
that he's gonna find food in this


---------45:19----------
direction is that is the likelihood of


---------45:21----------
success calculation increases the


---------45:23----------
probability it motivates him to move in


---------45:26----------
this direction you guys see that like


---------45:28----------
suddenly this bit of data actually


---------45:31----------
changes his motivation very quickly it's


---------45:34----------
kind of simple right


---------45:40----------
and then let's


---------45:41----------
like so this is how he this is where


---------45:43----------
motivation comes from so we do as a


---------45:44----------
likelihood of success calculation and


---------45:46----------
then let's say that like over here he


---------45:48----------
sees actually like you know a deer okay


---------45:55----------
so if he sees a deer over here then what


---------45:57----------
does that do to his success calculation


---------45:59----------
it increases his success count equation


---------46:02----------
a lot he's like oh there's actually food


---------46:04----------
there so suddenly his motivation is


---------46:06----------
going in this direction now he's going


---------46:12----------
there even more than over here so if we


---------46:15----------
think about this his internal motivation


---------46:17----------
is actually influenced very clearly by


---------46:20----------
his probability of success calculation


---------46:23----------
so let's think a little bit about that


---------46:25----------
what has to do so what goes into our


---------46:28----------
probability of success calculation so I


---------46:30----------
have a problem okay and I lack


---------46:34----------
motivation so let's say that I don't


---------46:36----------
have a job so what do we think about our


---------46:44----------
probability of success so like find a


---------46:48----------
job what's the probability of success


---------46:52----------
for finding a job the F knows you can't


---------47:01----------
assign a number to that and if you can't


---------47:03----------
assign a number to that you're gonna


---------47:05----------
stay in the middle just think about this


---------47:07----------
for a second if our brain has no idea


---------47:10----------
how to assign up a likelihood of success


---------47:12----------
it's not gonna act right so let's say


---------47:15----------
okay vs. play a game which makes us feel


---------47:25----------
better


---------47:28----------
what's the likelihood of success here


---------47:31----------
100% so think about this look at it


---------47:37----------
right how do you find a job like I don't


---------47:39----------
I don't even know what does that even


---------47:40----------
mean so when our brain when you wake up


---------47:42----------
in the morning and you think about okay


---------47:44----------
I need to find a job and then your brain


---------47:46----------
is like I don't know how to gauge


---------47:50----------
whether that's gonna work or not right


---------47:53----------
it's kind of like waking up in the


---------47:54----------
and saying I want to I want to find a


---------47:57----------
pound of gold and your brain is gonna be


---------48:00----------
like I don't know how to do that


---------48:03----------
like what's the likelihood of success of


---------48:06----------
finding a pound of gold and then your


---------48:09----------
brain is also like okay well we're


---------48:10----------
feeling bad so that's almost like a need


---------48:12----------
that it wants to fix like hunger or


---------48:14----------
thirst


---------48:15----------
so as negative emotions arise within you


---------48:17----------
your brain is like hmmm what can we do


---------48:19----------
about these negative emotions because


---------48:21----------
I'm trying to protect you buddy and I


---------48:23----------
know that you're suffering right now why


---------48:24----------
don't we just go play a game and so the


---------48:26----------
problem is that you the the your brain


---------48:29----------
is actually working perfectly fine it's


---------48:31----------
just it's doing a good job at what it


---------48:33----------
knows how to do and as long as you view


---------48:36----------
your problems as something or your goals


---------48:38----------
as something that like don't have clear


---------48:41----------
likelihoods of success then you're not


---------48:44----------
gonna do them and so let's think about


---------48:48----------
this for a second all right so so a lot


---------48:52----------
of people nowadays would rather play


---------48:56----------
games with a 0% chance of finding a job


---------49:05----------
[Music]


---------49:08----------
rather than apply for a job with a 10%


---------49:19----------
chance of success just think about that


---------49:23----------
for a second you guys would rather do


---------49:26----------
something that definitely does not help


---------49:29----------
you move forward in life versus


---------49:31----------
something that may not help you move


---------49:33----------
forward in life and how on earth does


---------49:35----------
this work right why on earth would your


---------49:39----------
brain pick a 0% chance over a 10% chance


---------49:43----------
and the reason is because this is


---------49:45----------
actually not a 0% chance this is a


---------49:48----------
hundred percent chance of feeling better


---------49:52----------
so it's not that you lack motivation


---------49:55----------
it's simply that you know your brain is


---------49:58----------
doing like a different kind of


---------49:59----------
calculation and like this is why because


---------50:01----------
like what this is why you guys do this


---------50:04----------
right so if you if you think about this


---------50:06----------
you know this is an observation this


---------50:08----------
what I was saying about observation so


---------50:10----------
if we actually look at ourselves we find


---------50:12----------
this to be true and if this is true


---------50:14----------
rather than assuming that we're broken


---------50:16----------
what we should do who is take that


---------50:20----------
observation and try to use it is like


---------50:22----------
scientific data and then develop an


---------50:25----------
explanatory hypothesis that accounts for


---------50:28----------
this observation the observations that


---------50:31----------
you make about yourself are not signs


---------50:32----------
that you're broken they're clues as to


---------50:35----------
how you work and that's a really really


---------50:39----------
important principle that I believe a


---------50:40----------
hundred percent in so don't assume


---------50:42----------
yourself to be broken assume that


---------50:45----------
everything about you is data about how


---------50:47----------
you work and then start to construct a


---------50:49----------
strategy about how to deal with with


---------50:52----------
those truths okay so the second thing is


---------50:56----------
that so if we think about likelihood of


---------50:58----------
success of success what else kind of


---------51:04----------
goes into this so the next big thing


---------51:07----------
that goes into it is confidence right so


---------51:11----------
like if we think about you know our


---------51:13----------
hunter again and let's say that there's


---------51:14----------
a deer over here and then there's a like


---------51:19----------
yak over here okay


---------51:22----------
so whether he goes for the deer or he


---------51:25----------
goes for the Yak depends on his


---------51:27----------
confidence in being able to catch either


---------51:30----------
one right and be able to hunt it down so


---------51:33----------
if we think about a likelihood of


---------51:35----------
success calculation your fundamental


---------51:37----------
confidence for success leads to the


---------51:40----------
likelihood of success so what that means


---------51:42----------
is that if your confidence is low that


---------51:46----------
leads to a low likelihood of success and


---------51:54----------
that's like mathematical and if we have


---------51:57----------
a low likelihood of success that in turn


---------51:59----------
leads to low motivation or lack of


---------52:04----------
behavior right and I don't know how else


---------52:09----------
to put this but why don't you guys wake


---------52:11----------
up every day and and jump up into the


---------52:13----------
air and try to fly because wouldn't it


---------52:16----------
be awesome to be to be able to fly like


---------52:17----------
it would be cool if you could fly like


---------52:19----------
imagine like how fun that would be


---------52:21----------
but why don't you


---------52:22----------
wake up everyday and jump up and try to


---------52:23----------
fly like why don't you guys do that


---------52:25----------
because the likelihood of success is


---------52:27----------
close to zero so even though you want to


---------52:29----------
be able to fly you're not going to spend


---------52:31----------
time trying to fly if the likelihood of


---------52:33----------
success is zero so likelihood of success


---------52:37----------
leads to motivation or lack of Beor or


---------52:40----------
behavior and if we think about what


---------52:43----------
leads to likelihood of success its


---------52:45----------
confidence in your ability okay


---------52:48----------
so what is this so what should you do


---------52:52----------
all this stuff is fine


---------52:54----------
what now right what should you do so the


---------53:05----------
first thing to understand well so let's


---------53:06----------
like look at our equation so confidence


---------53:08----------
[Music]


---------53:11----------
leads to likelihood of success which in


---------53:19----------
turn leads to motivation so now the


---------53:24----------
question is if we want to increase this


---------53:27----------
quantity how can we act on these two


---------53:31----------
quantities so the first is that we can


---------53:34----------
change our task from find a job


---------53:41----------
likelihood of success 0% or a lecture


---------53:45----------
that's not say zero let's be a little


---------53:46----------
bit more fair okay let's say one percent


---------53:52----------
okay to apply for a job


---------53:58----------
ah now what happens so when if we set


---------54:03----------
our target is applying for our job our


---------54:05----------
brain is like oh like apply for job I


---------54:07----------
can do that let's say 30 percent let's


---------54:11----------
remember we're us right so even though


---------54:13----------
it's perfectly in our control our brain


---------54:15----------
is like oh like applying for a job like


---------54:17----------
I understand what that means okay


---------54:19----------
let's even change it a little bit


---------54:21----------
further fill out a job application


---------54:28----------
no that's like 50% and then download a


---------54:36----------
job application


---------54:40----------
that's pretty easy that's like 80%


---------54:43----------
downloading job application is easy you


---------54:46----------
guys see this this is the trend so you


---------54:50----------
have to program your task so that your


---------54:53----------
brain is like oh actually I can do that


---------54:55----------
so if we go back to our hunter if we


---------54:58----------
tell our hunter go find go find food in


---------55:02----------
the mount like in the ten-mile radius


---------55:04----------
the hunter doesn't know where to start


---------55:06----------
you guys get that the more roads they


---------55:09----------
have the bigger the task is the more


---------55:12----------
paralyzed the hunter is so if the hunter


---------55:15----------
gets some kind of data that focuses his


---------55:19----------
attention his ability to act actually


---------55:22----------
increases so we need to do the same


---------55:24----------
thing over here we need to change our


---------55:27----------
tasked to increase the likelihood of


---------55:29----------
success and as you increase the


---------55:31----------
likelihood of success you're more able


---------55:33----------
to act so next question is what about


---------55:37----------
confidence so we're gonna do an entire


---------55:40----------
video on confidence but let's just think


---------55:44----------
a little bit about this so what leads to


---------55:46----------
confidence so the first thing I mean you


---------55:50----------
know how do you get confidence so the


---------55:52----------
first thing is that I'm going to kind of


---------55:53----------
just toss out a couple of things the


---------55:55----------
first thing is that dealing with


---------56:01----------
negative emotion so one of the things


---------56:06----------
that keeps us from being confident is


---------56:07----------
that we're sitting on these piles


---------56:09----------
generally speaking of like negative


---------56:11----------
emotion and if you feel bad about


---------56:12----------
yourself like if you have shame if you


---------56:15----------
have fear if you have low self-worth


---------56:24----------
then it's gonna heart it's it's hard to


---------56:28----------
be confident and confidence is gonna


---------56:30----------
affect all of these numbers right so the


---------56:35----------
first thing and this is kind of weird


---------56:36----------
because everyone kind of thinks about oh


---------56:37----------
how do I solve motivation how do I apply


---------56:39----------
for a job you know that they're looking


---------56:41----------
sort of externally or even they will


---------56:43----------
talk about habit or brain hacks or you


---------56:47----------
know they'll develop all kinds of


---------56:49----------
external strategies whereas my


---------56:50----------
overwhelming experience is that if you


---------56:53----------
actually deal with your negative


---------56:54----------
emotions your confidence increases and


---------56:57----------
the motivation naturally goes up the


---------57:00----------
motivation just goes up on its own it's


---------57:01----------
just like it happens magically like as I


---------57:04----------
do therapy with people and I help people


---------57:06----------
process their negative emotions they


---------57:08----------
just start being more active in life so


---------57:10----------
one solution to motivation is just by


---------57:13----------
directly dealing with your confidence


---------57:15----------
and addressing your confidence the next


---------57:18----------
thing that you can do is understand


---------57:19----------
where confidence comes from so


---------57:23----------
confidence a lot of people think that


---------57:25----------
confidence comes from success but


---------57:26----------
actually that's not true so if you guys


---------57:28----------
watch some of our videos you'll realize


---------57:30----------
that success after success after success


---------57:32----------
actually leads to things like impostor


---------57:35----------
syndrome so confidence comes from


---------57:37----------
[Music]


---------57:40----------
surviving failure okay and so what that


---------57:46----------
means is that when most people are


---------57:48----------
thinking about motivation they think


---------57:50----------
that if they get like something good


---------57:51----------
going on for them they'll be motivated


---------57:53----------
and that kind of leads to like


---------57:56----------
positivity so what I want you guys to


---------57:58----------
understand is that you know likelihood


---------58:00----------
of success comes from confidence right


---------58:03----------
so we kind of have this relationship


---------58:04----------
here and confidence comes from surviving


---------58:08----------
failure and so the real key to building


---------58:14----------
confidence is actually failing and what


---------58:18----------
that means is that failure leads to


---------58:21----------
confidence in confidence leads to


---------58:26----------
success so what that means is that


---------58:29----------
failure really leads to success and


---------58:31----------
let's just think about this for a second


---------58:33----------
like if you think about a kid right how


---------58:35----------
does a kid get confident and walk


---------58:38----------
if you if you've ever watched a kid


---------58:40----------
learn how to walk at first there they're


---------58:43----------
hesitant to walk because they're afraid


---------58:45----------
of falling so they hold onto things and


---------58:47----------
you try to get them to take like one or


---------58:48----------
two steps and you really have to


---------58:50----------
encourage a kid to learn how to walk and


---------58:52----------
so the tricky thing here is like how


---------58:55----------
does a kid learn how to walk and what


---------58:56----------
happens is they fall and then they get


---------58:59----------
back up again and they're like oh


---------59:00----------
actually falling is not that big of a


---------59:02----------
deal and the more they fall the easier


---------59:05----------
it becomes to try so failure makes


---------59:11----------
trying easier and trying is about


---------59:16----------
success confidence is about dealing with


---------59:19----------
the uncertain right so confidence isn't


---------59:21----------
guaranteeing a result if you're


---------59:23----------
confident in something you're willing to


---------59:24----------
do something with uncertainty and so if


---------59:30----------
you guys want to work on your motivation


---------59:31----------
I'd say two things one is change your


---------59:34----------
task okay oh no no no okay so


---------59:44----------
change your task right and the second


---------59:46----------
thing is fail this is what you guys


---------59:49----------
should do and if you really want to


---------59:51----------
understand how to increase your


---------59:52----------
motivation those are the two things that


---------59:53----------
you should do define your task more


---------59:55----------
clearly and learn how to fail and then


---------59:59----------
the third thing is deal with your


---------60:00----------
internal emotions because as long as


---------60:02----------
this stuff is kind of sitting here you


---------60:07----------
guys are gonna be like Sol and this if


---------60:09----------
you kind of deal with this stuff if you


---------60:11----------
get rid of this stuff then suddenly your


---------60:13----------
motivation is going to increase it has


---------60:14----------
nothing to do with your habits or think


---------60:15----------
I mean it has stuff to do with that but


---------60:17----------
I think these are kind of the highest


---------60:18----------
yield things okay so we've got a few


---------60:22----------
minutes for questions okay so we're


---------60:30----------
gonna try this how do I I just click to


---------60:34----------
check for speak


---------60:42----------
speak accept so I think I'm accepting


---------60:49----------
people so if you guys you guys want to


---------60:52----------
try talking how does this work so Martin

okay Oh Vince has joined the room there


---------63:19----------
we go Dell egg great ask your questions


---------63:22----------
guys let's get started we can't hear


---------63:29----------
anything


---------63:35----------
no see a little bit hello yeah ask away


---------63:39----------
buddy okay I have two questions go for


---------63:42----------
the first it's like my brain overvalues


---------63:47----------
my time because I like gaming so much


---------63:49----------
that like doing anything besides gaming


---------63:51----------
so I a high cost for me yep and the


---------63:57----------
second question is like I think I'm


---------63:58----------
meditating wrong I've been doing like


---------64:00----------
for eight weeks but like I see the


---------64:01----------
quests like having major experience at


---------64:04----------
first and I don't have anything okay so


---------64:08----------
let's start with the first one so I


---------64:09----------
completely agree with you that your


---------64:10----------
brain over values the time from gaming


---------64:12----------
that's why everyone games because gaming


---------64:15----------
gives you a very clear like path to


---------64:18----------
success so what should you do about that


---------64:21----------
smaller tisks absolutely right so you


---------64:24----------
have to you have to make the cost of


---------64:27----------
gaming like if you tell yourself to


---------64:31----------
apply for a job or get a girlfriend or


---------64:33----------
get healthy or get in shape your brain


---------64:35----------
is like that is way too much of a time


---------64:37----------
investment for a very low likelihood of


---------64:39----------
success and so what you need to do is


---------64:42----------
change the equation for your brain


---------64:45----------
mm-hmm and you say that you're you're


---------64:50----------
meditating wrong yeah what do you mean


---------64:53----------
by that


---------64:53----------
I been meditating for our like over


---------64:58----------
eight weeks and like I don't have a


---------65:01----------
technique like I tried everything that


---------65:03----------
was on YouTube and I feel like I don't


---------65:08----------
even know mine state and I see the


---------65:10----------
guests in the show like on the major


---------65:12----------
having major experiences at first like


---------65:15----------
Mitch like was major and I don't


---------65:19----------
remember right yeah so that's kind of


---------65:22----------
complicated and has something to do with


---------65:25----------
a Sun script term called Nick Scherr


---------65:27----------
which means initiation and I'm sorry but


---------65:31----------
I know this is gonna sound completely


---------65:33----------
bizarre and is probably gonna create


---------65:35----------
more questions than it answers but


---------65:36----------
there's this concept in meditation


---------65:38----------
instruction where a teacher actually


---------65:40----------
imparts a portion of their spiritual


---------65:43----------
energy to the person they're directly


---------65:45----------
teaching and I actually didn't put so


---------65:48----------
like you and get in


---------65:49----------
she ate it into a meditation practice by


---------65:53----------
a teacher or guru and that somehow that


---------65:55----------
initiation is worth more than like


---------65:58----------
learning it from a book or a video or


---------66:01----------
whatever and I actually did not put any


---------66:03----------
value in that concept I found no


---------66:05----------
scientific validity for that concept


---------66:07----------
until I started making observations that


---------66:10----------
the people that I teach meditation


---------66:11----------
directly to oftentimes have big


---------66:14----------
experiences on the first try whereas a


---------66:16----------
lot of people watching do not I don't


---------66:18----------
understand quite how that works so I'd


---------66:23----------
say that you know continue practicing


---------66:25----------
and try different techniques we're gonna


---------66:27----------
do a little bit of meditation now okay


---------66:30----------
does anybody else have a question I'm


---------66:31----------
gonna Daniel thanks for coming on buddy


---------66:34----------
I'm gonna just boot you and don't do it


---------66:36----------
if it gives room for someone else


---------66:39----------
[Music]


---------66:40----------
anybody else have a question yeah yeah


---------66:45----------
yeah no yep


---------66:49----------
yeah so basically her I was wondering


---------66:52----------
that you said you build confidence by


---------66:53----------
surviving failure yeah and how does it


---------66:56----------
actually happen like shouldn't failure


---------66:59----------
diminishes or contents like you


---------67:01----------
shouldn't really you can build yourself


---------67:04----------
up that way and second question I cover


---------67:05----------
this is that does not depend on your


---------67:08----------
perception like is perceiving failure a


---------67:12----------
certain way I mean let me rephrase sorry


---------67:17----------
perceiving failure a certain way might


---------67:21----------
make you more my increasing motivation


---------67:23----------
and perceiving it definitely might


---------67:25----------
reduce it so how do you influence your


---------67:28----------
perception of that great questions so


---------67:31----------
the first question was doesn't


---------67:33----------
how does failure lead to doesn't failure


---------67:36----------
isn't that a blow to your confidence


---------67:39----------
mm-hmm right so the answer is yes so I


---------67:43----------
didn't say that failing leads to


---------67:45----------
confidence what did I say surviving


---------67:47----------
failure there's a big difference hmm


---------67:51----------
what's the difference your perception


---------67:55----------
very good right so that now we go


---------67:58----------
straight to your second question which


---------68:00----------
is that like if if a child


---------68:02----------
old Falls and gets hurt and they don't


---------68:07----------
feel like if the consequence of the


---------68:10----------
action was negative it's gonna be like


---------68:11----------
it's gonna be a punishment and it's not


---------68:13----------
going to reinforce the behavior


---------68:15----------
confidence comes from surviving failure


---------68:18----------
right it's from knowing that you're


---------68:20----------
actually alive at the end of the day so


---------68:23----------
in my case like when I was failing out


---------68:25----------
of college it did not increase my


---------68:26----------
confidence at all it was the knowledge


---------68:29----------
that like one or two years after


---------68:31----------
graduating that you know I was still me


---------68:34----------
and that even though I had failed and


---------68:36----------
that was a challenge it was kind of like


---------68:37----------
this idea that okay like failing hasn't


---------68:39----------
actually destroyed me that I'm still


---------68:42----------
okay I'm still smart I'm still capable


---------68:44----------
and I just need to change a little bit


---------68:46----------
about like how I function so surviving


---------68:49----------
failure is a big difference from failing


---------68:51----------
and you're right that it has to do with


---------68:53----------
your perception and understand that like


---------68:55----------
failure in and of itself is going to be


---------68:58----------
a negative reinforcer I mean it's not


---------68:59----------
really the right term it's gonna be a


---------69:00----------
Punisher for a particular behavior so


---------69:03----------
it's going to reduce a behavior so this


---------69:05----------
is exactly why processing and


---------69:07----------
understanding your perspective is very


---------69:08----------
important because you're a hundred


---------69:10----------
percent correct that you need to change


---------69:12----------
your perspective on what failure means


---------69:14----------
so a lot of times when we get wrapped up


---------69:17----------
in the ego we look at one failure and


---------69:20----------
then we just stop trying again right so


---------69:24----------
if I fail a class I'm not gonna try


---------69:26----------
again but if you play a video game and


---------69:27----------
you lose a game how does that change


---------69:29----------
your behavior you're just queue up again


---------69:32----------
exactly so there's so what I want you


---------69:35----------
guys to do is think about that and


---------69:37----------
observe within yourself


---------69:38----------
why doesn't losing a game cause you to


---------69:42----------
quit playing and why does losing


---------69:43----------
something at life cause you to quit


---------69:45----------
playing and if you can understand within


---------69:48----------
yourself why you can queue up again


---------69:50----------
that's what confidence is all about


---------69:52----------
right when we think about someone who's


---------69:54----------
confident if I asked a girl out and she


---------69:55----------
says no and I queue up again you view


---------69:58----------
that person as confidence that's the


---------69:59----------
very definition of confidence it's not


---------70:02----------
letting failure affect you and


---------70:04----------
understanding that like your worth as a


---------70:06----------
human being is not necessarily tied to


---------70:09----------
the outcomes of your actions just


---------70:11----------
because a girl says no doesn't mean that


---------70:13----------
I'm unlovable but for a lot of people


---------70:15----------
that's what happens in their


---------70:17----------
right I mean there are a lot of reasons


---------70:19----------
that a girl could say no she could be in


---------70:21----------
a relationship she could have just


---------70:22----------
finished an abusive relationship she


---------70:25----------
could be not interested in men sexually


---------70:27----------
there are all kinds of her romantically


---------70:29----------
there are all kinds of reasons that


---------70:30----------
people say no but when our ego gets


---------70:33----------
involved it no longer is about that


---------70:35----------
aspect and starts to be about us okay


---------70:42----------
awesome and great questions I'm gonna


---------70:44----------
give you the boot to make room for


---------70:45----------
someone else okay all right anyone else


---------70:50----------
yeah you can go okay you were talking


---------71:01----------
about dealing with negative emotions and


---------71:04----------
I grew up being called stupid and


---------71:08----------
whatnot throughout my entire life and


---------71:10----------
I've been failing through the course of


---------71:12----------
like my education and that kind of led


---------71:15----------
me to take through gap years and I know


---------71:17----------
that this is like a big topic on its own


---------71:18----------
but I want to know like how to


---------71:21----------
specifically deal with those emotions


---------71:22----------
because even when I'm listening you talk


---------71:25----------
I get like this anxiety where I'm like


---------71:29----------
I'm not going to understand this I'm not


---------71:30----------
gonna understand this like I'm stupid


---------71:32----------
I'm stupid okay so you're right that


---------71:35----------
that is a whole topic in and of itself


---------71:38----------
and I can't do I can't give you an


---------71:40----------
answer that you deserve in the time that


---------71:42----------
we have left but I'm gonna give you one


---------71:45----------
an answer anyway right so the first


---------71:47----------
thing is it's good that you notice it so


---------71:49----------
I'm gonna ask you is it delag a dozen


---------71:53----------
Delic so delegate so do you if you're


---------71:59----------
noticing that thing you are not that


---------72:01----------
thing does that make sense yeah


---------72:06----------
so that's the first thing to understand


---------72:07----------
is that you don't have to be defined by


---------72:09----------
that feeling even though that feeling is


---------72:11----------
strong it's just a feeling it's not


---------72:13----------
truth and I know this sounds kind of


---------72:15----------
bizarre but oftentimes we think our


---------72:18----------
emotions and our thoughts or facts


---------72:20----------
that's the way that we live and operate


---------72:22----------
through life they're not facts there are


---------72:25----------
just emotions and feelings and if I'm


---------72:27----------
watching a scary movie and I'm scared


---------72:30----------
that doesn't actually mean I'm in danger


---------72:32----------
right now and if I can think all kinds


---------72:36----------
of thoughts like I can think I'm a dumb


---------72:37----------
person and my mind is telling me that


---------72:39----------
but that doesn't mean it's true it's


---------72:41----------
just my mind telling me that so over


---------72:44----------
time what you need to do is learn start


---------72:46----------
to appreciate and notice that delag is


---------72:50----------
actually different there's a part of you


---------72:52----------
there's like there's some kind of like I


---------72:54----------
want you to think about it this way


---------72:55----------
you're the machine you're the computer


---------72:57----------
and you have an OS and then you have


---------73:00----------
programs so the computer is different


---------73:03----------
from the program and you have a program


---------73:04----------
that's running in your head that says


---------73:06----------
deleg is not gonna understand it


---------73:07----------
delegates not gonna understand it Dalek


---------73:09----------
is not gonna understand it


---------73:10----------
it's like Spotify like playing in the


---------73:12----------
background and you're trying to like


---------73:13----------
have a voice chat with someone and


---------73:14----------
Spotify is just gonna like be playing in


---------73:16----------
the background and then it's gonna be


---------73:18----------
like really hard for you to function but


---------73:20----------
just because it's saying that doesn't


---------73:22----------
mean it's true and that starts that


---------73:25----------
recognition starts with noticing and and


---------73:29----------
you know you can also kind of ask


---------73:30----------
yourself like what are other like if you


---------73:32----------
don't think so just think about this for


---------73:33----------
a second if you--if there's a voice in


---------73:35----------
you that says that you're not gonna


---------73:36----------
understand it why why are you still in


---------73:37----------
the sound webinar why don't you drop out


---------73:39----------
you're not gonna understand in any way


---------73:42----------
fair no I'm asking it's not I'm not


---------73:46----------
making a point I'm genuinely asking


---------73:47----------
question why didn't you drop out of the


---------73:48----------
seminar because I want to try and


---------73:52----------
understand beautiful so there is another


---------73:56----------
program in you that says actually I can


---------73:59----------
make a difference actually I want to try


---------74:02----------
and all you need to do is learn to


---------74:05----------
prioritize that program instead of the


---------74:08----------
one that tells you that you suck at life


---------74:09----------
right right so you have both of those


---------74:12----------
programs within you and then kind of


---------74:14----------
like the angel and devil on your


---------74:16----------
shoulder over time you can train


---------74:18----------
yourself to listen to one over the other


---------74:21----------
but it starts with individual moments


---------74:24----------
like this where you chose not to drop


---------74:25----------
out in the seminar and pay attention to


---------74:27----------
that think about like why didn't you


---------74:29----------
drop out did you think about dropping


---------74:30----------
out what happened in your head that kept


---------74:32----------
you from dropping out I mean yeah I did


---------74:36----------
want to drop out of this call because I


---------74:38----------
thought my question was not valuable and


---------74:41----------
it's something so why didn't you write


---------74:44----------
so now you really need to go back in and


---------74:46----------
pay attention to why you didn't drop out


---------74:49----------
well because I hate the almond aspirin


---------74:53----------
sure because I felt as if my issues as


---------74:58----------
you said it's a common issue where


---------75:01----------
people feel as if they well they doubt


---------75:04----------
themselves and then I felt as if since I


---------75:06----------
have the opportunity here I can ask for


---------75:07----------
other people as well yeah but so do you


---------75:10----------
see how that's a different program the


---------75:13----------
content of the program is fine what I'm


---------75:15----------
pointing out to you is that there is an


---------75:17----------
impulse within you that says drop out


---------75:19----------
and there is another impulse within you


---------75:21----------
that says no let me do this as part of


---------75:22----------
my daughter mom let me ask this question


---------75:24----------
for other people even though people are


---------75:26----------
gonna think I'm an idiot because I'm


---------75:27----------
asking a question that's unrelated but


---------75:30----------
you did it anyway you chose to listen to


---------75:33----------
the part that was gonna make you feel


---------75:34----------
like an idiot


---------75:35----------
and that's exactly what embracing


---------75:38----------
failure looks like it's choosing the


---------75:40----------
things that are gonna make you feel like


---------75:41----------
an idiot that's how you build confidence


---------75:43----------
because now delag you're a little bit


---------75:45----------
more confident to speak whether you


---------75:47----------
realize it or not because you did the


---------75:49----------
hard thing you made yourself look like


---------75:50----------
an idiot and it turned out okay right


---------75:54----------
right so now you've survived looking


---------75:56----------
like an idiot how does it feel pretty


---------75:58----------
good there you go


---------76:00----------
right it's that simple it's not easy


---------76:02----------
it's simple okay great question man and


---------76:07----------
more about develop your confidence okay


---------76:10----------
we're gonna have time for one more and


---------76:12----------
then then I gotta go yep my question is


---------76:16----------
about like the focus of meditation of


---------76:19----------
like motivation okay so like the way of


---------76:22----------
like shifting your focus from the thing


---------76:26----------
that you want to the thing that you know


---------76:28----------
is good for you like beating the like


---------76:33----------
biological rewarding system of doing the


---------76:35----------
things you know are not necessarily good


---------76:37----------
for you okay to put that focus on the


---------76:40----------
things you know that are good for you


---------76:42----------
and that you don't necessarily want like


---------76:45----------
in the instant moment yeah so I would


---------76:48----------
actually disagree with your premise how


---------76:52----------
do you know that something is good for


---------76:53----------
you in the sense that it


---------76:57----------
would make me I don't know healthy or


---------76:59----------
would be a an investment of time that I


---------77:04----------
know would worldwide reward me with


---------77:07----------
something that we do you know that well


---------77:12----------
I feel it so where is that feeling


---------77:16----------
coming from it's from like I don't know


---------77:21----------
a vision of the future that I'd like to


---------77:25----------
excellent growth or so let me explain


---------77:27----------
something to you Vince fantasies about


---------77:30----------
the future do not factor in to the


---------77:33----------
likelihood of success calculation that


---------77:35----------
your brain does this is exactly my point


---------77:39----------
so I can fantasize about wanting yacht


---------77:41----------
like I want to have a yacht I want it to


---------77:44----------
have like very fast internet connection


---------77:47----------
I'm gonna get a gaming PC stick it on my


---------77:49----------
yacht and I want to sail around the


---------77:50----------
world while I game while I'm on the


---------77:54----------
ocean and then I want to dock in places


---------77:56----------
and eat delicious local food and what


---------77:59----------
does that do to my motivation well it


---------78:04----------
just enters it because it's kind of a


---------78:06----------
unattainable ideal absolutely right so I


---------78:11----------
think you're so you're you're starting


---------78:14----------
with a couple of assumptions that I


---------78:15----------
don't agree with and that's that you


---------78:17----------
kind of say there are some things that


---------78:18----------
are good for me and there's some things


---------78:20----------
that are not good for me and how do I


---------78:23----------
choose the thing that is good for me


---------78:25----------
instead of like playing video games and


---------78:26----------
I think that your brain doesn't actually


---------78:29----------
understand that those things are good


---------78:30----------
for you because I think that they are


---------78:33----------
like they're they're not things that you


---------78:35----------
feel they're like random rational


---------78:38----------
thoughts or fantasies which don't


---------78:40----------
actually lead to behavioral change that


---------78:43----------
doesn't go into the equation so I think


---------78:45----------
actually what you need to do is go back


---------78:46----------
to that like defining what you want


---------78:50----------
things so the likelihood of success


---------78:51----------
calculation so like what's a goal of


---------78:53----------
like what's an example of something that


---------78:55----------
you think is good for you the you doing


---------78:58----------
healthy perfect


---------79:00----------
so I even addressed this almost directly


---------79:02----------
eating healthy is not a thing how do you


---------79:04----------
eat healthy tell me you put your


---------79:07----------
attention towards buying certain types


---------79:10----------
food and cooking certain types of mean


---------79:13----------
for you so what is the likelihood of


---------79:15----------
success of that the likelihood of


---------79:20----------
success of putting your attention on


---------79:22----------
buying healthy food is pretty high but


---------79:29----------
I'm not so sure about that


---------79:31----------
right so like you my point is that use


---------79:33----------
offered a very complicated statement


---------79:35----------
putting your attention on buying food


---------79:38----------
and then cooking it yeah so what you


---------79:41----------
need to do is chunk up each of those


---------79:43----------
because I agree with you that if you put


---------79:44----------
your full attention on the buying yeah


---------79:47----------
that becomes easier than quote-unquote


---------79:50----------
eating healthy but the problem is that


---------79:52----------
your brain is like they're a bunch of


---------79:53----------
other things that you're talking about


---------79:54----------
here you're talking about


---------79:55----------
you know being willful when you go to


---------79:57----------
the grocery store you're talking about


---------79:59----------
buying food and a lot of people buy


---------80:00----------
healthy food but then what happens then


---------80:05----------
you have to cook it you have to prepare


---------80:08----------
your food yes - and which how to do with


---------80:11----------
that well it depends on the case but I


---------80:17----------
mean if you buy the if your answer is it


---------80:22----------
depends on the case your brain


---------80:23----------
calculates that is a low likelihood of


---------80:25----------
success if your brain thinks it depends


---------80:29----------
that's not a high likelihood of success


---------80:30----------
does that make sense yeah so therein


---------80:33----------
lies your problem because you're talking


---------80:34----------
about eating healthy and health is the


---------80:36----------
example I use because it's a great


---------80:38----------
example of how we actually poorly define


---------80:40----------
tasks for our brain and our brain


---------80:42----------
doesn't know what to do with that yeah


---------80:44----------
so I think in your case I would start by


---------80:47----------
really examining where you get the idea


---------80:49----------
that there is like something that's good


---------80:51----------
for you and something that isn't because


---------80:53----------
I think your brain believes the exact


---------80:54----------
opposite it's like we can do this weird


---------80:56----------
fantasy random amalgamation of tasks


---------81:00----------
that has an unclear chance of success or


---------81:02----------
we can play a video game yeah got it


---------81:09----------
okay I got a run so thank you very much


---------81:14----------
Vince we're gonna do I'm gonna go ahead


---------81:17----------
and I'm sorry Mikey I gotta kick you but


---------81:19----------
we're gonna do five minutes of


---------81:21----------
meditation and then I really do have to


---------81:22----------
run okay


---------81:24----------
