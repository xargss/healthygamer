---------00:04----------
okay we're ready to go thanks so much


---------00:06----------
for making time to see me uh i'm a big


---------00:08----------
admirer


---------00:09----------
oh thank you so uh thanks for the kind


---------00:11----------
words anthony um so i understand that


---------00:13----------
your story is uh a little bit different


---------00:15----------
from some people in our community


---------00:20----------
is it okay if i call you anthony


---------00:22----------
yeah that would be preferable thank you


---------00:24----------
okay so can you tell us a little bit


---------00:26----------
about yourself and um how you got to


---------00:28----------
where you are


---------00:31----------
sure so should i lead with the headline


---------00:33----------
uh you know having murdered somebody and


---------00:35----------
got the prison or should i give a little


---------00:36----------
bit of backstory to explain who i am


---------00:38----------
before i before i completely shatter


---------00:41----------
that


---------00:42----------
um what


---------00:43----------
your choice i i think you've led with


---------00:45----------
the headline at this point i don't know


---------00:47----------
i've already shared an app well i mean


---------00:48----------
it's on the title of the stream so it's


---------00:51----------
not a surprise i think


---------00:52----------
so i'm 41 years old now


---------00:55----------
um american


---------00:56----------
obviously um


---------00:59----------
grew up very poor


---------01:00----------
um


---------01:01----------
in a really abusive home


---------01:04----------
no father


---------01:05----------
uh


---------01:06----------
mom was a drug addict pretty bad when i


---------01:09----------
was young


---------01:10----------
she sold me and my brother one time to


---------01:12----------
the drug dealers


---------01:13----------
well


---------01:14----------
pawned us i guess would be a better way


---------01:16----------
to say it


---------01:17----------
uh and then my grandma ended up having


---------01:19----------
to come and pay her debt to get us to


---------01:21----------
bond us out of the drug dealers i only


---------01:23----------
heard that story later excuse me


---------01:26----------
thankfully i have no memory of that so


---------01:28----------
that that's just to give you a little


---------01:30----------
bit of context i never knew that version


---------01:32----------
of my mom thankfully


---------01:34----------
um


---------01:35----------
when i was two or three years old i got


---------01:37----------
ran over


---------01:39----------
uh my mom ran me over with a with a


---------01:41----------
chevy blazer which is a one ton truck i


---------01:43----------
think


---------01:44----------
um on accident


---------01:45----------
um


---------01:46----------
i remember remembering parts of it but i


---------01:49----------
have no memory of it um


---------01:51----------
i know she was in a rage with her


---------01:53----------
boyfriend


---------01:54----------
and uh was going to leave


---------01:56----------
in in the truck


---------01:58----------
and i evidently tried to stop her and


---------02:00----------
she didn't notice and she ran me over


---------02:03----------
so then i spent the next hmm


---------02:07----------
this is pretty emotional just bear with


---------02:08----------
me this is a hard [ __ ] to talk about


---------02:10----------
i've never talked to anybody about this


---------02:12----------
actually


---------02:13----------
um


---------02:15----------
i spent the next several years in


---------02:17----------
hospitals and wheelchairs and


---------02:19----------
crutches


---------02:21----------
trying to walk


---------02:24----------
and uh


---------02:25----------
never playing never getting to play or


---------02:28----------
anything because


---------02:29----------
you know


---------02:31----------
black cast on both legs


---------02:34----------
so it was tough


---------02:35----------
and uh


---------02:37----------
thankfully i can walk that's something


---------02:39----------
you know


---------02:40----------
and uh to this day


---------02:42----------
actually finally as i get older the pain


---------02:44----------
gets worse


---------02:46----------
just every day it gets worse in my legs


---------02:48----------
um the gift that keeps on giving you


---------02:52----------
know


---------02:52----------
so anyways


---------02:55----------
that was my childhood


---------02:57----------
and uh


---------02:59----------
so then i finally got it i finally got


---------03:00----------
through that


---------03:01----------
and uh


---------03:03----------
started going to school and everything


---------03:05----------
never made any friends everybody hated


---------03:07----------
me


---------03:08----------
uh never could figure out why


---------03:11----------
like


---------03:12----------
we moved a lot a lot


---------03:15----------
and i was the common denominator in


---------03:17----------
every scenario where i had no friends


---------03:20----------
uh


---------03:22----------
i was always bullied and picked on


---------03:26----------
and i'm big i was big as a kid i was the


---------03:28----------
biggest in my class so you would think


---------03:29----------
well how do you get bullied


---------03:31----------
it


---------03:32----------
i wonder it's because i was a [ __ ] and


---------03:34----------
i don't think it is i don't think that's


---------03:36----------
what it was i think i just wanted to be


---------03:37----------
liked


---------03:38----------
and


---------03:39----------
i'm very cerebral


---------03:41----------
i'm not usually this emotional i'm very


---------03:43----------
cerebral and so


---------03:44----------
when people would come and attack me it


---------03:46----------
was like


---------03:48----------
i wasn't getting mad i was just like why


---------03:51----------
like i don't get it yeah i mean i wanted


---------03:53----------
to know why i wanted to talk about it


---------03:54----------
and understand the situation and i never


---------03:56----------
could


---------03:57----------
and so probably an easy prey type of


---------03:59----------
thing you know


---------04:00----------
and plus i was big so it looks good


---------04:02----------
you're you're bullying the big guy you


---------04:04----------
know and so that


---------04:06----------
that that i never had any friends really


---------04:08----------
or i would always have like maybe one


---------04:10----------
outcast fellow outcast it was a friend


---------04:13----------
um


---------04:15----------
and that never lasted long i don't know


---------04:17----------
why i drive all my friends away and


---------04:19----------
again i know i'm the common denominator


---------04:21----------
in all of these things so i would like


---------04:23----------
to know


---------04:24----------
what that is and i know you wouldn't


---------04:25----------
have that insight in a two-hour


---------04:27----------
interview but


---------04:28----------
um


---------04:29----------
that's something i've been trying to


---------04:32----------
figure out like go ahead please i was


---------04:34----------
going to say i may not have that insight


---------04:35----------
but you may have that insight


---------04:37----------
i may and that's what i'm hoping you're


---------04:39----------
very good at leading questions you're


---------04:40----------
very very good at that that's your


---------04:42----------
strength and i've never seen a therapist


---------04:44----------
before or anything like that but if


---------04:47----------
they're all like you and that's the


---------04:48----------
method they use i mean that's phenomenal


---------04:50----------
you know you help the person find the


---------04:52----------
answer within and i think that's


---------04:53----------
critical you don't preach to them from


---------04:55----------
without and i think that that's really


---------04:57----------
important so first of all anthony thank


---------04:59----------
you so much for sharing i mean it sounds


---------05:01----------
like


---------05:02----------
um


---------05:04----------
that's a lot bro


---------05:06----------
yeah i was kind of a dump right there um


---------05:11----------
no i mean i i wasn't so much thinking


---------05:13----------
about the dump just as you know it's one


---------05:15----------
thing to dump that but to have all of


---------05:17----------
that to dump


---------05:20----------
you know that that's sort of more of


---------05:21----------
what i mean it's like wow like can you


---------05:25----------
catch a break in any dimension


---------05:27----------
i feel i feel that much of the time to


---------05:29----------
be honest with you um


---------05:31----------
i'm constantly


---------05:34----------
and i see a lot of your your people talk


---------05:36----------
about this that it resonates with me i'm


---------05:38----------
always waiting for the other shoe to


---------05:39----------
drop


---------05:40----------
when something good's happening all


---------05:42----------
right now what now what's the you know


---------05:44----------
where's the lightning it's got to be


---------05:45----------
coming it's got to be coming if you know


---------05:48----------
if my past history is any is anything to


---------05:50----------
go by you know the bad the bad is coming


---------05:53----------
right away


---------05:54----------
okay


---------05:56----------
um


---------06:01----------
anyway i i sort of jumped in for a


---------06:03----------
second but i think you were sharing a


---------06:05----------
little bit about so it seems like you


---------06:06----------
were getting bullied a lot had trouble


---------06:08----------
making friends you kind of called


---------06:10----------
yourself the common denominator because


---------06:12----------
you're moving around and this keeps


---------06:13----------
happening


---------06:14----------
right new set of people new set of kids


---------06:17----------
same patterns


---------06:18----------
yes exactly and so those are my school


---------06:21----------
years um


---------06:23----------
just to give a little insight into


---------06:24----------
myself um


---------06:26----------
i coasted through school with a's and


---------06:28----------
b's and when i say coasted i mean


---------06:30----------
basically did no work


---------06:32----------
uh i would show up


---------06:34----------
listen to the lectures take the take the


---------06:36----------
test and that's it like i i absorb


---------06:38----------
things quite easily except mathematics i


---------06:40----------
struggle with that greatly but otherwise


---------06:42----------
i


---------06:43----------
it in and i've got it right one time and


---------06:45----------
so that's that's a blessing i have that


---------06:47----------
going for me and i'm really appreciative


---------06:49----------
of that


---------06:50----------
um so i really never had to put in


---------06:52----------
effort at school and that's a trend that


---------06:53----------
continues to this day i'm a full-time


---------06:55----------
student in college and while i would


---------06:57----------
really like to be applying myself


---------06:59----------
i don't


---------07:00----------
i i wait till the very last minute


---------07:03----------
i breeze through it and then i get


---------07:05----------
straight a's so there's like no


---------07:07----------
incentive


---------07:08----------
to break that pattern and that's kind of


---------07:10----------
a drag because


---------07:12----------
at some point that's gonna blow up in my


---------07:14----------
face i'm just waiting on that to happen


---------07:16----------
and i


---------07:17----------
i would like to find the there's the


---------07:19----------
other shoe


---------07:21----------
yeah exactly


---------07:22----------
exactly good call exactly yeah um so


---------07:25----------
those are my school years we were pretty


---------07:27----------
poor like i said


---------07:28----------
made me start working a full-time job


---------07:30----------
when i was


---------07:32----------
i think 12 i had to lie about my age to


---------07:35----------
get a job so i had to work full-time and


---------07:36----------
go to school


---------07:37----------
and i had to pay rent and to my mom and


---------07:40----------
buy my own clothes and all that kind of


---------07:41----------
stuff


---------07:42----------
um


---------07:43----------
she had sent my brother away she gave my


---------07:45----------
brother to state when a couple years


---------07:47----------
prior to that so i was the only


---------07:48----------
remaining kid


---------07:50----------
um


---------07:52----------
to kick me out of the house


---------07:54----------
well


---------07:55----------
she had me put in jail she looked she


---------07:57----------
lied about me and had me put in jail


---------08:00----------
when i was


---------08:01----------
14 i believe


---------08:03----------
15


---------08:04----------
yeah i was 15.


---------08:06----------
um


---------08:08----------
she was very volatile person and by that


---------08:10----------
time i was big enough she couldn't beat


---------08:11----------
me anymore


---------08:13----------
uh


---------08:14----------
just to give you an instance so it


---------08:15----------
wasn't it wasn't just beatings my mom


---------08:17----------
was very physically abusive um i was 10


---------08:20----------
11.


---------08:21----------
you first start to get your adult teeth


---------08:24----------
and i didn't wear a shirt she picked out


---------08:26----------
from me one day


---------08:28----------
and she took my head


---------08:29----------
and she slammed it into the side of the


---------08:31----------
bathtub repeatedly and she broke that


---------08:34----------
tooth which is still broken to this day


---------08:36----------
and she knocked out that tooth


---------08:38----------
and she broke that tooth


---------08:40----------
and then mom told me


---------08:42----------
you better not tell anybody you better


---------08:44----------
tell them you fell off the monkey bars


---------08:45----------
or something


---------08:46----------
because if you don't i'm going to kill


---------08:48----------
you


---------08:48----------
and nobody's going to care i'm allowed


---------08:50----------
to i'm your mom


---------08:52----------
i'm 10 i'm however old i was and so


---------08:55----------
absolutely i believe that that's gospel


---------08:56----------
truth i said and even if they do and


---------08:58----------
even and she didn't say it in this tone


---------09:00----------
i'm trying to try to make light of it


---------09:02----------
because it's very painful for me and


---------09:04----------
that's how i defuse tension


---------09:05----------
um


---------09:06----------
she said


---------09:08----------
and even if they did care


---------09:10----------
all they would do is put you in a foster


---------09:12----------
home and you'd get molested so you know


---------09:14----------
take your choice


---------09:16----------
and so of course i never said anything


---------09:18----------
to her she didn't have to say that by


---------09:19----------
the way that was my mom i loved her to


---------09:21----------
death i wasn't going to tell on her i


---------09:23----------
mean i didn't think i was being abused


---------09:25----------
it was only later i came to that


---------09:26----------
realization


---------09:28----------
i thought


---------09:28----------
she was being a mom


---------09:30----------
so


---------09:32----------
very volatile but eventually i got big


---------09:33----------
enough to where she couldn't manhandle


---------09:35----------
me like that


---------09:36----------
and uh


---------09:38----------
i remember


---------09:39----------
so keep in mind at this time


---------09:41----------
i'm going to school to high school


---------09:43----------
full-time


---------09:44----------
of course since high school


---------09:46----------
um and i'm working full-time


---------09:48----------
and so i'm getting like five hours of


---------09:50----------
sleep a night


---------09:51----------
um


---------09:53----------
i don't mind it you know that's life you


---------09:55----------
got to learn how to work eventually yeah


---------09:56----------
i mean so it is what it is um what i did


---------10:00----------
mind


---------10:01----------
is that every day she would come home


---------10:03----------
from work and it's this co-worker was


---------10:06----------
such a piece [ __ ] this co-worker had


---------10:07----------
done that she got in a fight with this


---------10:09----------
co-worker for that reason uh you know


---------10:11----------
she's dead now you know bless her soul


---------10:13----------
she dead but


---------10:15----------
she was never happy unless she was in


---------10:17----------
conflict i don't know if you've ever


---------10:18----------
known anybody like that but that's


---------10:20----------
unless there was some kind of conflict


---------10:22----------
she wasn't happy


---------10:24----------
and so uh


---------10:26----------
i [ __ ] up this day she came home and


---------10:28----------
she you know this co-worker blah blah


---------10:30----------
blah and


---------10:32----------
you know i'm working too i'm going to


---------10:34----------
school i'm i'm having hell at school no


---------10:36----------
you know it's bullying only gets worse


---------10:38----------
as you get older believe it or not in


---------10:40----------
school um more violent


---------10:43----------
and now i wasn't the biggest so you know


---------10:46----------
and uh


---------10:48----------
i never said [ __ ] i just went about my


---------10:50----------
life i didn't cry about it i complained


---------10:52----------
to her about it i just did my business


---------10:54----------
but every day i got to listen to her


---------10:56----------
negativity


---------10:59----------
and uh


---------11:00----------
so she tells me she tells me all this


---------11:02----------
and i [ __ ] up


---------11:04----------
i said wow you just sound like you have


---------11:06----------
a hard time getting along with anybody


---------11:07----------
at work


---------11:08----------
oh man she freaked out


---------11:11----------
she pulled a knife out on me she she


---------11:13----------
just she just went [ __ ] ape [ __ ] so


---------11:15----------
nothing really came of that


---------11:18----------
except that she went to her room i went


---------11:20----------
to bed we went to our corners we went


---------11:22----------
back to our corners


---------11:23----------
and the next morning i woke up and i was


---------11:25----------
being arrested by the police


---------11:27----------
and she told him i pulled a knife on her


---------11:28----------
and threatened her life and


---------11:30----------
this and that and the other thing


---------11:32----------
actually that was it that was what she


---------11:33----------
told him was that i pulled a knife on


---------11:35----------
her and threatened her life and she's my


---------11:37----------
mom so they took my they took her word


---------11:39----------
for it no questions asked


---------11:41----------
and an interesting fact when you're a


---------11:43----------
juvenile the only person who can get you


---------11:45----------
out of juvenile hole is your legal


---------11:47----------
guardian which in my case was my mom who


---------11:49----------
had put me in there so she had me


---------11:51----------
hostage


---------11:52----------
in there and i had to agree to whatever


---------11:54----------
she wanted me to agree to to get out


---------11:56----------
and uh


---------11:57----------
i dreamed of going to college that was


---------11:59----------
my escape that was my lifelong dream was


---------12:01----------
that uh


---------12:02----------
that i was gonna go to college but no


---------12:04----------
money none


---------12:06----------
no money so


---------12:08----------
scholarship was what i was hoping for


---------12:11----------
but now i had a criminal record


---------12:14----------
and so


---------12:15----------
i went that dream


---------12:16----------
i thought i didn't know i thought


---------12:21----------
and so i dropped out of school after


---------12:23----------
that


---------12:24----------
cause what's the point


---------12:26----------
there's no end game anymore you know


---------12:30----------
uh


---------12:33----------
and my mom kicked me out of the house


---------12:35----------
i guess i dropped out because she kicked


---------12:37----------
me out of the house


---------12:39----------
uh


---------12:40----------
and so i went to live with my uncle


---------12:44----------
and he he was that he actually turned


---------12:46----------
out to be a violent drunk


---------12:48----------
and so then i went to live home i went


---------12:49----------
to go live on the streets


---------12:51----------
and i i wandered around the country i


---------12:53----------
hitchhiked across the country for a


---------12:55----------
while


---------12:58----------
best time of my life


---------13:00----------
in a way


---------13:02----------
that freedom


---------13:04----------
you know what i mean


---------13:06----------
tuckers are amazing people


---------13:09----------
go ahead i was just saying when you said


---------13:11----------
you know what i mean i was about to say


---------13:12----------
no no i don't can you help me understand


---------13:15----------
maybe yeah yeah


---------13:18----------
it's well number one i'm not living


---------13:21----------
under constant fear anymore of my mom my


---------13:23----------
uncle whoever you know


---------13:25----------
but believe it or not living on a


---------13:27----------
highway is it was less


---------13:30----------
emotionally traumatizing


---------13:32----------
so


---------13:35----------
um


---------13:36----------
unless you i i never had a bad


---------13:38----------
experience and i'm a big guy and i was a


---------13:40----------
big guy at that point i'm over six feet


---------13:42----------
tall and i'm big you know i'm a big guy


---------13:45----------
so


---------13:46----------
it would not be the same i think for a


---------13:48----------
woman hitchhiking across the country but


---------13:50----------
for a man i i've never had a negative


---------13:52----------
experience


---------13:53----------
you know truck drivers would give me a


---------13:55----------
ride


---------13:56----------
they would shoot the ship with me they


---------13:57----------
would give me a little cash to help me


---------13:58----------
on my way and i just met really good


---------14:01----------
people i just met a lot of really good


---------14:02----------
people across the country


---------14:04----------
and uh


---------14:07----------
so


---------14:08----------
to cut to the chase


---------14:10----------
i ended up at one point oh so my brother


---------14:13----------
was 18 by this point he had been


---------14:15----------
released by the state


---------14:16----------
he'd been let she had given him away to


---------14:18----------
the state he was now living on his own


---------14:21----------
so i went to go stay with him


---------14:24----------
my brother always hated me i think


---------14:26----------
i think he always hated me


---------14:28----------
he was he


---------14:31----------
i i can't even give you i don't even


---------14:32----------
want to go into that too deeply because


---------14:34----------
it it doesn't really matter he hated me


---------14:35----------
but i looked up to him he was the only


---------14:37----------
male in the house even though he was


---------14:39----------
only a couple of older years older than


---------14:42----------
i


---------14:42----------
he was like a father figure i suppose in


---------14:45----------
my mind


---------14:46----------
but he always hated me and rejected me


---------14:48----------
and and uh never want to be around i was


---------14:50----------
the annoying little brother you know i


---------14:52----------
was a tag along little brother who had


---------14:54----------
zero social skills of


---------14:57----------
and make friends


---------14:59----------
uh


---------15:00----------
as you know when other people are


---------15:02----------
learning those social i've i've only


---------15:03----------
read this in recent months when i've


---------15:05----------
been wondering what the [ __ ] up with


---------15:06----------
me


---------15:07----------
um


---------15:09----------
i didn't get that socialization at the


---------15:11----------
crucial years


---------15:13----------
you know and so uh you know there's no


---------15:15----------
making up for lost time i think with


---------15:17----------
that so that's something i've gone


---------15:18----------
through my whole life


---------15:20----------
complete lack of social skills


---------15:22----------
um


---------15:25----------
and uh


---------15:27----------
so i went to stay with my brother


---------15:28----------
temporarily


---------15:30----------
he said i could i could stay with him


---------15:31----------
for a couple of months


---------15:33----------
and uh so i wouldn't stay with him


---------15:37----------
and i thought well that'd be cool


---------15:39----------
and it was it was in a way but


---------15:42----------
he lived in a place


---------15:44----------
he lived excuse me


---------15:51----------
he lived in a place you can't even call


---------15:53----------
where he lived in town it was it was


---------15:55----------
nothing it was in nowheresville there


---------15:57----------
was no jobs there was no businesses


---------15:59----------
there was no nothing there was there was


---------16:01----------
it was nothing


---------16:02----------
um he just happened to live there and so


---------16:04----------
there was nothing for me to do he was at


---------16:06----------
work all day there was nowhere for me to


---------16:08----------
get a job there was nothing for me to do


---------16:10----------
so i was just there bored and then he


---------16:12----------
would go hang out with his friends and i


---------16:14----------
he didn't want me coming along


---------16:16----------
and so


---------16:17----------
i guess i felt rejected by that all


---------16:19----------
right i definitely felt rejected by that


---------16:20----------
but i only realized that now i didn't


---------16:22----------
realize that at the time


---------16:23----------
um


---------16:24----------
funny how hindsight is so useful but


---------16:27----------
foresight would be even better


---------16:29----------
um


---------16:31----------
so


---------16:34----------
he had a good friend so


---------16:36----------
they were like


---------16:39----------
they were in a gang


---------16:41----------
right


---------16:42----------
but the thing is this town like they had


---------16:44----------
two rival gangs but


---------16:46----------
there's no town there's nothing to fight


---------16:48----------
over so i don't understand right to this


---------16:50----------
day i still don't so they were in this


---------16:52----------
game


---------16:53----------
and um


---------16:54----------
one night


---------16:56----------
they uh


---------16:58----------
my brother was out with his friends


---------17:00----------
and then the friends came back and my


---------17:02----------
brother wasn't there


---------17:03----------
and so i asked my brother's friend i


---------17:05----------
said well where's my brother


---------17:07----------
and he said um


---------17:09----------
oh well we got jumped by by these rival


---------17:11----------
gang members and they pulled a gun


---------17:13----------
and so i ran away and your brother's


---------17:15----------
still there


---------17:17----------
and so i said what the what what so


---------17:20----------
we went and got a guy i went got my gun


---------17:22----------
and we were gonna go get my brother and


---------17:23----------
try to rescue him and then he just


---------17:24----------
happened to pull up at that time well


---------17:27----------
that that that is why i tell people i


---------17:30----------
killed that guy okay that scenario the


---------17:32----------
fact that he let my brother


---------17:34----------
have a gun pulled on him and abandoned


---------17:36----------
them


---------17:36----------
and that's true that is that is


---------17:39----------
partially true


---------17:40----------
that is publicly true and that that is


---------17:42----------
true within me as well but that's not


---------17:43----------
the whole story i don't think


---------17:45----------
i think a lot of it was jealousy the


---------17:47----------
relationship he had with my brother that


---------17:48----------
i didn't right


---------17:50----------
the fact that my brother liked him more


---------17:52----------
than me and clearly obviously no no


---------17:54----------
bones about it right


---------17:56----------
and um


---------17:57----------
so i think it was that sort of jealousy


---------17:59----------
that caused me to do that and i've only


---------18:01----------
come to that realization later


---------18:04----------
that


---------18:05----------
perhaps if it were not for that


---------18:08----------
that's if it were not for that


---------18:12----------
jealousy i would not have let that be a


---------18:15----------
reason to shoot him


---------18:17----------
so i just want to make a couple things


---------18:19----------
clear anthony so first of all um


---------18:22----------
you know are i want to make sure


---------18:25----------
i don't know how we're going to make


---------18:26----------
sure of this but um i understand that


---------18:29----------
you spent some time in prison but like


---------18:31----------
is there anything that you could be


---------18:32----------
saying right now that could get you in


---------18:34----------
trouble


---------18:35----------
no i've been convicted of it i was


---------18:37----------
guilty i've already done my prison


---------18:39----------
sentence okay so i i just want to make


---------18:42----------
because i'm not a lawyer it doesn't


---------18:43----------
sound like you're a lawyer


---------18:45----------
um i i you know the last thing that i


---------18:47----------
would want is anything negative to


---------18:49----------
happen to you by no no this is okay this


---------18:52----------
was a case that long long since been


---------18:54----------
adjudicated i've i've fulfilled my


---------18:57----------
sentence for it uh it's it's so so it


---------19:00----------
sounds like the dude that abandoned your


---------19:02----------
brother you ended up killing


---------19:04----------
yes i shot him


---------19:06----------
like at that time or like later


---------19:08----------
later on later on so that that that


---------19:11----------
whole night


---------19:12----------
so when my brother showed up


---------19:14----------
the guy was like oh you're one of us now


---------19:17----------
you proved your loyalty you're you're


---------19:19----------
part of the gang now by getting jumped i


---------19:21----------
guess i don't know my brother was all


---------19:22----------
beat up


---------19:23----------
so they shaved his head


---------19:26----------
uh i guess this was a sereno ritual or


---------19:28----------
whatever i don't i don't know anything


---------19:29----------
about it i i'm speaking it out of


---------19:31----------
ignorance so i just don't know


---------19:33----------
um


---------19:34----------
and so there was a big party that night


---------19:38----------
and um


---------19:40----------
everybody left slowly but surely


---------19:42----------
everybody trickled out


---------19:43----------
and santiago is my victim's name


---------19:46----------
i want to call him by name because he


---------19:48----------
deserves that respect what i did was


---------19:49----------
[ __ ] up


---------19:51----------
and santiago was the last was still


---------19:53----------
there in fact they stayed overnight


---------19:55----------
now santiago was 24


---------19:59----------
and his girlfriend was 14


---------20:02----------
and uh yeah that was kind of creepy you


---------20:04----------
know but they were there that night


---------20:06----------
and he was sleeping on the couch and she


---------20:08----------
was sleeping on the floor and my brother


---------20:10----------
was in bed


---------20:12----------
and they went to sleep


---------20:13----------
and so then i went to my room and i went


---------20:15----------
to sleep well the next morning my


---------20:16----------
brother went to work this was six a.m


---------20:18----------
roughly um and so i was up


---------20:22----------
and they were still asleep


---------20:24----------
and so


---------20:26----------
i woke the guy up


---------20:28----------
and i said hey


---------20:30----------
so what's up


---------20:31----------
so you know you're a real [ __ ] right he


---------20:34----------
said what's that


---------20:35----------
i said you're a real [ __ ]


---------20:38----------
he said why is that i said you almost


---------20:39----------
got my brother killed


---------20:41----------
and he had this little


---------20:43----------
18 inch


---------20:45----------
aluminum crowbar


---------20:47----------
and he picked it up and he said what do


---------20:49----------
you want to have a problem or what


---------20:52----------
and he didn't know i had a pistol right


---------20:53----------
there in my lap


---------20:55----------
and so i said yes i do and i shot him in


---------20:58----------
the face


---------20:59----------
and he died later at the hospital


---------21:02----------
and his girlfriend woke up


---------21:05----------
and said what what what's happening


---------21:07----------
to nothing i don't know what do you mean


---------21:10----------
and uh


---------21:11----------
anyways that's i'm not gonna get into


---------21:13----------
the nitty-gritty of it because that's


---------21:14----------
just gossip and there's no point that's


---------21:16----------
what came of it


---------21:18----------
uh the police came


---------21:20----------
i got arrested


---------21:21----------
i got second degree murder i did i was


---------21:24----------
16 years old


---------21:25----------
got charges i got charges in adult


---------21:28----------
i got 20 years in adult prison


---------21:31----------
uh the maximum possible sentence


---------21:35----------
i was terrified going into prison


---------21:38----------
because you know


---------21:40----------
people know what prisons like


---------21:42----------
enjoy they think they do i i guess i


---------21:44----------
would say


---------21:45----------
and you know school bullying's bad but


---------21:48----------
prison prison there's nowhere to go


---------21:49----------
there's no home to go to you're there


---------21:52----------
and i knew that i knew that um


---------21:56----------
if you get victimized once it'll never


---------21:57----------
stop in there it will never stop


---------22:01----------
and so


---------22:02----------
truthfully at 16 and 20 felt like a life


---------22:05----------
sentence


---------22:06----------
i see people saying like 20 years is not


---------22:08----------
that bad and things like that but


---------22:11----------
trust me it's in prison it's not 20


---------22:13----------
years it's it's 20 lifetimes


---------22:16----------
um


---------22:17----------
so


---------22:19----------
i got 20 years but it felt like a life


---------22:21----------
sentence to me so all my give a [ __ ]


---------22:23----------
were gone and i didn't want to be a


---------22:25----------
victim


---------22:26----------
i knew that much going in i didn't want


---------22:28----------
to be a victim if nothing else i knew


---------22:30----------
that


---------22:31----------
and so


---------22:33----------
i kind of just went crazy in there like


---------22:34----------
i didn't care if somebody talk if


---------22:36----------
somebody talked


---------22:38----------
slick it was going down that was the


---------22:40----------
bell immediately you know i mean and i


---------22:42----------
stabbed people and i got new time i got


---------22:44----------
new prison sentences in there i got


---------22:46----------
increased sentences in there for


---------22:48----------
stabbing people and


---------22:50----------
long story short


---------22:52----------
um


---------22:54----------
prison is about what you expect maybe


---------22:56----------
it's real boring i don't really have too


---------22:58----------
much too much to go into about that i


---------23:00----------
don't feel like it gave me anything


---------23:02----------
positive


---------23:03----------
at all


---------23:05----------
i feel like it was only a negative


---------23:06----------
experience


---------23:08----------
i deserved i had coming i deserved it i


---------23:11----------
have zero regrets about going to prison


---------23:13----------
i deserved every bit of it so so i'm not


---------23:16----------
here feeling sorry for myself about that


---------23:17----------
everything else yeah that no i i deserve


---------23:20----------
that 100 percent longer i feel but


---------23:23----------
there's a lot of self-loathing i feel


---------23:25----------
about that


---------23:26----------
and uh


---------23:28----------
what do you mean by about killing that


---------23:30----------
killing santiago


---------23:36----------
and so


---------23:37----------
i've been out


---------23:40----------
are you able to hear me okay because


---------23:41----------
your screen just cut out yeah sorry i'm


---------23:43----------
switching servers again it kind of


---------23:44----------
lagged out for a second i can hear you


---------23:48----------
and so


---------23:51----------
and so uh i've been out


---------23:54----------
five or six years


---------23:56----------
i had to start from square zero


---------23:58----------
all my family cut me off when i went to


---------24:00----------
prison


---------24:01----------
um so i have no fam i had i still have


---------24:03----------
no family


---------24:05----------
my mom tried to make


---------24:07----------
my mom tried to make um


---------24:11----------
try to make a connection when i got out


---------24:13----------
only when i got out but i went to prison


---------24:15----------
when i went when i got arrested she told


---------24:17----------
me she hoped i got the death penalty


---------24:19----------
um


---------24:22----------
i was a monster


---------24:24----------
it's like well


---------24:26----------
thank you creator dr frankenstein i


---------24:28----------
appreciate that assessment


---------24:30----------
um


---------24:33----------
so


---------24:35----------
we didn't talk for 20 years


---------24:37----------
and i got out and she wanted to


---------24:39----------
reconnect


---------24:41----------
and um


---------24:43----------
i tried


---------24:44----------
i couldn't forgive her i just couldn't


---------24:46----------
forgive her


---------24:48----------
and


---------24:50----------
she later died she had drank herself to


---------24:52----------
death over the years


---------24:54----------
um


---------24:56----------
and


---------24:57----------
i did tell her though i remembered the


---------24:59----------
good things she did for us you know not


---------25:00----------
just the bad but the good


---------25:03----------
the only thing i ever wanted her to


---------25:04----------
acknowledge was it


---------25:07----------
she was young


---------25:09----------
she didn't know how to parent and she


---------25:10----------
did a shitty job


---------25:13----------
oh we were bad kids that's all there was


---------25:15----------
to it we were bad kids


---------25:18----------
nobody ever had bad kids


---------25:20----------
like what she did nobody


---------25:23----------
you're the worst thing that ever


---------25:26----------
happened how do you feel about not being


---------25:29----------
able to forgive her


---------25:33----------
all i wanted was an acknowledgement


---------25:35----------
i guess i've forgiven her i guess i've


---------25:37----------
forgiven her internally but not a


---------25:39----------
hundred percent i don't think


---------25:41----------
because without that acknowledgement


---------25:42----------
[ __ ] that she [ __ ] up


---------25:44----------
i just can't get past there or yeah i


---------25:47----------
guess i can forgive i just can't get


---------25:48----------
over it


---------25:49----------
and uh


---------25:51----------
go ahead i see your i see you're poised


---------25:53----------
on the verge of yeah


---------25:55----------
looks like you know my tells well


---------25:57----------
anthony yeah cause i i was just gonna


---------25:58----------
kind of ask like you say you can't


---------26:00----------
forgive her but like


---------26:02----------
you know


---------26:03----------
whose fault is that


---------26:06----------
fine yeah i mean i can only i can only


---------26:09----------
control my emotions myself


---------26:12----------
i mean so that that's where i know it's


---------26:13----------
kind of weird but like


---------26:15----------
i'm not so sure right so i i would say


---------26:18----------
and i i mean anthony i'd sorry if i'm


---------26:20----------
interrupting and if you want to keep


---------26:22----------
going go for it but no no just to kind


---------26:24----------
of jump in for a second so i think like


---------26:25----------
something weird has happened with


---------26:26----------
forgiveness


---------26:28----------
where we've placed the burden of


---------26:30----------
responsibility


---------26:32----------
on like the person who does the


---------26:33----------
forgiving the victim the victim right


---------26:36----------
right which is sort of weird like i


---------26:38----------
think it's just interesting because i i


---------26:39----------
think that forgiveness is like yours to


---------26:41----------
give or not to give and it's entirely


---------26:43----------
your choice


---------26:44----------
you know just forgiveness earned


---------26:47----------
i think so


---------26:49----------
it's kind of isn't that what they say


---------26:50----------
that you have to earn somebody's


---------26:51----------
forgiveness and so yeah i guess i get


---------26:54----------
where you're i picked up what you're


---------26:55----------
putting down there yeah


---------26:56----------
right so so it's in in this i'm noticing


---------26:59----------
that there's like themes which you know


---------27:01----------
you're sharing a lot with me like i said


---------27:02----------
i don't know that i can figure things


---------27:04----------
out in two hours but you may be able to


---------27:07----------
and and just kind of noticing that like


---------27:10----------
you know what's the common denominator


---------27:11----------
who's to blame


---------27:13----------
you know this idea that if i want to be


---------27:15----------
a good person like i should forgive


---------27:17----------
right because we sort of associate that


---------27:20----------
we say like good people are the ones


---------27:21----------
that are forgiven if i don't forgive


---------27:24----------
what that also means is that like then


---------27:25----------
i'm a bad person and i haven't been


---------27:27----------
you know good enough my heart is not big


---------27:29----------
enough to where i can forgive my mom


---------27:31----------
who's never acknowledged any of the crap


---------27:33----------
that she's done to you


---------27:36----------
and and there's a part of me that says


---------27:37----------
like that's fine


---------27:40----------
right you don't you don't have to


---------27:42----------
actually forgive her like you don't need


---------27:44----------
to forgive and you don't need to forget


---------27:46----------
i think making peace with it


---------27:48----------
is one thing but i think that you can


---------27:50----------
make peace with it without forgiving you


---------27:52----------
can say that i will never forgive this


---------27:54----------
person for what they did


---------27:57----------
you know that can never be repaired


---------28:00----------
and i got the short end of the stick in


---------28:03----------
that relationship and i will


---------28:05----------
be disappointed and hate them as well as


---------28:08----------
love them and that can be like a


---------28:09----------
confusing piece to come to


---------28:12----------
but i don't think you need to forgive


---------28:14----------
her


---------28:15----------
you know especially if she never asked


---------28:17----------
for it


---------28:18----------
right


---------28:19----------
well because she didn't feel like she


---------28:20----------
needed forget there was she had done


---------28:22----------
nothing wrong in her eyes yeah in fact


---------28:24----------
she she and i want to emphasize here the


---------28:26----------
things i described my mom did to me i


---------28:28----------
was the favorite


---------28:30----------
my brother was the


---------28:32----------
she made it very obvious that he was the


---------28:34----------
least favorite he got it so much worse


---------28:37----------
than i did


---------28:38----------
and he kind of lucked out


---------28:41----------
and that she turned him over to the


---------28:43----------
state because he ended up at this boys


---------28:45----------
ranch that he loved and just so he kind


---------28:48----------
of lucked out in a way but also with a


---------28:49----------
horrible mom right yeah and so when i


---------28:52----------
confronted her years later after prison


---------28:54----------
i said well why did you do these things


---------28:56----------
to me i was imagining things she said


---------28:59----------
and i said oh am i imagining broken


---------29:03----------
am i imagining those broken teeth


---------29:06----------
i said you not you slammed my face


---------29:08----------
against the bathtub


---------29:10----------
and you knocked my oh and she broke my i


---------29:12----------
forgot to mention that my jaw got broken


---------29:13----------
in that as well so i had to have my jaw


---------29:15----------
wired shut after that as well


---------29:17----------
and i said so until you broke my jaw and


---------29:19----------
knocked out three of my teeth am i


---------29:21----------
imagining that she said i caught you


---------29:24----------
smoking


---------29:26----------
so it wasn't that she didn't remember


---------29:28----------
what she had at first alleged it was


---------29:30----------
that she thought she had caught me


---------29:31----------
smoking which i guess if that's good


---------29:33----------
enough to abuse your child but that


---------29:35----------
wasn't even the cause it was this shirt


---------29:38----------
so


---------29:40----------
to get over that is very difficult


---------29:42----------
because


---------29:43----------
like without the acknowledgement or the


---------29:45----------
asking of the forgiveness or even the


---------29:47----------
realizing that she needs forgiveness


---------29:49----------
it's very difficult for me to overcome


---------29:51----------
that


---------29:52----------
so i've been out now six years


---------29:56----------
starting from square zero like i said i


---------29:58----------
i i started out with call center jobs


---------30:00----------
and i i've just been pulling myself up


---------30:03----------
by the bootstraps as they say um


---------30:06----------
that's rough yeah that's been rough


---------30:09----------
because the felony is also a gift that


---------30:11----------
keeps on giving


---------30:12----------
a little known fast you can't rent you


---------30:15----------
can't rent a place with a felony on your


---------30:17----------
record


---------30:18----------
uh


---------30:19----------
you can't really get most jobs but yet


---------30:21----------
you also were supposed to work and and


---------30:24----------
live somewhere and live lawfully so i


---------30:25----------
don't understand how that conundrum


---------30:27----------
works for a lot of people but thankfully


---------30:30----------
through sheer dumb luck i guess i've


---------30:33----------
managed to scrape by so far and keep a


---------30:35----------
roof over my head and a job


---------30:37----------
and


---------30:39----------
then the coronavirus thing happened


---------30:41----------
and uh


---------30:42----------
i've been out of work


---------30:44----------
for quite a while now


---------30:46----------
year and a half


---------30:48----------
and uh i think idleness has been causing


---------30:51----------
i know it has i i've i went through i'm


---------30:54----------
gonna assume it was a depression


---------30:56----------
this last year months long like verge of


---------30:59----------
suicide


---------31:00----------
and i'm not exaggerating i mean


---------31:03----------
trying to figure out a reason to live


---------31:05----------
trying to figure out a reason to go to


---------31:07----------
tomorrow


---------31:09----------
and coming up empty


---------31:11----------
too cowardly to kill myself


---------31:15----------
and um


---------31:17----------
i had never experienced believe it or


---------31:19----------
not 20 years in prison never experienced


---------31:21----------
depression never experienced anything


---------31:23----------
like that


---------31:25----------
um


---------31:26----------
it was crippling it was horrible


---------31:29----------
i think it was the idleness


---------31:32----------
and uh


---------31:34----------
so


---------31:36----------
i've just been coasting along trying to


---------31:38----------
figure out what what the [ __ ] am i


---------31:39----------
supposed what am i supposed to do i'm


---------31:40----------
sorry i don't know if you i i'm gonna


---------31:42----------
try to stop cussing because i don't know


---------31:43----------
what how your format is on that um


---------31:47----------
but


---------31:48----------
i gotta figure out what i'm gonna do


---------31:49----------
with myself and you know and i don't


---------31:52----------
know


---------31:54----------
nothing nothing is appealing nothing is


---------31:56----------
appealing um i don't leave my house i'm


---------31:59----------
pretty much a shut-in at this point


---------32:02----------
so eventually i just said you know what


---------32:03----------
you gotta land on something


---------32:05----------
and so i'm going to college full-time


---------32:07----------
for computer programming


---------32:09----------
because like i said i'm pretty


---------32:10----------
intelligent i can pick things up pretty


---------32:12----------
easily and that looks like something


---------32:13----------
where even with a felony


---------32:15----------
you can at least make a reasonable


---------32:17----------
living


---------32:18----------
um


---------32:20----------
and so yeah that's what i'm doing and


---------32:22----------
it's it's going fine it's all right um i


---------32:25----------
i'm 4.0 gpa i'm in my sophomore year


---------32:28----------
i've been 4.0 every semester but


---------32:32----------
again i don't i don't apply myself i'm


---------32:34----------
unable to apply myself to this it's like


---------32:37----------
i can do the bare minimum to coast wow


---------32:40----------
okay if i got anything less than an a i


---------32:42----------
would actually apply myself i have to be


---------32:43----------
honest i'm pretty egotistical about my


---------32:45----------
grades but the fact that i'm able to


---------32:48----------
coast along and just get that i feel


---------32:50----------
like sort of is handicapping me in a way


---------32:52----------
um for the future


---------32:54----------
or maybe not i i i'm kind of torn


---------32:56----------
between that or are my motors going to


---------32:58----------
kick in when they need to kick in and


---------33:00----------
right now i can idle and so i'm just


---------33:02----------
idling you know and i i don't know the


---------33:05----------
answer that's some things i'm hoping you


---------33:06----------
can help me figure out am i lazy am i


---------33:09----------
unmotivated


---------33:11----------
uh i don't know


---------33:13----------
i'm very lazy i'll tell you that right


---------33:14----------
now


---------33:15----------
tell me about that


---------33:19----------
i would love to tell you about that


---------33:20----------
because that's something i would like to


---------33:21----------
talk about


---------33:22----------
um


---------33:25----------
small things that require no


---------33:27----------
intelligence or no thought or no no


---------33:30----------
present no challenge


---------33:33----------
i i i till the till the dishes are piled


---------33:36----------
up in the sink and i'm out of clean


---------33:37----------
clothes those things aren't getting done


---------33:39----------
until the floors look disgusting they're


---------33:40----------
not getting swept and mopped so the


---------33:42----------
table is covered in dust i'm not gonna


---------33:44----------
dust it


---------33:45----------
i hate that kind of thing i i don't hate


---------33:47----------
it i


---------33:48----------
and the interesting thing is


---------33:50----------
i don't hate it when i'm doing it i


---------33:52----------
dread it when i'm planning it when i'm


---------33:54----------
doing it it's sort of a zen thing you


---------33:56----------
get into where you just turn your brain


---------33:58----------
off and you go


---------33:59----------
and yet i dre i dread it right so i


---------34:02----------
don't know


---------34:03----------
but on the other hand if a pro if


---------34:05----------
something comes up and it seems really


---------34:07----------
really challenging and difficult and oh


---------34:09----------
god it's going to be brutal


---------34:11----------
let's go i'm on it and i will work


---------34:13----------
maniacally until in


---------34:16----------
done and so


---------34:18----------
so


---------34:19----------
is that a bit


---------34:21----------
i would say that would be a benefit if i


---------34:23----------
would feel the fill that other time was


---------34:25----------
something productive but i don't i feel


---------34:26----------
it with watching youtube and playing


---------34:28----------
video games and just time wasting reddit


---------34:31----------
and just time wasting do you do you have


---------34:34----------
fun playing video games and watching


---------34:35----------
youtube


---------34:37----------
watching youtube know i feel like i'm


---------34:39----------
actually addicted to uh youtube to be


---------34:41----------
honest with you i


---------34:43----------
it's addictive man it pulls you in


---------34:45----------
you're going to watch one thing and then


---------34:47----------
the next thing you know you're just


---------34:48----------
blindly clicking videos that sound


---------34:51----------
mildly interesting trying to find


---------34:53----------
something a video that you can actually


---------34:55----------
make it through to the end that's in


---------34:57----------
and it's like a vicious cycle and i will


---------34:59----------
keep you up till three in the morning


---------35:00----------
sometimes when i have to be in bed at


---------35:02----------
10.


---------35:03----------

---------35:04----------
that's something i struggle with a lot


---------35:06----------
my video game at the love hate


---------35:08----------
relationship i play world of tanks i'm


---------35:11----------
terrible at it but


---------35:13----------
what are you gonna do one of us if you


---------35:16----------
say that a video game is a is a


---------35:18----------
love-hate relationship that means you're


---------35:20----------
one of us


---------35:21----------
right absolutely if you don't hate at


---------35:24----------
least half eight your video game you're


---------35:26----------
not doing it right


---------35:28----------
hmm


---------35:30----------
so anthony what can i help you with


---------35:34----------
well


---------35:36----------
i guess just like how do how do i


---------35:38----------
okay another thing i guess i'm not done


---------35:41----------
okay um


---------35:42----------
i have not been with a woman since i've


---------35:44----------
been out


---------35:46----------
i've not really seen any that i've been


---------35:48----------
attracted to


---------35:49----------
to be honest with you that aren't in a


---------35:51----------
relationship or whatever the case may be


---------35:54----------
but also i just don't seem to feel a sex


---------35:56----------
drive that other people feel like ever


---------35:58----------
well i mean i i masturbate i stop


---------36:01----------
every month or so once a month or so but


---------36:04----------
that's quite low i know i i see the


---------36:06----------
urges that other people have and i've


---------36:07----------
never really felt those i've never felt


---------36:09----------
very


---------36:10----------
very uh i guess that a very cerebral


---------36:13----------
i've never felt very


---------36:14----------
very sexually uh


---------36:16----------
driven


---------36:17----------
and uh


---------36:19----------
oh but a lot of people ask me what are


---------36:21----------
you gonna hook up with a woman man


---------36:23----------
and i would like to i'm not saying i


---------36:24----------
wouldn't like to very much like to


---------36:27----------
but i just don't have that impulse to go


---------36:29----------
out and get it i'm waiting on her to


---------36:31----------
knock on my door i suppose


---------36:33----------
you mentioned that there's damage to


---------36:34----------
your legs and you feel pain is that


---------36:36----------
right yeah yeah i learned pretty bad how


---------36:40----------
are you i know it's kind of like a weird


---------36:41----------
question do you know if you have like


---------36:43----------
any atrophy of the of the quadriceps


---------36:45----------
muscles


---------36:46----------
so i don't have a calf muscle at all i


---------36:49----------
don't know let me see if you can see


---------36:50----------
what we're working with here


---------36:53----------
i don't know may i don't know what the


---------36:54----------
quadricep is so i don't know thighs are


---------36:57----------
your thighs atrophied


---------36:59----------
so no but my calf muscle is okay um and


---------37:03----------
my feet are deformed i have horrible


---------37:04----------
sciatica


---------37:06----------
uh back pain um


---------37:08----------
just like


---------37:10----------
and it's getting worse like i've been to


---------37:12----------
doctors and they pretty much tell me i'm


---------37:14----------
imagining things or that there's nothing


---------37:16----------
they can do about it basically is what


---------37:18----------
it boils down to


---------37:19----------
um


---------37:21----------
but then they don't look either they


---------37:22----------
don't they never touch you they won't


---------37:24----------
actually cut your back and i don't know


---------37:26----------
if that's how you examine a back but i


---------37:27----------
would think that touching the back as a


---------37:29----------
professional would be a good place to


---------37:30----------
start they won't even lay a finger on


---------37:32----------
you they won't even touch you


---------37:34----------
they ask you questions they send you in


---------37:36----------
for an mri that's about that big you get


---------37:38----------
that much of them to look out of your


---------37:39----------
back oh no we don't see anything sorry


---------37:42----------
try these exercises try these stretches


---------37:44----------
those don't work oh then we're out of


---------37:46----------
ideas


---------37:47----------
and so


---------37:48----------
that's very frustrating like a straight


---------37:50----------
leg test where they lift up your heel


---------37:54----------
do they do this i don't know


---------37:56----------
i don't i think maybe a physical


---------37:57----------
therapist did


---------38:00----------
i'm a [ __ ] psychiatrist


---------38:01----------
you're supposed to do that


---------38:04----------
okay so


---------38:06----------
i would like to learn


---------38:07----------
okay


---------38:09----------
why am i so lonely and alone


---------38:12----------
can that be changed and if not how do i


---------38:14----------
make peace with that


---------38:16----------
and


---------38:18----------
um


---------38:21----------
how do i find a purpose in life like i


---------38:23----------
don't


---------38:24----------
like computer programming is just for


---------38:27----------
it's just something to do i feel no


---------38:29----------
passion for it whatsoever it's just it's


---------38:31----------
interesting i'll give it that it's


---------38:33----------
interesting and it's challenging but


---------38:34----------
it's not something i'm like


---------38:37----------
ah this is something i'm really driven


---------38:38----------
to do and i used to feel that way about


---------38:41----------
things and i


---------38:42----------
i still do about some things you know


---------38:44----------
politics but


---------38:46----------
i


---------38:47----------
probably shouldn't honestly i i got


---------38:49----------
involved in prison politics pretty


---------38:51----------
heavily


---------38:52----------
as a white person


---------38:54----------
and


---------38:55----------
i'm a pretty virulent anti-semite


---------38:58----------
um


---------38:59----------
and i feel very strongly about that i'm


---------39:01----------
not a racist but i'm very anti-semitic


---------39:03----------
um


---------39:04----------
and so


---------39:06----------
that's not something that's really


---------39:07----------
socially acceptable in 2021


---------39:10----------
and uh


---------39:12----------
is what it is i don't care i believe


---------39:13----------
what i believe and i


---------39:14----------
i know what i know and so it is what it


---------39:17----------
is it's not up for debate or negotiation


---------39:19----------
um


---------39:22----------
but


---------39:25----------
i want to know what to do with my life i


---------39:27----------
want to know how do i find passion about


---------39:29----------
something


---------39:31----------
anything i used to believe in in


---------39:33----------
religion well i was the first thing to


---------39:35----------
go


---------39:37----------
you know although interestingly the more


---------39:39----------
i study quantum physics in the beginning


---------39:41----------
of the universe the more that just


---------39:42----------
sounds like god so i don't know maybe


---------39:44----------
the more i learn the more


---------39:46----------
the more religious i become


---------39:47----------
interestingly um so i guess i'm just


---------39:50----------
more questioning on a religious aspect


---------39:52----------
but


---------39:53----------
that really doesn't that institution


---------39:55----------
doesn't have the the faith for me it


---------39:57----------
once had the government has lost all


---------40:00----------
credibility with me long since probably


---------40:02----------
just as i got older


---------40:04----------
um maybe that's natural you see you know


---------40:07----------
how the sausage is being made and that's


---------40:09----------
an ugly process in general


---------40:11----------
um


---------40:13----------
and so politics has lost all of its


---------40:16----------
that institution has lost all its


---------40:18----------
credibility for me the media has lost so


---------40:21----------
like


---------40:22----------
what do i believe in i guess that's what


---------40:23----------
i'm what am i to believe in maybe that's


---------40:26----------
what i'm trying to get to what am i to


---------40:27----------
believe in


---------40:30----------
do you feel lonely


---------40:32----------
yes


---------40:33----------
and no i love solitude but at the same


---------40:36----------
time i feel so lonely sometimes i see


---------40:39----------
being with other people looks like fun


---------40:42----------
from the outside


---------40:43----------
being with other people is a trying


---------40:46----------
chore for me tell me about that


---------40:50----------
it's nothing not bad it just it feels


---------40:52----------
tiring i i at the end of it i want the


---------40:54----------
whole time i want to go home


---------40:58----------
i don't say that but i'm just like i'm


---------41:00----------
just like i'd rather be home doing my


---------41:02----------
thing anyway i'm out


---------41:04----------
what what what is it that's trying about


---------41:06----------
being with other people


---------41:08----------
what drains you


---------41:16----------
they're trying to be interest facade


---------41:19----------
perhaps putting on a facade


---------41:21----------
um


---------41:22----------
because in reality so i displayed a


---------41:25----------
little bit of personality here you know


---------41:26----------
i can make a little joke now and then


---------41:28----------
but in reality everybody that is a


---------41:30----------
facade if it were just me being me i'm


---------41:32----------
probably the most boring


---------41:35----------
monotone person you've ever met in your


---------41:37----------
life until i get interested in a topic


---------41:39----------
and then i will just spew


---------41:41----------
this wall of


---------41:42----------
knowledge at you about that subject


---------41:46----------
you know more than you ever wanted to


---------41:48----------
know about this subject probably you


---------41:50----------
never wanted to know anything about it


---------41:51----------
but i knew it right


---------41:53----------
and i want to share it with you and


---------41:54----------
that's the only thing i ever get excited


---------41:56----------
about is things that i know learning


---------41:58----------
knowledge


---------41:59----------
um i love learning i love i love knowing


---------42:02----------
things and i love learning and if there


---------42:04----------
were a way to monetize that that would


---------42:06----------
be fantastic but


---------42:08----------
like being a professional student


---------42:11----------
yes that would be amazing


---------42:13----------
okay


---------42:16----------
hmm


---------42:18----------
i'm gonna need like a minute to think


---------42:21----------
yeah yeah process i'm ready for you


---------42:34----------
so you know anthony my first reaction is


---------42:37----------
that i would expect to feel emotionally


---------42:40----------
worse listening to your


---------42:42----------
story like it sounds like you've been


---------42:46----------
so you know once again we don't diagnose


---------42:48----------
things on stream


---------42:50----------
but there's one diagnosis that comes to


---------42:52----------
mind which is a diagnosis that one of um


---------42:56----------
so there was a nurse who worked in the


---------42:58----------
emergency room where i trained or did


---------43:00----------
most of my emergency shifts


---------43:02----------
and so she was like awesome is awesome i


---------43:05----------
presume i'm sure she's still working


---------43:06----------
there so she was like older wiser you


---------43:09----------
know i think a lot of times we think


---------43:11----------
about doctors as experts but in my


---------43:14----------
experience like wisdom comes from nurses


---------43:17----------
more often than not


---------43:19----------
and and so


---------43:21----------
i think that um she had an interesting


---------43:23----------
diagnosis so sometimes we'd see these


---------43:25----------
people honestly like yourself to be


---------43:27----------
completely honest like 16 years old


---------43:29----------
usually adolescents


---------43:31----------
uh a list of different diagnoses


---------43:34----------
um a list of like you know you look at


---------43:36----------
their like chart and it's like they were


---------43:38----------
in this foster home went to juvie for a


---------43:40----------
year like we'd get these like 17 year


---------43:42----------
old kids


---------43:44----------
really nasty to talk to


---------43:46----------
you know like you go into the room and


---------43:48----------
they're they're like you know


---------43:51----------
kind of


---------43:53----------
acidic


---------43:54----------
not pleasant


---------43:56----------
um and so her diagnosis was [ __ ] life


---------43:58----------
syndrome


---------44:00----------
so it's not any of the fancy stuff


---------44:01----------
that's in the chart it's not depression


---------44:03----------
it's not bipolar it's not substance use


---------44:06----------
it's not trauma like they have all of


---------44:08----------
those things


---------44:10----------
but the real diagnosis is [ __ ] life


---------44:12----------
syndrome


---------44:13----------
and it was one of the most like


---------44:16----------
eye-opening


---------44:19----------
um


---------44:20----------
kind of like


---------44:21----------
teaching points for me that like we can


---------44:23----------
put all kinds of labels on you right but


---------44:26----------
like i don't think that any of those


---------44:28----------
labels actually capture who you are


---------44:32----------
um you know convicted felon um you know


---------44:37----------
chad with a 4.0 gpa without studying


---------44:39----------
computer science you know like


---------44:41----------
there are all kinds of labels like


---------44:43----------
trauma victim like absolutely like all


---------44:44----------
those labels check out


---------44:47----------
you know i i don't think cerebral is


---------44:50----------
another example


---------44:51----------
i don't think they're all bad


---------44:53----------
um someone who can't forgive which i


---------44:56----------
think is fair enough i don't think you


---------44:57----------
should try very much harder to be honest


---------45:00----------
but i don't think any of those are who


---------45:02----------
you are and so oddly enough like what i


---------45:05----------
see is like a dude who's basically had


---------45:07----------
some like really really bad luck have


---------45:10----------
you made some bad choices sure but i


---------45:12----------
don't know that you were ever taught


---------45:13----------
what a good choice is


---------45:16----------
um


---------45:17----------
you know should you be held responsible


---------45:19----------
for


---------45:20----------
shooting someone absolutely


---------45:22----------
and yet should you also should we also


---------45:25----------
like


---------45:26----------
i don't know how else to say this i


---------45:27----------
don't think we should overreact to that


---------45:29----------
data point in determining who you are


---------45:33----------
right it's an action


---------45:35----------
like is it a bad action is it a horrific


---------45:37----------
action is it an action that you may


---------45:39----------
never get forgiveness for sure i think


---------45:42----------
all of those things are correct


---------45:44----------
i'm not implying otherwise


---------45:46----------
and at the same time it's still an


---------45:48----------
action is it a catastrophic one


---------45:50----------
absolutely but i don't think it


---------45:51----------
determines who you are and this is where


---------45:54----------
like you know i draw a little bit on on


---------45:56----------
kind of eastern philosophy and i think a


---------45:58----------
big part of that is that


---------46:00----------
the human ego identifies with actions


---------46:04----------
you cannot be a failure that's not a


---------46:06----------
thing you can fail


---------46:08----------
but you can't be a failure but the human


---------46:11----------
brain and especially our ego our hamkar


---------46:14----------
identifies with our actions right so


---------46:16----------
even if you like look at me and you say


---------46:18----------
like i'm a doctor like that's not a real


---------46:20----------
thing


---------46:21----------
like very s


---------46:23----------
precisely


---------46:24----------
how do you know that someone is a doctor


---------46:26----------
well i have like a piece of paper that


---------46:28----------
has a medical degree


---------46:29----------
but i would be the first to say the


---------46:31----------
moment i got that medical degree is not


---------46:32----------
the moment i became a doctor it happened


---------46:34----------
like six months later


---------46:35----------
but i i like know when it


---------46:38----------
but it's not anything that you can


---------46:39----------
measure i mean you can in because


---------46:41----------
there's a societal you know agreement


---------46:44----------
that i'm a doctor


---------46:46----------
um


---------46:48----------
but i as and so i think that like a lot


---------46:49----------
of this is like there's a lot of stuff


---------46:51----------
here for sure and a lot of it's bad for


---------46:53----------
sure have you been through a lot


---------46:55----------
absolutely has that screwed you over in


---------46:59----------
some very fundamental ways like


---------47:01----------
absolutely


---------47:02----------
so like did you miss core developmental


---------47:05----------
milestones that help you understand like


---------47:07----------
how to engage with other people yes


---------47:10----------
oddly enough i find myself not being


---------47:12----------
hopeless


---------47:13----------
so i think that just hearing you and


---------47:16----------
listening to you and like just like


---------47:17----------
seeing the way that you relate


---------47:20----------
like are you what i'm sort of getting


---------47:22----------
the sense of is that your


---------47:27----------
how can i say this


---------47:30----------
i think ninety percent of what holds you


---------47:32----------
back is what you've had to learn to


---------47:34----------
survive


---------47:35----------
and so the good news is that like i


---------47:38----------
think you can unlearn that stuff


---------47:40----------
and you can i'm not i'm not kidding


---------47:42----------
anthony when i say you could on your


---------47:44----------
50th birthday


---------47:46----------
be married have a stable job be paying a


---------47:48----------
mortgage and like live in the burbs like


---------47:50----------
i don't think that that's an


---------47:52----------
unreasonable thing for you to have


---------47:55----------
nine years from now


---------47:56----------
right like


---------47:57----------
is it is it a long road sure is it gonna


---------48:00----------
be tough absolutely


---------48:02----------
have you pulled yourself up by your


---------48:03----------
bootstraps it sounds like you're in the


---------48:05----------
process are there a lot of like oh i own


---------48:08----------
my own house right now


---------48:10----------
okay out in the mountains


---------48:12----------
uh i got a beautiful house like honestly


---------48:14----------
it's my dream house it's it it was it's


---------48:16----------
still a crap hole but it's i built this


---------48:18----------
office myself like everybody that's


---------48:20----------
coming along so that's i'm making


---------48:22----------
significant progress but i just i feel


---------48:25----------
like that other person to share with is


---------48:27----------
a vital missing component


---------48:30----------
but it also fills me with dread the


---------48:32----------
thought of having to go out and


---------48:35----------
obtain that and and and put myself out


---------48:38----------
there and


---------48:39----------
and share my life with somebody else you


---------48:42----------
know what i mean that sounds very trying


---------48:45----------
yeah so what what fills you with dread


---------48:48----------
about finding someone


---------48:52----------
so every girl every girl i've ever


---------48:54----------
expressed any interest in


---------48:56----------
only likes me as a friend or boy that


---------48:59----------
she sure likes me like a brother you


---------49:01----------
know i get that a lot friends um okay so


---------49:04----------
you really are one of us


---------49:07----------
right and this is going to come off as


---------49:09----------
judgmental but that's only because i am


---------49:10----------
judgmental and as shitty as that is


---------49:12----------
that's who i am as a person and they try


---------49:14----------
to hook me up with anybody


---------49:16----------
it's usually a bridge troll to be honest


---------49:19----------
and it's like is that how little you


---------49:21----------
think of me


---------49:23----------
that this is somebody you think i would


---------49:24----------
be sexually attracted to right i see


---------49:26----------
your disgust on your face and and like i


---------49:28----------
said i'm a judgmental person


---------49:30----------
unfortunately you see disgust on my face


---------49:33----------
oh maybe i'm misreading maybe i'm


---------49:34----------
misreading what are you reading i'm


---------49:36----------
curious


---------49:37----------
just when i when i when i said the thing


---------49:39----------
about the bridge troll you look like a


---------49:41----------
disapproving look perhaps perhaps i


---------49:43----------
misinterpreted


---------49:45----------
um but nevertheless um those are my


---------49:47----------
feelings and uh i must be true to myself


---------49:50----------
um


---------49:52----------
i know i'm not that attractive but i


---------49:54----------
want okay so i put myself at about a


---------49:56----------
three maybe but i'm looking for like an


---------49:58----------
eight


---------49:59----------
and so i have not and but i also don't


---------50:03----------
work out i also don't go anywhere to


---------50:05----------
where i can meet anybody


---------50:07----------
i also don't uh


---------50:10----------
i also don't actually talk to any women


---------50:12----------
other than when they engage the


---------50:14----------
conversation like in a professional


---------50:16----------
level or whatever the case may be or men


---------50:18----------
i'm it's not just women don't get me


---------50:20----------
wrong i i don't have any friends i i i'm


---------50:23----------
pretty much a hermit shut-in


---------50:25----------
i leave when i need to leave to go do


---------50:28----------
something i come back as soon as i can


---------50:31----------
and other than that i i'm content in my


---------50:34----------
house


---------50:35----------
um


---------50:36----------
uh probably a lot of social anxiety


---------50:40----------
i i'm not even gonna say that because


---------50:42----------
i'm not gonna self-diagnose i don't know


---------50:44----------
anything about it sure so


---------50:46----------
i would like to


---------50:48----------
i would like i would like to


---------50:50----------
like i said come to terms with that


---------50:52----------
aspect of myself or figure out a way to


---------50:54----------
overcome it


---------50:55----------
um i would like to know who i am as a


---------50:57----------
person


---------50:58----------
i know that's a lot to ask for but


---------51:01----------
um


---------51:02----------
what makes it a lot to ask for


---------51:05----------
i'll tell ya


---------51:06----------
the question i always dread in a rat in


---------51:08----------
an interview


---------51:09----------
tell me about yourself


---------51:11----------
i i don't know what's i don't have


---------51:13----------
anything i come up empty


---------51:15----------
i come up empty i have no likes i have


---------51:17----------
no dip i have not many dislikes i have a


---------51:20----------
couple's pretty specific ones but not


---------51:22----------
many dislikes


---------51:23----------
um


---------51:25----------
i'm pretty


---------51:27----------
indifferent about everything i'm just


---------51:29----------
like i can take it or leave it you want


---------51:31----------
to go here let's go i don't care i have


---------51:33----------
no opinion on the matter right


---------51:35----------
um


---------51:36----------
so i almost have no i'm all i feel like


---------51:39----------
i almost lack a personality in a way


---------51:42----------
because


---------51:43----------
if you were to ask me to list 10 things


---------51:45----------
i'm interested in


---------51:48----------
physical things not subjects that i can


---------51:51----------
learn about because i could list you 100


---------51:53----------
of those


---------51:54----------
why why


---------51:56----------
but why do you discount subjects from


---------51:58----------
like things that you're interested in


---------52:00----------
what i mean is okay so if you ask me 10


---------52:02----------
things i wanted to go out and do


---------52:05----------
actually do in the world


---------52:07----------
i would struggle with that


---------52:10----------
okay


---------52:12----------
i would struggle with that


---------52:14----------
in general yeah i just i don't know who


---------52:16----------
i am and i don't i don't know how to


---------52:18----------
start


---------52:19----------
learning what i like in the world and


---------52:21----------
what i don't like in the world because


---------52:22----------
16


---------52:23----------
36 i was incarcerated okay


---------52:26----------
those are the years where you go to


---------52:28----------
college those are the years where you're


---------52:30----------
in your 20s and you're out and whatever


---------52:32----------
people in their 20s do i've only seen


---------52:34----------
sitcoms about it so i don't know um jail


---------52:36----------
stunted him yes but form poker butt farm


---------52:39----------
poker that's exactly right um jail


---------52:41----------
stunted me um i missed out on a lot of


---------52:44----------
the the um the the the experiences that


---------52:49----------
people that people have and so


---------52:52----------
okay can you possibly know anything


---------52:54----------
about the world yes yes let me just let


---------52:56----------
me think okay


---------53:08----------
let me just compose my thoughts


---------53:11----------
so let's think about what are the issues


---------53:14----------
here because there's a lot


---------53:17----------
okay


---------53:41----------
thank you builder or


---------53:49----------
give me a second


---------53:50----------
yes please take all the time you need


---------54:02----------
so


---------54:21----------
i don't know where to put this okay


---------54:35----------
okay


---------54:44----------
uh


---------54:55----------
okay so let's i'm just gonna think out


---------54:56----------
loud all right so you let me know


---------54:59----------
so you've given me a lot of pieces


---------55:02----------
i'm gonna try to assemble them in some


---------55:03----------
way


---------55:07----------
feel free to jump in if you feel like


---------55:09----------
there's a piece that doesn't fit


---------55:11----------
properly


---------55:12----------
so the first thing is


---------55:14----------
you got born into [ __ ] life syndrome


---------55:17----------
okay that's gonna screw you in a lot of


---------55:19----------
ways so like let's think about the


---------55:20----------
impacts of like so we get conditioned


---------55:24----------
by our upbringing and we get all this


---------55:26----------
super basic conditioning like how to


---------55:28----------
relate to other people


---------55:31----------
um even like how to understand what we


---------55:34----------
feel


---------55:36----------
uh


---------55:38----------
even like discovering what we


---------55:41----------
discovering what we like


---------55:44----------
and who we are


---------55:47----------
so who we are comes from external


---------55:49----------
conditioning actually so like this is


---------55:51----------
something so let's just like take a step


---------55:52----------
back and understand what's going on okay


---------55:54----------
so when you're like a three-year-old kid


---------55:57----------
your brain is absorbing all kinds of


---------55:59----------
stuff it's like understanding like how


---------56:00----------
does gravity work like what's the


---------56:02----------
purpose of smiling


---------56:04----------
like who am i so identity in its most


---------56:07----------
original form is actually formed by the


---------56:10----------
reflections of people around us


---------56:13----------
so i don't know like if i'm a if i'm a


---------56:15----------
six month old like i don't know who i am


---------56:17----------
i don't know what i'm feeling all i know


---------56:19----------
is that something is unpleasant so it is


---------56:21----------
the way that people relate to me that


---------56:23----------
help me understand oh this


---------56:24----------
unpleasantness is something called


---------56:26----------
hunger and if i you know get some food


---------56:28----------
or drink some milk like then i will feel


---------56:30----------
better maybe this unpleasantness is like


---------56:33----------
i need a diaper change so like the way


---------56:35----------
that we make sense of the world and how


---------56:37----------
we understand the world works is all


---------56:40----------
like taught to us in our early


---------56:42----------
upbringing okay


---------56:44----------
so you're screwed there so far we'll get


---------56:47----------
to that okay you're not screwed forever


---------56:49----------
but i think you know in terms of how do


---------56:51----------
i form relationships how do i love


---------56:53----------
someone like i don't know that you know


---------56:55----------
how to love someone


---------56:57----------
um and we'll get to that in a second


---------57:00----------
expand before you move on yeah sure


---------57:03----------
so


---------57:04----------
i try to get love by buying people


---------57:06----------
things i try to keep friendships by


---------57:07----------
buying people things with money or


---------57:09----------
extravagant gestures and it never works


---------57:13----------
i found that all my friendships end the


---------57:15----------
first time i say no to some outrageous


---------57:17----------
favor that i don't want to do


---------57:20----------
they fall off the face of the earth and


---------57:22----------
so that's how i relate to love please


---------57:23----------
carry on yeah so that's case in point


---------57:26----------
right so like that's what i'm saying is


---------57:29----------
like i i don't think you were ever


---------57:31----------
taught like how to form a healthy


---------57:33----------
relationship


---------57:34----------
and so you're gonna enter into these


---------57:36----------
self-fulfilling prophecies of like enter


---------57:39----------
into a relationship and so cerebrally


---------57:41----------
like this is hard because essentially


---------57:43----------
what you're doing is your intellect


---------57:46----------
is like carrying you


---------57:49----------
upstream against like a tide of like


---------57:52----------
empathic blindness so you don't know


---------57:54----------
like normal humans and i don't mean to


---------57:56----------
be denigrating when i say that but i i


---------57:59----------
genuinely do think that you've like


---------58:01----------
missed some mate like regular


---------58:02----------
opportunities and when i when i said i


---------58:04----------
think it's important to acknowledge that


---------58:05----------
because a lot of us like take this for


---------58:07----------
granted right like i grew up with two


---------58:09----------
loving parents so like it wasn't hard


---------58:12----------
for me to learn how to love my kids


---------58:15----------
because i was taught like i know how to


---------58:18----------
interact with a two-year-old because


---------58:19----------
i've been on the receiving end of it


---------58:20----------
right i'm not trying to make a


---------58:22----------
comparison i'm just saying that i've


---------58:23----------
come to appreciate so many advantages


---------58:25----------
that i had that like other people don't


---------58:28----------
have and if we want to fix a problem we


---------58:30----------
have to start by understanding like


---------58:31----------
where it comes from


---------58:33----------
so i think you missed a lot of different


---------58:35----------
milestones so there's like concrete work


---------58:36----------
that you need to do about learning how


---------58:38----------
to behave in a relationship um you know


---------58:41----------
how to understand even what you feel


---------58:44----------
um


---------58:45----------
discovering like who you are so i want


---------58:47----------
you to imagine that you know when you've


---------58:48----------
got a six-year-old who goes to like


---------58:50----------
t-ball practice


---------58:52----------
and hits a home run


---------58:54----------
then like


---------58:55----------
the way that people respond to that


---------58:57----------
six-year-old helps that six-year-old


---------58:59----------
like understand who he is


---------59:01----------
right so like that six-year-old benz is


---------59:03----------
like oh i'm a champion cool


---------59:06----------
and then the six-year-old goes around


---------59:07----------
and tells people i'm a champion i'm a


---------59:09----------
champion i'm a champion and if he has


---------59:11----------
poor parents they will encourage him to


---------59:14----------
think that he is a champion and better


---------59:15----------
than all other human beings and he will


---------59:17----------
become a spoiled brat


---------59:19----------
if he has parents that are a little bit


---------59:20----------
better or other people like or other


---------59:23----------
kids who are like hey you're not a


---------59:24----------
champion i'm a champion


---------59:26----------
then you know like he'll learn over time


---------59:28----------
that okay i can be a champion but like


---------59:30----------
other people can be champions too


---------59:32----------
there's just so much like subconscious


---------59:34----------
programming that goes on with like


---------59:36----------
healthy human relationships and our


---------59:38----------
brain is sort of wired to like absorb


---------59:40----------
this stuff like a sponge and i think


---------59:42----------
that unfortunately like your brain


---------59:44----------
absorbed a lot of bad things or like


---------59:46----------
unfortunate lessons


---------59:48----------
right like like in terms of how you


---------59:50----------
establish relationships how you deal


---------59:53----------
with dissatisfaction within


---------59:54----------
relationships right so like it's yelling


---------59:57----------
at people blaming others i think that


---------59:59----------
you have some of that programming baked


---------60:01----------
in


---------60:02----------
but through


---------60:03----------
virtue of your cerebral nature and


---------60:06----------
self-reflection and like a lot of for


---------60:08----------
lack of a better term spiritual work i


---------60:10----------
think you've learned how to not be those


---------60:12----------
things but i would not be surprised if


---------60:15----------
under periods of stress some of those


---------60:16----------
behaviors activate


---------60:18----------
so you're not instantly instantly tell


---------60:21----------
me instantly go to anger when i like


---------60:23----------
under stress


---------60:24----------
i


---------60:25----------
either shut down yep


---------60:28----------
is the best i can describe it


---------60:31----------
almost like when it burst into tears as


---------60:33----------
weird as that sounds like a child


---------60:35----------
like just helplessly like ah or


---------60:38----------
anger


---------60:40----------
you know


---------60:44----------
i was backing out of a spot at


---------60:45----------
mcdonald's


---------60:47----------
and the car behind me honked


---------60:49----------
you know i stopped my car i put it in


---------60:51----------
the park i got out i went up to the car


---------60:53----------
and i started screaming at that car what


---------60:55----------
are you honking about and only when the


---------60:57----------
window rolled down and i realized it was


---------60:59----------
a woman with a little girl in there did


---------61:00----------
i say oh i apologize and i got back in


---------61:02----------
my car and i went about my business


---------61:04----------
and that's not me generally that very


---------61:06----------
much surprised me i have to be honest


---------61:08----------
and i didn't even feel like i was under


---------61:10----------
a particularly lot of stress


---------61:12----------
um


---------61:14----------
but


---------61:15----------
you know i also find myself binge eating


---------61:17----------
late at night


---------61:18----------
um i'm a chronic heavy drug user


---------61:22----------
right now of marijuana


---------61:25----------
from the time i wake up to the time i go


---------61:26----------
to sleep i'm high


---------61:29----------
um


---------61:31----------
and so i'm like am i binge eating or do


---------61:33----------
i have the munchies because because


---------61:35----------
what's funny is


---------61:37----------
maybe you can help me answer this


---------61:38----------
because i'll get up and i'll find myself


---------61:41----------
in the fridge binge eating and i look at


---------61:42----------
the clock and it's always about 1103


---------61:45----------
1104 at night like 11 o'clock comes and


---------61:48----------
all my restraints fall and if i'm still


---------61:50----------
watching youtube at that time i ain't


---------61:52----------
going to sleep till like three in the


---------61:53----------
morning it's not like is that a thing


---------61:55----------
where after a certain time you're a


---------61:57----------
straight out yes it's absolutely a thing


---------62:00----------
so if let's just talk about binge eating


---------62:02----------
for a second


---------62:03----------
so i'm the same way by the way


---------62:05----------
10 to 11 is my time too


---------62:07----------
and and so this is where if we


---------62:10----------
so


---------62:11----------
our brain


---------62:12----------
has impulses


---------62:14----------
and as our brain gets fatigued


---------62:16----------
especially our frontal lobes our ability


---------62:18----------
to restrain impulses goes down so if you


---------62:20----------
look at for example like i don't know


---------62:22----------
how to say this but


---------62:24----------
you know


---------62:25----------
it's easier to go to bed at 10 sometimes


---------62:28----------
than it is at like 12 or 1


---------62:31----------
because like at 10 even though you're


---------62:33----------
less tired you have enough like frontal


---------62:36----------
lobe function that you can restrain your


---------62:39----------
ability to stay up and then once you


---------62:41----------
cross into like midnight and then your


---------62:44----------
brain is fatigued you can't pull


---------62:46----------
yourself away from things as powerfully


---------62:48----------
right right


---------62:50----------
we absolutely see an increase in


---------62:51----------
impulsive behavior and binge eating


---------62:53----------
because your brain is just tired and you


---------62:55----------
can't control yourself anymore right


---------62:57----------
like you're fatigued


---------62:59----------
um


---------63:00----------
but yeah so like i said i think that you


---------63:02----------
know as you get under periods of stress


---------63:04----------
like that programming is kind of baked


---------63:06----------
in it's very like subconscious in terms


---------63:08----------
of how your neurons have been wired and


---------63:10----------
like you know when i feel mad when i


---------63:13----------
feel frustrated or when i feel


---------63:15----------
frightened because i can imagine that


---------63:17----------
actually your physiologic response is


---------63:19----------
one of a startling in fear


---------63:21----------
and then adrenaline pops through your


---------63:23----------
system and then like your brain is like


---------63:26----------
kind of goes into fight or flight mode


---------63:29----------
and since you spent 20 years in prison


---------63:31----------
where


---------63:32----------
flight is an option


---------63:35----------
you've adapted to fight with when you


---------63:37----------
have an adrenaline response right so now


---------63:40----------
i'm kind of getting ahead of myself


---------63:41----------
because i want to start with like let's


---------63:43----------
start with let's say


---------63:45----------
[ __ ] life syndrome which you're going to


---------63:47----------
have a lot of it's an uphill battle bro


---------63:49----------
i'm sorry to say like it's just an


---------63:50----------
uphill battle that's just the truth of


---------63:52----------
it


---------63:53----------
the second thing is that i think that


---------63:55----------
what's happened is you've adapted to


---------63:57----------
your circumstances so you've learned how


---------63:58----------
to survive


---------64:00----------
right and like learning how to survive


---------64:02----------
involves a second layer of programming


---------64:06----------
which is you know how do i deal with


---------64:08----------
conflict well like you know you shift


---------64:09----------
someone because like that's what you got


---------64:11----------
to do in prison


---------64:12----------
and and so you know in that moment like


---------64:14----------
this is like it's not in a sense it's


---------64:16----------
kind of not your fault because your


---------64:18----------
brain has been wired a particular way i


---------64:20----------
still think you're responsible but you


---------64:22----------
know if you think about the instinctual


---------64:24----------
reaction of like fight or flight and how


---------64:26----------
you respond to that if we think about


---------64:28----------
you know like a veteran who was in a war


---------64:30----------
who's got ptsd and then a door slams and


---------64:33----------
they like they think they're under


---------64:34----------
attack our brain is wired and responds a


---------64:36----------
particular way


---------64:38----------
so i think half of what we're dealing


---------64:39----------
with the shitlife syndrome half of what


---------64:41----------
we're dealing with is the adaptations to


---------64:43----------
shitlife syndrome and this is where i


---------64:45----------
think actually there's a lot of stuff


---------64:47----------
that you can work on


---------64:49----------
so um you know you i think that in some


---------64:52----------
ways uh


---------64:54----------
anthony you're very cerebral but i also


---------64:57----------
think it sounds like you're incredibly


---------64:58----------
rigid you don't sound open-minded to me


---------65:01----------
so i think that this is where


---------65:04----------
so like like i think in some directions


---------65:07----------
you're willing to learn but once your


---------65:08----------
mind gets made up so like when you talk


---------65:10----------
about anti-semitism for example when you


---------65:13----------
talk about other things or like when you


---------65:14----------
talk about the bridge trolls you know so


---------65:16----------
so it's interesting because you're


---------65:18----------
open-minded like except for some issues


---------65:21----------
in which case i'm a three and i deserve


---------65:23----------
an eight and like there's a lot there


---------65:26----------
you know i i wasn't responding with no


---------65:28----------
deserve hope to get but no you're


---------65:31----------
absolutely right about the rigidity


---------65:32----------
thank you and your and


---------65:34----------
the way you put it was perfect once my


---------65:35----------
mind is made up because i don't make up


---------65:38----------
my mind easily in fact that's something


---------65:40----------
i have a very hard time doing but once i


---------65:42----------
make up my mind it is made up


---------65:44----------
so so then i think the the challenge


---------65:47----------
there is that i want you to think for a


---------65:49----------
second take a step back


---------65:51----------
and imagine all of the conclusions that


---------65:54----------
you have been forced to accept over the


---------65:57----------
last let's say 30 years


---------66:00----------
right and so what's happening is you've


---------66:02----------
got a lot of conclusions which have been


---------66:04----------
made up for a good reason but like


---------66:06----------
they're


---------66:07----------
they're adaptations to situations which


---------66:09----------
you don't exist in anymore


---------66:11----------
right so like the way that you relate


---------66:13----------
like the way that you love someone


---------66:15----------
is like confusing because you clearly


---------66:18----------
love your mom she taught you what love


---------66:20----------
is and she was incredibly abusive


---------66:22----------
so you know i imagine that it's gonna


---------66:24----------
feel very strange for you if you ever go


---------66:27----------
on a date and like someone expresses


---------66:29----------
compassion and so then what you end up


---------66:31----------
doing is like


---------66:32----------
you know you play the game the way that


---------66:34----------
your intellect has told you it's to be


---------66:36----------
played which is like okay how do i get


---------66:39----------
someone to like me i like do things for


---------66:41----------
them that's what happens in a


---------66:42----------
relationship but then you sort of enter


---------66:44----------
into the self-fulfilling prophecy which


---------66:46----------
is kind of like bullying where there's


---------66:48----------
something and i hate to break this to


---------66:49----------
you but i think you are the common


---------66:50----------
denominator that's a interesting


---------66:53----------
thing


---------66:54----------
okay so let's just talk about this for a


---------66:56----------
second because when a lot of times


---------66:58----------
people's shame and sense of failure


---------67:01----------
kind of piles onto this idea of being a


---------67:04----------
common denominator


---------67:06----------
but i think there's a really tricky


---------67:07----------
thing to understand is that if you are


---------67:09----------
the common denominator the power to


---------67:10----------
change is also in your hands


---------67:13----------
right that's interesting yeah it's true


---------67:15----------
so like if you kind of think about it


---------67:17----------
let's just be honest because your


---------67:18----------
intellectual mind is saying hey i'm the


---------67:19----------
common denominator like it's something


---------67:21----------
to do with me and that's where you have


---------67:23----------
to be kind of careful because if you've


---------67:24----------
grown up with bullying


---------67:26----------
what your mind automatically does is oh


---------67:28----------
it's like my fault and there's something


---------67:30----------
fundamentally wrong with me but chances


---------67:32----------
are it's some kind of behavior


---------67:34----------
right like so as you kind of noted that


---------67:36----------
kids can get a lot of social status by


---------67:38----------
standing up to you


---------67:40----------
and so early on you know you didn't


---------67:42----------
respond to kids in a particular way


---------67:43----------
which like sort of sets you out as a


---------67:45----------
target and then when you go to prison


---------67:47----------
you realize oh like i can't be a target


---------67:49----------
anymore and then you kind of swung the


---------67:51----------
pendulum the other way and then you're


---------67:52----------
yelling at you know mom's in the


---------67:54----------
mcdonald's parking lot because like


---------67:56----------
damned if because you had to learn that


---------67:58----------
it was like survival it was adaptation


---------68:00----------
right and that's gonna echo


---------68:03----------
and so probably what you're dealing with


---------68:05----------
is some combination of the two where at


---------68:07----------
times you feel like


---------68:08----------
you know the other shoe is gonna drop


---------68:11----------
and like no one is gonna care about you


---------68:13----------
and you're gonna wind up getting bullied


---------68:14----------
and like if people express compassion


---------68:17----------
you know like you don't know how to


---------68:18----------
handle it


---------68:19----------
um and then on the flip side maybe you


---------68:22----------
go into survival mode but it's like


---------68:23----------
really hard to be like kind of tranquil


---------68:25----------
and in the middle


---------68:26----------
because i think the really interesting


---------68:27----------
thing is like you know how do you think


---------68:30----------
you are coming across in this interview


---------68:37----------
i don't know i to be honest with you i'm


---------68:39----------
trying to drop all my guards and just be


---------68:41----------
as honest as i can so i'm not really


---------68:43----------
even trying to focus on that i


---------68:45----------
understand that so how does that feel


---------68:51----------
fine because you're a complete and total


---------68:52----------
stranger and i'll never see you


---------68:55----------
nor will i ever see anybody in chat


---------68:57----------
would i share any of these things with


---------68:58----------
somebody i would ever see again i i


---------69:00----------
think no i would have a really hard time


---------69:02----------
on i'm so i'm burdening myself like that


---------69:05----------
so let's play this tape through to the


---------69:07----------
end


---------69:08----------
if we were gonna see you what so like


---------69:10----------
you're like you're saying that there's


---------69:12----------
no consequence because we're never gonna


---------69:13----------
see you again right


---------69:15----------
right let's pretend that


---------69:18----------
where i'm gonna see like we're gonna see


---------69:20----------
each other


---------69:21----------
we're gonna like hang out once a week


---------69:23----------
for the next four weeks


---------69:24----------
what would you be afraid of me believing


---------69:27----------
about you after this conversation like


---------69:29----------
what do you think you're how do you


---------69:31----------
think you're coming across


---------69:41----------
smart maybe i i i'm at a loss i just i


---------69:44----------
don't understand how other people know


---------69:46----------
things like that i don't know the answer


---------69:48----------
to your question i'm sorry yeah so that


---------69:50----------
that's totally fine you don't need to so


---------69:52----------
i think that's kind of telling because


---------69:54----------
i want you to just point i want to point


---------69:56----------
out to you that you're afraid of being


---------69:58----------
judged right that's why you would you're


---------70:00----------
like you're afraid of being judged but


---------70:02----------
as we tunnel down into what is the


---------70:04----------
judgment that you're afraid of you come


---------70:06----------
up empty


---------70:07----------
so this general all right


---------70:09----------
so this is really important anthony so


---------70:11----------
what that means


---------70:13----------
is that


---------70:14----------
the fear that you have is like an echo


---------70:17----------
from a primitive state of your brain


---------70:20----------
so like there's like there's no


---------70:23----------
there's no like nuance or specificity to


---------70:26----------
it it's just like i can't tell people


---------70:29----------
how i feel otherwise bad [ __ ] happens


---------70:32----------
you know like the one time you're


---------70:34----------
authentic with your mom and you're like


---------70:35----------
wow it sounds like you have trouble


---------70:36----------
relating to people at work it's just


---------70:38----------
like a simple observation that's


---------70:40----------
completely authentic and boom


---------70:42----------
you're screwed so i think almost like a


---------70:45----------
ptsd kind of thing where you're you've


---------70:47----------
learned that like being authentic with


---------70:49----------
people is tough but let's be straight


---------70:51----------
bro like you call in women bridge trolls


---------70:53----------
you're voicing being anti-semitic


---------70:56----------
you know you're telling people that you


---------70:58----------
killed someone


---------70:59----------
and


---------71:01----------
are i think generally speaking people


---------71:03----------
like you


---------71:04----------
like i think i don't think that like


---------71:06----------
chat i don't know i'm not looking at


---------71:08----------
chat and i encourage you not to but i


---------71:09----------
think that like you know people can


---------71:11----------
respect you


---------71:12----------
despite these things that are negative


---------71:14----------
and i think part of that comes from like


---------71:16----------
owning the things that are negative in


---------71:17----------
your life right


---------71:19----------
and so i think there's a really tricky


---------71:20----------
thing and this is kind of how i would


---------71:22----------
recommend you move forward is that you


---------71:23----------
keep on putting on a mask whereas like


---------71:26----------
if you really want to form a connection


---------71:27----------
with someone you have to like let people


---------71:29----------
in on the inside


---------71:31----------
and then it's terrifying because then we


---------71:33----------
may think you're a racist [ __ ] which


---------71:35----------
you could be


---------71:37----------
but just because you're


---------71:38----------
yeah but i'm also a good person i feel


---------71:40----------
like there's a dichotomy yeah i i i


---------71:43----------
agree right so i think that people can


---------71:45----------
be you know you can the people are not


---------71:47----------
like black or white


---------71:49----------
and so i you know i would and we'll get


---------71:51----------
to the rigid thinking and stuff later


---------71:53----------
but so i i think it's kind of


---------71:55----------
interesting because what you're afraid


---------71:56----------
of is like you're literally like having


---------71:58----------
a conversation with thousands of people


---------71:59----------
on the internet and and you're like


---------72:01----------
being relatively authentic i don't get


---------72:02----------
the sense that you're bsing us


---------72:05----------
um


---------72:06----------
and


---------72:07----------
you're afraid of some consequence which


---------72:08----------
makes perfect sense


---------72:10----------
but at the same time like the more that


---------72:12----------
you tunnel down into like oh what are


---------72:14----------
they gonna think and you're like i don't


---------72:16----------
really know


---------72:17----------
so then it's like a very primitive fear


---------72:19----------
that doesn't actually have like legs to


---------72:20----------
stand on does that make sense


---------72:22----------
well it's rejection i know what i'm


---------72:24----------
afraid of it's rejection because it's


---------72:26----------
consistent


---------72:27----------
i've never successfully asked a woman or


---------72:29----------
a girl out through school or is it i've


---------72:31----------
never successfully managed that the one


---------72:34----------
time i had sex


---------72:36----------
i was in my brother's town and she was


---------72:38----------
just


---------72:39----------
the very friendly girl in town who was


---------72:42----------
pretty much the man maker um if you went


---------72:45----------
to her house you're pretty set so that's


---------72:47----------
how that went down


---------72:49----------
and


---------72:50----------
it was awkward and uncomfortable and


---------72:52----------
and embarrassing and i did not enjoy it


---------72:54----------
i got zero enjoyment out of it zero


---------72:57----------
um


---------72:59----------
so


---------73:00----------
yeah so


---------73:03----------
so here's what i'm getting the sense of


---------73:05----------
like honestly anthony what i feel more


---------73:07----------
than anything else talking to you is


---------73:09----------
that you're dormant


---------73:11----------
like i get the sense that there's


---------73:13----------
there's a whole


---------73:14----------
life and person


---------73:17----------
and like positivity that's just been


---------73:19----------
like slumbering and you just haven't had


---------73:21----------
the chance


---------73:23----------
to like wake up and really like


---------73:26----------
be for lack of a better term


---------73:28----------
and so i think you know when you were


---------73:30----------
talking about like motivation and


---------73:31----------
feeling lazy like i wasn't worried at


---------73:33----------
all i think your


---------73:35----------
the problem is that there's just nothing


---------73:36----------
to motivate you like


---------73:38----------
so i'm pretty sure that when a challenge


---------73:40----------
kicks in you'll be fine like i think


---------73:42----------
that you're gonna do great it's gonna be


---------73:44----------
a bumpy ride so when the challenge kicks


---------73:46----------
in you're gonna find out that your


---------73:47----------
habits are lacking but i think generally


---------73:48----------
speaking


---------73:49----------
my recommendation to you if you're lazy


---------73:52----------
is like do more not less like don't if


---------73:54----------
you don't feel motivated don't go


---------73:56----------
hunting for artificial motivation i know


---------73:58----------
it sounds kind of weird don't just like


---------73:59----------
wake up every day and be like oh my god


---------74:01----------
like i need to do the dishes because


---------74:02----------
like that's motivation i'm gonna find my


---------74:04----------
internal self i'd say


---------74:06----------
you've missed out on life you've missed


---------74:08----------
out on 41 years of life basically


---------74:11----------
so what i'd say first and foremost is


---------74:13----------
like start living right like that's your


---------74:16----------
job forget about purpose forget about


---------74:17----------
making the world a better place you've


---------74:19----------
missed out


---------74:20----------
so missed out on all kinds of things


---------74:22----------
being challenged failing even then i


---------74:25----------
know you say you've gotten rejected a


---------74:26----------
lot but i don't think that you've ever


---------74:27----------
gotten rejected maybe you have but i


---------74:30----------
feel like every failure you've had has


---------74:32----------
been part of a rigged game


---------74:34----------
i don't know that you've ever been on


---------74:36----------
your a game and really been the best


---------74:39----------
human you can possibly be


---------74:40----------
when you ask out a girl i don't know


---------74:43----------
that you've had a career and like you


---------74:45----------
know been in shape and and like you know


---------74:47----------
done some emotional work and like worked


---------74:49----------
with a therapist like i don't think that


---------74:50----------
you've you know you've never played a


---------74:52----------
fair [ __ ] game so you got to be super


---------74:55----------
careful about the identity of i am a


---------74:57----------
failure when you've never played a fair


---------74:59----------
game


---------75:01----------
and something tells me so i'd say that


---------75:02----------
you know programming is going to get


---------75:04----------
harder you can slide through with 4.0


---------75:06----------
for now but i'd say let it get harder


---------75:09----------
and then rise to the challenge


---------75:11----------
and then keep climbing and eventually


---------75:13----------
you'll equilibrate and i think that'll


---------75:15----------
be like fulfilling for you even if you


---------75:17----------
don't love programming at least you're


---------75:18----------
not going to be [ __ ] bored


---------75:20----------
right because your enemy right now is


---------75:22----------
like idleness and


---------75:24----------
you're slumbering like i feel like i'm


---------75:26----------
talking to a slumbering giant and i


---------75:29----------
don't know if you're gonna turn into a


---------75:31----------
programmer i don't know if you're gonna


---------75:32----------
do like


---------75:33----------
analytics for like cambridge analytica


---------75:36----------
and and you know help promote


---------75:38----------
anti-semitism around the world or like


---------75:40----------
whatever you end up doing you know but i


---------75:42----------
think something challenging is gonna it


---------75:45----------
is


---------75:46----------
is gonna engage you right and it's gonna


---------75:49----------
demand of you like what you look at that


---------75:52----------
now this is a facial expression we


---------75:53----------
haven't seen at all


---------75:54----------
what is it what are you smile


---------75:56----------
no you've smiled here


---------75:58----------
this is different you made a really good


---------76:00----------
joke and then i was thinking that would


---------76:02----------
be great if i could put that into action


---------76:04----------
but unfortunately i don't feel like my


---------76:06----------
anti-semitic semitism is an exportable


---------76:09----------
exportable good


---------76:11----------
i'm pretty sure that some people would


---------76:12----------
disagree with you but i think what i saw


---------76:14----------
for the first time anthony was


---------76:16----------
excitement


---------76:17----------
we've seen you smile we've seen you


---------76:19----------
laugh i don't think i've ever seen


---------76:21----------
excitement even now you're kind of


---------76:22----------
lagging so it was frozen and kind of an


---------76:24----------
excited


---------76:25----------
frame but


---------76:26----------
i i think i got a touch i wasn't sure


---------76:29----------
but you know i think that there's


---------76:31----------
there's something when i when i speak


---------76:32----------
about this stuff i get that there's like


---------76:34----------
actually like a very very there are a


---------76:35----------
couple embers


---------76:37----------
buried in the coals


---------76:39----------
you know like there's a bunch of ash and


---------76:40----------
there's something down there that i


---------76:42----------
think just needs to wake up


---------76:45----------
so practically i'd say keep studying cs


---------76:47----------
by all means


---------76:49----------
um you know you'll rise up i think also


---------76:50----------
in terms of like sexuality i think


---------76:52----------
there's been a lot of dormancy


---------76:54----------
right when i kind of think about it it's


---------76:56----------
sort of like you're rusty


---------76:58----------
you know so so it and not rusty isn't


---------77:01----------
just in terms of a physical sense like a


---------77:04----------
lot of sexuality has to do with like


---------77:05----------
emotional intimacy and things like that


---------77:07----------
which i think that you're rusty on or


---------77:09----------
never really learned how to do


---------77:11----------
um i do think there are a couple of


---------77:13----------
really high points i know this sounds


---------77:15----------
kind of weird especially if we're


---------77:16----------
talking about sexuality but really not


---------77:18----------
related but i think your hitchhiking


---------77:20----------
experience really gives me hope


---------77:22----------
because what i'm what i'm really hearing


---------77:24----------
from that experience is that you met


---------77:26----------
like random people


---------77:28----------
and you were able to connect with them


---------77:30----------
in like an authentic and and like


---------77:32----------
meaningful way


---------77:34----------
right and like even when you talk about


---------77:35----------
it like it's some of the best years of


---------77:37----------
your life and like why was that


---------77:39----------
it's because you don't have to worry


---------77:41----------
about what people thought right like you


---------77:43----------
were just you


---------77:44----------
and like you were didn't have a house


---------77:46----------
didn't have a job like you were in


---------77:48----------
nothing


---------77:49----------
you didn't have to give anyone any gifts


---------77:51----------
and what did they do for you anthony


---------77:55----------
it helped me


---------77:56----------
absolutely and so just think about that


---------77:58----------
for a second that like when you are who


---------78:01----------
you are and you have nothing to give and


---------78:03----------
they don't owe you anything


---------78:06----------
that they see something within you that


---------78:08----------
is worth helping


---------78:10----------
and i see it too i'm pretty sure all of


---------78:11----------
chat sees it too is that you are


---------78:13----------
absolutely someone who is scary and also


---------78:16----------
worth helping


---------78:18----------
you know you're you have a certain like


---------78:20----------
cranky bareness to you


---------78:23----------
and i guess that a lot that am i upset


---------78:25----------
but i think i just have resting [ __ ]


---------78:27----------
face because


---------78:28----------
right now i feel completely new this is


---------78:30----------
a neutral face yeah you certainly but


---------78:33----------
that too is also like adaptive


---------78:35----------
right


---------78:36----------
where like you want to have neutral


---------78:38----------
affect so people who grow up in abusive


---------78:41----------
households learn how to become invisible


---------78:44----------
like because being noticed in some way


---------78:46----------
is like you know


---------78:48----------
i can imagine in prison resting [ __ ]


---------78:51----------
face helps you


---------78:52----------
like it's actually quite adaptive and so


---------78:55----------
i think the biggest


---------78:56----------
problem anthony that i think you you


---------78:58----------
have to face and this is going to be


---------78:59----------
hard


---------79:00----------
is there's a life like there's


---------79:02----------
absolutely life i'm not worried about


---------79:04----------
that at all i think the problem is that


---------79:06----------
discovering that life requires you to


---------79:09----------
undo all of the things that how can i


---------79:12----------
say this when you go to prison at the


---------79:15----------
age of 16 and that feels like 20 life


---------79:18----------
sentences


---------79:19----------
the only way you can survive that is to


---------79:22----------
numb yourself to the prospect of life


---------79:25----------
i don't need life anymore right that's


---------79:27----------
the only way you survive your 18th


---------79:30----------
birthday in prison 21st birthday in


---------79:32----------
prison 30th birthday in prison 35th


---------79:35----------
birthday in prison


---------79:37----------
the only way you survive that is by


---------79:39----------
giving up on life entirely and saying


---------79:41----------
like


---------79:42----------
i have to exactly what i did yes


---------79:45----------
any kind of joy


---------79:48----------
goal


---------79:53----------
not just dead you had to kill it bro


---------79:56----------
right when a tiny bit of hope on your


---------79:58----------
21st birthday


---------80:01----------
you don't dare hope hope hope keeps


---------80:03----------
wanting to sprout up in your garden like


---------80:06----------
a weed and there you are every day


---------80:08----------
plucking it out


---------80:11----------
and then you


---------80:12----------
you wind up and you're asking like i


---------80:13----------
don't know what to get out of life and


---------80:15----------
like that's right bro because you spent


---------80:18----------
20 years doing your level best to get


---------80:20----------
nothing out of life


---------80:24----------
right so i i don't think i know it


---------80:27----------
sounds kind of weird but i don't think


---------80:28----------
you need to actually discover


---------80:31----------
what you want from life i don't think


---------80:33----------
it's this deep


---------80:34----------
personal journey


---------80:36----------
that you have to like go and spend time


---------80:38----------
in the himalayas and things like that to


---------80:40----------
like discover what you want life i think


---------80:42----------
all you've got to do is stop pulling out


---------80:44----------
the weeds


---------80:45----------
and you've gotten so good at pulling out


---------80:47----------
the weeds that


---------80:48----------
you know it'll it'll come up and this is


---------80:50----------
where you know i think there are a lot


---------80:51----------
of things that you're doing that are


---------80:52----------
quite amazing like 4.0 gpa in computer


---------80:54----------
programming is not easy i imagine for a


---------80:56----------
41 year old dude to do


---------80:58----------
right like so you've got you've


---------81:00----------
definitely got like things in your


---------81:01----------
corner that are working for you


---------81:04----------
and so oddly enough i think your road


---------81:05----------
forward is not about like


---------81:07----------
doing more it's actually about stopping


---------81:10----------
to do what you have learned how to do


---------81:16----------
um


---------81:17----------
is that can i keep going


---------81:19----------
yes please do okay


---------81:22----------
so


---------81:22----------
a couple of things to think about


---------81:24----------
practically so i think you've got to


---------81:26----------
think long and hard i'm gonna zero in on


---------81:28----------
the bridge troll for a second okay


---------81:30----------
you've gotta think long and hard about


---------81:32----------
some of these things that you accept for


---------81:34----------
yourself which i think you really need


---------81:35----------
to reconsider


---------81:37----------
so the first is like in your mind you're


---------81:39----------
a three i don't think you're three maybe


---------81:41----------
you are i don't know i'd like i'd like


---------81:43----------
stick you to five okay


---------81:45----------
and that you want an eight and that's


---------81:47----------
fine but i think that when you really


---------81:48----------
think about what's important to you in a


---------81:50----------
relationship you don't sound like you're


---------81:52----------
horny all the time


---------81:53----------
you know you don't sound like like


---------81:56----------
you're i mean it sounds like you want


---------81:58----------
someone


---------82:00----------
who you know if i could find someone for


---------82:02----------
you it's not so much about the physical


---------82:03----------
attractiveness as it is about


---------82:06----------
someone who can kind of like just listen


---------82:08----------
to you talk about stuff right like you


---------82:10----------
just need well because i like a


---------82:12----------
conversation i like i like a smart


---------82:14----------
person who can give back as good as they


---------82:16----------
receive i like a conversationalist


---------82:18----------
sure so if that's what you like and i


---------82:20----------
suspect that that's actually i know you


---------82:22----------
like it but i don't know if that's what


---------82:23----------
you need


---------82:24----------
i i think what you need is probably like


---------82:26----------
a good woman who makes you think sh


---------82:28----------
you're having a conversation but is


---------82:30----------
actually just letting you talk


---------82:32----------
and i say this as someone who's being


---------82:34----------
married to what i i know what it's like


---------82:35----------
to be someone who likes to talk and


---------82:37----------
likes to think that they have a


---------82:38----------
conversation but really what we like to


---------82:40----------
do people like us anthony we just like


---------82:42----------
to talk


---------82:44----------
right talking is great yes


---------82:47----------
and and we like to think we're having a


---------82:49----------
conversation but if someone's you know


---------82:52----------
letting us speak our peace


---------82:55----------
about how the jews are ruining


---------82:56----------
everything like you're going to love


---------82:57----------
that that's what you're that's what


---------82:58----------
you're going to want


---------83:00----------
yes i go on those tangents sometimes i


---------83:02----------
do go on those tangents um


---------83:05----------
you know i i


---------83:08----------
so it's like a cerebral maybe you can


---------83:10----------
help me with this because it's like a


---------83:12----------
cerebral wanting a family it's like a


---------83:14----------
cerebral wanting a wife


---------83:16----------
but really it's i want to impress other


---------83:18----------
people and i think everything i do is is


---------83:20----------
in an attempt to impress and i was


---------83:22----------
actually this was just something that


---------83:23----------
came to me the last two three days i was


---------83:24----------
thinking


---------83:25----------
you know when i was a kid i was a i was


---------83:28----------
a compulsive liar like


---------83:31----------
outrageous lies not that i invented the


---------83:34----------
question mark but uh


---------83:36----------
i i remember when i was a kid i said i


---------83:38----------
i was probably 11. i said i do like 120


---------83:40----------
mile an hour fastball and of course


---------83:42----------
everybody said i was full of [ __ ]


---------83:44----------
because i knew nothing about


---------83:46----------
baseball whatsoever and i was just


---------83:48----------
trying to impress people and it feels


---------83:50----------
like


---------83:51----------
every decision i make


---------83:53----------
i wanted the car what will other what


---------83:55----------
will what will other people think about


---------83:56----------
will other people be impressed by will


---------83:58----------
it make other people


---------83:59----------
yeah i i


---------84:01----------
yeah i feel like i i feel like i try to


---------84:04----------
impress people


---------84:06----------
or the other way i say things that are


---------84:08----------
shocking yep


---------84:11----------
right


---------84:12----------
is it just attention-seeking behavior or


---------84:14----------
don't no what it is


---------84:16----------
it's it's [ __ ] distraction from what


---------84:18----------
you really are


---------84:21----------
right so you want to go you want to show


---------84:23----------
people the best parts of you or the


---------84:25----------
worst parts of you as long as they don't


---------84:26----------
see you


---------84:28----------
oh


---------84:29----------
that is interesting


---------84:32----------
well i but i feel like i have nothing to


---------84:34----------
offer yep that's why you don't want to


---------84:36----------
see it have no opinions like i said i


---------84:38----------
have no opinion no of course you haven't


---------84:40----------
got a doctor that's not true that's not


---------84:42----------
true i have no like but hold on a second


---------84:45----------
wrong preferences and hold on hold on


---------84:47----------
but there's another problem that you're


---------84:48----------
doing which is you're setting up a


---------84:50----------
rigged game for yourself


---------84:52----------
when you say like so earlier we had this


---------84:54----------
conversation about like i'm not


---------84:55----------
interested in anything


---------84:57----------
and then you like you walked yourself


---------84:58----------
back and you're like no i'm interested


---------85:00----------
in hundreds of things if you asked me


---------85:02----------
about an activity i wouldn't be able to


---------85:04----------
come up with a single one


---------85:05----------
so it's like here's here's the test


---------85:08----------
you're able to pass this test and so


---------85:10----------
some part of your mind is like [ __ ] that


---------85:11----------
we don't want to pass the test let's


---------85:12----------
pick the one that we're going to fail


---------85:16----------
right whereas like who you you may just


---------85:18----------
not be like a doer you're like a thinker


---------85:20----------
you're like a philosopher


---------85:22----------
you're like one of these guys that like


---------85:23----------
thinks deeply okay


---------85:25----------
yeah of course it's okay


---------85:28----------
how do you live like that


---------85:30----------
you hang out with other people who can


---------85:32----------
have conversations with you how do you


---------85:34----------
how do you feed yourself like that


---------85:37----------
how do you physically make money how do


---------85:39----------
you make money like that by being a


---------85:41----------
thinker


---------85:42----------
yeah


---------85:43----------
so it's paying people to think


---------85:45----------
i mean so any author who writes a book


---------85:48----------
is someone that people


---------85:50----------
okay okay okay fair enough right i got


---------85:52----------
it yeah any any video essayist


---------85:55----------
are you you're a thinker yeah you're


---------85:56----------
absolutely right yeah it's like you have


---------85:58----------
to i have to be a little more


---------85:59----------
imaginative with the medium yeah you're


---------86:01----------
absolutely right so i'm not saying you


---------86:03----------
should steer away from computer


---------86:04----------
programming i think it's a really good


---------86:06----------
so i'm on that


---------86:08----------
but i think long term and this is also


---------86:10----------
where like who you are and how you get


---------86:12----------
paid ideally we'll we'll get together


---------86:15----------
but honestly bro from like how far


---------86:17----------
behind you are i wouldn't shoot for that


---------86:19----------
yet


---------86:20----------
okay you know i think there's lower


---------86:21----------
hanging fruit i'm not going to tell you


---------86:23----------
maybe it's a mean thing to say but i


---------86:25----------
wouldn't shoot for you know you've just


---------86:27----------
got so many like people who can afford


---------86:29----------
to be thinkers


---------86:31----------
oh yeah


---------86:33----------
sometimes don't have


---------86:35----------
they have some advantages that you're


---------86:36----------
playing with a handicap so i i'd like


---------86:38----------
shoot and you by all means like we


---------86:40----------
should cry over that if anything right


---------86:42----------
that life is so [ __ ] unfair to you


---------86:44----------
that other people have opportunities


---------86:46----------
that you may not have but on the flip


---------86:47----------
side i could absolutely totally see


---------86:50----------
a really interesting kind of angle of


---------86:52----------
hey i killed someone for 20 you know i


---------86:54----------
spent 20 years in prison here's how i


---------86:56----------
made sense of my life like you could


---------86:58----------
wind up on [ __ ] oprah and and you


---------87:00----------
know lifetime and like you could like


---------87:03----------
put your like you could go down that


---------87:05----------
route like a lot of people are looking


---------87:06----------
for guidance and if you're able to find


---------87:08----------
it you may be able to help other people


---------87:10----------
as well like i don't know


---------87:12----------
right when i say asperger's does that do


---------87:15----------
anything for you


---------87:18----------
because i read the descriptions of all


---------87:19----------
these various ailments and they all seem


---------87:22----------
to match me perfectly so that


---------87:24----------
yeah so here's here's here's what i'll


---------87:26----------
say about asperger's okay so if you want


---------87:29----------
that's where you should really get a


---------87:30----------
full mental health evaluation but


---------87:32----------
what i will say is that


---------87:34----------
if you look at the symptoms of


---------87:36----------
asperger's


---------87:37----------
there are many things that can


---------87:39----------
contribute to those kinds of symptoms


---------87:40----------
like i've already explained to you you


---------87:42----------
know a lot of hypotheses besides


---------87:44----------
asperger's or autism spectrum that can


---------87:47----------
contribute to your cognitive and


---------87:49----------
empathic and friendship difficulties


---------87:51----------
certainly so the symptoms of asperger's


---------87:54----------
or autism spectrum have multiple causes


---------87:58----------
so sometimes it's autism spectrum but


---------87:59----------
frankly we see this in the gaming


---------88:01----------
population as a whole


---------88:03----------
i was talking to literally like my


---------88:05----------
pediatrician the pediatrician of my kids


---------88:07----------
and she was saying that as technology


---------88:09----------
usage has increased


---------88:11----------
she is getting like more asperger's like


---------88:15----------
presentations from children but she


---------88:18----------
doesn't think that all these kids are on


---------88:19----------
the spectrum she thinks it has something


---------88:20----------
to do with the way that they interact


---------88:22----------
with technology and how it shapes their


---------88:24----------
brains in terms of like social


---------88:25----------
interactions


---------88:27----------
so that science is really interesting


---------88:29----------
i'd say that you know we'll get to


---------88:30----------
concrete recommendations about mental


---------88:31----------
health treatment a second but


---------88:33----------
um going back to like impressive


---------88:36----------
yeah please and at the murder thing i


---------88:38----------
don't want to make light of it somebody


---------88:39----------
lost their life and i see people joking


---------88:41----------
and chat about i'm going to make a


---------88:42----------
youtube channel real life murder now


---------88:44----------
that somebody lost their life and i was


---------88:45----------
messed up that i did that that's not


---------88:47----------
something i even like to talk about


---------88:49----------
much less use as a as a form of


---------88:52----------
advertisement or i caused that family a


---------88:55----------
lot of pain and that's really messed up


---------88:56----------
that i did that


---------88:58----------
sure sure so i i completely agree with


---------89:01----------
that but i i think it's important to


---------89:03----------
also acknowledge that that's the way the


---------89:05----------
internet is


---------89:06----------
right that we live in a world where if


---------89:08----------
you did something like that


---------89:10----------
there are going to be people who due to


---------89:12----------
shot and freud or voyeurism or like


---------89:15----------
because they're all looking for


---------89:16----------
something like you know they're just


---------89:18----------
like you said they're like addicted to


---------89:19----------
youtube and they're looking for


---------89:21----------
something that's gonna like excite them


---------89:22----------
and make them feel something so i know


---------89:24----------
it sounds kind of weird but i think that


---------89:26----------
your karma


---------89:27----------
your karma has set you up in a very


---------89:29----------
unique way that i think could be an


---------89:32----------
advantage i know it sounds kind of weird


---------89:33----------
i think it's hard to make that case and


---------89:35----------
i mean overall that disadvantage


---------89:37----------
absolutely but it still makes you the


---------89:39----------
person that you are and i think the


---------89:41----------
person that you are


---------89:42----------
i mean you have such a unique


---------89:44----------
perspective on life


---------89:45----------
that could be very educational to people


---------89:48----------
like i've learned a lot you know and i


---------89:50----------
do this this is my job and i've still


---------89:52----------
learned a lot i've worked in prisons for


---------89:53----------
months


---------89:54----------
and i've never had a conversation with


---------89:56----------
anyone in prison the way that i've had


---------89:57----------
with you


---------89:59----------
because most of the time they're not as


---------90:01----------
scribal as you are unfortunately right


---------90:03----------
they haven't done i wouldn't i had one


---------90:05----------
come to try to talk to me when i was


---------90:07----------
like 17 and and i would


---------90:09----------
i always thought therapists were for


---------90:11----------
[ __ ] were for where for fakers people


---------90:13----------
who just wanted attention or to cry and


---------90:15----------
feel sorry for themselves i think that


---------90:16----------
was just more of mom's


---------90:18----------
mom's upbringing right there because


---------90:20----------
that's kind of what she instilled in me


---------90:21----------
is that you know it's every man for


---------90:24----------
himself you got to pull yourself up by


---------90:25----------
your bootstraps you better keep your


---------90:27----------
mouth shut nobody wants to hear you cry


---------90:28----------
yeah i mean you just suck it up


---------90:31----------
and so that's kind of that's kind of


---------90:32----------
that's kind of the philosophy i lived


---------90:34----------
under most of my life


---------90:36----------
so can we go back to impressing people


---------90:38----------
for a second because i think there's a


---------90:39----------
lot here yes carry on so so i i think


---------90:42----------
that um when it comes to impressing


---------90:44----------
people like i think it makes sense


---------90:47----------
because you know you're concerned for


---------90:50----------
good reason


---------90:51----------
that what you are on the inside people


---------90:53----------
aren't gonna like right so like when you


---------90:55----------
were five and you don't know how to put


---------90:57----------
on a mask your mom was like really cruel


---------90:59----------
to you your brother was like pretty


---------91:00----------
neglectful you know i wonder a little


---------91:02----------
bit about whether he was you know since


---------91:04----------
you were the favorite whether he


---------91:05----------
resented you for that


---------91:07----------
um


---------91:08----------
you know there's there's a lot of stuff


---------91:09----------
there where you learned early on that


---------91:11----------
like who i am is like not an okay person


---------91:14----------
and then that gets reinforced by you


---------91:16----------
know going to prison and putting on a


---------91:17----------
mask and this kind of stuff and then you


---------91:19----------
sort of also gets reinforced when you


---------91:21----------
start like doing really nice things for


---------91:22----------
people and you begin to see like oh if i


---------91:24----------
give people gifts like they're going to


---------91:26----------
like me and they'll want to hang out


---------91:27----------
with me this is how this game is played


---------91:29----------
it's all very cerebral


---------91:31----------
right


---------91:32----------
so i think that as a result you're going


---------91:33----------
to want to impress people because


---------91:35----------
there's probably also if we want to just


---------91:36----------
be blunt about there's some amount of


---------91:38----------
shame right because you're a 41 year old


---------91:40----------
dude you got laid like 25 years ago you


---------91:42----------
know


---------91:44----------
there's a lot of that crap and so to


---------91:46----------
compensate for all of that stuff


---------91:49----------
there's gonna be like i wanna because i


---------91:51----------
feel like i'm down here if i impress


---------91:54----------
people to this level i'll end up


---------91:55----------
somewhere in the middle where i can be


---------91:58----------
comfortable


---------91:59----------
you know even if i and so there's a lot


---------92:01----------
going on there and so i'm not surprised


---------92:03----------
that you'll also swing to the other end


---------92:05----------
of the sp spectrum because


---------92:07----------
if you i don't know how to say this but


---------92:11----------
if you advertise something really


---------92:13----------
terrible you've done


---------92:15----------
and then people hate you for it


---------92:17----------
that's the reason they hate you it's not


---------92:19----------
because that's understandable exactly


---------92:22----------
it's not because there's something


---------92:24----------
broken and unfixable and deep down and


---------92:27----------
part of your dna


---------92:29----------
that


---------92:30----------
if people saw like you would be


---------92:32----------
absolutely terrified if they hated you


---------92:34----------
for that but you're fearful that there's


---------92:36----------
something within me that like


---------92:38----------
if i ever let people see so then what


---------92:40----------
you do is you advertise all this


---------92:41----------
negative crap and it actually protects


---------92:43----------
you both ways either way what's


---------92:45----------
happening is no one is getting an


---------92:47----------
authentic you


---------92:50----------
and so the tricky thing there is you


---------92:52----------
know i think stepping away from all of


---------92:54----------
this stuff


---------92:55----------
so you try so hard you're trying to


---------92:57----------
figure out who am i well like i think


---------92:59----------
all you need to do is stop moving away


---------93:01----------
from it and you'll figure it out i think


---------93:03----------
actually we know who you are i feel like


---------93:05----------
i have a pretty good sense of who you


---------93:06----------
are can you share


---------93:09----------
yeah so i mean i think you're i think


---------93:11----------
you're the dormant philosopher


---------93:13----------
i think that you like to think big


---------93:16----------
thoughts you like to have your thoughts


---------93:17----------
challenged you want to have you want to


---------93:19----------
put your thoughts out into the world and


---------93:21----------
you want to have respect for the quality


---------93:24----------
and excellence of your thoughts


---------93:27----------
with all of that yep that it's who you


---------93:30----------
are bro


---------93:31----------
right like you want to say to the world


---------93:33----------
like i'm going to work really really


---------93:35----------
really hard at this and i'm gonna make


---------93:37----------
it awesome and i'm gonna show it to you


---------93:39----------
and y'all are gonna [ __ ] think it's


---------93:40----------
awesome too


---------93:42----------
the day that you're able to do that i


---------93:44----------
think is gonna be the opposite end of


---------93:46----------
the spectrum of when you were suicidal


---------93:48----------
and trying to find a reason to wake up


---------93:50----------
tomorrow for tomorrow


---------93:52----------
as long as you're moving in that


---------93:54----------
direction you're gonna fight to stay


---------93:56----------
alive


---------93:59----------
and the problem is that you've just been


---------94:01----------
given such a shitty circumstance


---------94:05----------
that


---------94:06----------
that part of you has never had a chance


---------94:10----------
to like


---------94:11----------
exist in the world because who's going


---------94:12----------
to listen to an ex-con who's going to


---------94:14----------
listen to this guy who's going to listen


---------94:16----------
to like it


---------94:18----------
dude without a shin


---------94:20----------
your mind is gonna fill in all these


---------94:22----------
different reasons why no one has had a


---------94:24----------
chance to reason to listen to you but


---------94:26----------
you have a lot to say and it has immense


---------94:28----------
value


---------94:32----------
what do you think about that


---------94:34----------
i think that'd be fantastic um


---------94:37----------
if anybody wanted to talk to me about


---------94:38----------
anything that'd be great yep


---------94:41----------
so so and i think this is the tricky


---------94:42----------
thing so now we get to like the rigidity


---------94:45----------
right so you have to be careful because


---------94:46----------
the ego i think is shooting you in the


---------94:48----------
foot in some ways


---------94:50----------
so when you know someone when you're


---------94:52----------
attracted to someone because they're an


---------94:53----------
eight and you want to impress everyone


---------94:55----------
because


---------94:56----------
you know this person's an eight and you


---------94:57----------
want to go on a date with them


---------94:59----------
and they say hey i think you should


---------95:01----------
really meet my friend who's probably not


---------95:03----------
a three she's probably not maybe she


---------95:05----------
really is a bridge troll but i suspect


---------95:07----------
that your mind is warping her


---------95:10----------
attractiveness


---------95:11----------
and the second thing is like you're not


---------95:13----------
like a super sexual guy to begin with


---------95:14----------
and do you want a hot girlfriend sure


---------95:16----------
but i think it would be wonderful if you


---------95:18----------
could like because attraction is more


---------95:20----------
than physical stuff right there's like


---------95:22----------
intimacy there's emotional stuff people


---------95:24----------
have very healthy loving sexually


---------95:27----------
arousing relationships in their 70s


---------95:30----------
like they do that it's like normal right


---------95:32----------
so i think a big part of that is is like


---------95:35----------
you're not giving people a chance


---------95:37----------
to


---------95:39----------
like


---------95:40----------
you you're kind of writing yourself off


---------95:41----------
right it's back to this idea of here's


---------95:44----------
the test that i can pass therefore i'm


---------95:47----------
going to throw that one out the window


---------95:48----------
and let me find one that i can fail


---------95:51----------
and so when you talk about rejection


---------95:53----------
from women that's fine but you know i


---------95:56----------
don't know that you're also playing a


---------95:58----------
fair game there


---------96:00----------
where like maybe


---------96:01----------
you are


---------96:02----------
you know and i'm not saying that you


---------96:04----------
can't get an eight like i think you can


---------96:05----------
get an eight i think it's going to take


---------96:07----------
some work


---------96:08----------
but i think this is where other


---------96:09----------
self-fulfilling prophecies could come in


---------96:11----------
because the eight shows up and you're so


---------96:13----------
concerned about her not rejecting you


---------96:15----------
that you do a lot of nice stuff for her


---------96:18----------
you meet her emotional needs while not


---------96:20----------
asking for anything in return in an


---------96:22----------
effort to get her to like you and then


---------96:23----------
she starts treating you like a friend


---------96:25----------
because that's like that's the thing


---------96:27----------
right we're friends like friends are


---------96:28----------
there for each other


---------96:30----------
and the start of the romantic


---------96:32----------
relationship is like different like


---------96:33----------
people usually make their intentions


---------96:35----------
know early on but this is how people


---------96:36----------
kind of repeatedly get into the friend


---------96:38----------
zone is you're afraid she's going to


---------96:39----------
reject you so you want to stack the deck


---------96:41----------
in your favor by doing a lot of nice


---------96:43----------
things yeah yeah the friend zone that's


---------96:45----------
where i live that's my that's my address


---------96:47----------
so so you stack you stack up on your


---------96:50----------
side to get her to like you in a


---------96:51----------
particular like to get her to like you


---------96:53----------
so you're there for her and then you


---------96:55----------
know women this is going to be a


---------96:56----------
generalization which you know


---------96:58----------
anyone can criticize me for fairly but i


---------97:01----------
think generally speaking like women are


---------97:03----------
better at


---------97:04----------
offering emotional support and receiving


---------97:06----------
emotional support without it having a


---------97:08----------
sexual connotation to it whereas like if


---------97:11----------
you were like the things that you do for


---------97:13----------
the women that friendzoned you you


---------97:14----------
wouldn't do for your dude your boys


---------97:16----------
right right


---------97:18----------
you know like like you treat them


---------97:19----------
differently so like there's there's a


---------97:21----------
interesting thing about emotional


---------97:22----------
support and sexual intimacy which men


---------97:25----------
tend to tie together a little bit closer


---------97:27----------
and women don't


---------97:29----------
broad sweeping generalization that's


---------97:31----------
very open to criticism


---------97:33----------
but i do think that the more you stack


---------97:35----------
the deck in your favor to try to get


---------97:36----------
someone to like you the more likely


---------97:38----------
you're you are to end up in the friend


---------97:39----------
zone


---------97:41----------
so in this hypothetical scenario where i


---------97:43----------
do have an eight


---------97:44----------
or even a seven or six i gotta be honest


---------97:47----------
do you i feel and i would want to know


---------97:49----------
if you feel as well


---------97:51----------
i i fear i would be extremely insecure


---------97:54----------
and jealous


---------97:55----------
one time i had a girlfriend when i was a


---------97:57----------
kid i was ex


---------97:59----------
massively insecure like like grossly so


---------98:02----------
like creepily weirdly


---------98:04----------
psychotically so


---------98:06----------
yep you're only with me because you like


---------98:07----------
my brother and and


---------98:10----------
yeah so


---------98:11----------
i don't know that i'm emotionally


---------98:12----------
equipped for uh for a relationship of


---------98:14----------
any kind you're you're do you think that


---------98:17----------
oh okay okay so i'm right then okay yeah


---------98:20----------
so i i don't think you're emotionally


---------98:22----------
equipped for a relationship but that


---------98:23----------
doesn't mean you shouldn't start dating


---------98:25----------
and that also doesn't mean that you


---------98:27----------
won't become emotionally equipped over


---------98:29----------
time


---------98:30----------
because if you've gotten this far


---------98:32----------
with this shitty hand of cards like i


---------98:34----------
think you could be emotionally equipped


---------98:35----------
for a relationship in no time


---------98:38----------
don't sell yourself short


---------98:40----------
you know you haven't really been trying


---------98:42----------
i mean i know you've been trying in your


---------98:44----------
way i don't think you've been engaged in


---------98:46----------
a in a positive learning environment


---------98:49----------
that's what i'd call it right so like


---------98:51----------
even if you end up they end up


---------98:53----------
recommending what you call a three


---------98:56----------
it's probably closer to a five


---------98:58----------
and i think you should do your best to


---------99:00----------
like go and have a conversation with the


---------99:02----------
person you don't have to sleep with them


---------99:04----------
just try to go and like make a friend


---------99:06----------
like fine well that hasn't by the way


---------99:08----------
that hasn't happened since i was sick 15


---------99:10----------
14 years old so this is nothing reason


---------99:13----------
that has happened


---------99:14----------
yeah so i yeah okay i don't even have


---------99:16----------
any friends too i don't even have any


---------99:18----------
friends to refer anybody for me i don't


---------99:20----------
know how to make friends i don't go


---------99:22----------
anywhere so that makes it hard


---------99:25----------
think to myself okay where do i go to


---------99:27----------
meet people well corona virus happens so


---------99:29----------
okay fair enough but in normal


---------99:32----------
circumstances i don't know where one


---------99:34----------
goes as an adult to me


---------99:37----------
friends lovers you know just just other


---------99:40----------
adults


---------99:42----------
yeah so that's a challenging question


---------99:44----------
um i'm gonna i'm gonna table that for a


---------99:46----------
second okay we'll get to concrete advice


---------99:49----------
um


---------99:50----------
so the last thing that i want to share


---------99:52----------
with you is i think that like like you


---------99:54----------
said you're going to be very insecure if


---------99:55----------
you enter into a relationship so the


---------99:57----------
question is


---------99:58----------
how do you learn how to be insecure


---------100:00----------
right so and this is the challenge and


---------100:03----------
secure or secure sorry secure so


---------100:05----------
okay um


---------100:07----------
you know and i think this is gonna be


---------100:09----------
tough


---------100:10----------
but i think this is where you got to


---------100:12----------
work on the rigidity of your thinking


---------100:14----------
okay so like if your mind is telling you


---------100:16----------
something and it's telling you this is


---------100:17----------
true this is true this is true this is


---------100:19----------
true


---------100:20----------
there's a general capacity to be less


---------100:22----------
rigid with your thinking and be more


---------100:23----------
flexible


---------100:25----------
so i know this is this is i i say this


---------100:27----------
not entirely i say this with judgment


---------100:30----------
okay so like if you can learn how to


---------100:32----------
love a jewish person you will be no


---------100:34----------
longer insecure


---------100:38----------
so i didn't really want to get into this


---------100:40----------
but i don't hate


---------100:41----------
the jews i just hate jews


---------100:45----------
maybe i mean it the other way i don't


---------100:47----------
hate jews i hate the jews individually i


---------100:50----------
have no opinion on them okay sure so i


---------100:53----------
get what you're saying i get what you're


---------100:55----------
saying if i can overcome something that


---------100:56----------
i have made my mind up on exactly so


---------101:00----------
that's why it doesn't have to be the


---------101:01----------
anti-semitism right that's me taking a


---------101:03----------
sucker punch at you so i apologize for


---------101:05----------
that that's fair totally fair i knew i


---------101:07----------
had it coming so yeah now that we've


---------101:10----------
done it


---------101:11----------
we're good right


---------101:13----------
so the other thing is i would say that


---------101:15----------
you've made other statements i keep on


---------101:17----------
harping on that because maybe that


---------101:18----------
statement did bother me so i should have


---------101:20----------
i should have processed those emotions a


---------101:22----------
little bit better but um and maybe you


---------101:24----------
did detect disgust i'm sort of


---------101:26----------
reflecting now


---------101:27----------
but i i think that uh


---------101:30----------
what i would say is that there are


---------101:31----------
several things that you said today where


---------101:32----------
you're like that's the way that i am


---------101:35----------
right and i think flexibility around any


---------101:38----------
one of those things basically


---------101:40----------
training yourself to be cognitively


---------101:41----------
flexible i think is the most important


---------101:43----------
thing that you need to learn


---------101:45----------
because i do think i mean it's not hard


---------101:47----------
to figure out what you should do in your


---------101:49----------
life i think like to summarize like so


---------101:51----------
here's what i'd say anthony first of all


---------101:53----------
what you should your purpose in life


---------101:55----------
right now is to [ __ ] live it because


---------101:56----------
you haven't had a chance


---------101:58----------
so i'd say if you enjoy playing video


---------102:00----------
games play video games go and seek as


---------102:03----------
many experiences as you can because like


---------102:05----------
go eat burgers you know study computer


---------102:09----------
programming be at the top of your class


---------102:10----------
like get a [ __ ] award with the day


---------102:12----------
that you graduate you know like be on


---------102:15----------
the honors list


---------102:16----------
do the things that kids normally go to


---------102:19----------
their parents and are proud of


---------102:21----------
and then like you know do the things


---------102:23----------
that make your parents brag about you


---------102:26----------
and then you're not gonna have any


---------102:27----------
parents to brag about you and you're


---------102:29----------
gonna do that thing and you're gonna


---------102:30----------
feel devastated and alone and [ __ ]


---------102:33----------
feel that [ __ ] too


---------102:36----------
and then pity yourself and let other


---------102:38----------
people pity you and let other people


---------102:40----------
have compassion towards you


---------102:42----------
and let go of your like you know


---------102:45----------
i i don't know there's some strength in


---------102:47----------
there which is like a strength of


---------102:49----------
survival and let go of that let yourself


---------102:52----------
be weak


---------102:53----------
you know like feel all of those things


---------102:55----------
and have someone to share that with


---------102:58----------
and start to date and start to play


---------102:59----------
video games and go for walks you're in


---------103:01----------
the mountains fantastic build shelves


---------103:03----------
like build your house get a dog


---------103:05----------
do all of the things that life has not


---------103:07----------
let you do


---------103:08----------
and in terms of who you are read think


---------103:12----------
write


---------103:13----------
study


---------103:15----------
and then you say that's going to be hard


---------103:16----------
because i have no one to talk with which


---------103:18----------
is exactly right so i don't know this is


---------103:20----------
where practically like you have to find


---------103:21----------
people you have to recognize that as you


---------103:24----------
enter into places with people there's


---------103:27----------
going to be this tsunami of feelings


---------103:29----------
that arises


---------103:30----------
insecurity what are they going to think


---------103:32----------
what do i have to say how do i get them


---------103:34----------
to like me but you're not going for them


---------103:36----------
to like you you're just going to get


---------103:39----------
food for your mind


---------103:41----------
because the rigid thinking especially on


---------103:43----------
politics and stuff if you're on the


---------103:44----------
internet like you're never going to get


---------103:45----------
a contrary opinion or you're going to


---------103:47----------
discount a contrary opinion you know


---------103:49----------
like whatever


---------103:50----------
so just go and like i don't know where


---------103:52----------
you engage with people so i'd say that


---------103:54----------
you know sometimes there are like


---------103:55----------
different kinds of classes and stuff


---------103:58----------
like um you know even i it sounds like


---------104:00----------
you're in school online i assume because


---------104:02----------
of covet and you're living in the


---------104:03----------
mountains right


---------104:04----------
right


---------104:05----------
so so this is where i don't know where


---------104:07----------
your school is and and you know whether


---------104:09----------
it's a local university but it's online


---------104:11----------
classes yes or in person classes i could


---------104:14----------
take so not just in person classes i


---------104:16----------
would look at in-person extracurriculars


---------104:18----------
and you are going to feel like a weirdo


---------104:21----------
because it's going to be a bunch of 18


---------104:22----------
19 year old kids


---------104:24----------
and you're going to be a 41 year old


---------104:26----------
ex-con with tattoos


---------104:28----------
right


---------104:29----------
but like that carries a certain like


---------104:31----------
gravitas and respect


---------104:33----------
they're all children and you're a man


---------104:35----------
you know you may not feel like it on the


---------104:37----------
inside but it's kind of scary and with


---------104:39----------
your resting [ __ ] face you know because


---------104:41----------
your smile like really lights up your


---------104:43----------
face


---------104:44----------
it does wonders for it right you've got


---------104:46----------
a beautiful smile and and and so i think


---------104:49----------
even when you see it there's like


---------104:50----------
mischievous in like there's


---------104:52----------
mischievousness right there's


---------104:54----------
playfulness there there's excitement


---------104:56----------
and so i think all of those things you


---------104:58----------
actually have to give too is the resting


---------105:00----------
[ __ ] face terrifying absolutely are you


---------105:02----------
[ __ ] xcon with tattoos like


---------105:03----------
absolutely but the moment you smile it


---------105:06----------
all comes falling apart


---------105:08----------
and even to be able to smile like that


---------105:11----------
anthony that's what you've missed man


---------105:14----------
you know i want to see i want to say


---------105:15----------
that your goal should be having that


---------105:17----------
mischievous smile


---------105:19----------
every day


---------105:20----------
have a conversation with someone play a


---------105:22----------
trick on them you know pour some ice


---------105:24----------
water down their back like do whatever


---------105:27----------
it is that like you haven't gotten to do


---------105:30----------
have conversations with people and i'd


---------105:32----------
say if you want like a compass


---------105:34----------
try to go as close as you can to the


---------105:36----------
person that you were in the way you


---------105:38----------
interacted people when you hitchhiked


---------105:41----------
right because i think that that's


---------105:42----------
there's something about


---------105:44----------
acknowledging that you may not deserve


---------105:46----------
much but you're gonna give people a


---------105:48----------
chance to give you something anyway


---------105:51----------
and what i'm really seeing right now is


---------105:53----------
that once again you're holding yourself


---------105:55----------
back you're not giving people a chance


---------105:56----------
to care about you


---------105:59----------
all you do is you put up facades that


---------106:01----------
are guaranteed to get their respect and


---------106:04----------
enjoyment you're not giving people a


---------106:05----------
chance


---------106:07----------
you're tricking them into engaging into


---------106:09----------
a false relationship with you


---------106:14----------
so go and do stuff i'd say go see a


---------106:16----------
medical doctor if you if you don't have


---------106:18----------
one you know get yourself checked out


---------106:20----------
especially in terms of the sexuality


---------106:21----------
stuff there's some medical conditions


---------106:24----------
like for example low testosterone


---------106:26----------
production can lead to decreased libido


---------106:28----------
part of the reason i was asking you


---------106:29----------
about the leg muscles and the leg injury


---------106:31----------
is because the largest source of


---------106:33----------
endogenous testosterone in from the male


---------106:36----------
body comes from actually the quadriceps


---------106:38----------
muscles so people that i work with have


---------106:40----------
low uh testosterone like i'll tell them


---------106:42----------
to do like squats


---------106:44----------
like if you want to you know


---------106:46----------
get horny again do squats it's kind of


---------106:48----------
interesting


---------106:49----------
so it's a very endogenous kind of source


---------106:52----------
of testosterone there are other things


---------106:53----------
in terms of sexuality like just you know


---------106:55----------
the brain you know the body kind of like


---------106:58----------
you know


---------106:59----------
puts things on standby if they're not


---------107:01----------
like regularly used right so for 20


---------107:03----------
years while you're in prison we don't


---------107:04----------
know what your sexual activity is like


---------107:06----------
i'm not gonna ask zero but zero you know


---------107:09----------
so your your body's like hey we don't


---------107:11----------
need this thing so let's like shut it


---------107:12----------
down for now and you'll be surprised


---------107:14----------
it'll come back so i do think in terms


---------107:16----------
of hope by the way


---------107:18----------
i do think that everything that i'm


---------107:20----------
hearing you have a lot of handicaps but


---------107:22----------
i don't think you're like the boy who


---------107:23----------
was raised by wolves


---------107:25----------
right i don't think you missed


---------107:26----------
developmental milestones in such a


---------107:29----------
crucial way to where you won't be able


---------107:31----------
to engage in these things and this


---------107:33----------
conversation really reassures me because


---------107:35----------
you seem like a quite a relatable guy


---------107:37----------
like you seem like a good dude


---------107:38----------
right you're very in tune with facial


---------107:40----------
expressions you're very sensitive to


---------107:42----------
different kinds of judgment you're


---------107:44----------
better at detecting my sensitive my


---------107:46----------
disapproval than i am and i'm pretty


---------107:48----------
[ __ ] good at detecting myself that


---------107:50----------
means you're an absolute beast and we


---------107:52----------
see this in people who are raised in


---------107:54----------
traumatic households because you have


---------107:56----------
it's a survival for you you have to be


---------107:58----------
able to read your mom's facial


---------107:59----------
expressions


---------108:00----------
right like whether you're gonna get hit


---------108:01----------
that day or not like you need to know


---------108:04----------
so be careful because you're going to be


---------108:06----------
interpreting a lot of information that


---------108:08----------
people themselves are not going to be


---------108:10----------
aware of


---------108:11----------
so you you will see dislike in people's


---------108:14----------
faces that they're not even aware of and


---------108:16----------
may not even


---------108:19----------
because i definitely see the facial


---------108:20----------
expressions and it's like it's like


---------108:23----------
oh i see where this is leading let me go


---------108:25----------
ahead and exit with some grace while i


---------108:27----------
still can exactly and this is the thing


---------108:29----------
though i know it sounds kind of crazy


---------108:31----------
but


---------108:32----------
they're only there's only a 20 chance


---------108:35----------
it's going to go where you think it's


---------108:36----------
going to go


---------108:38----------
because the other thing about your brain


---------108:40----------
and there's been overwhelming research


---------108:42----------
about this is that your brain is also


---------108:44----------
especially tuned to negative facial


---------108:46----------
expressions


---------108:48----------
sure absolutely


---------108:49----------
so you're gonna miss


---------108:51----------
all of the positive facial expressions


---------108:53----------
and you're gonna amplify all of the


---------108:55----------
negative ones which is in turn gonna


---------108:57----------
reinforce your insecurity


---------108:59----------
is going to cause you to stack the deck


---------109:01----------
in your favor


---------109:02----------
and will set you up for a relationship


---------109:04----------
on false pretenses which is going to


---------109:06----------
wind up in the friend zone


---------109:08----------
and i fear that i have women flirt with


---------109:10----------
me and i have literally no idea they're


---------109:12----------
doing it i i fear that does happen and i


---------109:15----------
would have no way of knowing yep


---------109:18----------
i i believe it


---------109:21----------
you know so


---------109:22----------
i think very practically anthony i think


---------109:24----------
the first thing is to understand


---------109:26----------
yourself and understand your rigidity


---------109:28----------
and try to engage in a little bit of


---------109:30----------
cognitive flexibility


---------109:31----------
really start to question what does that


---------109:33----------
mean practically it means question your


---------109:35----------
conclusions because like you said you


---------109:37----------
see where this is going hold on a second


---------109:40----------
let's actually play the tape through to


---------109:42----------
the end because when i ask you i forgot


---------109:44----------
what question i asked you about oh yeah


---------109:45----------
what are you afraid that you know why


---------109:47----------
are you reassured that we're never going


---------109:49----------
to meet again what is the judgment that


---------109:50----------
you're afraid i'm making and like it


---------109:52----------
doesn't there isn't one


---------109:54----------
right so it's actually there's this


---------109:56----------
really tricky thing going on where like


---------109:57----------
your insecurity is like shaping your


---------110:00----------
thoughts and it feels logical to you


---------110:03----------
and it feels like oh this has happened a


---------110:04----------
thousand times before so i know i'm


---------110:06----------
right


---------110:07----------
but like it's all like if you kind of


---------110:09----------
it's going to be smoke and mirrors it's


---------110:10----------
going to be a mirage i'm like pretty


---------110:12----------
sure about this stuff


---------110:14----------
that most of the problems that you see


---------110:15----------
are going to be mirages when closely


---------110:17----------
examined your insecurity is going to be


---------110:19----------
a mirage or there'll be some truth to it


---------110:21----------
like there's some good reason you know


---------110:23----------
i'm missing a shannon i'm an ex-con i'm


---------110:25----------
41 years old you know i may not be the


---------110:27----------
the you know the highest what most women


---------110:30----------
are looking for


---------110:31----------
right so there's some truth to that we


---------110:33----------
just have to acknowledge that but i


---------110:34----------
think that don't let those things define


---------110:36----------
who you are because you're so much more


---------110:38----------
than that


---------110:42----------
now


---------110:43----------
you mentioned that


---------110:45----------
you imagine it might be hard for me to


---------110:46----------
imagine myself as an adult inside what


---------110:49----------
made you say that because that's very


---------110:50----------
true i tell people i don't even know


---------110:52----------
what i want to be when i grow up and i


---------110:54----------
i'm only half joking when i say that um


---------110:57----------
what what what brought you to that


---------110:58----------
conclusion because that's exactly how i


---------111:00----------
feel


---------111:02----------
so the first is that you weren't shown


---------111:04----------
how to be an adult


---------111:05----------
so you don't know what it looks like


---------111:08----------
right


---------111:09----------
and then the second thing is that you've


---------111:11----------
missed a lot of the developmental


---------111:12----------
milestones that people


---------111:15----------
like that help people become adults


---------111:18----------
oh yeah that's true i get what you're


---------111:20----------
saying yeah you go to the weddings you


---------111:21----------
do the whole thing the girl you go to


---------111:22----------
prom


---------111:23----------
or you ask a girl out for prom and she


---------111:25----------
says no


---------111:27----------
you ask a girl out freshman year and she


---------111:29----------
says no


---------111:30----------
yeah ask a girl out fresh sophomore year


---------111:32----------
and she says yes


---------111:35----------
that's how you grow up you you graduate


---------111:37----------
from college you get a college degree


---------111:40----------
you know you get your first job


---------111:42----------
you have a career


---------111:44----------
and then you're like adulting


---------111:46----------
you like talk with friends of yours and


---------111:48----------
this is your it's gonna be uh uphill


---------111:49----------
battle okay anthony i hate to break it


---------111:51----------
to you but like there's also like you


---------111:53----------
know when you're 21 years old and you're


---------111:55----------
like late night hanging out with your


---------111:57----------
friends and you have a conversation


---------111:58----------
about i don't know if i want to be an


---------111:59----------
electrical engineer


---------112:01----------
i really love art and then you have a


---------112:03----------
conversation about that and your friends


---------112:05----------
are like then you should do art and then


---------112:06----------
you wake up the next day and you realize


---------112:08----------
how stupid it is to not be an electrical


---------112:10----------
engineer and you try to have a


---------112:12----------
conversation with your parents like


---------112:13----------
that's idiotic and then you decide to


---------112:16----------
become an electrical engineer that's how


---------112:17----------
you grow up because you kill a tiny part


---------112:20----------
of your childlike self on the inside


---------112:22----------
you know


---------112:24----------
and so i think all those things so i


---------112:26----------
think it's a lack of modeling


---------112:28----------
and then also like you just haven't gone


---------112:29----------
through the developmental milestones the


---------112:31----------
good news is that


---------112:32----------
generally speaking data i don't know


---------112:34----------
about data but i guess i'm just making a


---------112:35----------
conclusion it's been my experience that


---------112:39----------
missed milestones you can catch up on


---------112:41----------
very quickly


---------112:43----------
so i would not be surprised if four


---------112:45----------
years from now you felt like a 45 year


---------112:47----------
old and you were doing most of the


---------112:48----------
things that a 45 year old is doing


---------112:51----------
sure


---------112:52----------
do you think it's possible i only want


---------112:54----------
friends and a girlfriend because that's


---------112:56----------
what is expected by society is to have


---------112:58----------
friends and a girlfriend to be normal


---------113:00----------
yes absolutely i think that's half your


---------113:02----------
problem


---------113:03----------
is that you're trying to do


---------113:05----------
normal yep is you're trying to do what


---------113:07----------
you think you should be doing instead of


---------113:09----------
actually doing what feels right to you


---------113:11----------
so why do you want the eight instead of


---------113:13----------
the three it's because


---------113:15----------
the eight other people would be


---------113:16----------
impressed that i have


---------113:17----------
but you may actually you may genuinely


---------113:20----------
if you got the eight to marry you and


---------113:22----------
you got the three to marry you


---------113:24----------
i'm not convinced that you would be


---------113:26----------
genuinely happier with the eight because


---------113:28----------
i don't think that physically more


---------113:29----------
insecure if anything right


---------113:31----------
case in point right you're the one who's


---------113:33----------
telling me it's a bad idea so like


---------113:35----------
instead gravitate towards what is


---------113:37----------
authentically you but the problem is


---------113:38----------
you've been weeding that [ __ ] out for so


---------113:40----------
long you don't even know what that is


---------113:42----------
right right


---------113:44----------
right so i don't know who i am yeah well


---------113:46----------
but so here's the thing so you get


---------113:48----------
there's there's a there's a trick you


---------113:49----------
can play


---------113:50----------
so as you observe your thoughts and as


---------113:53----------
you begin to realize


---------113:55----------
that


---------113:57----------
i want this eight because people will be


---------113:59----------
impressed then you know you should move


---------114:02----------
in a different direction


---------114:03----------
if i'm doing it for external motivations


---------114:07----------
okay that's that's great that's really


---------114:08----------
good inside that's great right so then


---------114:10----------
be like okay hold on a second what do i


---------114:12----------
actually want this is what i would feel


---------114:15----------
secure with because everything in your


---------114:17----------
brain understand this anthony when


---------114:18----------
you've had trauma like yours


---------114:20----------
everything in your brain is wired not


---------114:22----------
for happiness it's wired for safety and


---------114:24----------
security


---------114:26----------
what have you never had [ __ ] safety


---------114:28----------
and security


---------114:29----------
ever right right so like everything


---------114:31----------
you're going to be doing is going to be


---------114:33----------
the safe route computer programming like


---------114:35----------
that's a safe pick


---------114:37----------
well i figured future proof right that's


---------114:39----------
exactly the logic that went into it what


---------114:41----------
is the most future proof job i could


---------114:43----------
pick that i would be capable of doing


---------114:44----------
and that a felony would


---------114:46----------
not hamper as much you're absolutely


---------114:48----------
right you're right so it's it's all


---------114:50----------
safety and security and like safety and


---------114:52----------
security is important don't get me wrong


---------114:53----------
i think it's it's a good choice but at


---------114:56----------
the end of the day if that's where


---------114:57----------
you're moving towards in your cognitive


---------114:59----------
thought process move the other way


---------115:01----------
like i i can almost guarantee you that


---------115:03----------
if you start meeting women and stuff


---------115:05----------
you're going to meet a woman who is


---------115:06----------
absolutely amazing and would be a


---------115:08----------
wonderful partner and she's going to be


---------115:09----------
less attractive than what you would want


---------115:12----------
and really like look at yourself in that


---------115:14----------
moment examine that rigidity


---------115:17----------
you know and it's not about security or


---------115:19----------
any of that crap to be honest it's just


---------115:21----------
like do i enjoy spending time with this


---------115:23----------
person do i enjoy having a conversation


---------115:25----------
with this person that's what's important


---------115:28----------
i mean 25 years from now like everyone's


---------115:30----------
gonna be ugly anyway


---------115:33----------
so it's you know what


---------115:39----------
that's what i got some stuff right there


---------115:42----------
that's what i got for you


---------115:44----------
that's much appreciated i i think that's


---------115:46----------
some good insights um


---------115:48----------
i think


---------115:51----------
i i really i i don't know how like


---------115:55----------
i just i really wonder if i wouldn't


---------115:56----------
just be happier alone like maybe that's


---------115:58----------
what i really want and the only reason i


---------116:00----------
want other people okay i would like to


---------116:02----------
have a sounding board you're absolutely


---------116:04----------
right about that when you say somebody


---------116:05----------
you could just talk at in the guise of


---------116:07----------
conversation that does sound phenomenal


---------116:10----------
um


---------116:11----------
and honestly somebody to share life's


---------116:13----------
triumphs and things like that with right


---------116:16----------
and and and that would be great to have


---------116:18----------
um


---------116:19----------
but like


---------116:21----------
also it terrifies me the thought of


---------116:23----------
having to


---------116:25----------
the rigidity you're 100 right about the


---------116:27----------
rigidity because it's like i have a set


---------116:29----------
way of doing things i have and this is


---------116:30----------
how i think of it i have a set schedule


---------116:33----------
of when i clean the house on sundays


---------116:35----------
sundays when i do laundry sundays you


---------116:36----------
know i mean like i have a very rigid


---------116:38----------
schedule and i think a lot of that is is


---------116:41----------
is prison


---------116:43----------
yeah i mean


---------116:44----------
it's a rigid schedule in there you eat


---------116:46----------
when told to eat what you're told to eat


---------116:48----------
and how you're told to eat it and so you


---------116:50----------
you kind of you begin to find comfort in


---------116:52----------
the routine i began to find comfort in


---------116:54----------
the routine and


---------116:56----------
i was literally the only thing that kept


---------116:58----------
me going day to day is the routine one


---------117:00----------
meal to the next one meal to the next


---------117:01----------
and then wake up made one meal to the


---------117:03----------
next and so i think that that's that's


---------117:06----------
um


---------117:07----------
yeah i think that that rigidity


---------117:09----------
overcoming that rigidity and sharing my


---------117:12----------
life and letting somebody into my


---------117:14----------
intimate space would be difficult for me


---------117:16----------
yeah so


---------117:17----------
baby steps


---------117:18----------
right


---------117:19----------
so here's what i'd say anthony to sum


---------117:21----------
you up your problem is not one of


---------117:23----------
learning what you want to do it's about


---------117:25----------
unlearning


---------117:28----------
the second thing is you you may be right


---------117:30----------
that you may at the end of the day be


---------117:32----------
happier alone but you don't get to make


---------117:34----------
that choice until you've tried


---------117:36----------
tried


---------117:40----------
dude you have to live [ __ ] life


---------117:42----------
and living life means making mistakes to


---------117:44----------
figure out what your life looks like


---------117:46----------
thank you for that because i think that


---------117:47----------
was just giving up saying that i think


---------117:49----------
that was just talking myself into giving


---------117:51----------
up so thank you you may be right but you


---------117:53----------
don't get to make that decision yet


---------117:56----------
until you've tested the alternative


---------117:57----------
hypothesis right and it's turned out to


---------118:00----------
be a train wreck after train wreck after


---------118:01----------
train wreck if you want to grow up to be


---------118:03----------
an adult you have to have as


---------118:05----------
you have to have a string of bad


---------118:06----------
relationships in your teenage years and


---------118:08----------
early 20s


---------118:09----------
it's part of the process


---------118:11----------
you know


---------118:12----------
so i'd say like if you're not


---------118:14----------
entirely ready yet like slow steps you


---------118:17----------
don't have to open up completely but i'd


---------118:18----------
reign in some of that stuff


---------118:20----------
about you know trying to impress people


---------118:22----------
and like you're a genuinely good dude


---------118:24----------
you don't have to fake it


---------118:27----------
you know


---------118:28----------
so just let let that authentically show


---------118:32----------
do you think that professional therapy


---------118:34----------
would be advisable or not absolutely


---------118:37----------
is it necessary


---------118:39----------
is it necessary


---------118:41----------
do you sense something in there me that


---------118:43----------
that is off


---------118:45----------
no granted it's only been two hours i


---------118:47----------
know so let me let me explain let me


---------118:49----------
explain to you anthony this is very


---------118:50----------
important to understand


---------118:52----------
i i would strongly recommend


---------118:53----------
professional therapy to you not because


---------118:55----------
something is broken because you're so


---------118:57----------
cerebral and you would get so much out


---------118:59----------
of it


---------119:00----------
is a bunch within you broken yeah man


---------119:03----------
it's like


---------119:05----------
a hurricane went through your internal


---------119:07----------
self


---------119:08----------
but that's not the reason i'm


---------119:10----------
recommending therapy i'm recommending


---------119:12----------
therapy because you are really good at


---------119:13----------
having conversations and boy if someone


---------119:16----------
devoted one hour a week to helping you


---------119:18----------
understand yourself you would learn so


---------119:20----------
much


---------119:23----------
it's not about fixing something


---------119:25----------
it's about like think about this for a


---------119:26----------
second you could spend one hour a week


---------119:29----------
having someone reflect on your


---------119:31----------
interpersonal journey


---------119:35----------
helping you discover who you are


---------119:37----------
what holds you back how does all this


---------119:39----------
programming get laid down


---------119:41----------
you know what's what software and what's


---------119:43----------
hardware all of these questions i think


---------119:46----------
you can


---------119:47----------
do in therapy that's why you should do


---------119:49----------
it because you'd love it


---------119:51----------
not because you need it


---------119:53----------
will will it help you practically i


---------119:55----------
think so like especially with insecurity


---------119:56----------
and emotional you know that kind of


---------119:59----------
stuff like


---------120:02----------
but yeah and i'd say you know in terms


---------120:04----------
of resources and stuff i don't know


---------120:06----------
exactly what your financial situation is


---------120:07----------
like but you know if you're a student


---------120:10----------
oftentimes they have discounted or


---------120:12----------
available resources depending on


---------120:14----------
you know what


---------120:15----------
their ways to get it you can kind of


---------120:17----------
google search


---------120:18----------
you know for community mental health


---------120:20----------
center and oftentimes they can help you


---------120:23----------
in some way they can even like help you


---------120:24----------
get on insurance if your financial


---------120:26----------
situation is like below a certain level


---------120:28----------
like you can basically get insurance to


---------120:29----------
get therapy


---------120:31----------
um


---------120:32----------
but i would absolutely recommend it i


---------120:34----------
think


---------120:35----------
i mean if you find a decent therapist


---------120:36----------
that fits well with you


---------120:38----------
i think uh you know it doesn't


---------120:41----------
i think the thing you got to be careful


---------120:42----------
about is like some therapists may over


---------120:44----------
pathologize you


---------120:46----------
so they may like think like oh my god


---------120:48----------
like anthony's like such a oh he's like


---------120:50----------
such a poor traumatized little baby and


---------120:52----------
there may be a part of you that really


---------120:53----------
wants that compassion because you


---------120:55----------
deserve it right there's a part of you


---------120:56----------
that it's going to piss you off


---------120:58----------
it would yeah it would it would be very


---------121:00----------
awkward right it would be very like pity


---------121:02----------
is very uncomfortable for me as was


---------121:04----------
compel actually i i don't know the


---------121:06----------
difference between compassion and pity


---------121:07----------
to be honest with you and so i don't


---------121:09----------
feel the difference that you're


---------121:10----------
absolutely right it's very shameful for


---------121:12----------
me to get compassion very shameful yeah


---------121:15----------
so here's the difference so pity


---------121:17----------
oftentimes comes at the cost of respect


---------121:21----------
right so what you really need is a


---------121:23----------
therapist who can recognize that you've


---------121:25----------
had a bunch of [ __ ] happen to you but


---------121:28----------
that you are not like a victim


---------121:30----------
like you are a victim


---------121:32----------
but like


---------121:36----------
let me say it this way you have been


---------121:37----------
victimized but you are not a victim i


---------121:39----------
don't feel like i'm talking to a victim


---------121:41----------
i feel like i'm talking to a survivor


---------121:44----------
and that degree of respect i think is


---------121:46----------
going to be very important to you and


---------121:47----------
you have to be patient with therapists


---------121:49----------
because when they hear about your life


---------121:51----------
what they're going to see is a victim


---------121:53----------
and as you overcome your ego and your


---------121:55----------
rigidity you will allow yourself to


---------121:57----------
become a victim too


---------121:59----------
and you will say actually it's okay for


---------122:01----------
people to pity me it doesn't mean that


---------122:03----------
i'm a weak person


---------122:04----------
but that's


---------122:06----------
that's going to take time my friend


---------122:10----------
and you know i want to thank you for


---------122:11----------
this time dr k you know one of the


---------122:13----------
things i like about you i i just i don't


---------122:15----------
know if i've heard this word before but


---------122:16----------
you don't over pathologize people um


---------122:19----------
i've watched a lot of your previous


---------122:21----------
sessions i really resonated with the


---------122:23----------
gifted group and i hope you get to have


---------122:25----------
a follow-up session with them i thought


---------122:26----------
that was an amazing session i would love


---------122:28----------
to see it again um but


---------122:31----------
as


---------122:31----------
you don't just jump straight to well i


---------122:33----------
see that you're suffering from bipolar


---------122:36----------
you know you know all these


---------122:38----------
self-diagnosis that people lay on


---------122:39----------
themselves that's you don't indulge in


---------122:41----------
any of that you say let's be let's have


---------122:42----------
common sense and here's some very


---------122:44----------
practical you know easily applicable


---------122:47----------
things that you can that you can put


---------122:49----------
into your life and that's what i really


---------122:50----------
like about your style and that's why i


---------122:52----------
wanted to come on here so thank you so


---------122:54----------
much for the experience i really got a


---------122:56----------
lot out of it um


---------122:58----------
i don't know if you ever want to talk


---------122:59----------
again you guys have my contact


---------123:01----------
information sure um but thank you again


---------123:03----------
so much thank you to chat for the


---------123:04----------
support


---------123:05----------
um


---------123:07----------
you you've been awesome it's been a


---------123:08----------
great experience thank you so much yeah


---------123:10----------
thank you so much for coming on anthony


---------123:11----------
thank you for sharing thank you for


---------123:13----------
being authentic


---------123:14----------
and to a certain degree vulnerable


---------123:17----------
i i think um


---------123:19----------
you know i know that there's some mental


---------123:20----------
protections in terms of not seeing us


---------123:22----------
again but i think what you're doing is


---------123:23----------
awesome


---------123:24----------
i think that this is the story that


---------123:26----------
you're sharing is one that not enough


---------123:28----------
people share


---------123:29----------
because the truth is that there are a


---------123:30----------
lot of people out there who are like you


---------123:33----------
and that you know ex-cons are not people


---------123:35----------
that


---------123:36----------
should be relegated to menial labor for


---------123:38----------
the rest of their life


---------123:39----------
you know many of them are talented and


---------123:41----------
gifted and and dormant


---------123:43----------
i'll toss that word out again i think


---------123:45----------
you're just dude you're just like


---------123:47----------
you're just waking up


---------123:49----------
give yourself time but you'll be amazed


---------123:51----------
at what you can accomplish


---------123:52----------
so thanks for coming on and good luck


---------123:55----------
thanks doctor okay you have a great one


---------123:57----------
um just uh


---------123:59----------
i can't teach meditation today because


---------124:01----------
we're about 20 minutes over but


---------124:02----------
otherwise um i would highly recommend i


---------124:05----------
think you should get an access code if


---------124:06----------
you don't have one already just because


---------124:08----------
you're a guest to the stream but i would


---------124:10----------
definitely recommend the meditations in


---------124:12----------
the atman


---------124:14----------
of dr k's guide to mental health


---------124:16----------
um


---------124:18----------
so we'll we'll send you that but uh i'm


---------124:20----------
sorry i can't teach you meditation today


---------124:22----------
just because we're kind of ran over best


---------124:24----------
of luck seriously anthony like i'm


---------124:25----------
rooting for you man appreciate you


---------124:27----------
i appreciate you guys yeah take care


---------124:30----------
thanks you too bye now


---------124:34----------
okay chat we are over time gg


---------124:39----------
oh that was interesting


---------124:41----------
um anthony's fantastic


---------124:44----------
right it's so interesting


---------124:46----------
so here are a couple of takeaways i


---------124:47----------
don't know if y'all if i need to say


---------124:49----------
this but


---------124:51----------
so too often


---------124:52----------
our identities get dominated by


---------124:55----------
particular events in our life right i am


---------124:58----------
a failure versus i fail to test i am a


---------125:01----------
convicted felon versus i committed a


---------125:04----------
felony and you know served a prison


---------125:06----------
sentence


---------125:07----------
and so


---------125:08----------
um


---------125:10----------
and sometimes lsd is amazing


---------125:12----------
so i think i think if we want to talk


---------125:14----------
about lsd for a second i think it just


---------125:16----------
speaks to the the potential therapeutic


---------125:18----------
value of psychedelic substances which


---------125:21----------
are being studied just a reminder i


---------125:23----------
don't know if you all know this but like


---------125:24----------
you know people will have bad outcomes


---------125:26----------
from lsd too people will like develop


---------125:28----------
anxiety and panic attacks and ptsd and


---------125:31----------
all kinds of stuff so i don't recommend


---------125:33----------
that people use it


---------125:35----------
at least until it gets sort of kind of


---------125:36----------
verified through clinical trials we try


---------125:38----------
to stay as evidence-based as we can in


---------125:40----------
terms of our recommendations here


---------125:42----------
but we do also offer a lot of


---------125:44----------
non-evidence-based recommendations to be


---------125:45----------
fair so in terms of lsd you know i'd say


---------125:48----------
be careful


---------125:49----------
but i i think you know for all of y'all


---------125:53----------
the thing that really shocked me about


---------125:54----------
anthony is how relatable he is right


---------125:56----------
because when we think about these labels


---------125:59----------
right someone who like you know


---------126:00----------
committed murder at the age of 16 it


---------126:02----------
sounds like


---------126:03----------
and went to prison for 20 some odd years


---------126:06----------
like we don't think about someone who's


---------126:07----------
so relatable but i think part of why i


---------126:09----------
love doing this work is because we're


---------126:11----------
all human and the experiences that we


---------126:13----------
share are like surprisingly similar


---------126:16----------
and so a lot of the stuff that he's


---------126:18----------
dealing with i think is very common in


---------126:20----------
our community about this whole business


---------126:22----------
of friend zone and being insecure and


---------126:24----------
like doing things for people and then


---------126:25----------
feeling resentful because you've


---------126:27----------
invested so much and they haven't given


---------126:29----------
you anything because you were and then


---------126:31----------
you feel that entitlement and then you


---------126:32----------
start to feel like constantly rejected


---------126:35----------
and and it kind of changes the way that


---------126:36----------
you think so be super careful about your


---------126:39----------
rigid thinking i think part of what


---------126:40----------
holds us back in general is our very


---------126:42----------
rigid thinking and anthony's a smart guy


---------126:45----------
so clearly he's like super high iq is


---------126:47----------
capable of a lot


---------126:49----------
um and and you know he's just


---------126:52----------
another key kind of takeaway is that


---------126:54----------
a lot of what holds us back a lot of


---------126:56----------
like growing and learning is not so much


---------126:59----------
as actually not about learning it's


---------127:00----------
about unlearning


---------127:02----------
that usually what human beings do is


---------127:04----------
we'll develop adaptations to our


---------127:06----------
circumstances and those help us survive


---------127:09----------
particular periods and then growing as a


---------127:11----------
person involves letting go of those


---------127:13----------
adaptations and actually trying


---------127:14----------
something different it's letting go of


---------127:16----------
the strategy that works


---------127:19----------
you know if i kind of think about a


---------127:20----------
video game analogy it's sort of like you


---------127:22----------
can get away with something in like low


---------127:24----------
level games right you can be like a one


---------127:27----------
trick pony and like zerg rush


---------127:29----------
your opponents like six pool people


---------127:31----------
people even know what that means


---------127:33----------
you know you can do like some kind of


---------127:35----------
cheese strat when you're in bronze


---------127:36----------
league but as you ascend through the


---------127:38----------
ranks like you can't keep using that


---------127:41----------
cheese strat over and over and over


---------127:43----------
again you actually have to unlearn


---------127:45----------
things and start to come up with


---------127:47----------
different strategies as you rise through


---------127:49----------
the ranks


---------127:50----------
and so if you feel stuck like i'm


---------127:52----------
concerned that if anthony doesn't


---------127:54----------
unlearn what he's had to


---------127:56----------
learn to survive he will stay stuck


---------127:58----------
right another six years will go by he


---------128:00----------
won't be in a relationship


---------128:02----------
and so if you all are feeling stuck in


---------128:04----------
life it's not so much that you're you


---------128:06----------
know bad at something or you're a


---------128:08----------
failure or you're lazy or dis


---------128:10----------
undisciplined that's all unactionable


---------128:12----------
information so let go of that crap


---------128:14----------
instead what you need to be asking


---------128:16----------
yourself is like how did i learn to do


---------128:18----------
the things that i do


---------128:20----------
you know when did i how did i benefit


---------128:22----------
from playing video games 24 7. and you


---------128:25----------
may say to yourself oh i didn't benefit


---------128:26----------
at all it's all a waste that's when your


---------128:29----------
your thinking needs to be better you


---------128:30----------
need to be a little bit more clinical a


---------128:32----------
little bit more scientific


---------128:33----------
recognize that playing video games all


---------128:35----------
day long protects you from all kinds of


---------128:37----------
stuff


---------128:38----------
you don't have to feel shame while


---------128:39----------
you're playing a game


---------128:41----------
when you have a 60 minute game of dota


---------128:44----------
and you come back at the last second


---------128:45----------
against medi mega creeps


---------128:47----------
you get to feel like the best thing on


---------128:50----------
earth


---------128:51----------
and what else in your life gives you


---------128:53----------
that feeling what else in your life


---------128:54----------
gives you a feeling of absolute triumph


---------128:57----------
and dominance


---------128:58----------
right when you don't have access to


---------129:00----------
those feelings in the rest of your life


---------129:01----------
that's why you play the game


---------129:03----------
it does things for you that you aren't


---------129:05----------
able to do in your regular life so you


---------129:08----------
may think that all of the things that


---------129:10----------
hold you back are negatives which you


---------129:12----------
need to understand is that all of those


---------129:13----------
things are actually positives they're


---------129:16----------
not problems they're solutions


---------129:18----------
and moving forward actually


---------129:21----------
is about undoing solutions that have


---------129:23----------
gotten us to where we are
