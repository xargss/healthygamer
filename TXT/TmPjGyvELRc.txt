is that BPD there there's actually some


---------00:02----------
very interesting data so a lot of people


---------00:05----------
think of BPD is being incurable but


---------00:07----------
there's a there's some really


---------00:08----------
fascinating data that if you can get in


---------00:10----------
a stable relationship for two years and


---------00:13----------
have someone not abandon you then


---------00:16----------
there's a 50% chance your BPD will like


---------00:18----------
actually go away


---------00:27----------
you sound good to me you sound good to


---------00:30----------
me too man good good so how you doing


---------00:35----------
man I actually had a few days where I


---------00:46----------
was helping a friend with depression uh


---------00:50----------
which was kind of therapeutic for me


---------00:53----------
yeah and I kind of I was using some


---------00:56----------
things you taught me and it seems to be


---------01:00----------
working it was nice


---------01:02----------
well hold on can i Hanson about this I


---------01:04----------
mean I want to preserve this person's


---------01:06----------
privacy and everything yeah but I think


---------01:08----------
that's awesome


---------01:09----------
can we talk about that for a second I'm


---------01:11----------
excited sure so tell me tell me a little


---------01:16----------
bit about someone that you know and


---------01:19----------
obviously care about was feeling sad or


---------01:20----------
down or depressed yeah um


---------01:26----------
they're in a spot in life where they


---------01:28----------
don't really know what path they want to


---------01:31----------
go down they have a lot of minor


---------01:34----------
interests but no big overwhelming drive


---------01:39----------
toward one specific thing uh-huh and


---------01:43----------
then I was able to relate to that I was


---------01:45----------
in felt like that before and how good it


---------01:50----------
will feel to find the specific drive or


---------01:53----------
a motivator a dark Dharma you call it


---------01:55----------
right yeah and just trying to search


---------02:00----------
with them for what they could do what


---------02:05----------
what they're passionate about and asking


---------02:06----------
a bunch of questions it was fun for me I


---------02:09----------
was excited to help them find it and we


---------02:13----------
were seeing we seem to be getting


---------02:14----------
somewhere that's awesome man I'm so


---------02:17----------
happy to hear that yeah so here's the


---------02:20----------
thing I don't think you need to like


---------02:21----------
have a degree or be like a licensed


---------02:24----------
professional to like help another human


---------02:26----------
being and I think it's yes I can't see


---------02:29----------
you in discord because you have to turn


---------02:31----------
it off Moebius wait or is it me no maybe


---------02:35----------
it's me hold on you haven't pressed the


---------02:37----------
little camera button tomorrow there we


---------02:39----------
go


---------02:39----------
okay there we go sorry parrot oh good


---------02:42----------
yes so I think that's that's awesome and


---------02:46----------
I'm so happy that you were able to do


---------02:47----------
that for someone yeah yeah I I noticed I


---------02:55----------
very much enjoy trying to help people


---------02:57----------
find something they're passionate about


---------02:59----------
and I took that uh myers-briggs sixteen


---------03:04----------
personality test uh-huh what do you


---------03:07----------
think about that by the way so I think


---------03:09----------
it is a useful tool to help people


---------03:12----------
understand themselves in terms of like


---------03:14----------
what resonates and what doesn't there's


---------03:17----------
a lot of non independent research on


---------03:20----------
myers-briggs so myers-briggs has not


---------03:23----------
been to the best of my knowledge very


---------03:25----------
independently verified I'm so there's a


---------03:29----------
myers-briggs Research Institute and they


---------03:30----------
do a lot of research but I don't think


---------03:33----------
it's been studied as well as something


---------03:35----------
that is like let's say the five factor


---------03:36----------
model which doesn't mean is it isn't


---------03:39----------
useful it just may not be as scientific


---------03:42----------
as people think it is okay interestingly


---------03:45----------
enough myers-briggs is in my opinion


---------03:47----------
based on iron meta which not many people


---------03:51----------
know tell us about that a little


---------03:54----------
so myers-briggs is it was developed by


---------03:56----------
people who are studying Carl Jung so


---------03:59----------
Carl Jung is the one who came up with


---------04:01----------
the term introvert and extrovert I think


---------04:03----------
and so they sort of took some of Carl


---------04:06----------
Jung's teachings and then tried to


---------04:07----------
develop a system of personality


---------04:09----------
assessment based on Jung's


---------04:12----------
work the interesting thing is like


---------04:14----------
Jung's work is heavily influenced by


---------04:16----------
Eastern philosophy and Eastern


---------04:18----------
perspectives on the mind so for example


---------04:21----------
the idea that there are different mental


---------04:23----------
types which is I think myers-briggs has


---------04:26----------
done the best job of sort of sharing


---------04:29----------
this concept with with the West which is


---------04:31----------
that like your mental type is not the


---------04:33----------
same as other people's mental type which


---------04:35----------
is generally like when we think about


---------04:36----------
psychology like if you study a


---------04:37----------
psychology textbook they talk about like


---------04:39----------
things they talk about principles of the


---------04:41----------
mind as if they apply to everyone yes


---------04:43----------
right but myers-briggs says oh there are


---------04:46----------
fundamentally different kinds of minds


---------04:48----------
and that concept I think is different


---------04:51----------
from like it's not actually a Western


---------04:52----------
concept that's actually like a concept


---------04:54----------
that comes from Eastern medicine because


---------04:55----------
Western psychology and science and


---------04:57----------
medicine is about the standardization of


---------05:00----------
all human beings so like when we you


---------05:01----------
learned cardiac physiology a heart is a


---------05:04----------
heart is a heart yeah it's very


---------05:07----------
beneficial to realize that the minds are


---------05:08----------
different so that you can try to when


---------05:11----------
you're communicating with someone you


---------05:12----------
can realize that their perspective is


---------05:16----------
different one than yours that they see


---------05:18----------
the world in another way that even the


---------05:22----------
things they enjoy or care about can be


---------05:26----------
complete opposites or I I hadn't


---------05:34----------
realized that so much I guess I guess


---------05:37----------
that's what I was liking about a friend


---------05:39----------
of mine talking about the myers-briggs


---------05:39----------
yeah yeah and I think just as a


---------05:42----------
practical point so I did a trained a


---------05:45----------
myers-briggs training where we did like


---------05:46----------
a personality assessment through like


---------05:48----------
the official institution as part of my


---------05:51----------
psychiatry training and I thought it was


---------05:53----------
wonderful like there were all kinds of


---------05:55----------
like there was actually a medical doctor


---------05:57----------
who's a myers-briggs trained person who


---------05:59----------
was teaching it so she was explaining to


---------06:01----------
us how a lot of the interactions we have


---------06:03----------
within the field of medicine can be


---------06:05----------
broken down


---------06:05----------
according to myers-briggs personality


---------06:07----------
typing and I actually found it to be


---------06:08----------
quite helpful mm-hmm


---------06:11----------
do you know what you're do you feel


---------06:13----------
comfortable sharing what your type is


---------06:15----------
yeah so I took it a long long time ago


---------06:18----------
and back then I got INTP but then I took


---------06:24----------
it two days ago


---------06:25----------
I had a completely different one so I've


---------06:29----------
changed I guess but I have to look up


---------06:31----------
which one it was ah I watched a YouTube


---------06:33----------
video on what it was afterwards I look


---------06:35----------
at my history did you take the official


---------06:39----------
test or you took like an online version


---------06:43----------
so I took some online version it was


---------06:45----------
pretty long though what's the official


---------06:48----------
one in comparison I mean you have to pay


---------06:50----------
money for the official one usually and


---------06:52----------
how long how many questions is it I


---------06:54----------
don't know I don't remember maybe like


---------06:57----------
150 or something


---------06:58----------
okay um and I'm having trouble finding


---------07:01----------
this I got I got one that when I went on


---------07:06----------
the YouTube video about it it said that


---------07:08----------
this personality type enjoys trying to


---------07:09----------
help people find what they are


---------07:14----------
passionate about


---------07:15----------
yeah Oh II nfj I think that is wildly


---------07:19----------
different from I MTP yeah let me make


---------07:25----------
sure ENFJ oh wait maybe it was ENFP hold


---------07:30----------
on hold on


---------07:31----------
I was watching this video hold on hold


---------07:35----------
on it was this the one yeah okay I think


---------07:44----------
it was ENFP yeah so in the my official


---------07:49----------
myers-briggs test they also give you


---------07:51----------
like what percentage you are so for


---------07:54----------
example like you can be a strong tea or


---------07:56----------
a strong F or you can be kind of in the


---------07:58----------
middle and a couple of other things


---------08:01----------
about myers-briggs typing so you can


---------08:03----------
like fluctuate over time and you can


---------08:05----------
adopt different attitudes in different


---------08:07----------
situations yeah so right now this seemed


---------08:11----------
really fitting for me because it said


---------08:12----------
that I like to start things and inspire


---------08:14----------
people and give broad ideas and then


---------08:17----------
other people will go in and do the


---------08:18----------
specifics which is really accurate for


---------08:20----------
what I'm doing on Everland


---------08:22----------
yeah yeah cool how are you feeling um


---------08:27----------
today yeah so today I haven't taken


---------08:33----------
psilocybin I mean okay if you can tell


---------08:37----------
I'm feeling okay I you know I have my


---------08:39----------
usual low desire I've had some wavering


---------08:45----------
confidence recently it's just coming and


---------08:49----------
going like sometimes there'll be moments


---------08:51----------
where I'm very confident myself and


---------08:52----------
wanting to talk to people


---------08:56----------
I'll be going on a walk outside by the


---------09:01----------
river and I'll i'ma start conversation


---------09:04----------
with with with random people and and in


---------09:07----------
a way that I was never able to do before


---------09:08----------
I'll I used to maybe think oh how would


---------09:14----------
I even talk to someone I'll say hello


---------09:15----------
and then I'll run I have nothing else to


---------09:16----------
say but somehow I'll always think of a


---------09:18----------
topic of something pertaining to exactly


---------09:21----------
what's going on in the situation or I


---------09:23----------
don't know and the conversation just


---------09:24----------
flows and it makes me feel confident


---------09:26----------
good that I can do that yeah but then


---------09:30----------
other days that I feel a low self-esteem


---------09:34----------
scared to look people in the eyes even


---------09:38----------
mm-hmm


---------09:40----------
so it's going back and forth a lot and


---------09:43----------
my how good I'm feeling is a lot has a


---------09:45----------
lot to do with the validation I'm


---------09:46----------
getting from others and I'd love for it


---------09:49----------
to be more independent but if one person


---------09:52----------
finds my one person finds my hmm my


---------10:01----------
conversation or whatever uninteresting


---------10:05----------
or uncomfortable for them it'll affect


---------10:10----------
my mood a lot and I won't be able to


---------10:13----------
focus or feel good about myself yeah


---------10:15----------
okay


---------10:19----------
out of curiosity the first time we


---------10:22----------
talked do you know if you had used


---------10:23----------
psilocybin that day I had but it would


---------10:27----------
have been like five hours before we


---------10:28----------
talked before we began talking so was


---------10:31----------
near the very end okay


---------10:32----------
you know okay how does it feel sorry go


---------10:36----------
ahead


---------10:36----------
yeah go ahead how does it feel to sort


---------10:39----------
of not have control over which reckful


---------10:42----------
shows up well I do have control cuz I


---------10:46----------
can take it or not take it that's in my


---------10:48----------
control right yeah okay so do you feel


---------10:52----------
like the confident reckful shows up when


---------10:53----------
you do take it yeah when I take it


---------10:57----------
consistently


---------10:58----------
everything's consistently better and


---------11:00----------
every single time I'm like maybe I can


---------11:02----------
be interesting without it


---------11:08----------
and maybe maybe I prefer being out


---------11:10----------
without it today what if I decide to


---------11:11----------
take it then I do feel better every


---------11:14----------
single time it hasn't ever happened


---------11:17----------
where I don't um it's interesting so I


---------11:24----------
was I was talking with Gary my brother


---------11:26----------
he said he was watching our talks and um


---------11:32----------
well he was really happy for me anyway


---------11:34----------
that uh I'm feeling better nowadays but


---------11:37----------
he wanted me to mention to you that I've


---------11:40----------
been missing him also in my life because


---------11:44----------
he ran away and went backpacking in


---------11:47----------
South America fifteen years ago and


---------11:49----------
never came back


---------11:51----------
since then he came back he streamed with


---------11:53----------
me like one a couple days like in 2012


---------11:56----------
and uh he came for a few days here and


---------11:58----------
there to the US but he's just been


---------12:00----------
traveling the world and staying in


---------12:02----------
hostels for like 15 years uh and he said


---------12:06----------
he ran away because it was overwhelming


---------12:09----------
for him all the responsibility he had to


---------12:10----------
take on in the family that he felt like


---------12:13----------
he had to be my dad when he was my


---------12:16----------
brother you know I actually wanted to


---------12:18----------
bring him on he said he can't today but


---------12:20----------
next week he said he could come on if we


---------12:22----------
want to talk okay we three yeah maybe


---------12:27----------
that'd be good right yeah absolutely


---------12:29----------
yeah


---------12:30----------
I mean no what do you think what do you


---------12:36----------
think about that reckful about what he


---------12:38----------
did and why do you think it's relevant


---------12:41----------
here well why did he mention it or why


---------12:49----------
do I think it's relevant why do you


---------12:50----------
think it's relevant I think it's


---------12:53----------
relevant because it helps paint a fuller


---------12:56----------
picture of the story of a family and


---------12:59----------
actually his experience was probably a


---------13:01----------
lot harder than mine because he was 16


---------13:05----------
when it happened and it's a more more


---------13:08----------
formative years I guess I I guess so I'm


---------13:12----------
not sure yeah


---------13:15----------
and he suddenly his personality shifted


---------13:18----------
you know 180 degrees when it happened he


---------13:24----------
was texting me talking about how he


---------13:27----------
feels to blame that my brother died and


---------13:30----------
he feels like he knew he was gonna kill


---------13:32----------
himself and that he could have stopped


---------13:35----------
it and he feels like my brother didn't


---------13:38----------
directly tell him but he knew and you


---------13:46----------
know this that when you go down that


---------13:47----------
thought process it's really hard what's


---------13:50----------
hard on that thought process for him


---------13:55----------
it's a field to take the blame on for it


---------13:58----------
that's very hard and I was telling him


---------13:59----------
though that it would have happened


---------14:00----------
regardless if it didn't happen that day


---------14:02----------
cuz I know what it's like to be sad for


---------14:07----------
years and it's just it's really hard to


---------14:10----------
avoid trying to kill yourself at some


---------14:13----------
point yeah now unless he had found a


---------14:16----------
really good therapist or some medication


---------14:21----------
I think he would have happened regard


---------14:23----------
for psilocybin or psilocybin yeah which


---------14:26----------
I that's medication I think yeah but uh


---------14:34----------
or meditation maybe I think the problem


---------14:36----------
with meditation even if it gets you


---------14:38----------
there a really depressed person won't


---------14:42----------
put in the time required that's the


---------14:45----------
problem that completely I believe you


---------14:47----------
fully that it would meditation can get


---------14:50----------
someone there I just don't go anywhere


---------14:53----------
outside out of depression okay but I


---------14:58----------
think it's really hard to get a


---------14:59----------
depressed person to start meditating and


---------15:01----------
stick with it similarly to how I feel


---------15:04----------
it's very hard to get an anxious person


---------15:05----------
to go to therapy because they're too


---------15:09----------
anxious about going I completely agree


---------15:11----------
with you yeah


---------15:14----------
so so I think the the tricky think about


---------15:16----------
meditation is while I you know it is an


---------15:18----------
evidence-based treatment for a lot of


---------15:20----------
mental health issues it requires a lot


---------15:23----------
of I don't think it's a good acute


---------15:26----------
treatment right so when we think about


---------15:28----------
medicine their acute treatments and then


---------15:29----------
they're like non-acute treatments so I


---------15:32----------
think yoga and surgery are both good for


---------15:35----------
your body but if you've been acutely


---------15:38----------
injured in a motor vehicle accident you


---------15:40----------
need surgery not yoga and I think Yoga


---------15:43----------
is good for like you know the healing


---------15:45----------
process and to make sure you maintain


---------15:47----------
mobility and things like that afterward


---------15:49----------
that kind of think about meditation the


---------15:50----------
same way so I actually dislike it


---------15:53----------
sometimes when some people come to me


---------15:55----------
and they say I'm super super depressed I


---------15:56----------
don't want medication I don't just want


---------15:58----------
to meditate my way through it and I'm


---------16:00----------
happy to have them try that but I think


---------16:03----------
that science has given us a lot of tools


---------16:05----------
including you know psychoactive


---------16:08----------
compounds like medications and then if


---------16:10----------
you know things go I mean I just saw a


---------16:14----------
couple of other things about FDA


---------16:15----------
fast-tracking MDMA and other of these


---------16:18----------
psychoactive compounds because I do


---------16:20----------
think that they're therapeutic yeah what


---------16:23----------
kind of is it okay but can I push you


---------16:24----------
right into the experience they well at


---------16:28----------
least they open a door for you and it's


---------16:30----------
really easy to go in that door I heard


---------16:34----------
it MDMA helps with PTSD I think we


---------16:36----------
talked about that a little bit so


---------16:38----------
reckful if we were to just think a


---------16:40----------
little bit about what direction you want


---------16:41----------
to go so you've feel like we have a


---------16:43----------
couple of open doors that we can explore


---------16:45----------
one is that you know if you want to


---------16:47----------
continue talking about psilocybin and


---------16:50----------
how it makes you feel and when you use


---------16:51----------
it and when you don't we can talk about


---------16:55----------
Gary and what it was like you were sort


---------16:58----------
of putting yourself in his shoes a


---------16:59----------
little bit and sort of imagining what it


---------17:01----------
was like for him and we can continue to


---------17:04----------
explore that or we can talk about what


---------17:06----------
it was like for you to have Gary leave


---------17:08----------
and I mean I think all three of those


---------17:11----------
are good what do you think we should


---------17:13----------
spend our time on today it's interesting


---------17:16----------
today all of those sounds scary to


---------17:18----------
explore maybe it's because I'm not on so


---------17:21----------
Simon but I just I


---------17:22----------
think about it and it sounds like a


---------17:24----------
daunting task to go down any of those


---------17:26----------
paths okay um I don't know which one we


---------17:30----------
should go down I prefer so josy okay


---------17:33----------
sure so III am gonna actually offer


---------17:36----------
number four so how do you face life when


---------17:39----------
life gives you daunting tasks mmm right


---------17:43----------
so like let's not go down let's not


---------17:45----------
force ourselves through any one of those


---------17:47----------
roads and let's try to find you where


---------17:48----------
you are because I'm glad I'm glad I'm so


---------17:51----------
glad you said that reckful because I


---------17:53----------
think a lot of the challenge like you


---------17:54----------
said like it's hard to meditate when


---------17:55----------
you're feeling a certain way and the way


---------17:57----------
that you're feeling instead of just


---------17:59----------
pushing you down a path because it's


---------18:00----------
quote-unquote good for you or you know


---------18:03----------
helps you understand things or whatever


---------18:04----------
let's try to meet you where you are and


---------18:07----------
talk about what is it what does it feel


---------18:09----------
like


---------18:09----------
I like this oppressor to live where you


---------18:12----------
are right now yeah what is it like when


---------18:16----------
when you have a choice in life to take


---------18:20----------
some some substance and then for things


---------18:22----------
to no longer be as daunting and then to


---------18:25----------
like not take that substance some days


---------18:27----------
and then like life feels daunting like


---------18:29----------
that sounds terrifying to me maybe a bit


---------18:35----------
it's more terrifying to not have the


---------18:38----------
option to take anything because then


---------18:40----------
you're hopeless okay but I I agree with


---------18:48----------
you that most people wouldn't like the


---------18:50----------
feeling of reliance on anything like


---------18:52----------
that I also get often get the feeling of


---------18:55----------
reliance on other people yeah I do well


---------18:58----------
alone and I'll be very overbearing for


---------19:02----------
people sometimes because sometimes I


---------19:04----------
feel like I just need someone to talk to


---------19:06----------
I can't be in my thoughts like I'm yeah


---------19:09----------
losing my mind in my room I just can't


---------19:12----------
handle it so I'll just message someone


---------19:14----------
and


---------19:16----------
they won't respond and I'll message them


---------19:18----------
again and I'll have this huge wall of


---------19:20----------
text and then they'll be like oh this


---------19:23----------
person is just too much for me even if


---------19:25----------
it's a long term friends might hang on


---------19:26----------
for like seven years yeah this big and


---------19:29----------
then they'll notice they'll start


---------19:30----------
talking to me less and less because of


---------19:31----------
these situations where I was overbearing


---------19:34----------
or just needed them at the specific time


---------19:36----------
and tried to push them to go outside


---------19:39----------
with me or you know spontaneously I


---------19:42----------
always want to do these spontaneous


---------19:43----------
things and people most people like to


---------19:46----------
plan more I've always had trouble


---------19:48----------
planning I I never bought a round-trip


---------19:51----------
plane ticket yeah what what is it what


---------19:57----------
is it within you that what are you


---------19:59----------
hungry for in those moments where you


---------20:01----------
need someone else connection I really


---------20:05----------
want I want to hear someone relating to


---------20:08----------
me in some way well I think I do but


---------20:12----------
then if I actually reach out to someone


---------20:13----------
very depressed then we bounce off back


---------20:15----------
and forth about how much life sucks and


---------20:17----------
it just gets darker at darker so and


---------20:20----------
then if I reach out to someone happy I


---------20:22----------
can't relate to them hmm sounds like


---------20:25----------
you're damned if you do damned if you


---------20:27----------
don't


---------20:27----------
yeah so so it looks like you're looking


---------20:32----------
for something but I mean are there


---------20:33----------
people that you can connect with that


---------20:35----------
sort of have the balance that makes you


---------20:36----------
feel better once in a while and it's


---------20:39----------
really incredible when I find that and


---------20:41----------
those people means so much to me I'm so


---------20:45----------
scared for them to disappear because


---------20:48----------
though there'll be people who have been


---------20:50----------
there but are currently okay and I think


---------20:53----------
those are the ones when I talk to them


---------20:55----------
they can relate but they can also be


---------20:59----------
optimists yep yep yeah I think that's a


---------21:02----------
really important realization so I'm


---------21:04----------
gonna just repeat back some words at you


---------21:06----------
and so it sounds like you're looking for


---------21:09----------
connection yes right and that you're


---------21:13----------
looking for a particular kind of


---------21:15----------
connection someone who understands where


---------21:17----------
you are but at the same time isn't where


---------21:20----------
you are yes and when you find someone


---------21:23----------
like that you feel


---------21:26----------
some think within you feels really good


---------21:29----------
so what how do we describe the way you


---------21:30----------
feel when you find someone like that I


---------21:33----------
want to find someone like that oh well I


---------21:47----------
feels I guess I was smiling just


---------21:52----------
thinking about it I III think I'm


---------21:57----------
looking a little bit for family in my


---------22:00----------
friendships and it feels like I have a


---------22:04----------
family member at that moment have you


---------22:13----------
thought about that before no that was


---------22:16----------
just now I go ahead yeah I mean I'm


---------22:26----------
surprised that you got there that quick


---------22:28----------
I think you're learning fast yeah I


---------22:32----------
wonder if I can process these thoughts


---------22:34----------
better sober


---------22:36----------
I feel so there's this disconnect that


---------22:40----------
I'm not interested in my own thoughts


---------22:43----------
right now you know cuz I'm have no


---------22:45----------
desires because that's how I am and I


---------22:49----------
but I assume that if I'm on psilocybin


---------22:52----------
since I'm having more fun since I'm


---------22:57----------
getting provoked but thought that my own


---------22:59----------
thoughts are stimulating my my mind that


---------23:04----------
everyone else is more interested in what


---------23:06----------
I'm saying as well which isn't exactly


---------23:08----------
always true I can't tell because I'm


---------23:11----------
locked in my experience and if my


---------23:13----------
experience is better I assume other


---------23:14----------
people's experiences better usually as a


---------23:16----------
streamer that is the case if I'm


---------23:18----------
laughing other people are laughing it's


---------23:21----------
been true but there have been a couple


---------23:22----------
times I've been really happy and there


---------23:23----------
was this really strong disconnect with


---------23:25----------
my chat they would we're not enjoying


---------23:28----------
yeah me and not


---------23:33----------
that doesn't seem like a profound


---------23:34----------
realization but it was anyway I can't


---------23:37----------
tell right now if I am thinking or


---------23:40----------
getting to the correct conclusions


---------23:43----------
quickly or more slowly than usual I feel


---------23:49----------
like I'm talking slowly right now you


---------23:51----------
are talking slowly you're saying I'm


---------23:53----------
less animated so there's also another


---------23:55----------
layer of something going on is like when


---------23:57----------
we're talking about you and suddenly you


---------23:59----------
start talking about your interactions


---------24:00----------
with your viewers mm-hmm right so the so


---------24:05----------
this we have to be careful about because


---------24:06----------
how much of the person that you try to


---------24:09----------
be is about being you and how much about


---------24:12----------
it is like being what your viewers want


---------24:17----------
um well I've had a moral in my head


---------24:21----------
since I started streaming and I guess


---------24:23----------
since I've started living really said I


---------24:26----------
always want to be true to myself I want


---------24:29----------
to yeah it's one of my favorite ones


---------24:32----------
because the because is a


---------24:39----------
harder to define I've always noticed


---------24:41----------
myself getting annoyed with other people


---------24:43----------
who are putting up facade mm-hmm an


---------24:48----------
alternate persona I also think it's


---------24:53----------
damaging to society in general for


---------24:57----------
anyone to be pretending to be happy when


---------25:00----------
they're not actually sharing your pain


---------25:05----------
helps others relate if people are just


---------25:10----------
watching happy people all the time


---------25:12----------
they wonder what's wrong with me you


---------25:13----------
know I think that adapt slates a lot of


---------25:17----------
what's the damage of social media yeah I


---------25:21----------
agree and even on get on social media


---------25:25----------
even I'm guilty of it because I don't


---------25:26----------
feel like tweeting hey I want to die


---------25:32----------
right now doesn't really don't really


---------25:36----------
tweet that but I


---------25:38----------
if I'm having a good thought a happy


---------25:40----------
thought I'll tweet that if I'm a live


---------25:42----------
streaming I'll share the negative and


---------25:43----------
the positive but on social media you


---------25:46----------
tend not to out of curiosity if you


---------25:48----------
tweet I feel like dying right now and


---------25:51----------
you get a bunch of likes for that what


---------25:54----------
does it like mean yeah does that mean we


---------25:59----------
love you and please don't hurt yourself


---------26:01----------
or does it mean I don't know we can


---------26:03----------
obviously it's like so good music I


---------26:05----------
don't even know what that means like I


---------26:06----------
wouldn't know how to interpret that I


---------26:08----------
think all the UH I think all the


---------26:12----------
employees of Everland would be a little


---------26:14----------
worried about their job not good for me


---------26:19----------
or for anyone else


---------26:21----------
so reckful is it okay if I kind of go


---------26:24----------
back to sort of you and and the way that


---------26:27----------
you experience things and take a step


---------26:29----------
back a little bit from some of this


---------26:30----------
social commentary sure so this all


---------26:34----------
started with a question that I asked you


---------26:37----------
about you know what does it feel like


---------26:38----------
when you find that connection and then


---------26:40----------
you paused and you were thinking for a


---------26:42----------
little bit and that he said you know


---------26:46----------
took the words out of my mouth and you


---------26:48----------
said it feels like I'm trying to replace


---------26:50----------
family with friends and then we went off


---------26:54----------
on this track of sort of like I don't


---------26:56----------
know if if you know I I don't know if I


---------27:02----------
understand things better or worse when


---------27:04----------
I'm on on psilocybin or you know and so


---------27:08----------
you kind of went off on that tangent and


---------27:09----------
we can explore that too about like you


---------27:11----------
know what is the nature of your


---------27:12----------
understanding that you gained what does


---------27:14----------
it feel like one of the advantages and


---------27:16----------
disadvantages of being able to swim in


---------27:18----------
both worlds or should we just pick one


---------27:19----------
or the other but if it's okay with you


---------27:23----------
we can run with this thread of


---------27:24----------
connecting with another human being


---------27:26----------
because I think there's more there sure


---------27:28----------
so can you help us understand what you


---------27:33----------
meant when you were a fivehead or six


---------27:35----------
head and you said I feel like I'm trying


---------27:37----------
to replace I mean I feel like I'm trying


---------27:39----------
to I'm treating my friends like family


---------27:43----------
or something yeah so how did you get to


---------27:47----------
that conclusion


---------27:49----------
well it crossed my mind this feeling I


---------27:53----------
had when I was five years old and came


---------27:55----------
home and saw laughing and smiling faces


---------27:59----------
it on the couch something I never saw


---------28:05----------
again after I was six


---------28:07----------
um I've been thinking about that a lot


---------28:11----------
recently


---------28:13----------
ever since we started talking and I


---------28:17----------
realized that to come back to bring that


---------28:22----------
back and a couple times I've I tried to


---------28:25----------
facilitate situations with friends where


---------28:30----------
this would happen and I lived with a


---------28:32----------
bunch of friends and I like a gamer


---------28:35----------
house and I'd want to come home and see


---------28:39----------
a couple friends around the couch


---------28:41----------
yeah sometimes we'd be playing Mario or


---------28:44----------
something and coming home to that gave


---------28:48----------
me some deep satisfaction that I needed


---------28:54----------
um I guess from my childhood but maybe


---------28:59----------
not just from my childhood I mean people


---------29:01----------
needed as adults to even if they had


---------29:03----------
even so high so what is that


---------29:05----------
satisfaction that you're looking for


---------29:06----------
what is that feeling that you're like


---------29:08----------
when you connect with someone and they


---------29:09----------
understand you just


---------29:17----------
I can feel what it is right now but I


---------29:20----------
can't describe it


---------29:22----------
my right way knows what is it what does


---------29:25----------
it feel like in your body it's that


---------29:36----------
feeling where you when you really want a


---------29:37----------
hug don't know how else to describe it


---------29:43----------
yeah a what I'm seeing in your face is


---------29:51----------
an aching loneliness just an abject


---------29:57----------
sense of just being yeah in it it like


---------30:09----------
hurts right it's like not just being


---------30:11----------
lonely like lonely doesn't describe it


---------30:13----------
it's like hurts it feels like


---------30:20----------
something's missing and the only thing


---------30:22----------
that can like you need someone else to


---------30:25----------
fill that in because you've tried for a


---------30:28----------
long time to like fill it yourself and


---------30:30----------
you just can't yeah


---------30:33----------
but they keep it keeps happening where


---------30:37----------
the people I'm trying to fill it in with


---------30:40----------
think I'm crazy ya know cuz they're not


---------30:43----------
as needy as I am for soon now there's a


---------30:47----------
whole other layer to this you need a


---------30:50----------
minute or can we keep going no we can


---------30:52----------
keep going so I think there's there two


---------30:54----------
fears here one is like the feeling of


---------30:57----------
aching and loneliness and the second is


---------30:59----------
when you find those people the fear that


---------31:02----------
they're going to leave to that you're


---------31:04----------
gonna do something and then they're


---------31:06----------
gonna stop returning your to me do ya so


---------31:10----------
it's not an irrational fear right so


---------31:12----------
what do we call that


---------31:16----------
hmm what do we consider when you're


---------31:19----------
afraid of someone leaving


---------31:23----------
and then you call it fear of abandonment


---------31:26----------
yeah yeah and in your case reckful this


---------31:33----------
is this needs to be understood very


---------31:34----------
clearly so some people when they


---------31:37----------
recognize those things within themselves


---------31:39----------
they blame themselves right they say I


---------31:42----------
shouldn't feel this way or this is


---------31:44----------
weakness or I should be able to be


---------31:45----------
independent do you have those thoughts I


---------31:48----------
used to because everyone I talk to would


---------31:50----------
tell me oh I don't know why you're in a


---------31:56----------
relationship when you can't even be


---------31:58----------
happy alone or you know that's a very


---------32:00----------
common line I hear and I would say well


---------32:04----------
if I wasn't in the relationship I'd want


---------32:08----------
to die okay obviously not a healthy so


---------32:15----------
it would I'm gonna ask you a couple of


---------32:18----------
questions okay now if I if you have


---------32:23----------
someone who's lonely or not even lonely


---------32:27----------
how does someone get comfortable how can


---------32:31----------
I say this how does someone get


---------32:33----------
comfortable with being alone like what


---------32:36----------
has to happen for them to feel


---------32:38----------
comfortable with like separation from


---------32:40----------
other human beings and this may be a


---------32:44----------
little bit of a reading my mind


---------32:45----------
questions so sorry I don't know how to


---------32:47----------
answer ask it well well I mean that void


---------32:50----------
that you're talking about needs to be


---------32:51----------
filled but I don't know how to fill it i


---------32:55----------
if I had a family maybe it would be okay


---------33:02----------
but in my situation what can I do know


---------33:06----------
your situation what you can do now oddly


---------33:09----------
enough I I think you're on on the right


---------33:10----------
track and I want to stop there because I


---------33:11----------
want to talk about someone else let's


---------33:13----------
talk about someone besides you right if


---------33:15----------
you have a person who feels lonely and


---------33:17----------
feels like they have a void within them


---------33:19----------
what is the solution because there's a


---------33:22----------
there's all that there's the camp of


---------33:23----------
people who says why are you in a


---------33:25----------
relationship if you can't be happy by


---------33:26----------
yourself right they're saying like okay


---------33:28----------
the first thing you need to do is fill


---------33:29----------
that void and then you can be with


---------33:31----------
someone in a healthy and productive way


---------33:33----------
does that make sense yeah that's what


---------33:36----------
they say that's what they say right but


---------33:38----------
let's just think about that for a second


---------33:39----------
is that actually correct because if you


---------33:42----------
have that void within you and you feel


---------33:44----------
loneliness within you if you're afraid


---------33:45----------
of abandonment how do you get someone to


---------33:48----------
stop fearing abandonment


---------33:54----------
you don't abandon them absolutely so


---------33:59----------
this needs to be understood reckful you


---------34:02----------
cannot fix this for yourself that's a


---------34:07----------
bit scary yeah right so it's not that


---------34:11----------
the relationship has to happen after you


---------34:17----------
fix this for yourself or I mean maybe


---------34:19----------
you can't fix it for yourself maybe


---------34:20----------
that's unfair for me to say it's kind of


---------34:21----------
like a blanket statement so I think


---------34:23----------
maybe you can generally what you've seen


---------34:25----------
generally when I think about people who


---------34:28----------
have been abandoned


---------34:30----------
they fear abandonment and that's what


---------34:33----------
happened to you right like cuz


---------34:34----------
apparently you weren't abandoned by just


---------34:37----------
one brother Yeah right how old are you


---------34:44----------
now thirty okay so when you were fifteen


---------34:48----------
one brother left when you were six one


---------34:52----------
and the other brother left when you were


---------34:54----------
fifteen yeah yeah


---------34:57----------
and that's hard right and so like this


---------35:01----------
is this is like so I mean I don't wasn't


---------35:05----------
like it wasn't just like he left for a


---------35:06----------
job or you know to school it was he left


---------35:11----------
the country and never came back


---------35:13----------
yeah so if he left for like college or a


---------35:16----------
job like that I don't think is the same


---------35:18----------
as like he just ya up it like straight


---------35:21----------
up left yeah cuz when he had left for


---------35:24----------
college it was okay we would come back


---------35:26----------
some weekends and we would play Final


---------35:31----------
Fantasy so don't take turns sir


---------35:34----------
some things like that yeah yeah order


---------35:37----------
Chinese food I remember yeah and and I


---------35:41----------
mean it was bad enough without one and I


---------35:43----------
think you were maybe getting your sea


---------35:44----------
legs under you and then like round two


---------35:46----------
hits and and then what happens is you


---------35:50----------
have this thing that's that's afraid


---------35:51----------
that other people are gonna leave you


---------35:53----------
and I think the problem is that you're


---------35:54----------
smart and and something probably very


---------35:57----------
vicious happens and I can a


---------35:59----------
self-fulfilling prophecy that absolutely


---------36:01----------
they're gonna leave me then they will


---------36:03----------
leave me because I'll be overbearing in


---------36:05----------
the capsule and you can see it happening


---------36:07----------
and it terrifies you because you can't


---------36:08----------
stop it and you know what's gonna happen


---------36:10----------
yeah and each time it happens it's


---------36:13----------
another abandonment another abandonment


---------36:15----------
another abandonment yeah yeah I've had


---------36:19----------
about there been a like three or four


---------36:26----------
people just in the last few months that


---------36:27----------
I've started to talk to you regularly


---------36:30----------
and then I was quickly too much they


---------36:33----------
liked me at first my company and then I


---------36:36----------
was quickly too needy or too much for


---------36:38----------
them and they started feeling like they


---------36:43----------
should ignore me which is doesn't even


---------36:45----------
feel unreasonable I can't no matter so


---------36:50----------
what it comes down to so I'm gonna share


---------36:51----------
a little bit of data okay I want to be


---------36:53----------
very clear about this I'm gonna talk to


---------36:55----------
you about something called borderline


---------36:56----------
personality disorder I don't think you


---------36:58----------
have this by the way and it's really


---------37:00----------
okay a lot of people think I do have


---------37:02----------
that maybe you do I don't know so I


---------37:04----------
don't have enough time I don't know so


---------37:07----------
I'm gonna just talk a little bit about


---------37:08----------
borderline personality disorder because


---------37:10----------
I think that there's some features of it


---------37:11----------
which are irrelevant yeah and also like


---------37:15----------
some very interesting data that some


---------37:17----------
people don't know so the first is that


---------37:19----------
borderline personality disorder a lot of


---------37:20----------
times these people have a fear of


---------37:22----------
abandonment and so they do get overly


---------37:25----------
clingy and as they get overly clingy


---------37:28----------
they sort of like force people away and


---------37:30----------
then it kind of like reinforces their


---------37:32----------
fear that like they're unlovable yeah


---------37:35----------
and then that sort of and each round


---------37:38----------
makes it worse because once you do to


---------37:40----------
the first person your sense of being


---------37:42----------
unlovable increases and then when you


---------37:44----------
interact with the next human being like


---------37:46----------
that


---------37:47----------
that wolf has become hungrier and so


---------37:50----------
when when they sort of treat you well


---------37:51----------
they feel really good about themselves


---------37:53----------
and when the person starts to I kind of


---------37:54----------
slip away it gets like stronger and


---------37:57----------
stronger and stronger and each round is


---------37:58----------
like a becomes as you put it a


---------38:00----------
self-fulfilling prophecy and makes it


---------38:02----------
harder mm-hmm now what many people don't


---------38:04----------
know about BPD is that BPD there there's


---------38:08----------
actually some very interesting data so a


---------38:10----------
lot of people think of BPD is being


---------38:12----------
incurable but there's a there's some


---------38:14----------
really fascinating data that if you can


---------38:16----------
get in a stable relationship for two


---------38:18----------
years and have someone not abandon you


---------38:21----------
then there's a 50% chance your BPD will


---------38:24----------
like actually go away so it's really


---------38:27----------
fascinating and I think the opposite of


---------38:30----------
you shouldn't get in a relationship


---------38:31----------
until you're yeah so a lot of people


---------38:34----------
struggle with BPD but it's it's a really


---------38:36----------
fascinating little snippet of research


---------38:38----------
which I don't think is like well


---------38:39----------
understood by many people disputed by


---------38:42----------
many people but the truth is that the


---------38:44----------
majority of people who have BPD never


---------38:45----------
see a psychiatrist they just live their


---------38:47----------
lives and then some people were they're


---------38:49----------
just like kind of crazy until like their


---------38:51----------
30s in their second marriage and they


---------38:53----------
find someone who's like stable enough to


---------38:55----------
like not abandon them and also deal with


---------38:57----------
their like neediness and then like over


---------39:01----------
time they get better because they start


---------39:03----------
to like recognize oh this person


---------39:05----------
actually isn't gonna leave and then like


---------39:07----------
if you realize that someone isn't gonna


---------39:09----------
leave you then what does that do to like


---------39:12----------
the hungry like that aching loneliness


---------39:14----------
inside I I heard you but your camera


---------39:19----------
froze oh [ __ ] sorry yeah this is


---------39:21----------
freezing but okay what the last couple


---------39:24----------
words went a little robot so so what


---------39:27----------
what was the aching loneliness inside


---------39:30----------
you if someone doesn't leave you and you


---------39:32----------
have faith and confidence in that I


---------39:36----------
become more stable and go through my


---------39:41----------
days feeling


---------39:44----------
like my presence was desired I'd be able


---------39:48----------
to go in my room alone and work on


---------39:50----------
something and not feel like I needed to


---------39:55----------
be near someone at that moment because I


---------39:58----------
know they'd be there for me later


---------39:59----------
exactly that's the key thing right you


---------40:03----------
know they're gonna be here for you later


---------40:05----------
and the problem right now is when you


---------40:07----------
start texting people a little bit much


---------40:10----------
and they can't handle it you don't know


---------40:12----------
that they're gonna be here therefore you


---------40:14----------
don't yeah and that's what terrifies you


---------40:17----------
so the other way so like even if you


---------40:19----------
dispute the research on BPD and I don't


---------40:21----------
know if you have BPD or you don't have


---------40:23----------
BPD but think about it this way if a


---------40:26----------
child feels insecure about like being


---------40:31----------
abandoned like what do you do like when


---------40:33----------
a kid probably hug them a lot and you


---------40:38----------
spend time with them yeah absolutely


---------40:41----------
right so like I'll share a little bit


---------40:43----------
for my personal life so when I had my


---------40:45----------
second kid my first kid was like really


---------40:49----------
confused and she was like super super


---------40:51----------
clingy to me because she didn't


---------40:52----------
understand what was happening so like I


---------40:54----------
went to the hospital with my wife and we


---------40:56----------
were like at the hospital and and my


---------40:58----------
in-laws so her grandparents were staying


---------41:01----------
with her they did an awesome job and she


---------41:02----------
likes them but she was two years old and


---------41:04----------
she literally did not understand what


---------41:06----------
was going on she did not understand like


---------41:08----------
why my wife and I would not come home


---------41:10----------
yeah and she would come and see us every


---------41:14----------
day in the hospital and she would be


---------41:16----------
like excited when she saw us and she


---------41:17----------
would actually be okay leaving because


---------41:19----------
she's like a pretty you know confident


---------41:21----------
sort of loving kid but she just did not


---------41:24----------
understand like why mommy and daddy were


---------41:26----------
like not coming back and so she got


---------41:29----------
super super clingy for about a year and


---------41:32----------
that was like doubly so because


---------41:33----------
especially towards the end of my wife's


---------41:36----------
pregnancy she used to do some things


---------41:38----------
like she would Bollywood dance with my


---------41:39----------
two-year-old but as she was like eight


---------41:41----------
and nine months pregnant she like can't


---------41:43----------
like she can't pick her up and throw her


---------41:44----------
in the air and things like that and so


---------41:46----------
the tumor was already like noticing that


---------41:48----------
something is different


---------41:49----------
and then she liked what it was attached


---------41:52----------
to me at the hip even at that age


---------41:54----------
there's that perceptive huh


---------41:55----------
that perceptive yeah right


---------41:59----------
so then then for like for a period of


---------42:02----------
about a year and she didn't understand


---------42:04----------
cuz like my wife would have to feed the


---------42:06----------
newborn right so she was like tired all


---------42:08----------
day and things like that


---------42:09----------
she couldn't be like the person that


---------42:11----------
that my two-year-old had come to know


---------42:13----------
and love and expect the level of


---------42:16----------
attention she had come to expect who had


---------42:18----------
diminished yeah and so she did not feel


---------42:22----------
good in herself right the two-year-old


---------42:24----------
just didn't because she didn't


---------42:26----------
understand why these people are not


---------42:28----------
doing the things like is something wrong


---------42:29----------
with me she didn't understand why they


---------42:32----------
went away because when you're - or


---------42:36----------
because when you're five and someone


---------42:37----------
goes away like you don't understand why


---------42:39----------
they did that you don't have the


---------42:40----------
capacity to understand that they did


---------42:42----------
that because of them and not because of


---------42:44----------
you yeah I still never believed that


---------42:49----------
sentence yep right because like you you


---------42:55----------
can't believe it because you didn't have


---------42:57----------
the capacity believe it and that thing


---------42:59----------
still exists within you and so what did


---------43:03----------
she need to get out of it so she's -


---------43:06----------
it's not that complicated


---------43:08----------
right she needed 50% sorry a third of


---------43:12----------
her life to have someone who did not


---------43:15----------
like abandon her in a very like


---------43:16----------
intentional way so my wife and I we had


---------43:21----------
this like conversation when she was like


---------43:22----------
you know we had these several


---------43:23----------
conversations that like okay your bond


---------43:26----------
with the new kid is not the same as your


---------43:28----------
bond with the old kid because you're


---------43:29----------
spending all the time with Vee Revere's


---------43:31----------
our older daughter our younger


---------43:34----------
daughter's name is avi and so she was


---------43:36----------
like saying that like you know you're


---------43:37----------
not spending time with avi the way that


---------43:39----------
you used to spend time with Viren and we


---------43:41----------
would kind of like talk about it and


---------43:42----------
it's like well yeah that's because like


---------43:43----------
Veera needs me more and so we're really


---------43:45----------
concerned about sort of playing


---------43:46----------
favorites and stuff but I think in her


---------43:48----------
case it all Kurt huh that's tough I


---------43:51----------
haven't thought about the intricacies of


---------43:53----------
having multiple children and how you


---------43:57----------
want it to be balanced where you give


---------43:58----------
them both equal time but what if one of


---------44:00----------
them needs you more you


---------44:02----------
cuz they're yeah like this yeah then


---------44:07----------
then then you start to give one more


---------44:08----------
attention than the other one might be


---------44:11----------
subtly losing confidence or yeah that's


---------44:16----------
tough I wouldn't know what to do there's


---------44:18----------
no obvious logical solution well I mean


---------44:22----------
so when you talk to people I think


---------44:24----------
they're they're solutions that seem that


---------44:26----------
are simpler that tend to do the trick so


---------44:29----------
for example like we made it a point to


---------44:30----------
do like one-on-one time like each of us


---------44:32----------
would swap traditional things so like


---------44:34----------
for example my wife would usually give


---------44:36----------
veera bath and then I'd say like okay


---------44:39----------
for this month I'm gonna give her a bath


---------44:40----------
instead of you let's just swap the


---------44:43----------
things that we do so they're a couple of


---------44:44----------
actually pretty easy like low-hanging


---------44:46----------
fruit turns out to be because it's


---------44:48----------
something it's not exactly balanced yeah


---------44:50----------
it's Joe yeah like some one-on-one time


---------44:53----------
consistently but the point here reckful


---------44:55----------
is I think like your solution is not


---------44:57----------
that like you need to learn how to be


---------44:59----------
independent I think like I don't know if


---------45:01----------
I'm painting this picture for you


---------45:02----------
appropriately but like what do you think


---------45:04----------
needs so like what what did we manage to


---------45:06----------
do for our two-year-old that never


---------45:07----------
happened for you gave that gave you gave


---------45:13----------
the two-year-old enough attention


---------45:14----------
absolutely yeah and I think that's what


---------45:18----------
you need you need you need someone in


---------45:20----------
your life who's not going to turn away


---------45:21----------
for a period of at least two years and


---------45:24----------
you may be terrified that they'll turn


---------45:26----------
away at two point five right I might


---------45:30----------
never get it yeah I mean there's no


---------45:32----------
guarantee I will but I look for it him


---------45:35----------
yeah so sure there is I would not say so


---------45:40----------
I there's only one I've gotten some


---------45:45----------
really unhealthy situations because I'm


---------45:47----------
so desperate for human interaction that


---------45:52----------
I'll have you know paid people's rent


---------45:54----------
just so they'd be my roommate said have


---------45:57----------
someone around you know done it a few


---------46:00----------
times just a lot of dumb things like


---------46:04----------
that or try to get them to quit their


---------46:06----------
jobs and I give them a new job that


---------46:09----------
requires less time so I could have a


---------46:13----------
friend


---------46:14----------
and obviously I've realized that these


---------46:15----------
things are unhealthy but I was just in


---------46:19----------
desperate situations where I needed


---------46:21----------
human interaction so reckful I am


---------46:24----------
confident and okay


---------46:26----------
I'm confident there's gonna be someone


---------46:28----------
around in your life who will be there


---------46:31----------
for you most of the time when you need


---------46:33----------
them hopefully for at least a period of


---------46:35----------
two years okay how can I be confident in


---------46:42----------
that how can you be confident yeah well


---------46:47----------
you probably you find me stimulating I


---------46:51----------
talk too and I'm not demanding too much


---------46:53----------
of your time or spamming you with walls


---------46:56----------
of text and even if I were you'd feel


---------47:03----------
inclined to answer me because it's you


---------47:05----------
you love helping people it's it's your


---------47:08----------
passion so from your perspective maybe


---------47:13----------
you can feel confident but then if you


---------47:15----------
put yourself in the shoes of any other


---------47:18----------
human being I don't know that they'll


---------47:20----------
really spend two years with me unless


---------47:22----------
there's it's erect well I'm not I'm not


---------47:25----------
counting on them to spend two years with


---------47:27----------
you what are you counting on I'm


---------47:30----------
counting on myself see oh there you'll


---------47:33----------
spend two years with me hey yeah that I


---------47:36----------
believe that I can believe yeah so I


---------47:39----------
can't trust any of them true so I'm


---------47:43----------
gonna come to you every week like this


---------47:45----------
I'm gonna try to love you for two years


---------47:52----------
[Music]


---------47:59----------
so this is a the other thing is that I


---------48:03----------
do helping people but I also like


---------48:06----------
helping you and I want you to understand


---------48:09----------
this reckful this isn't I'm not even


---------48:11----------
helping you like this isn't help I don't


---------48:13----------
like the phrase health help implies like


---------48:17----------
charity right it implies that you have


---------48:19----------
something and that you have nothing and


---------48:22----------
I have something and I'm like helping


---------48:23----------
you I'm not helping you this is just me


---------48:25----------
being human and you being human


---------48:26----------
I don't know if that makes any sense I


---------48:32----------
think it's one of the hinged by human


---------48:35----------
it's just like it were just being


---------48:38----------
awesome an it's not something fancy


---------48:40----------
you're doing what you enjoy


---------48:42----------
it's not about a joy it's I'm being who


---------48:44----------
I am and you are being who you are and


---------48:46----------
that's the most that we can expect of


---------48:48----------
ourselves yeah I I want to say that I


---------48:57----------
fully understand but I don't yeah and if


---------49:05----------
you do spare me with walls of text I'll


---------49:07----------
get back to you as soon as I can


---------49:08----------
no actually I like this this is good


---------49:11----------
practice that I have to wait the week


---------49:13----------
yeah because that's what other people


---------49:16----------
want me to do


---------49:17----------
they want me to plan ahead and wait to


---------49:21----------
see them when they have time and not be


---------49:23----------
like oh I need hang up right now I need


---------49:25----------
you know let's go outside I need someone


---------49:28----------
to talk to you please


---------49:29----------
you know yeah and this is the other


---------49:36----------
important thing reckful very important


---------49:37----------
very very important okay we have to be


---------49:41----------
careful about our relationship yeah


---------49:44----------
because the challenge is that when you


---------49:46----------
start doing things to get people to be


---------49:50----------
with you you can do that but it taints


---------49:56----------
what they mean to you and it taints the


---------50:00----------
color of what that person does for you


---------50:04----------
because then something like goes into


---------50:06----------
your mind and and it's kind of like are


---------50:09----------
they doing this because I'm paying their


---------50:10----------
rent or are they doing this because they


---------50:12----------
like me


---------50:13----------
yeah yes listen it's very important that


---------50:19----------
we're very careful about like not


---------50:21----------
tainting and for you to go forward you


---------50:23----------
know if there's someone that you want to


---------50:25----------
form a relationship with don't taint the


---------50:27----------
relationship don't try to get me just be


---------50:29----------
aware of that because what you really


---------50:32----------
need is someone who wants you to who


---------50:34----------
wants you for you yeah and you make it


---------50:40----------
hard on them by giving them things that


---------50:44----------
they may need in life


---------50:47----------
yeah but recently I try to make it


---------50:50----------
mutually beneficial at least I hope so


---------50:52----------
I mean things can be you can engage in


---------50:54----------
mutually beneficial relationships that's


---------50:56----------
fine I'm just saying like be careful


---------50:58----------
about when your loneliness there's a


---------51:02----------
difference between helping someone out


---------51:03----------
because you're they're your friend and


---------51:05----------
you like you care about them as a


---------51:07----------
genuine person and you're just trying to


---------51:09----------
help them out and there's a there's a


---------51:11----------
difference between that and trying to


---------51:12----------
keep someone close to you because you're


---------51:14----------
feeling lonely yeah I've done both for


---------51:18----------
sure yet more and sometimes those get


---------51:21----------
muddled yeah so I'm not saying anything


---------51:28----------
else breathing so just going forward you


---------51:30----------
know just be careful about that and try


---------51:34----------
to notice that loneliness within you I'm


---------51:37----------
trying so it keeps happening where I'm


---------51:42----------
hiring people on Everland


---------51:44----------
they're very talented but I also like


---------51:48----------
spending time with them so it's getting


---------51:53----------
close to that muddled area but it really


---------51:56----------
does seem like the correct play I'll ask


---------51:59----------
you know Mike I lost Talbot or my lead


---------52:05----------
designer if this is a good hire say yes


---------52:08----------
it really is they're amazing


---------52:11----------
I know but I think I think this is a


---------52:14----------
situation where it's mutually beneficial


---------52:16----------
that's what I actually really like about


---------52:19----------
this whole game development thing is


---------52:21----------
they're getting a job God my first


---------52:26----------
thought was I'm getting a friend but


---------52:27----------
this is fine they're getting a job I'm


---------52:31----------
getting a friend I'm getting someone to


---------52:32----------
and I'm also I mean the project is


---------52:36----------
progressing because of it and it's


---------52:38----------
forming a sense of community in our


---------52:41----------
workspace yeah so I mean I think that


---------52:46----------
makes sense and and I think that you


---------52:48----------
know it's it's challenging to navigate


---------52:51----------
those relationships and what I want you


---------52:52----------
to do is like cut yourself some slack


---------52:54----------
okay cuz you have and well yeah you have


---------52:58----------
a you have a big void of love and and


---------53:02----------
that's gonna that's gonna you know


---------53:04----------
that's gonna cause you to do a couple of


---------53:05----------
things and that's not like it's not your


---------53:07----------
fault right like you're just you just


---------53:09----------
need more love man and that's okay and


---------53:12----------
at the same time I think you should be


---------53:14----------
intentional about giving yourself the


---------53:18----------
opportunities to be cared for


---------53:21----------
appreciated and loved by other human


---------53:23----------
beings who are not your employees and to


---------53:26----------
cultivate those relationships yeah I'm


---------53:29----------
trying I I have a few now yeah my old


---------53:36----------
friends from Lao are the best examples


---------53:39----------
because we just met online and played


---------53:42----------
games together and


---------53:46----------
talked every day for years you know


---------53:51----------
formed a deep sense of community it was


---------53:56----------
a little sad for me


---------53:59----------
it's similarly to how after high school


---------54:01----------
you and all your friends go to different


---------54:04----------
places or pursue different walks of life


---------54:06----------
after world of warcraft all my friends


---------54:09----------
went to different games or job careers


---------54:13----------
you know even if we went to the same


---------54:16----------
career if it happened to be streaming


---------54:18----------
it's actually such an isolating job most


---------54:21----------
of the time not for you because you're


---------54:23----------
talking to someone every time but most


---------54:25----------
people that they're streaming on their


---------54:27----------
own just playing a game right so it


---------54:31----------
wasn't the same as when we just spend


---------54:34----------
time together online yeah good how you


---------54:37----------
feeling right now


---------54:39----------
Phil uh I'm happy that I was able to


---------54:44----------
come on here without psilocybin and


---------54:46----------
still deep dive some critically some


---------54:53----------
thoughts critically think


---------54:55----------
get somewhere learn something also I


---------55:01----------
think the my viewers probably like


---------55:04----------
seeing the other side of me here because


---------55:07----------
I've been on psilocybin every stream for


---------55:11----------
a while I'm scared to be this version of


---------55:15----------
me in front of people now a bit a little


---------55:17----------
bit I just I mean they used to see this


---------55:22----------
version of me all the time but I'm just


---------55:25----------
[Music]


---------55:27----------
identifying more with my happy side


---------55:30----------
I like being happy me I mean who doesn't


---------55:33----------
right I wonder what people think


---------55:37----------
actually I lost them at the end so I


---------55:41----------
like your oath means I think you're


---------55:44----------
doing a really good job reckful because


---------55:46----------
I think you're right I mean who doesn't


---------55:48----------
like to be the happy version of


---------55:49----------
themselves but I think that the real you


---------55:54----------
and you know is not all happiness that's


---------55:58----------
not what life is like life is not just


---------56:00----------
like you know just the happy side of


---------56:02----------
life and there are a lot of people who


---------56:03----------
try to chase that part of themselves


---------56:05----------
what I would advocate for you to do


---------56:08----------
along with just about everyone else is


---------56:10----------
that you like you be both of these


---------56:12----------
people and you learn how to be sad


---------56:15----------
reckful better because I do believe that


---------56:17----------
you can be this person and it not be as


---------56:20----------
hard or as painful as it is for you to


---------56:23----------
experience like day to day now like I


---------56:25----------
think that if you have someone who


---------56:27----------
consistently loves you and demonstrates


---------56:29----------
that they're not going to leave you for


---------56:30----------
a period of two years like being this


---------56:33----------
person is gonna be completely different


---------56:35----------
in the sad and difficult thing is that's


---------56:38----------
not something you can do you can't make


---------56:41----------
someone love you like that's just


---------56:43----------
something that depends on your governme


---------56:45----------
someone has to come into your life and


---------56:47----------
you have to like create this time and


---------56:49----------
space for that relationship it makes


---------56:51----------
sense what you're saying cuz there have


---------56:53----------
been times in my life where I'm just


---------56:54----------
giving everything up for a relationship


---------56:57----------
and now I understand why I'll just stop


---------57:01----------
streaming and now


---------57:05----------
go anywhere do anything to be closer to


---------57:08----------
the person yeah and cuz yeah and so this


---------57:16----------
is the hard thing this is why I guess


---------57:19----------
maybe I'm shooting myself in the foot


---------57:20----------
here but I'm I guess I'm volunteering


---------57:21----------
and and the reason is because I think


---------57:24----------
that that person needs to also I mean


---------57:26----------
they don't need to understand this but I


---------57:27----------
think that person needs to not let you


---------57:29----------
do that as well yeah right so that I


---------57:33----------
realized that don't let you like if you


---------57:37----------
want to move to Boston I'm gonna say no


---------57:40----------
right right and it doesn't mean that I


---------57:43----------
don't care about you but it's just you


---------57:44----------
should continue to live your life and


---------57:46----------
have some degree of constancy from


---------57:48----------
someone and it sounds like you're in a


---------57:49----------
romantic relationship so I mean it


---------57:50----------
doesn't have to be right now I'm not no


---------57:52----------
okay


---------57:53----------
I was though I did it a twitch streamer


---------57:57----------
girl and we met in Japan that we were


---------58:01----------
both IRL streaming in Japan now and it


---------58:07----------
was so exciting to meet like that and we


---------58:11----------
traveled to other places together but


---------58:16----------
then when life's kind of settled in slow


---------58:19----------
down I you know was slowly giving up


---------58:25----------
everything just to spend more time with


---------58:29----------
her at one point I had actually deleted


---------58:31----------
my twitch channel which my viewers


---------58:34----------
thought was insane because I just I


---------58:38----------
don't know I can't even explain why I


---------58:42----------
don't know


---------58:43----------
okay well a conversation for a different


---------58:46----------
day yeah do you feel like meditating for


---------58:50----------
a few minutes do you yes yeah I yeah I


---------58:53----------
feel like I need a break from thought


---------58:57----------
yeah good you do you want to take a


---------59:00----------
break for a few minutes first and then


---------59:02----------
meditate on how clogged does your nose


---------59:07----------
it's pretty good I'm getting over the


---------59:09----------
sickness finally I think I've been sick


---------59:11----------
the whole time we've known each other


---------59:13----------
maybe that's a first session yeah so


---------59:19----------
nowadays I've been on a chanting kick


---------59:21----------
I've chanted with a couple of people how


---------59:23----------
do you feel about trying that I saw you


---------59:25----------
do with Lily by the way I love Lily and

---------62:15----------
beautiful okay now eyes closed


---------62:19----------

---------62:21----------
vibration not about sound so I want you


---------62:25----------
to try to feel the vibration in your


---------62:26----------
body and I'm going to ask you reckful at


---------62:29----------
the end of it where you felt the


---------62:31----------
vibration which part of your body so pay


---------62:33----------
attention to the sound the the each


---------62:36----------
sound is gonna feel slightly different


---------62:39----------
in your body and we're gonna ask you


---------62:40----------
about that afterward we're gonna do five


---------62:42----------
breaths together okay


---------62:51----------
[Music]


---------62:51----------
[Laughter]


---------62:52----------
[Music]


---------63:02----------

---------63:40----------
do two more


---------63:40----------

---------64:08----------
[Laughter]


---------64:11----------
Oh


---------64:15----------
last one big deep breath


---------64:29----------
Oh


---------64:29----------
[Music]


---------64:35----------
and now sit with your eyes closed just


---------64:38----------
feel alright reckful come on back how do


---------65:12----------
you feel i I really drifted away during


---------65:17----------
that I was not so the first one I was


---------65:20----------
self-conscious of giggling a bit in the


---------65:22----------
night I was gone I was just immersed in


---------65:25----------
it which is surprising to me that I was


---------65:27----------
able to do that ma'am yeah yeah how do


---------65:31----------
you feel


---------65:38----------
I really enjoyed turning off my brain


---------65:44----------
for a bit we had talked and usually I


---------65:47----------
just said I love stimulating


---------65:48----------
conversation back and forth but then I


---------65:51----------
felt I felt burnt out and then


---------65:55----------
transitioning into consciousness without


---------65:58----------
thought was amazing so I want you to do


---------66:03----------
something


---------66:04----------
I won't you just look at your face like


---------66:06----------
go back and watch the vaad and look at


---------66:08----------
your face now and look at your face at


---------66:10----------
the beginning of the interview you're


---------66:13----------
compatible give it it's gonna be happier


---------66:14----------
yeah right yeah so you can be happy this


---------66:20----------
way just give it give it some time I


---------66:24----------
think I can i yeah we can go more into


---------66:30----------
that later I think I think I can


---------66:34----------
definitely the feelings of the fears of


---------66:41----------
abandonment and the my desires might


---------66:45----------
when I'm actually consciously thinking


---------66:48----------
life is a lot worse right now when I'm


---------66:52----------
not thinking it's pretty similar I mean


---------66:54----------
I guess by definition which is what


---------66:57----------
you're trying to get me to the not


---------66:58----------
thinking right yeah yeah yeah but my


---------67:03----------
thoughts go in loops a lot more negative


---------67:06----------
ones if I'm thinking it's like there's


---------67:10----------
that analogy with the the sleds on the


---------67:13----------
snowy mountain you heard that one


---------67:16----------
oh maybe yeah I think yeah when when you


---------67:19----------
yeah so this is the thing like I mean


---------67:23----------
the one I tell is the game trail so like


---------67:26----------
you know if you think about like a field


---------67:28----------
and a deer walks across it like the


---------67:31----------
whole field is the same but the deer


---------67:32----------
walks across one path and that grass is


---------67:35----------
a little bit trampled and so the next


---------67:37----------
animal that goes by takes that path


---------67:39----------
again and it becomes a little bit more


---------67:41----------
trampled and then over time you develop


---------67:43----------
a trail and this trail is what your


---------67:46----------
thoughts are following over and over


---------67:47----------
yeah that's how your neurons work to


---------67:49----------
that once you get used to thinking in a


---------67:52----------
particular cycle like your thoughts like


---------67:54----------
kind of they love going down that


---------67:55----------
pathway again how do we break how do we


---------68:01----------
untrim pull the grass or how do we break


---------68:04----------
these loops without medication so


---------68:08----------
medication doesn't break the loops let's


---------68:10----------
start there okay really so yeah so let's


---------68:13----------
just think about it so if I were to if


---------68:15----------
you were to say let's say we have a


---------68:17----------
field of grass and we've have a game


---------68:19----------
trail because a thousand animals have


---------68:21----------
gone down it and I were to ask you


---------68:22----------
reckful how do we make a different game


---------68:25----------
trail


---------68:27----------
we'd have to repeat new thoughts in our


---------68:30----------
head over and over there it is so we


---------68:35----------
actually think my people do the


---------68:36----------
gratitude journals yeah a little bit


---------68:39----------
maybe yeah absolutely so I think that's


---------68:41----------
one reason they do grab it so I think


---------68:44----------
gratitude is one way to do that but I


---------68:46----------
come on huh I just said talking to you


---------68:50----------
is fun and so the other thing is we we


---------68:54----------
think about things in a new way right


---------68:56----------
and once you learn something like once


---------68:58----------
you start like recognizing oh okay


---------69:00----------
and I think you recognize


---------69:02----------
things within yourself so you recognize


---------69:04----------
okay there's a thought my mind is about


---------69:06----------
to go down this game trail but in uh you


---------69:09----------
know I've also started this other game


---------69:11----------
trail so let me see if I can redirect


---------69:13----------
down there


---------69:14----------
that's what reframing a cognitive bias


---------69:16----------
is about so when people tell you like Oh


---------69:19----------
reckful you're you're lonely and and you


---------69:21----------
should learn how to be independent and


---------69:23----------
then you beat yourself up for feeling


---------69:25----------
lonely and you feel like you should be


---------69:26----------
independent because there are other


---------69:27----------
people who are your age and look at how


---------69:29----------
independent they are you all of your


---------69:31----------
thoughts those are a bunch of game


---------69:32----------
shells but then you say no hold on a


---------69:33----------
second I'm different and and I I do feel


---------69:37----------
lonely I'm allowed to feel lonely and


---------69:38----------
I'm gonna feel lonely until I get enough


---------69:40----------
love I love it you telling me that's cuz


---------69:42----------
everyone else has told me I've said in


---------69:44----------
my whole life


---------69:44----------
yeah and how has that worked for you no


---------69:47----------
no I'm good hahaha there we go yeah


---------69:50----------
right so I I just I mean that's like the


---------69:56----------
clinician within me says if you give


---------69:58----------
someone a treatment for thirty years and


---------70:00----------
it doesn't work maybe try something else


---------70:03----------
yeah it's like the UH trying the same


---------70:08----------
thing over and over is the definition of


---------70:10----------
insanity right so it doesn't work if at


---------70:14----------
first you don't succeed


---------70:15----------
don't try try again try it a different


---------70:18----------
way yeah and it in your case I don't


---------70:23----------
think I mean like it's not a complicated


---------70:25----------
psychological thing I think you're just


---------70:27----------
I mean maybe it is but like I think at


---------70:29----------
the end of the day like you just needed


---------70:30----------
more TLC than you got and it doesn't


---------70:33----------
mean that your parents did a bad job or


---------70:35----------
that anyone else be tender love and care


---------70:38----------
tender love and care


---------70:41----------
and and you move our terminology reckful


---------70:45----------
is that band TLC does that what it means


---------70:48----------
oh I don't know I don't know anything


---------70:52----------
about bands okay yeah anyway so any


---------70:58----------
questions for me before we wrap up


---------71:00----------
specific thoughts questions what do you


---------71:03----------
think about me on enough psilocybin


---------71:07----------
what's your take on it I mean my take is


---------71:13----------
that you are where you are right now in


---------71:15----------
an order for you so I mean I place a


---------71:17----------
value judgment on psilocybin and


---------71:20----------
substance use because of like my life


---------71:22----------
but I try not to judge other people like


---------71:25----------
I don't know if I've shared this on


---------71:26----------
stream but you know one of my patients


---------71:28----------
who has a lot of physical real problems


---------71:31----------
like confessed to me that they use


---------71:33----------
marijuana from time to time and they


---------71:35----------
were afraid that I would was gonna be


---------71:37----------
upset because they like because I teach


---------71:39----------
meditation and yoga and they come to me


---------71:40----------
to learn all this like healthy natural


---------71:42----------
kind of stuff and I was like look you're


---------71:44----------
doing everything right you know you're


---------71:47----------
going to you do yoga five days a week


---------71:48----------
you meditate every day you're eating


---------71:50----------
healthy and and sometimes life just


---------71:53----------
gives you pain and if you're if you're


---------71:54----------
saying that you use marijuana from time


---------71:56----------
to time like twice a month because there


---------71:59----------
are just days where it just really


---------72:00----------
really sucks and you need a break like I


---------72:02----------
think you know that's fine like you have


---------72:04----------
to decide for yourself


---------72:05----------
you know choices that I make in my life


---------72:08----------
about what I choose to use and the value


---------72:10----------
judgments that I place or for me they're


---------72:12----------
not for you


---------72:13----------
now I think the only thing that I would


---------72:15----------
really oh wow so learn gifted just a


---------72:17----------
bunch of subs so thank you very much


---------72:19----------
learn so the only thing that I would say


---------72:22----------
for you reckful is the only thing the


---------72:25----------
only mistake that I think you can truly


---------72:27----------
make is to not be reflective about it


---------72:31----------
okay


---------72:33----------
if you go through an honest process of


---------72:36----------
exploring alternatives and seeing how


---------72:37----------
the way you feel and trying to live is


---------72:39----------
sad reckful as opposed to happy reckful


---------72:42----------
like explore that and then come to your


---------72:44----------
own conclusion and whatever conclusion


---------72:45----------
you come to I'm behind you just don't do


---------72:49----------
it on autopilot that's the only thing


---------72:53----------
thanks that had more of an emotional


---------72:59----------
impact than I was expecting


---------73:03----------
same I was in professor mode I don't


---------73:08----------
know if you guys caught that but there


---------73:09----------
are different modes one is I'm quiet and


---------73:12----------
I'm listening and the other is I'm


---------73:13----------
teaching it's my teacher voice but okay


---------73:20----------
well you know it was it was this feeling


---------73:24----------
that you accepted me too and it gave me


---------73:32----------
the option to make my own decisions as


---------73:35----------
long as I'm being as long as I'm


---------73:38----------
consciously critically thinking and


---------73:40----------
analyzing me yeah which is I appreciate


---------73:44----------
yeah I think you know I it's not my


---------73:46----------
place to tell you that something is


---------73:48----------
right or wrong I mean I may do that from


---------73:50----------
time to time but I think the most


---------73:52----------
important thing is for you to decide I


---------73:53----------
think you should explore Oh Chad I want


---------73:59----------

---------74:01----------
