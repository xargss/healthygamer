---------00:00----------
and then you wonder why aren't you


---------00:01----------
confident it's because in the past when


---------00:03----------
you've been confident it did not go well


---------00:05----------
the one person you cared about your best


---------00:07----------
friend stabbed you in the back just


---------00:09----------
because you were a decent human being


---------00:17----------
oh hi yeah so can we just check audio


---------00:23----------
levels real quick and make sure can you


---------00:24----------

---------00:25----------
[Music]


---------00:28----------

---------00:29----------
that thing is so sensitive I can touch


---------00:31----------
anything okay audio is great okay so is


---------00:35----------
it Lucy PI am i pronouncing that


---------00:37----------
correctly can just call me Lucy okay


---------00:39----------
yeah so Lucy tell me a list of all what


---------00:43----------
is all that stuff in behind your chair


---------00:44----------
this looks like a I'm I'm a stream


---------00:48----------
yeah but some plants uh yeah yeah this


---------00:52----------
is my little little little cozy setup


---------00:55----------
yeah yeah oh sorry buddy I was gonna say


---------01:00----------
I'd like I came in and graded you the


---------01:02----------
other day yeah I really like your stream


---------01:05----------
that's why I wanted to come on cuz I


---------01:08----------
really really like what you're doing


---------01:09----------
okay


---------01:10----------
and and so what are we gonna be talking


---------01:13----------
about today Lucy um so I've been


---------01:16----------
reflecting on this a little bit because


---------01:18----------
I knew this was gonna be the question


---------01:19----------
that was asked like I know I'll have a


---------01:21----------
lot of issues okay and and sometimes um


---------01:24----------
you know when you're in the the maze of


---------01:27----------
your mind it's kind of hard to


---------01:28----------
categorize absolutely what the issue is


---------01:31----------
but one of the one of the big things


---------01:34----------
that I kind of click with today that I


---------01:36----------
kind of wanted to start with is like um


---------01:38----------
I really look like I like Who I am when


---------01:41----------
I'm on my own when I'm quiet when I'm by


---------01:43----------
myself like I'm quite content with who I


---------01:46----------
am as a person okay I'm nice go good


---------01:49----------
morals like I kind of check a lot of


---------01:51----------
boxes and I enjoy being in my own energy


---------01:54----------
okay the minute I'm with other people my


---------01:59----------
internal dialogue and my energy just


---------02:01----------
completely shifts and I'm very like


---------02:04----------
critical I don't like Who I am like when


---------02:07----------
I'm around people I like constantly


---------02:10----------
judge myself and of some days it's


---------02:14----------
better than others you know like if I


---------02:16----------
meditate before I go into an interaction


---------02:21----------
and there's some people that I feel more


---------02:24----------
comfortable than others around okay um


---------02:26----------
but yeah for them I think that's like


---------02:30----------
the biggest thing that's going on right


---------02:32----------
now yeah so first of all thank you so


---------02:34----------
much for spending some time kind of


---------02:36----------
thinking about it and also I think you


---------02:38----------
did a wonderful job of encapsulating


---------02:40----------
this issue which is that


---------02:42----------
there's more than one you yeah yeah


---------02:46----------
there's sort of the real you and then


---------02:49----------
there's the person that you feel like


---------02:51----------
you should be when other people are


---------02:53----------
around yeah especially with that cuz I I


---------02:56----------
do die cuz I'm in stream yeah I might


---------02:58----------
like I've been going through this like a


---------03:01----------
lot processes lately of um trying to


---------03:04----------
become more of who I am a stream on


---------03:07----------
stream and I'm trying to become hold on


---------03:11----------
you're trying to become more of who you


---------03:12----------
are on stream or off stream um like


---------03:16----------
bring who I am off stream onto stream


---------03:18----------
okay okay gotcha yeah cuz sometimes so I


---------03:22----------
guess like my goal with what I like to


---------03:26----------
do is like I like to uplift people like


---------03:28----------
to help people find purpose I also I'm


---------03:32----------
very into like this the spiritual


---------03:34----------
scientist so I do like tarot cards and


---------03:37----------
oracle cards and just like I don't know


---------03:41----------
like trying to be that compassionate


---------03:42----------
voice of spirit I like to work with


---------03:45----------
spirit and I I really like that and


---------03:50----------
sometimes though I I feel like I have to


---------03:53----------
be this um


---------03:55----------
think this like always like super super


---------04:02----------
positive or this like yeah so so you


---------04:10----------
want to be the thing that you are yes


---------04:13----------
but you feel like sometimes there's a


---------04:15----------
there's a voice inside you that says


---------04:17----------
that you should be something else yeah


---------04:21----------
and when did you start becoming the


---------04:23----------
person that you are


---------04:26----------
and


---------04:30----------
it's been I think just like through the


---------04:32----------
process of growing up he kind of like


---------04:34----------
shed a lot of beliefs that other people


---------04:37----------
kind of put on you yeah I'm 24 now so


---------04:40----------
like that process is like really saw it


---------04:43----------
happened in where I'm like I don't want


---------04:45----------
to keep


---------04:47----------
doing this so I guess like yeah I guess


---------04:52----------
you keep doing what um like putting on


---------04:55----------
like a like out like a show or a like a


---------04:58----------
like a persona um like a friend yeah but


---------05:04----------
yeah I think I'm just like finding out


---------05:05----------
more of who I am like I still don't


---------05:07----------
really know like Who I am so when you


---------05:11----------
asked like how long have I been Who I am


---------05:12----------
I'm like oh okay you know by the way


---------05:17----------
your your picture seems to have gotten


---------05:18----------
blurry I don't know if it's oh oh hang


---------05:22----------
on hang on


---------05:27----------
oh that's


---------05:29----------
okay yes okay sorry I just rely a lot on


---------05:35----------
facial expressions so it helps me an


---------05:36----------
effect oh okay okay oh I'm really good


---------05:39----------
with those I'm like really bad at like


---------05:40----------
hiding what's going on so that's gonna


---------05:44----------
make make this easier for me but so so


---------05:46----------
let's just think about this a little bit


---------05:48----------
right so there's so give me give me an


---------05:50----------
example of like you say that sometimes


---------05:51----------
when you're around people you start to


---------05:54----------
have a in your internal dialog so what


---------05:57----------
kind of person are we talking about is


---------05:58----------
there someone that changes your internal


---------06:00----------
dialogue pretty consistently yeah


---------06:06----------
usually people that don't have similar


---------06:10----------
but like beliefs I think the


---------06:14----------
spirituality thing is a big one I even


---------06:18----------
hate the word spirituality because I


---------06:20----------
feel like


---------06:21----------
I get a lot or I judge that a lot or


---------06:25----------
feel like I get a lot of judgment from


---------06:27----------
that so especially when it come on to


---------06:30----------
like the twitch platform like if the


---------06:34----------
conversations thriving means something


---------06:38----------
that I really enjoy that I'm fine


---------06:41----------
okay but if it's yeah if it's and and so


---------06:45----------
if it's not thriving then what happens


---------06:47----------
and I get quiet I kind of shut down I go


---------06:52----------
internal and I'm like Oh what kind of


---------06:59----------
thoughts do you have Oh like oh I bet


---------07:04----------
these people think I'm stupid


---------07:06----------
Oh like I thought I sound like an


---------07:08----------
absolute like no case mm-hmm so if


---------07:13----------
you're not like talking to these kinds


---------07:16----------
of thoughts arise when you're not


---------07:17----------
talking to your people


---------07:19----------
yeah does that make sense yeah okay so


---------07:22----------
like so now I've got my first question


---------07:25----------
for you Lucy is why is it important to


---------07:27----------
thrive because it feels good to thrive


---------07:30----------
okay it was yeah I don't know if you'll


---------07:34----------
yeah it feels good


---------07:35----------
so I've got like dead limited vocabulary


---------07:38----------
you know that's that's no I think that's


---------07:40----------
it that's a really fantastic answer


---------07:42----------
right so it feels good to thrive so what


---------07:45----------
part of what is thriving


---------07:48----------
um the exchange of information the


---------07:52----------
conversation we talking about what I'm


---------07:55----------
passionate about again I don't know like


---------07:59----------
my energy so I think okay is this like I


---------08:02----------
feel glowing like yeah you look good I


---------08:04----------
feel like I'm so does that feeling


---------08:07----------
coming come from you or does it come


---------08:09----------
from other people um it comes from me


---------08:12----------
I'm sure about that like well then again


---------08:16----------
actually new because then it's like the


---------08:17----------
connection because I feel like I'm more


---------08:20----------
connected with people when I'm talking


---------08:22----------
about something that with driving about


---------08:24----------
yeah so cuz I I think you know my sense


---------08:27----------
is that it comes from you but what I'm


---------08:29----------
noticing is that you're not the one who


---------08:32----------
brings it out ya know that yeah you're


---------08:36----------
right right yeah right because what


---------08:39----------
we're saying is that like so even though


---------08:41----------
the feeling is internal like it's a


---------08:42----------
vocht by something else yeah so there's


---------08:45----------
something there's some kind of


---------08:46----------
circumstance yeah that brings out your


---------08:50----------
sense of like connection and thriving


---------08:52----------
yes


---------08:54----------
and what


---------08:58----------
let's start with this so like when some


---------09:01----------
when you're sitting with someone and


---------09:03----------
they're not evoking they're not sort of


---------09:06----------
giving you a space to thrive okay is


---------09:09----------
that a good way to describe it yeah how


---------09:11----------
do you feel don't create the space


---------09:13----------
either I beat myself up a lot of like um


---------09:16----------
I've been compete in this cycle where I


---------09:20----------
am so I do i do tarot readings on and I


---------09:23----------
love doing them and I get I get that


---------09:25----------
this is like the best scenario I could


---------09:28----------
describe what happens is um I come in


---------09:31----------
with an intention of like I don't know


---------09:33----------
like I want to uplift people I want to


---------09:35----------
like have a discussion about this this


---------09:37----------
and this and then I'll be talking I'm


---------09:41----------
having a great time and then like things


---------09:42----------
slowly start to die down but then it's


---------09:44----------
like internally I start to show off and


---------09:46----------
then I start going into this comfort


---------09:48----------
zone of like okay I'm just gonna do


---------09:49----------
people's cards now and it's like a like


---------09:54----------
a comfort zone of like okay I'm just


---------09:56----------
gonna be focusing on you and like would


---------09:59----------
you like I like a question and answer


---------10:01----------
type thing where people come in with


---------10:02----------
questions I like just kind of reel up


---------10:04----------
like go back to like yeah so machine


---------10:09----------
yeah absolutely so so what is it what is


---------10:12----------
it that the cards protect you from you


---------10:18----------
see that the cards are protecting you


---------10:20----------
like yeah so so I I want you and


---------10:24----------
everyone else to notice that like when


---------10:26----------
you go so when you're feeling a certain


---------10:28----------
way which is like something in the


---------10:30----------
negative spectrum yeah you turn to the


---------10:32----------
cards because this is as you put it it's


---------10:34----------
your comfort zone yeah right you feel


---------10:36----------
safe if you're doing cards because the


---------10:38----------
focus is on them it's moved off of you


---------10:40----------
yeah and then and then you're in safe


---------10:43----------
territory because then like you're out


---------10:45----------
of the spotlight yeah and then in your


---------10:47----------
case it's tarot cards and it's another


---------10:49----------
human being but in a lot of cases like


---------10:51----------
for me it was video games right when I


---------10:53----------
was feeling a certain way recovered


---------10:55----------
addicts from video games yeah yeah now


---------10:59----------
I'm addicted to tarot cards instead yeah


---------11:01----------
beautiful right so you see let's think


---------11:03----------
about that for a second so my god


---------11:05----------
how does that how does that work so


---------11:08----------
tarot cards have replaced something it


---------11:10----------
replaced video games and I


---------11:12----------
think that's good like I think it's a


---------11:13----------
step in the right direction also kind of


---------11:14----------
replaced like external validation like I


---------11:17----------
have been reflecting a bit on like you


---------11:19----------
know like why can't I just be me in any


---------11:21----------
situation like why am I like relying on


---------11:24----------
like this external like yeah this this


---------11:27----------
person who you are is good oh no we


---------11:29----------
don't let you know like why am I trying


---------11:31----------
to gauge like how I should be from other


---------11:33----------
people but like I have well so let's


---------11:36----------
let's answer that why why do you need to


---------11:38----------
rely on other people to gauge to give


---------11:42----------
you a sense of confidence about yourself


---------11:44----------
I don't know like God let's be


---------11:49----------
mathematical so let's say let's say that


---------11:53----------
we're can confidence about myself come


---------11:55----------
from


---------11:57----------
for me in theory okay or it can come


---------12:01----------
from where else


---------12:04----------
um you okay where do you get it I get it


---------12:11----------
from me but it's I only give it to


---------12:13----------
myself when I feel like validated okay


---------12:16----------
so yeah I think that makes perfect sense


---------12:18----------
so in a bizarre way so like I know that


---------12:20----------
the right answer for people who are


---------12:22----------
spiritually in tune with themselves is


---------12:24----------
that confidence comes from within that's


---------12:26----------
the right answer but if we actually


---------12:28----------
listen to what you're saying your


---------12:30----------
confidence comes from two places yeah


---------12:32----------
sometimes it comes from you and


---------12:33----------
sometimes it comes from other people


---------12:36----------
absolutely right yeah first let's


---------12:38----------
acknowledge that that's the way it is


---------12:40----------
right now what what is it


---------12:46----------
why would I need confidence to come


---------12:50----------
so if I'm not getting confidence from


---------12:53----------
the outside where do I need it to come


---------12:54----------
from from you absolutely and if I'm not


---------12:58----------
needing conf I'm not finding confidence


---------13:00----------
on the inside where do I need it to come


---------13:02----------
from you need these come from the inside


---------13:04----------
it's the only like sustainable source of


---------13:07----------
confidence uh hold on hold on woman


---------13:09----------
sustainable source of confidence I


---------13:11----------
completely agree with you but if I'm not


---------13:13----------
if I'm getting confidence from the


---------13:15----------
outside what does that mean about the


---------13:17----------
confidence what I'm getting from the


---------13:18----------
inside well it's not that is it


---------13:20----------
absolutely Yeah right yeah so why don't


---------13:26----------
we write it so what can we understand


---------13:28----------
about like if you find that you're with


---------13:31----------
someone and you're feeling like you're


---------13:34----------
not doing a good enough of a job and


---------13:36----------
you're feeling some kind of negative


---------13:38----------
space inside you're feeling judged you


---------13:41----------
start to judge yourself and then you


---------13:43----------
turn to the videogames tarot cards


---------13:47----------
Netflix take your pick Yeah right


---------13:50----------
what does that tell us about your


---------13:54----------
confidence or what you get from the


---------13:56----------
inside that's kind of low like yeah if I


---------14:03----------
have low confidence yeah yeah which is


---------14:07----------
strange right because a lot of the times


---------14:09----------
it doesn't feel that way it's it's


---------14:12----------
interesting I think like sometimes


---------14:14----------
people can look at me and like see like


---------14:17----------
think that I'm a lot more confident than


---------14:18----------
I am and it's like yo [ __ ] there's like


---------14:21----------
there's a reason I'm into spirituality


---------14:22----------
like that has been like something that


---------14:24----------
I've been trying to build my confidence


---------14:26----------
like with yes because people can look at


---------14:29----------
you on paper and be like oh you have


---------14:31----------
this this and this you have all of these


---------14:32----------
reasons to be confident and it's like so


---------14:35----------
like it's all about how you feel about


---------14:38----------
you like you know really like deep down


---------14:40----------
and um yeah I'd like that's one of the


---------14:42----------
big reasons wanting to come into the


---------14:44----------
call was just because like I've been


---------14:46----------
trying to navigate my own maze and


---------14:49----------
there's just I feel like there's just


---------14:50----------
big coal wounds around confidence that I


---------14:56----------
haven't quite um like healed and even


---------14:59----------
like thinking about it and talking about


---------15:00----------
it and tapping into it like like I I


---------15:03----------
have tissues like because I know I'm


---------15:05----------
probably gonna cry cuz like okay I even


---------15:08----------
felt like tearing up like even starting


---------15:11----------
to open that what am I so tell us so I


---------15:16----------
think that makes sense because the


---------15:18----------
strange thing is that I see two versions


---------15:20----------
of you right there's the confident


---------15:23----------
version but something happens like I


---------15:25----------
think that that confident person is not


---------15:27----------
actually the real you that there's some


---------15:30----------
kind of separation that's happening when


---------15:32----------
you take all of your lack of confidence


---------15:34----------
and you kind of bundle it up and you


---------15:36----------
like stick it in the closet so that you


---------15:39----------
can be this perfect self that can help


---------15:42----------
enough with other people it's actually a


---------15:44----------
sacrifice that you make for the sake of


---------15:46----------
your antara or your duty and then the


---------15:48----------
problem though is that like even though


---------15:49----------
that person feels very authentic I think


---------15:52----------
and I don't mean to be judgmental I


---------15:54----------
think that that person is a little bit


---------15:56----------
of a lie yeah because in order to become


---------15:58----------
that person you have to take some of


---------16:00----------
this negativity and you have


---------16:01----------
to ball it up and you up to stuff in a


---------16:02----------
way and and and this is where you use


---------16:05----------
the word wounds which i think is a very


---------16:07----------
powerful word that there's something


---------16:09----------
about you which you have to kind of like


---------16:11----------
stick under the table yeah and when you


---------16:14----------
do that I think what actually happens is


---------16:16----------
you're invalidating towards yourself no


---------16:19----------
for sure


---------16:19----------
I had a small realization of like well


---------16:22----------
this about this validation that I get


---------16:24----------
this persona how am I ever


---------16:28----------
how is that ever going to increase my


---------16:29----------
confidence because I don't even identify


---------16:31----------
with that all that there are times like


---------16:33----------
this person that's being accepted like


---------16:36----------
it's only one part of me it's not who I


---------16:39----------
am again like when I'm away from cameras


---------16:43----------
and when I'm like alone like I really I


---------16:46----------
do really like Who I am and it's more


---------16:48----------
soft it's more general it is less


---------16:50----------
confident it's not that bold but it's


---------16:53----------
like nice beautiful so just think about


---------16:56----------
that for a second right in a weird way


---------16:58----------
you were more confident in the person


---------17:01----------
who is less confident yeah you're softer


---------17:04----------
you're gentler you're less confident in


---------17:06----------
who you are you're a flawed human being


---------17:08----------
yeah and somehow it's peaceful to be


---------17:11----------
with that person who does not live up to


---------17:14----------
expectations oh my god you just blow my


---------17:20----------
I don't know I am so afraid to like show


---------17:25----------
that I think I think sometimes like this


---------17:27----------
that's supposed to be huge


---------17:29----------
of like oh you're supposed to be like


---------17:32----------
this yeah so it's expectation let me ask


---------17:36----------
you this Lucy who did you show yourself


---------17:39----------
to that you cared about that didn't


---------17:41----------
accept you my best friend


---------17:45----------
tell me about that um I had this friend


---------17:52----------
so I've I think your camera is tearing


---------17:54----------
up because it just got blurry oh no we


---------17:57----------
don't want to see her like okay yeah I


---------18:02----------
don't know it sometimes it's in focus


---------18:04----------
but oh okay there we go it's 40 yeah


---------18:16----------
that's okay it's okay I'll manage but


---------18:21----------
okay so tell me about your right your


---------18:22----------
best friend um so uh I get cozy for this


---------18:30----------
emotionally preparing myself okay so um


---------18:34----------
I had a friend everything has just gone


---------18:36----------
black in his flashing okay so so you


---------18:39----------
were saying okay yeah there we go I yeah


---------18:49----------
I've always been I've always had like


---------18:51----------

---------18:58----------
best friend and I don't know just I just


---------19:02----------

---------19:15----------
just sit at home and play games and then


---------19:18----------
in school I'd just you know kind of like


---------19:21----------
keep my head down like keep my head down


---------19:23----------
and just like don't need to make any


---------19:25----------
friends cause like you know um but yeah


---------19:30----------
but then I go I get into high school and


---------19:32----------
I like stop making friends with this


---------19:37----------
like one girl and uh we end up becoming


---------19:40----------
like really really good friends and


---------19:43----------
you know those like I don't know I see


---------19:46----------
like people having friends of it like


---------19:47----------
I've known this person for like 10 years


---------19:49----------
and then like I had like how like how


---------19:52----------
have you got all of these friends cause


---------19:53----------
like it doesn't make any sense to me


---------19:55----------
um but anyway let me just clarify so so


---------19:59----------
does it is it somewhat perplexing to you


---------20:01----------
how people maintain long-term


---------20:02----------
friendships not anymore


---------20:05----------
um because I i but yeah sometimes I do


---------20:09----------
think some long-term friendships I look


---------20:11----------
at them and like they feel like that I


---------20:13----------
see a lot of people like who had in


---------20:15----------
those friendships because they feel


---------20:16----------
obliged


---------20:17----------
um to be in those friendships because


---------20:18----------
they've been in there for a long time


---------20:20----------
and I'm like how do you do that like how


---------20:23----------
like how do you maintain that um I


---------20:26----------
almost want to say it's like a bit of a


---------20:28----------
persona that like you know to maintain


---------20:30----------
that friendship like they have to


---------20:31----------
completely abandon who they really are


---------20:34----------
in those situations of like I just don't


---------20:37----------
have a good like I don't have any easy


---------20:38----------
time doing that even though you don't


---------20:41----------
have a easy time abandoning who you are


---------20:42----------
well I do apparently but I mean I'm I


---------20:47----------
you know I don't abandon myself


---------20:49----------
completely like there okay Inc you know


---------20:52----------
if there's like a spectrum of how much


---------20:54----------
you abandon yourself uh-huh I know like


---------20:57----------
I was like is that a super extreme but


---------20:59----------
you know I am I think I feel like


---------21:02----------
everyone in a way is on that spectrum


---------21:04----------
because the way I think society and


---------21:07----------
everything is is like yeah you don't


---------21:09----------
know who's oh like that you are okay


---------21:12----------
chuckling it sounds like you're you're


---------21:16----------
kind of wondering you know how is it


---------21:19----------
that people can be so inauthentic with


---------21:22----------
themselves for such a long time in order


---------21:24----------
to maintain a relationship for ten years


---------21:28----------
it um honestly like I don't want it too


---------21:33----------
much because it seems like I don't know


---------21:34----------
it it's uh it seems like kind of


---------21:36----------
self-explanatory like how things are set


---------21:39----------
up but um oh yeah I've I've always kind


---------21:43----------
of just struggled to do that so I kind


---------21:45----------
of wonder what's wrong with me yeah more


---------21:47----------
than wonder what's wrong with other


---------21:49----------
people I more wonder like what's wrong


---------21:51----------
well Lucy so I I think I think um so


---------21:54----------
first of all I don't think anything is


---------21:55----------
wrong with you


---------21:57----------
okay that's nice what's the narrow but I


---------21:58----------
I do think that somewhere along the way


---------22:02----------
you got the idea like in your in the


---------22:05----------
assumptions of what you're saying


---------22:07----------
there's this assumption that being


---------22:09----------
together with someone for ten years the


---------22:11----------
longer you're with someone the more work


---------22:14----------
it is because the more you have to


---------22:16----------
abandon yourself


---------22:19----------
right that's why it's sort of perplexing


---------22:21----------
to you how people can maintain


---------22:22----------
relationships for 10 years because the


---------22:24----------
first year of maintaining relationship


---------22:26----------
is so much work and then if we have to


---------22:29----------
do it for a second year in the third


---------22:31----------
year I don't it's more like if you make


---------22:39----------
it small about making a childhood friend


---------22:41----------
like that precise to be like maintaining


---------22:43----------
a friendship with somebody as you grow


---------22:45----------
as a person and no longer become like


---------22:48----------
you're no longer that person that they


---------22:49----------
became friends with and that they have


---------22:52----------
grown and a problem meet someone that


---------22:54----------
you no longer like oh and remember who


---------22:57----------
they are you're no longer who you are


---------23:00----------
how do you still maintain the Dodgers


---------23:03----------
I'm not very good with like small talk


---------23:06----------
or like I don't know like um I don't


---------23:09----------
know I want I don't want to say fake but


---------23:12----------
that's like the old I think that's like


---------23:13----------
the only thing about vocabulary that's


---------23:14----------
it's like very surface level um I want I


---------23:19----------
don't know why I want secrecy like only


---------23:21----------
surface level like me me me me me like


---------23:23----------
me I just think I don't know I just


---------23:25----------
don't like you that's and that's a great


---------23:27----------
that's a great description so I actually


---------23:29----------
I just want to pause for a second and


---------23:30----------
like you and me me me me me me


---------23:32----------
so it feels like that's not good


---------23:35----------
communication but that is an amazing way


---------23:37----------
to convey what you're feeling because I


---------23:38----------
understood exactly what you meant


---------23:40----------
what do you mean it's sort of like this


---------23:44----------
idea that you know that sometimes there


---------23:46----------
are people out there who are super fake


---------23:48----------
and that when you haven't seen someone


---------23:50----------
in a year that's the way you act with


---------23:51----------
them oh yeah it really is and it's


---------23:56----------
really hard for you to do that because


---------23:59----------
it's hard for you to be fake yeah it's


---------24:01----------
like reads all over my face I'm like how


---------24:03----------
do you how do you do this yeah so I


---------24:05----------
think oddly enough


---------24:07----------
I know that some of the ways that I'm


---------24:09----------
reframing things or framing things is


---------24:11----------
not really connecting with what you're


---------24:13----------
saying but I really think somewhere


---------24:14----------
along the way you're kind of saying like


---------24:17----------
how do people maintain friendships over


---------24:19----------
10 years as individuals grow and change


---------24:21----------
because the longer the relationship goes


---------24:24----------
in the more that you diverge the less


---------24:26----------
like authentic stuff the less stuff that


---------24:29----------
you guys have in common is you become


---------24:30----------
different people how do you maintain a


---------24:32----------
a strong connection without the mimimi


---------24:34----------
mimimi mimimi yeah because you guys have


---------24:37----------
become different people yeah I think one


---------24:40----------
of the things there with me and as you


---------24:43----------
like reframe that it's like I have a


---------24:45----------
hard time being confident with myself as


---------24:48----------
I'm changing and growing I don't stick


---------24:50----------
to it I was awake and I'm like me me me


---------24:53----------
me me like yeah authentic because I'm


---------24:56----------
like not confident with who I've changed


---------24:58----------
and grown into a person so I feel like I


---------25:00----------
have to like do these like pleasantries


---------25:02----------
and don't feel oh there it is


---------25:06----------
no that's very yeah so I'm gonna just


---------25:09----------
say that back to you right so the reason


---------25:12----------
that people are able to maintain


---------25:13----------
relationships over 10 years is because


---------25:15----------
they're authentic it's really really


---------25:17----------
hard if all you have is me me me me me


---------25:20----------
me me yeah right so the way that you


---------25:23----------
maintain a relationship for 10 years is


---------25:25----------
that you recognize that each of you has


---------25:26----------
changed as human beings but can you come


---------25:29----------
to love and accept the person that they


---------25:32----------
are now instead of the person that they


---------25:34----------
used to be yeah you know so I had a


---------25:38----------
friend who we were really close when


---------25:39----------
when we were in middle school and then


---------25:42----------
like when we got into high school he


---------25:43----------
started using a bunch of drugs and like


---------25:47----------
that was difficult for our relationship


---------25:49----------
because I didn't want to use drugs and


---------25:51----------
he wanted to use drugs and like we still


---------25:54----------
are friends to this day but we've just


---------25:56----------
taken different paths and we've sort of


---------25:58----------
accepted each other for like what we are


---------26:00----------
yeah that's cool


---------26:01----------
but I I think the reason that it feels


---------26:03----------
so confusing to you is because the


---------26:06----------
reason like the reason it's so hard is


---------26:08----------
because the further you guys diverge the


---------26:11----------
more you have - me me me me me me me me


---------26:14----------
me it to bridge that gap right the more


---------26:15----------
fake you have to become yeah but I think


---------26:18----------
the problem here is that you're not


---------26:19----------
letting them see who you really are


---------26:22----------
yeah that's that's that's really true


---------26:24----------
yeah so then the question becomes and


---------26:28----------
I'll come back to this like what


---------26:29----------
happened with Anna yeah so so honey her


---------26:33----------
name was uh her name is Amy


---------26:35----------
I'm sorry Amy yes okay I don't even


---------26:37----------
think I said a name to be okay so I was


---------26:39----------
a really good guess like I don't even


---------26:41----------
know if I said a name but um but yeah we


---------26:44----------
were


---------26:45----------
really good friends she was like my


---------26:46----------
first like official like bestfriend and


---------26:51----------
we used to play xbox and she just really


---------26:54----------
like was we just really really connected


---------26:57----------
really clicked really go on as we got


---------27:00----------
older to like 18 19 she started getting


---------27:04----------
into drug use and I wasn't into that and


---------27:07----------
she got very like judgmental towards me


---------27:11----------
because I wasn't interested in drugs and


---------27:15----------
it started kind of kind of getting into


---------27:16----------
peer pressure of like you know all you


---------27:19----------
being boring oh oh you're a [ __ ] for


---------27:21----------
like not wanting to do it and I'm like


---------27:23----------
yeah I don't know I just like have this


---------27:25----------
I just don't I'm just not interested


---------27:26----------
just internally resistant I just don't


---------27:29----------
want to do it like um and that like


---------27:32----------
seemed like like they didn't really


---------27:33----------
shouldn't really respect that and she'd


---------27:37----------
slowly kind of like I don't know like


---------27:39----------
she'd start talking like trash about me


---------27:43----------
like to the people around me and like


---------27:45----------
saying that I was like judgmental and um


---------27:49----------
like up my own ass but like and


---------27:53----------
condescending and think that I'm a above


---------27:55----------
her because of I wanted to be like clean


---------28:03----------
and not what when I say clean I don't


---------28:05----------
mean like there's anything dirty about


---------28:06----------
drugs um just as like the ceiling of


---------28:08----------
like being clean like I do yeah yeah


---------28:10----------
doing drugs I'm correcting myself now


---------28:13----------
because I don't want to seem like I'm


---------28:14----------
clothing being condescending or being


---------28:15----------
above anyone even it's like I'm talking


---------28:19----------
about it um but yeah and then over time


---------28:22----------
like it just the relationship just got


---------28:26----------
really mean and oh my god


---------28:31----------
so I so I used to do like YouTube videos


---------28:34----------
when I was younger um cuz I was very


---------28:37----------
like shortened I used to make call of


---------28:39----------
duty commentaries on YouTube and I


---------28:42----------
really enjoyed doing them and I actually


---------28:44----------
was pretty successful like for my age I


---------28:48----------
was about 18 and I had about 80,000


---------28:50----------
subscribers and it was really cool I'm


---------28:52----------
proud of it and


---------28:55----------
then she would always introduce me as


---------28:57----------
like oh this is Lucy like she's famous


---------28:59----------
on YouTube but I'm like all can you not


---------29:01----------
like I don't want to like that's not I


---------29:03----------
don't that like just makes me sound like


---------29:05----------
an [ __ ] and she was always like if we


---------29:09----------
ever got into an argument she would use


---------29:13----------
like that card of like oh you think


---------29:14----------
you're better than me because of like


---------29:17----------
where you're at and um she'd like accuse


---------29:21----------
me of being jealous and stuff a lot and


---------29:23----------
I know like looking back now it's like I


---------29:25----------
understand that she has like a lot of


---------29:27----------
issues that she'd put on to me but I


---------29:29----------
think I just like gobbled them all up


---------29:31----------
and for that I was like this horrific


---------29:32----------
horrible


---------29:34----------
like person and


---------29:39----------
I don't know I'm trying


---------29:43----------
how that connects to like


---------29:45----------
everything but like when you're in the


---------29:46----------
maze it's hard to see I'm sure sure can


---------29:48----------
see maybe maybe we can help you out with


---------29:53----------
that yeah


---------29:55----------
the combined wisdom of short chat in


---------29:57----------
myself oh no I'm not even looking at


---------29:59----------
Twitter I was like I'm not either does


---------30:01----------
it go to a chat trick chats pretty good


---------30:04----------
though actually so so let's just think


---------30:06----------
through once again mathematically like


---------30:08----------
what happened right so there's this


---------30:09----------
person who's your best friend you guys


---------30:11----------
connect y'all play xbox you've been a


---------30:13----------
little bit lonely it sounds like through


---------30:16----------
middle school and and when you got to


---------30:18----------
high school and where what you have an


---------30:20----------
accent where are you from generally I'm


---------30:22----------
from England


---------30:23----------
okay from Burton yeah okay so um so you


---------30:27----------
were kind of I think you used the words


---------30:29----------
shut in a little bit yeah I was a sure


---------30:31----------
enough just like homebody yeah and so


---------30:34----------
you had this friend and this person that


---------30:36----------
you really connect with and and amy is


---------30:38----------
like soup Amy right yeah yeah and so


---------30:42----------
y'all are y'all are close and he's she's


---------30:44----------
your friend and she's your officially


---------30:45----------
yes because I've always been like oh you


---------30:48----------
see like girls and cliques like all the


---------30:50----------
cool girls in high school and I was like


---------30:51----------
a goof yes I was like yeah I have me


---------30:55----------
like one of these best friends yeah


---------30:57----------
absolutely right so you were you were


---------31:00----------
hungry for something you were hungry for


---------31:03----------
companionship and friendship and here


---------31:05----------
comes along Amy and you know you kind of


---------31:09----------
described in a very like logical way


---------31:11----------
that there was like sort of this decline


---------31:12----------
that started around drug use and it


---------31:15----------
sounds like she took a lot of your


---------31:18----------
choices personally like she felt like if


---------31:22----------
you're not using drugs she was


---------31:25----------
projecting so in psychology and


---------31:28----------
psychiatry we call that projecting she


---------31:30----------
was projecting her insecurities she was


---------31:32----------
calling you judgmental even though like


---------31:35----------
and we could talk a little bit about


---------31:37----------
this so people


---------31:39----------
people sometimes hate the thing that


---------31:43----------
they hate the most in the world is


---------31:45----------
someone who they could be yes yeah and


---------31:49----------
and we we talked about this a little


---------31:51----------
couple weeks ago on Devon stream but


---------31:53----------
like my theory of trolls on the Internet


---------31:55----------
is that like the reason that they troll


---------31:57----------
is because they look at someone and they


---------31:59----------
feel like if they were different they


---------32:01----------
could be the person that they choose to


---------32:03----------
troll yeah and so what they have to do


---------32:06----------
is like knock people down a peg to make


---------32:08----------
themselves feel better yeah and so what


---------32:11----------
she's got to do is like when you're when


---------32:12----------
when she's using drugs and you're sober


---------32:14----------
and you've got 80,000 subscribers on


---------32:16----------
YouTube


---------32:18----------
like or where either of you


---------32:20----------
professionally oriented or successful or


---------32:23----------
academic or anything like that no we're


---------32:25----------
both no we both we both like didn't go


---------32:28----------
to college didn't go yeah so University


---------32:32----------
absolutely right so like like if you


---------32:34----------
think about both of you guys are so


---------32:36----------
similar but they're a couple of really


---------32:39----------
important differences between you and


---------32:41----------
her and those are that first of all you


---------32:45----------
choose not to use drugs yeah and the


---------32:47----------
second is that you're professionally


---------32:51----------
successful in some way despite college


---------32:54----------
so there's like there's like the


---------32:56----------
jealousy and envy of everyone who


---------32:58----------
decides to go to university and you know


---------33:00----------
becomes an accountant which is like


---------33:02----------
they're like a normal functional member


---------33:04----------
of society and then there's the two of


---------33:06----------
you and you guys you your bond is so


---------33:09----------
deep because both of y'all are misfits


---------33:11----------
yeah and in both of you are rejects yeah


---------33:15----------
and so it's okay for both of you guys to


---------33:17----------
[ __ ] up yeah but then you committed the


---------33:21----------
most cardinal sin Lucy you didn't


---------33:24----------
actually [ __ ] up yeah you're someone who


---------33:27----------
walked her path but decided not to use


---------33:30----------
drugs and became YouTube famous yeah and


---------33:33----------
so she every day when she wakes up and


---------33:36----------
she sees you she sees the thugs so hard


---------33:40----------
absolutely yeah right


---------33:45----------
and then because she's like oh it's then


---------33:47----------
what happens is the guilt arises the


---------33:49----------
shame arises like Oh Lucy's actually


---------33:51----------
better than I and then what she has to


---------33:53----------
do is she has to protect herself for


---------33:54----------
Matt right yeah we've talked about this


---------33:56----------
before but remember that the ego arises


---------33:59----------
in order to protect you from negative


---------34:01----------
emotion yeah so she starts to feel guilt


---------34:04----------
and shame the ego steps in and then she


---------34:07----------
starts being judgmental towards you


---------34:09----------
right every person that she introduces


---------34:12----------
you to she's got to tell them that


---------34:15----------
you're famous on YouTube because if it


---------34:17----------
comes out 15 minutes into the


---------34:18----------
conversation they're gonna be really


---------34:20----------
impressed right oh I like a way like cuz


---------34:26----------
I just got really embarrassed by I was


---------34:27----------
like oh my god she's just like I don't


---------34:29----------
know yeah you got a bear spy it because


---------34:32----------
you're an empathic person and you


---------34:33----------
realize that she's insulting you in


---------34:35----------
public but that's not what it looks like


---------34:39----------
I'm kidding sorry that's a joke but oh


---------34:41----------
right so like this is this is like


---------34:44----------
someone saying like so a hi my name is


---------34:45----------
olive Canoga I'm I'm on faculty at


---------34:47----------
Harvard Medical School like it's the


---------34:49----------
second word out of like second think I


---------34:50----------
know mine that's a dick thing to say and


---------34:51----------
then if someone introduces reduce me


---------34:55----------
down to this YouTube favorite I'm just


---------34:57----------
like I'm so much more than that like


---------34:58----------
that was a byproduct of me being me you


---------35:01----------
know like yeah yeah yeah I didn't think


---------35:04----------
of it like that


---------35:04----------
oh my god and and so she's got a she's


---------35:07----------
got to pull the gun out and sort of like


---------35:09----------
it and the funny thing is she can't you


---------35:11----------
can't if she like if you complain about


---------35:14----------
that but she's like oh no I'm trying to


---------35:16----------
like tell everyone how awesome you are


---------35:17----------
but she's actually doing the exact


---------35:19----------
opposite she's been it's no yeah yeah


---------35:23----------
yeah and and that's what she's got to do


---------35:25----------
because if people find out that like not


---------35:27----------
only are you a normal human being that


---------35:29----------
they like and your YouTube famous and


---------35:32----------
your humble about it and it's not how


---------35:34----------
you define yourself


---------35:35----------
yeah that's intolerable I also feel like


---------35:38----------
I need to disclaim I'm also not YouTube


---------35:40----------
famous anymore just like what but yeah


---------35:43----------
how does it feel how does it feel to say


---------35:45----------
you're not YouTube famous oh it's nice


---------35:48----------
like a weight off my shoulders like I


---------35:49----------
mean yeah right so that's kind of weird


---------35:52----------
so let's just let's just pause and pay


---------35:54----------
attention to that for a second okay so


---------35:56----------
one would think that admitting


---------35:58----------
your failures or that you're a has-been


---------36:01----------
would lead to a sense of lack of


---------36:05----------
self-confidence oh yeah I kind of what I


---------36:07----------
have been through that like process of


---------36:11----------
like my mind being like oh God


---------36:13----------
everyone's gonna be so judgmental like


---------36:15----------
of because I have friends that are wrong


---------36:17----------
like millions of subscribers now um and


---------36:20----------
I'm like all [ __ ] like think that bet


---------36:24----------
they think I'm like a but I'm like you


---------36:25----------
know what it's actually like really nice


---------36:28----------
to


---------36:30----------
no that sounds like an Amy thought


---------36:34----------
I bet they think I'm a burnout yeah like


---------36:38----------
that's it any thought


---------36:39----------
you see that very yeah wait that's the


---------36:41----------
kind of thing that Amy used to think


---------36:42----------
about you oh my god if she liked the


---------36:45----------
little voice in my head now those


---------36:47----------
judgments cuz it happens like I get a


---------36:50----------
kind of I have yes you should be really


---------36:53----------
bad but it's not as bad anymore but yeah


---------36:55----------
like I have um like some quite like very


---------37:00----------
like famous people like syndicate and


---------37:02----------
there was this guy called like ksi who


---------37:04----------
were like huge huge youtubers I used to


---------37:06----------
be like quiet friends with the ball I


---------37:07----------
got kind of embarrassed I kind of


---------37:09----------
returned to the internet again as this


---------37:11----------
you know more like spiritual laid-back


---------37:13----------
like hippie rather than like a super


---------37:16----------
intense like gamer with like I used to


---------37:20----------
have like a lot of opinions negative


---------37:23----------
ones I used to like run ting and like I


---------37:26----------
don't know but yeah I how do you feel


---------37:31----------
right now is he


---------37:35----------
embarrassed I why


---------37:39----------
[Music]


---------37:43----------
Oh No um about like all of my


---------37:48----------
projections and like what what does that


---------37:51----------
mean projections what do you mean well


---------37:52----------
my um like explaining like


---------37:58----------
how how I feel about and like talking


---------38:04----------
about my judgments and thoughts that I


---------38:05----------
have like sometimes I feel kind of like


---------38:07----------
ashamed of them and especially I still


---------38:11----------
low-key feel like I'm I'm like somehow


---------38:14----------
like bragging goes something by saying


---------38:16----------
that like I was friends with famous


---------38:18----------
people it's like it's just part of like


---------38:21----------
the story it's not like me trying to


---------38:24----------
brag but yeah that's an Amy comment yeah


---------38:29----------
so so the other thing that is is those


---------38:32----------
are the thoughts so you have this like


---------38:35----------
program running like in the back of your


---------38:37----------
computer


---------38:38----------
yeah of your mind that judges what you


---------38:42----------
say based on how other people are gonna


---------38:44----------
perceive it oh yeah no that's exactly it


---------38:47----------
right and and we're gonna call that


---------38:49----------
thing Amy


---------38:53----------
that's Amy Exe like that's that's


---------38:57----------
actually hilarious because it's and


---------38:59----------
Sholay is true like it's sad so now I'm


---------39:03----------
gonna ask you Lucy when you pull out the


---------39:06----------
tarot cards what program are you trying


---------39:08----------
to shut down um Amy and anything else in


---------39:12----------
my life that's been that program you


---------39:14----------
know like I have this I made my own


---------39:17----------
little deck and it's like you know


---------39:20----------
things like listen to yourself like


---------39:22----------
connect with your heart like what your


---------39:24----------
intentions let your guard down like it's


---------39:26----------
safe to trust things and it's just like


---------39:29----------
this is literally like I don't know it's


---------39:32----------
just like I don't know it's like a


---------39:34----------
little nice messages that I'm like yeah


---------39:36----------
that I'd like trying to dry out like


---------39:38----------
drown out like even today like I was


---------39:40----------
crapping myself coming on to this Cole I


---------39:42----------
was like like I was so anxious I felt


---------39:45----------
really sick and I was like you know it's


---------39:48----------
like meditate chill breathe what were


---------39:52----------
you feeling oh my god


---------39:55----------
I was anxious about being able to like


---------39:57----------
communicate want my issues off cuz as I


---------39:59----------
said like like trying to categorize like


---------40:03----------
I'm a whole like I'm a bit of a mess you


---------40:06----------
know like I've got a lot of like


---------40:08----------
different she's going on and like any


---------40:10----------
bleed out into like different places


---------40:12----------
oh there's core issues that affect a lot


---------40:15----------
of things yeah so let me so it sounds


---------40:19----------
like what you were embarrassed about is


---------40:20----------
that if you came on here unless you had


---------40:22----------
everything sorted out people would think


---------40:24----------
that you were stupid for not


---------40:25----------
understanding your issues so what I'm


---------40:30----------
sorry what program is that well I could


---------40:34----------
quote a myeonghui but I feel like not


---------40:38----------
all of its from her but we can yeah I


---------40:40----------
completely agree yeah yeah so I I think


---------40:42----------
that there are multiple things so yeah


---------40:43----------
so this the Sun script word for this is


---------40:46----------
a some scar essay msk ARA and as twitch


---------40:50----------
ad is telling me this is like malware so


---------40:53----------
like I want I want you guys to


---------40:55----------
understand this that like as we go


---------40:56----------
through life we accumulate these


---------40:59----------
negative bundles of emotion that we


---------41:01----------
don't process yeah and what happens is


---------41:03----------
that bundle of emotion forms like some


---------41:06----------
kind of pattern which psychology calls a


---------41:08----------
schema sch EMA son script calls a some


---------41:14----------
Scott and it's kind of like this little


---------41:16----------
thing that's like operating in your mind


---------41:18----------
that changes the way your mind works


---------41:22----------
because when you're by yourself you're


---------41:23----------
like a completely normal person and even


---------41:26----------
on stream even on streams so even though


---------41:29----------
you're feeling embarrassment I think


---------41:30----------
you're being mostly authentic and I


---------41:32----------
think that I don't think anyone thinks


---------41:34----------
you're arrogant for having eighty


---------41:36----------
thousand YouTube subscribers at the age


---------41:38----------
of eighteen I don't think anyone thinks


---------41:40----------
that you think you're better than anyone


---------41:42----------
else for like knowing famous youtubers


---------41:44----------
because you used to be together I think


---------41:45----------
it's just a statement of fact that's the


---------41:47----------
way I interpret it yeah


---------41:49----------
but you've got this some scar which is


---------41:52----------
this little ball of undigested emotion


---------41:55----------
which when Amy did this to you she was


---------41:57----------
your friend she was your one person you


---------41:59----------
were hungry for friendship she was your


---------42:00----------
best friend


---------42:01----------
and you guys were both the rejects right


---------42:04----------
y'all were both the misfits neither


---------42:06----------
y'all went to university neither of you


---------42:08----------
guys had jobs or I mean I haven't asked


---------42:11----------
you about relationships but um you know


---------42:14----------
like like you guys didn't have something


---------42:16----------
that when you went to Thanksgiving and


---------42:18----------
you see your aunt or uncle and they


---------42:19----------
asked you what are you up to nowadays


---------42:21----------
you didn't have an answer that has them


---------42:23----------
nodding and respect yeah yeah I mean


---------42:27----------
then YouTube think even though that


---------42:28----------
seems cool they would still like they


---------42:30----------
weren't not in a respect temple yeah


---------42:33----------
yeah they'd have something more than her


---------42:36----------
at least yeah right which is big when


---------42:39----------
you've got nothing so like when either


---------42:41----------
you all have nothing and then you've got


---------42:42----------
something and then that creates that


---------42:43----------
problem for her and then she starts


---------42:45----------
attacking you and this is someone that


---------42:47----------
you formed a relationship that you were


---------42:49----------
vulnerable towards yeah you were


---------42:51----------
authentic you guys had this connection


---------42:53----------
we just when she starts attacking you


---------42:54----------
that hurts


---------42:55----------
yeah and that hurts a lot because your


---------42:58----------
tribes me being like like it's like it's


---------43:01----------
I was taking everything that you're


---------43:02----------
saying is true yes I didn't have any


---------43:05----------
other external support to be like yo


---------43:07----------
loose like she's she's like projecting


---------43:09----------
her [ __ ] on you you know yes I tried to


---------43:11----------
speak to my mum about it and one was


---------43:14----------
like kind of like yeah just jealous you


---------43:16----------
know and it's like so what did that do


---------43:19----------
to your internal sense of confidence I


---------43:21----------
took of myself you own it yeah and I


---------43:24----------
know it's not like every time like I'm


---------43:25----------
doing something while I'm always like


---------43:27----------
okay gotta make sure like I'm not sound


---------43:29----------
like I can't it's almost like a calm I'm


---------43:31----------
not allowed to be successful like I'm


---------43:32----------
always beating myself up for like even


---------43:35----------
wanting like something good yes because


---------43:38----------
that's a me judging you for being


---------43:40----------
successful yeah right so now what you've


---------43:43----------
done is you've internalized that Amy


---------43:45----------
viruses malware yeah and and when you're


---------43:49----------
with yourself you don't have to be


---------43:51----------
successful you don't have to appear to


---------43:52----------
be successful what turns on the malware


---------43:56----------
is other people's appearance or judgment


---------44:00----------
of your appearance success


---------44:02----------
yeah and also just a judgment of me like


---------44:05----------
as as me not even in regards to success


---------44:09----------
like sometimes I can literally just be


---------44:11----------
in a conversation with somebody and it


---------44:12----------
and it turns on us like hey am i making


---------44:16----------
this person feel bad or like I don't


---------44:19----------
know just like questioning like how I'm


---------44:21----------
being perceived um or judged and like it


---------44:26----------
even with success like out of the


---------44:28----------
equation like I just


---------44:31----------
I just like I don't know I hate it so it


---------44:35----------
sucks yeah right it's very powerful so


---------44:40----------
now I'm gonna ask you a question that


---------44:42----------
maybe you don't have an answer to which


---------44:44----------
is perfectly fine so Lucy it's fine to


---------44:46----------
understand that you got this bit of


---------44:48----------
malware there actually I think the


---------44:49----------
reason that you say they're not all Amy


---------44:51----------
is because the truth is that you have


---------44:52----------
multiple some scars and each some scar


---------44:54----------
is like activated by a slightly


---------44:56----------
different scenario yeah and what I want


---------45:00----------
you to notice about a some scar is that


---------45:01----------
you're yourself except when it becomes


---------45:03----------
active and then you become someone else


---------45:05----------
it's like the confident quiet person


---------45:08----------
disappears the other thing I'll tell you


---------45:11----------
about some scars is according to like


---------45:12----------
yogic theory the some scar retains the


---------45:15----------
age at which it was formed ya know I


---------45:18----------
relate to that a lot and and so right


---------45:21----------
now you're 24 yeah and so when you when


---------45:25----------
Amy exe activates you become like 18


---------45:28----------
again yeah and so all the person that


---------45:31----------
you've become all the growth that you've


---------45:33----------
experienced actually deactivates it's


---------45:36----------
like you shut off that program and


---------45:37----------
that's why it's so damn perplexing


---------45:39----------
because you're like I've become more


---------45:41----------
confident I'm confident in myself I


---------45:43----------
spent all this time meditating and


---------45:45----------
reflecting and I know I'm a good person


---------45:46----------
so why is it that all of those feelings


---------45:48----------
just randomly go out the window in some


---------45:51----------
circumstances yeah and so I want you to


---------45:53----------
recognize that your brain is literally


---------45:56----------
like a CPU that's running different


---------45:57----------
programs and there's 24 year-old


---------46:00----------
spiritual adviser Lucy who helps people


---------46:03----------
and is confident in herself and then


---------46:06----------
even while you're that person sometimes


---------46:08----------
Amy exe activates and in the middle of a


---------46:11----------
session with someone is a meaty XE


---------46:14----------
activates you can't just talk to that


---------46:15----------
person you need the crutch of the tarot


---------46:17----------
cards yeah that's a third program yeah


---------46:21----------
right which is like a full screen like


---------46:23----------
this is video games or other things that


---------46:25----------
that when we have this negative some


---------46:26----------
scar that activates we have to pull up a


---------46:29----------
third program to like put that other


---------46:31----------
[ __ ] into the background yeah yeah


---------46:34----------
because it is well like trying to


---------46:35----------
operate still while you have that going


---------46:38----------
on like you just like switch internally


---------46:41----------
and it's like oh [ __ ] like how do I yeah


---------46:44----------
function right now I need a minute like


---------46:45----------
I need to go like yeah it's like one of


---------46:48----------
those pop-up ads where you click the X


---------46:50----------
and that's a link to open up another pop


---------46:52----------
I can't pop-up ad and it's not a real X


---------46:54----------
yeah and especially don't looks like


---------46:57----------
just can't go down like stream it's like


---------47:02----------
you know it's funny cuz like I I you


---------47:07----------
know it's probably like very normal you


---------47:09----------
know for that for that to happen and


---------47:11----------
like I I've been trying to be more aware


---------47:14----------
of it's like activation I've been


---------47:18----------
practicing like a few things like not


---------47:19----------
taking things personally and not jumping


---------47:21----------
to conclusions because that's what Amy


---------47:23----------
does you know Amy jumps to conclusions


---------47:25----------
and she takes like what were the people


---------47:27----------
saying she takes it personally but yeah


---------47:30----------
like when it does it's reduced the


---------47:33----------
activation rate but um yeah it's it's


---------47:37----------
still that and when it is it's just very


---------47:39----------
hard to like function as a person


---------47:41----------
absolutely


---------47:42----------
so Lucy interaction wallet iPhone in I


---------47:45----------
think I think you've started by actually


---------47:47----------
so my question was gonna be okay it's


---------47:48----------
fine to figure all this stuff out what


---------47:51----------
do we do about it right like how now


---------47:54----------
what and I think you've actually done a


---------47:55----------
fantastic job of the first answer which


---------47:58----------
is I think the first thing you need to


---------47:59----------
do if you have these kinds of intrusive


---------48:01----------
thoughts and like for people who are


---------48:02----------
watching I want you to just think about


---------48:04----------
this scenario right so your your normal


---------48:06----------
self and then some circumstances arise


---------48:08----------
that your mind starts going like [ __ ]


---------48:11----------
haywire it just starts malfunctioning


---------48:13----------
and thinking all these thoughts that you


---------48:15----------
don't want them to think and you're like


---------48:16----------
why are these coming back it's just like


---------48:18----------
malware malware is a beautiful way to


---------48:20----------
put it and so the question is like how


---------48:22----------
do we conquer it like what do you think


---------48:23----------
Lucy how do we um probably like Charing


---------48:28----------
get to the root of light why did you


---------48:30----------
download the malware like why did it


---------48:31----------
come yeah and then how much one install


---------48:36----------
it um probably do you like I don't know


---------48:40----------
cuz this is why it's like this is why


---------48:41----------
I've come to you you know I think young


---------48:43----------
need support they need to go to a


---------48:45----------
professional to like health and diagnose


---------48:47----------
and like run a diagnosis all right you


---------48:50----------
thought my halwa and this is what it's


---------48:51----------
doing and um well I guess like on my own


---------48:54----------
side what I've been trying to do is like


---------48:58----------
diagnose like what it is and like what


---------49:01----------
it what it's doing with the limit like


---------49:04----------
from from inside the mal WA which has


---------49:06----------
been kind of hard and then try to


---------49:08----------
beautiful result like reduce how much


---------49:10----------
it's kind of coming up but I don't


---------49:12----------
actually know the solution I was loving


---------49:14----------
this tell me I will so I'm loving this


---------49:18----------
analogy more and more because like I I


---------49:19----------
just love the way are you using the


---------49:21----------
language to actually describe so I think


---------49:22----------
you're spot on the first thing you have


---------49:24----------
to figure out where did you get the


---------49:25----------
[ __ ] bow where right yeah where did


---------49:28----------
this where did these thoughts originate


---------49:29----------
yeah the second thing that you noticed


---------49:32----------
is that when you're operating from


---------49:34----------
within the malware it's really hard to


---------49:37----------
shut it off or impossible to shut it off


---------49:38----------
yeah right so what we've got to do is


---------49:42----------
step outside of the malware that's how


---------49:46----------
we're gonna diagnose it but the first


---------49:47----------
thing is that you know to recognize that


---------49:50----------
okay this actually is not me right now


---------49:53----------
but when you're on stream with someone


---------49:56----------
and you lose confidence and you feel


---------49:57----------
like you're not doing a good job the


---------49:59----------
first thing is to recognize that this is


---------50:01----------
the malware this is a me exe that's


---------50:03----------
activating it's not me okay and until


---------50:06----------
you know what a me exe is you can't tell


---------50:09----------
the difference and even route because


---------50:11----------
it's like I recognize it's happening but


---------50:13----------
I'm like is this me what's going on but


---------50:15----------
if I'm seen it's like something external


---------50:17----------
it's easier to like deal with in


---------50:19----------
separation yeah like that the other


---------50:21----------
thing is to be compassionate towards the


---------50:24----------
malware yeah right is to understand that


---------50:27----------
there's some guy in like Russia or the


---------50:29----------
Ukraine was just trying to make ends


---------50:31----------
meet so he wrote this virus and installs


---------50:34----------
money on your computer and that that guy


---------50:37----------
is just trying to bribe read and milk


---------50:39----------
and sort of understand that there's a


---------50:40----------
part of you that is actually


---------50:42----------
eighteen-year-old Lucy who feels hurt


---------50:44----------
and rejected yeah and what that person


---------50:47----------
needs is like your support right like


---------50:50----------
what ami needed and I think you did a


---------50:51----------
fantastic job of this Lucy like when I


---------50:53----------
was talking to you about what was going


---------50:55----------
on in Amy's mind you tossed this same


---------50:57----------
out there oh my god that must have been


---------50:59----------
really hard for her yeah right I mean it


---------51:03----------
was it was so weird like the dynamic at


---------51:05----------
the relationship I ended up with me


---------51:07----------
being a lot of like supporting her


---------51:09----------
through that and she'd go through these


---------51:11----------
like


---------51:11----------
um switch modes why she'd be like


---------51:13----------
recognized like Oh Lucy you're actually


---------51:15----------
really good puss and like actually I'm


---------51:17----------
sorry for like judging you like that and


---------51:19----------
then like switch because then it was


---------51:22----------
like oh if I recognize her as a good


---------51:24----------
purse and then she then becomes even


---------51:26----------
better than me and then Lucy you know


---------51:31----------
what you're doing right now


---------51:32----------
well you're diagnosing malware within


---------51:35----------
Amy you see that yeah I have like a


---------51:38----------
natural thing with that I'm quite good


---------51:40----------
with diagnose in people's malware and I


---------51:41----------
always feel like a and this is probably


---------51:43----------
like I set for it yeah mine but I always


---------51:45----------
feel like oh no like I don't want to


---------51:48----------
call out people's like oh yeah it's


---------51:49----------
clearly shadow but I'm quite good at


---------51:51----------
diagnosing people's mom yeah what so


---------51:54----------
you're noticing that amy has this one


---------51:56----------
mode of operation in something awakens


---------51:58----------
within her where she's got to treat you


---------52:00----------
like a [ __ ] yeah yeah and and so all of


---------52:04----------
us have malware all of us we all have


---------52:07----------
some scars


---------52:09----------
and so the first thing is to recognize


---------52:10----------
okay like this is where it came from the


---------52:12----------
second thing is to recognize when it


---------52:14----------
arises that this is actually not me but


---------52:17----------
that doesn't mean that it doesn't


---------52:18----------
deserve space in your head like you


---------52:21----------
can't just delete it or close the


---------52:24----------
program or something like that just


---------52:25----------
recognize that when this malware


---------52:27----------
activates oddly enough the more that you


---------52:29----------
fight against it quick if you like go


---------52:32----------
and you like like you know if you


---------52:33----------
control-alt-delete and like end the


---------52:35----------
process the malware just like pops up


---------52:37----------
again you can't just shut it off by


---------52:40----------
knowing that just understand that it's


---------52:41----------
activating and then like just you just


---------52:44----------
recognize that okay I'm feeling I'm not


---------52:46----------
feeling confident right now


---------52:47----------
this is like the Amy DXE it's gonna feel


---------52:50----------
a lack of confidence for a time and


---------52:53----------
that's actually okay because if you


---------52:55----------
actually just sit with the feelings of


---------52:57----------
Amy and you're not gonna it's hard to


---------52:59----------
recognize this because any time it


---------53:01----------
activates what happens is you go to your


---------53:03----------
comfort yeah and when you go to your


---------53:05----------
comfort the process goes into the


---------53:07----------
background and then you don't actually


---------53:09----------
get to like emotionally metabolize any


---------53:13----------
of that negativity so just sit with it


---------53:15----------
try to put on a face and just recognize


---------53:17----------
that okay on the inside there's gonna be


---------53:19----------
this whole process going on and I'm just


---------53:21----------
gonna keep talking like exactly like


---------53:23----------
what I'm doing on Twitch right now which


---------53:25----------
is internally I'm filled with anxiety


---------53:27----------
and thoughts of judgment and all of


---------53:30----------
these kinds of things but I'm just gonna


---------53:32----------
keep talking and play pretend and as


---------53:34----------
long as I recognize that I'm filled with


---------53:36----------
anxiety over time the anxiety is


---------53:38----------
actually gonna go away yeah yeah I have


---------53:41----------
a hard time saying when anxiety arises


---------53:43----------
I'm just like shut it down like yes and


---------53:46----------
it's like oh yeah absolutely through it


---------53:49----------
I like cuz because I think as well it's


---------53:51----------
like resistance like oh if I'm anxious


---------53:53----------
it means like I'm not doing wash like


---------53:55----------
should be doing go like this is a


---------53:58----------
warning sign of like stop what you're


---------54:01----------
doing like do something different you


---------54:03----------
know yeah so so just recognize that your


---------54:07----------
impulse is gonna be to shut it down and


---------54:09----------
as best as you can just ride it out I


---------54:11----------
want everyone to understand that like


---------54:14----------
feelings like anxiety or actually like a


---------54:16----------
wave and if you just wait the wave is


---------54:19----------
gonna like it builds up builds up builds


---------54:21----------
up feels like it's imposter


---------54:23----------
and if you try to stop the wave it


---------54:24----------
doesn't work but if you just leave the


---------54:26----------
wave alone it's gonna like crest and


---------54:29----------
then it's gonna collapse all on its own


---------54:32----------
yes all you have to do is just ride it


---------54:34----------
out and so when I'm talking to people


---------54:37----------
who have addiction problems we talked


---------54:39----------
about this principle called urge surfing


---------54:41----------
and to recognize that an urge is going


---------54:45----------
to arise to use whether it be a video


---------54:48----------
game or drugs or alcohol or marijuana or


---------54:52----------
whatever and that you don't have to


---------54:53----------
resist the impulse forever you just have


---------54:56----------
to resist the urge so just ride it yeah


---------54:59----------
surf along top and then over time like


---------55:02----------
that wave is gonna crash on its own and


---------55:03----------
then you'll be completely fine and the


---------55:06----------
more that you just practice that like


---------55:10----------
recognize you don't have to actually


---------55:11----------
take a step back from anything you're


---------55:13----------
doing just just sit with the feelings


---------55:15----------
that you've got recognize that there's


---------55:17----------
an 18 year old version of you who's


---------55:20----------
alive and got really really hurt by


---------55:23----------
being yourself because the only thing


---------55:25----------
you were is yourself yeah an Amy [ __ ]


---------55:30----------
punished you for it yeah and so now when


---------55:33----------
you try to be yourself like you learn


---------55:35----------
this is a learned behavior Lucy you


---------55:37----------
learned that if you're just like a good


---------55:39----------
person someone's gonna [ __ ] you over


---------55:42----------
that people are gonna hate you for it


---------55:44----------
and then you wonder why aren't you


---------55:47----------
confident it's because in the past when


---------55:49----------
you've been confident it did not go well


---------55:51----------
the one person you cared about your best


---------55:53----------
friend stabbed you in the back just


---------55:55----------
because you were a decent human being


---------55:57----------
who didn't use drugs oh dude that's so


---------56:00----------
like it's really absolutely mean I don't


---------56:05----------
think she realized was oh yeah I feel


---------56:07----------
like just in day to day like you don't


---------56:09----------
realize the impact that you make why not


---------56:12----------
you [ __ ] like that and yeah like I've


---------56:16----------
tried to speak to people in the past


---------56:18----------
about it and I think like you know if


---------56:22----------
people can like look at you and like


---------56:23----------
look at all you've got why did you not


---------56:25----------
feel confident like you've got all this


---------56:27----------
that's just like


---------56:29----------
I'm really glad that I came on this coal


---------56:32----------
yeah I'm glad you did too so let's go


---------56:35----------
ahead and transition let's see if people


---------56:37----------
have questions or you have this this


---------56:39----------
question bot so I'm gonna see if I find


---------56:42----------
it really interesting that you called it


---------56:43----------
malware to some like that no that's


---------56:46----------
twitch chat see I'm telling you this is


---------56:48----------
it's not just me it's me and twitch chat


---------56:50----------
twitch chat call it malware so I


---------56:52----------
actually did like a guided meditation


---------56:53----------
once Wow I imagined it because I really


---------56:57----------
liked computers like okay I'm gonna do


---------57:00----------
control-alt-delete


---------57:01----------
I'm gonna look at my processes like see


---------57:04----------
like a processes tab going on I'm gonna


---------57:05----------
like look and yep and and stop close


---------57:08----------
I'll be like anxiety exe okay delete and


---------57:12----------
I was like dude all of these things I


---------57:14----------
don't doing like okay virus scan okay


---------57:18----------
clear out junk I don't was actually like


---------57:21----------
pretty good like it this is like coping


---------57:23----------
mechanisms but even deeper than that


---------57:26----------
like I really like the idea that you


---------57:29----------
know we all roll just computers and when


---------57:31----------
were born we just like you know download


---------57:33----------
software and throughout our lives you


---------57:35----------
know were downloading different


---------57:37----------
information viruses malware connecting


---------57:41----------
with different computers exchanging


---------57:43----------
information you know cutting away


---------57:44----------
connections and just always trying to


---------57:46----------
evolve and like upgrade and sometimes


---------57:48----------
people have better Mouse's and keyboards


---------57:51----------
and some people have three monitors one


---------57:54----------
person might have the cheap [ __ ] one and


---------57:56----------
you know it just is what it is


---------57:58----------
and you know sometimes you don't realize


---------58:01----------
that where the computer we think with


---------58:02----------
the programs that are running in it


---------58:04----------
because it's just so deeply ingrained


---------58:06----------
and then even further than that I


---------58:08----------
believe like we're all actually just the


---------58:10----------
electricity running through that running


---------58:12----------
through those computers and when we die


---------58:15----------
the electricity just goes back yeah yeah


---------58:18----------
that's that's a really great analogy I


---------58:21----------
think the interesting thing about some


---------58:23----------
scars from the yogic perspective is that


---------58:25----------
they believe that some of your


---------58:26----------
programming get happens even before


---------58:28----------
birth oh yeah like I'm I like I'm


---------58:31----------
interested in like past lives and things


---------58:33----------
like that yeah so you should check out


---------58:34----------
something called this is like not really


---------58:36----------
great science but there's a great theory


---------58:38----------
called inherited trauma which is this


---------58:41----------
idea that like


---------58:43----------
children of Holocaust survivors have


---------58:47----------
some symptoms of PTSD and so apparently


---------58:53----------
like they're they're like not genetic


---------58:55----------
level changes but something called


---------58:56----------
epigenetic level changes that allow


---------58:58----------
prior experiences to be like passed on


---------59:01----------
to kids yeah and the prevailing theory


---------59:04----------
was that this was just sort of like


---------59:05----------
psychological and upbringing like a


---------59:06----------
nurture thing like if you experienced


---------59:08----------
PTSD that that affects the way that you


---------59:10----------
parent right and so because of your


---------59:12----------
parenting changes that someone else


---------59:14----------
grows up a particular way but that has


---------59:16----------
nothing to do with like birth it's just


---------59:18----------
all your the circumstances and you grew


---------59:20----------
up but some studies actually suggest


---------59:22----------
that their their changes at the


---------59:24----------
epigenetic level which is the activation


---------59:26----------
or on activation of genes which get


---------59:28----------
turned on in the mother and then


---------59:30----------
actually get passed on to the child


---------59:32----------
genetic yeah or in their DNA


---------59:35----------
but yeah so there's we can you know have


---------59:37----------
a separate conversation about


---------59:39----------
reincarnation and past lives and all


---------59:41----------
that stuff yeah but I want to get to two


---------59:44----------
questions if that's okay so one question


---------59:47----------
is Lucy are you using so elmond Reina


---------59:50----------
asks Lucy are you using other people's


---------59:53----------
standards to judge yourself are you


---------59:55----------
trying to see yourself through the eyes


---------59:56----------
of others unsuccessfully [ __ ] yeah no


---------60:00----------
you're right you're right yeah I do


---------60:01----------
judge myself by other people standards


---------60:03----------
especially with the content that I'm


---------60:05----------
into creating I'm always like oh like I


---------60:08----------
need to be like this to be like


---------60:10----------
spiritual or I need to be like this -


---------60:14----------
yeah you're right yeah yeah I do judge


---------60:17----------
myself by other people's standards like


---------60:19----------
cuz my standard I don't [ __ ] judge


---------60:21----------
anyone


---------60:22----------
I think everyone's like I'm like yo you


---------60:23----------
live in your best life like you go go


---------60:25----------
you know I I don't


---------60:29----------
myself by my own standards I'd be a haha


---------60:31----------
I feel a lot happier in that's exactly


---------60:33----------
what I do people kind of my oh my god my


---------60:38----------
brain yeah good job for a chat


---------60:43----------
yeah so someone else so Morphin morph


---------60:47----------
man 30 asks so in a sense Amy is the


---------60:50----------
devil card who Amy's the devil card who


---------60:53----------
has things dragging her down and Lucy is


---------60:54----------
the hermit walking her own path


---------60:56----------
no I guess this person I'm saying to the


---------60:58----------
Tarot yeah yeah that's architects at the


---------61:01----------
Tarot is that can you explain that to us


---------61:04----------
yes card is this person or it's it's a


---------61:10----------
non-physical thing that makes you feel


---------61:12----------
trapped


---------61:12----------
um it's usually dark it's demonized it's


---------61:17----------
the devil Cod it's usually symbolized


---------61:20----------
with like addiction things a taboo it's


---------61:24----------
the it's the things that make you like


---------61:26----------
feel like physically constrained and


---------61:29----------
trapped in something when there's no one


---------61:31----------
actually holding you in anything it's


---------61:34----------
just judgment and usually the best way


---------61:36----------
to kind of get out with it is to like


---------61:38----------
laugh it off and not be so serious and


---------61:40----------
then the Hermit is the archetype of


---------61:42----------
being alone go in your own way he holds


---------61:46----------
like a lantern and he's just on his own


---------61:49----------
path he's in solitude he's like in a


---------61:52----------
deep state of like reflection and of


---------61:54----------
like knowing himself and knowing who he


---------61:56----------
is compared to like out outside like


---------61:59----------
judgment and outside perspectives and


---------62:02----------
like beliefs and standards of like the


---------62:05----------
rest of the world I'd be like isolate so


---------62:07----------
like knows himself so yeah yeah that was


---------62:09----------
interesting


---------62:10----------
yeah that's cool thanks for explaining


---------62:13----------
that no problem so so when you stream do


---------62:16----------
you do like readings and stuff yes so I


---------62:19----------
do like a mixture of different things


---------62:20----------
I've recently started getting into ASM


---------62:22----------
aw because I love like um I don't know I


---------62:26----------
love ice well it brings you into like


---------62:27----------
the present moment but yeah when I


---------62:30----------
stream I have like a little queue and


---------62:32----------
people can come and join in and like ask


---------62:34----------
a question and then I um I like read


---------62:39----------
like read cause and go through those


---------62:40----------
questions and you know we go from any


---------62:43----------
of like you know like what's holding me


---------62:45----------
back right now and the cards show these


---------62:47----------
kind of like archetypes playing out like


---------62:50----------
in your life right now and it's supposed


---------62:53----------
to be like a projection of your


---------62:54----------
subconscious mind onto cards um through


---------62:58----------
symbolism through archetypes and I don't


---------63:02----------
do like fortune-telling I think people


---------63:04----------
have a bit of a thing with tarot cards


---------63:06----------
they think it's like supposed to tell


---------63:07----------
your future and how I use them is like


---------63:10----------
this is a reflection of the processes


---------63:12----------
that are going on right now helping you


---------63:14----------
navigate the maze because it's hard to


---------63:16----------
like navigate when you're in it


---------63:17----------
Tarot can show you more of like the


---------63:21----------
different energies at play or like the


---------63:23----------
different archetypes like at play and


---------63:26----------
yeah that's that's what I mainly do on


---------63:28----------
stream we just talk like life issues and


---------63:30----------
you know processing things and and yeah


---------63:34----------
but use Tarot is like sometimes it's


---------63:37----------
it's probably more of a crutch I could


---------63:38----------
probably just talk to people about that


---------63:40----------
issues without needing the symbolism of


---------63:43----------
like the cards but sometimes it's uh


---------63:45----------
it's very interesting why do you feel


---------63:48----------
like it the Tarot is a crutch um cuz I


---------63:51----------
actually like even in my own style do


---------63:54----------
you like private like private reads but


---------63:57----------
I don't actually use cards I can just


---------63:59----------
quite like I don't know I I say that


---------64:03----------
it's because I work with spirit like I


---------64:05----------
get like answers and I just I'm able to


---------64:07----------
talk with people and communicate and


---------64:09----------
connect with them but I guess like in a


---------64:13----------
scientific way like maybe I'm just both


---------64:14----------
empathic and like could pick up on cues


---------64:16----------
and relate and see um as we kind of


---------64:20----------
pointy I'm quite good at like diagnose


---------64:22----------
like people's malware yeah I don't know


---------64:27----------
how or why like I say that that spirit


---------64:30----------
but it might be something else you know


---------64:32----------
it depends what you believe in really


---------64:34----------
doesn't it um but yeah that's kind of


---------64:37----------
like what I do on stream really is that


---------64:40----------
but I don't always die don't always


---------64:43----------
diagnose malware like I do you don't


---------64:45----------
want you died you did that to be


---------64:47----------
diagnosed I can do that yeah okay thanks


---------64:51----------
for explaining so when do you just just


---------64:55----------
while we're on the topic when do you


---------64:56----------
stream


---------64:57----------
often you see um I think I stream on


---------64:59----------
like pretty much the same days as you


---------65:00----------
Wednesday friday-sunday okay as many


---------65:03----------
days 8 p.m. GMT no 7 p.m. GMT ok UK UK


---------65:08----------
time and then let's see why I think we


---------65:12----------
have maybe time for one or two more


---------65:13----------
questions so


---------65:16----------
one of the questions is how do I build


---------65:18----------
IKEA her


---------65:20----------
the instructions okay so so I guess the


---------65:26----------
last question comes from Tom so this is


---------65:29----------
domination time how does one actually


---------65:30----------
introduce someone in a group and try to


---------65:32----------
build them up about what they do


---------65:34----------
eg this is my friend he also served in


---------65:36----------
the military so I guess I'll go ahead


---------65:39----------
and take this one Lucy but my first


---------65:44----------
question is why do you feel like you


---------65:45----------
have to build up people that you


---------65:46----------
introduced like why is that


---------65:48----------
you know like why is that standard and


---------65:53----------
and you know if you really do feel like


---------65:55----------
there's a particular reason to build


---------65:57----------
them up like so I mean I generally don't


---------66:00----------
try to just build up people but I will


---------66:02----------
oftentimes say something that could be


---------66:04----------
corn quote building them up if I feel


---------66:05----------
it's like relevant to the conversation


---------66:07----------
so if I'm you know talking with someone


---------66:10----------
who's like a medical student and they're


---------66:11----------
interested in let's say orthopedic


---------66:14----------
surgery and I'm hanging out with a buddy


---------66:16----------
of mine who's an orthopedic surgeon I


---------66:17----------
will say something along the lines of


---------66:21----------
you know the so-and-so is a this is a


---------66:23----------
medical students interest ortho and so I


---------66:27----------
think I try to make I try to introduce


---------66:28----------
people in ways that are more relevant as


---------66:31----------
opposed to like


---------66:35----------
you know build them up and I'd really


---------66:37----------
wonder a little bit about why you you


---------66:40----------
know why building up other people and


---------66:41----------
conversations is important like I know


---------66:43----------
in general like it's nice to introduce


---------66:45----------
people and sort of you know try to say


---------66:48----------
good things about them but just the


---------66:56----------
yeah so like if you're on Tom is asking


---------66:59----------
a follow-up question and that's like


---------67:00----------
let's say we're at twitchcon and I'm


---------67:02----------
introducing dr. kay to the other


---------67:03----------
streamers I might say this is dr. kay


---------67:05----------
he's a Harvard psychiatrist an


---------67:06----------
incredible mental health treatment yeah


---------67:08----------
so I think that's fine all right so I


---------67:09----------
think that's relevant so I try to think


---------67:12----------
about things is is like what's relevant


---------67:14----------
like what is that what is the person


---------67:17----------
that you're going to be talking about


---------67:18----------
like because when you give details about


---------67:20----------
someone when you introduce them you're


---------67:22----------
framing the conversation you're teeing


---------67:24----------
up the conversation to go in a


---------67:26----------
particular way right like if I'm if I'm


---------67:28----------
talking to a buddy of mine who's single


---------67:30----------
and there's like someone else that I


---------67:31----------
want to set them up with I will


---------67:33----------
introduce the two of them and I will say


---------67:34----------
you know this is my buddy Tom he's


---------67:36----------
single and this is by my friend Helen


---------67:38----------
she's single - and then like that super


---------67:41----------
awkward but it's like you know it's


---------67:43----------
teeing up the conversation in a


---------67:44----------
particular way or I'll say something


---------67:46----------
like Oh like this is Tom he's super into


---------67:47----------
fitness and this is Helen she super


---------67:50----------
wants to be into fitness and and so like


---------67:53----------
that's you know so I try to make things


---------67:54----------
relevant and then of course you're not


---------67:56----------
gonna say anything negative about people


---------67:57----------
but I think you know take a step back


---------68:00----------
from from the ego and just just say


---------68:04----------
what's relevant


---------68:06----------
and that looks like


---------68:09----------
okay so hi it's Ava asks how do you deal


---------68:13----------
with anxiety when the wave just feels


---------68:15----------
too high to ride out so I'm gonna start


---------68:18----------
with something that Lucy said and Lucy


---------68:22----------
if you have thoughts about this I I


---------68:23----------
figured this question is a little bit


---------68:24----------
more directed towards me um but you know


---------68:27----------
so I think the first thing to recognize


---------68:28----------
is that if we look at Lucy's case she


---------68:31----------
has some mechanisms that she goes to


---------68:33----------
right so she was talking about how she


---------68:35----------
turns to the tarot cards and that's kind


---------68:37----------
of like your coping mechanism in the


---------68:39----------
moment and then the second thing to


---------68:41----------
remember about anxiety waves that feel


---------68:43----------
too large is that there are going to be


---------68:46----------
anxiety waves that are too large for you


---------68:48----------
to handle that's just gonna happen and


---------68:50----------
when that happens there's going to be


---------68:53----------
some kind of bad outcome either you'll


---------68:55----------
have a panic attack you'll start you


---------68:57----------
know you'll turn to whatever your coping


---------68:59----------
mechanism is so I think that like Lucy


---------69:01----------
has done an awesome job of like trance


---------69:02----------
transforming like gaming which is not a


---------69:04----------
great coping mechanism but I would say


---------69:06----------
like better than heroine right so


---------69:08----------
there's like a spectrum of like let's


---------69:10----------
say heroine gaming tarot cards taking a


---------69:14----------
deep breath and just sitting with the


---------69:16----------
feelings like there are a lot of


---------69:16----------
different coping mechanisms you so try


---------69:19----------
to replace trying to like move up the


---------69:21----------
line of like matter of coping mechanisms


---------69:23----------
but the other thing is I just


---------69:24----------
acknowledge that sometimes the anxiety


---------69:26----------
is too much to deal with and just


---------69:28----------
understand that things are gonna be


---------69:30----------
[ __ ] for a little bit like if your


---------69:32----------
anxiety is just super bad just let


---------69:33----------
yourself be overwhelmed be like well you


---------69:38----------
know I was interested in talking to this


---------69:39----------
person but at the end of the day like


---------69:42----------
that's not gonna work today because I'm


---------69:44----------
just feeling like [ __ ] but I'm just


---------69:45----------
gonna I'm gonna look like a bumbling


---------69:47----------
idiot for the next half hour and then I


---------69:49----------
get to leave so that's it


---------69:52----------
I'm Sol and oddly enough when you just


---------69:56----------
say to yourself like I'm Sol that's it


---------69:59----------
I'm screwed something magical happens to


---------70:02----------
the anxiety which is that it goes away


---------70:04----------
and it's kind of bizarre how that works


---------70:07----------
well what maybe we'll practice that one


---------70:08----------
day


---------70:08----------
[Music]


---------70:11----------
so I just want to thank you


---------70:14----------
lucify for coming on yeah and do you


---------70:17----------
have any questions or thoughts before we


---------70:20----------
wrap up


---------70:22----------
no I'm I don't think so not not yet at


---------70:26----------
least anyway I've got I'm gonna process


---------70:27----------
this a little bit because I feel like


---------70:29----------
I've learned a lot already


---------70:31----------
um but ya know thank you for having me


---------70:34----------
on thank ya you helped I just don't feel


---------70:36----------
like a bit like like my brain has just


---------70:39----------
been like pounded well like in a good


---------70:40----------
way like my phone like I'm gonna well


---------70:46----------
good I'm glad it was it was help I


---------70:48----------
really am glad it was helpful to you


---------70:50----------
Lucy and I think um what I want to thank


---------70:52----------
you for is is because I think everything


---------70:53----------
that you've talked about clearly


---------70:55----------
resonated with twitchchat


---------70:56----------
I've been sort of anything I was a bit


---------70:59----------
afraid like I don't know because I think


---------71:01----------
I think the stuff that I know so I think


---------71:04----------
everyone has an amy dot exe like that


---------71:06----------
malware is [ __ ] it's all over the


---------71:08----------
internet yeah you know it's it comes


---------71:11----------
from Reddit and so everyone has it and


---------71:13----------
it's why I think it's it's really basic


---------71:16----------
I think the reason the stream is what it


---------71:17----------
is is because people come on and they're


---------71:20----------
like authentic about what their


---------71:21----------
experiences and the cool thing like the


---------71:24----------
cool thing about the stream is that


---------71:26----------
anxiety self judgement self critical


---------71:28----------
thoughts that's something that we all


---------71:30----------
deal with but somewhere along the way


---------71:32----------
society stops talking about bad things


---------71:34----------
yeah


---------71:36----------
right you always talk about like even if


---------71:38----------
we think about Tom's question about like


---------71:39----------
how do you pump someone up when you


---------71:41----------
introduce them somewhere along the way


---------71:42----------
Society placed a value judgment on


---------71:45----------
saying something good about someone


---------71:46----------
instead of saying hey this is Lucy she


---------71:49----------
struggles with her own internal dialogue


---------71:51----------
from time to time like we just don't


---------71:52----------
introduce people like that it's crazy I


---------71:54----------
was working with someone who was having


---------71:56----------
really bad anxiety and he was on a date


---------71:59----------
with someone from tinder and the first


---------72:01----------
thing that he said on the date was hi my


---------72:04----------
name is so-and-so and then he said I


---------72:05----------
sometimes struggle with social anxiety


---------72:07----------
so apologies if this is awkward and then


---------72:09----------
do you know what her answer was


---------72:12----------
no no she said I also struggle with


---------72:15----------
social anxiety thank you so much for


---------72:17----------
saying that they had an awesome date


---------72:18----------
that's like it was crazy


---------72:21----------
I like I said it's like go in with like


---------72:24----------
disclaimers like oh yeah yeah call them


---------72:27----------
disclaim is it actually like makes you


---------72:29----------
feel a lot more like relax just like oh


---------72:31----------
yeah here's my disclaimer of like my


---------72:32----------
human behavior oh [ __ ] you're human too


---------72:35----------
oh my god


---------72:37----------
and I know it's it's kind of stupid cuz


---------72:40----------
like I've set this standard goodbye to


---------72:43----------
like the standard thing they go vetted


---------72:45----------
earlier like either it's a standard that


---------72:47----------
I've set or like that I feel like other


---------72:49----------
people have set for me but it's not it's


---------72:51----------
like as a streamer like you're supposed


---------72:53----------
supposed to be like this like perfect


---------72:57----------
person it's like sometimes I just want


---------72:59----------
to comment stream and like yo disclaimer


---------73:00----------
like I'm kind of tired I'm kind of


---------73:03----------
anxious and I don't really know if I


---------73:05----------
want to be here today cuz I like what


---------73:08----------
those are it's like that's what that's


---------73:10----------
the truth that's what's going on but is


---------73:12----------
that like oh you don't want to like like


---------73:15----------
seem like ungrateful but then after you


---------73:17----------
kind of get it off your chest it's it's


---------73:20----------
kind of gone I think yeah yeah yeah


---------73:27----------
right so I think what Lucy what you're


---------73:30----------
describing is exactly what hi it's Ava


---------73:33----------
was asking which is like what do you do


---------73:34----------
when the the urge of anxiety is too high


---------73:37----------
and you can't surf it you just say like


---------73:39----------
Oh like hey this is just gonna be bad


---------73:42----------
and somehow you gain power over that


---------73:43----------
negative emotion I just acknowledge and


---------73:46----------
get admitting it accepting it and that's


---------73:48----------
what you should do with Amy dot exe yeah


---------73:51----------
I think yeah I think I don't know if


---------73:53----------
it's like in society like we were like


---------73:54----------
ashamed of like the gem that comes along


---------73:57----------
with just saying like hey this is my Amy


---------73:59----------
EXE like here's my [ __ ]


---------74:02----------
cuz I think with the whole like social


---------74:03----------
media thing nowadays it's like used to


---------74:06----------
like manufacturing yourself to like be


---------74:09----------
perfect to then deep down everyone's got


---------74:11----------
this Amy


---------74:11----------
exe runnin and it's like oh [ __ ] like


---------74:14----------
what's wrong with me like why why does


---------74:17----------
everyone else look so like perfect Yeah


---------74:21----------
right because what's happening is are


---------74:22----------
are the versions of people that we're


---------74:25----------
seeing or


---------74:26----------
coming more and more manufacturer yeah


---------74:29----------
so we it's just monkey-see monkey-do


---------74:31----------
like that's how we are and so we think


---------74:33----------
that we since we see everyone going on


---------74:35----------
vacation to like Hawaii and the Bahamas


---------74:37----------
and things like that we think that's


---------74:38----------
what we should be doing right and so


---------74:42----------
anyway thanks a lot for coming on thanks


---------74:44----------

---------74:46----------

---------74:48----------
