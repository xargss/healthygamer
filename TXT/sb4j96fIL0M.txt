---------00:00----------
will I get a legit evaluation or will


---------00:02----------
they just think I'm depressed you cut


---------00:04----------
out gaming and then you just replace it


---------00:06----------
with other crap people think that is a


---------00:08----------
particular thing that makes them bored


---------00:09----------
no your mind isn't a pro boredom State


---------00:12----------
ok this is a great question I see you


---------00:14----------
keep flaming therapy is there a


---------00:15----------
situation which therapy is the right


---------00:17----------
move what alternatives do you recommend


---------00:18----------
ways to give back to the community so


---------00:20----------
you know you're welcome to get involved


---------00:22----------
with us so we're we're you know as we're


---------00:24----------
training coaches and stuff what's


---------00:25----------
happening in the brain with you all of a


---------00:27----------
sudden stop enjoying games and actually


---------00:29----------
prefer doing more productive things is


---------00:31----------
it still about dopamine levels do you


---------00:33----------
find spirituality conflicts with


---------00:34----------
scientific research not at all so let me


---------00:37----------
be clear about a couple of things what I


---------00:38----------
say I'm on lightened know what at what


---------00:42----------
age it hasn't happened yet


---------00:46----------
I have a question if I try to get


---------00:48----------
professional help for video game


---------00:49----------
addiction will I get a legit evaluation


---------00:52----------
or will they just think I'm depressed I


---------00:54----------
really think I'm an emotional I have an


---------00:57----------
emotional dependency on games and I use


---------00:59----------
them to evade bad feelings to the point


---------01:01----------
that I can't get that get things I need


---------01:03----------
to get done okay so will you get a legit


---------01:07----------
evaluation or will they just think I'm


---------01:09----------
depressed so you will get a legit


---------01:11----------
evaluation and they will probably think


---------01:13----------
that you are depressed so the first


---------01:16----------
thing doctor says is that very few


---------01:17----------
mental health professionals understand


---------01:19----------
video game addiction or how video games


---------01:20----------
affect psychology or neuroscience and


---------01:23----------
that's not their fault right like when


---------01:26----------
we were training like in my training I


---------01:28----------
got over the course of four years in


---------01:30----------
about twelve to fifteen thousand hours


---------01:32----------
of training


---------01:33----------
I got a grand total of zero hours of


---------01:37----------
training on video game addiction and


---------01:40----------
that is at all places at the Harvard


---------01:42----------
Medical School and so the first thing


---------01:44----------
you guys need to understand is if you're


---------01:45----------
gonna seek a mental health evaluation


---------01:47----------
it's not their fault that they don't


---------01:49----------
understand video games it's not that no


---------01:51----------
one has been trained to ask are you


---------01:53----------
addicted to video games so that's the


---------01:55----------
work that I'm trying to do with the


---------01:56----------
American Psychiatric Association so I'm


---------01:59----------
putting together a continuing medical


---------02:00----------
education like a class for psychiatrists


---------02:02----------
to educate them about video game


---------02:04----------
addiction to try to get them I teach at


---------02:06----------
various places to try to raise awareness


---------02:09----------
so that people do like start asking


---------02:11----------
about it


---------02:12----------
but I think if you want to get proper


---------02:15----------
help I think it is your responsibility


---------02:18----------
to share this with them if you share


---------02:21----------
this sentence with them you walk in and


---------02:24----------
you say hey you talk to them they're


---------02:26----------
gonna ask you so what are you what's


---------02:27----------
bringing you in they're gonna I'll ask


---------02:29----------
that question they're like what's


---------02:30----------
bringing you in today they're gonna ask


---------02:32----------
this open-ended question about why


---------02:34----------
you're coming to see them and if you say


---------02:37----------
I really think I have an emotional


---------02:38----------
dependency on video games and I use them


---------02:41----------
to evade bad feelings to the point that


---------02:43----------
I can't get things I need to get done


---------02:44----------
that's all you need that's the perfect


---------02:46----------
answer they should be able to handle


---------02:48----------
that because remember that what


---------02:50----------
psychiatrists and psychologists and


---------02:52----------
therapists are good at is like not


---------02:55----------
necessarily understanding the nuances of


---------02:57----------
a particular addiction like if you go


---------03:00----------
see


---------03:00----------
me for example so I'm an addiction


---------03:02----------
psychiatrist and I work with people who


---------03:04----------
have like cocaine addictions but like I


---------03:07----------
don't know the ins and outs of like


---------03:09----------
using cocaine and what it does I'm not


---------03:11----------
an expert I've never even tried cocaine


---------03:12----------
so I don't I don't know really and know


---------03:13----------
anything about it but I can absolutely


---------03:15----------
help them with their emotional


---------03:18----------
dependency on it and how they use it to


---------03:20----------
evade bad feelings to the point that I


---------03:22----------
can't get things done because that's not


---------03:24----------
specific to video games right that's


---------03:26----------
just normal like that that's what we


---------03:30----------
deal with like a therapist should be


---------03:33----------
able to help you explore your emotional


---------03:35----------
dependency on video games should be able


---------03:38----------
to help you explore what it is that


---------03:40----------
you're using your video games to like


---------03:42----------
emotionally avoid because we do that for


---------03:44----------
all kinds of stuff like we watch TV we


---------03:47----------
engage in unhealthy relationships we use


---------03:50----------
substances of abuse all of that stuff


---------03:52----------
happens all the time and psychiatrists


---------03:54----------
should be able to handle that so I don't


---------03:57----------
think you're gonna get like a super


---------03:58----------
knowledgeable person about video game


---------04:00----------
addiction and what it does to you but I


---------04:02----------
think that's something that you have to


---------04:03----------
kind of educate them about and that you


---------04:05----------
guys can kind of like work on together


---------04:06----------
and I think you can get help I think you


---------04:09----------
just can't if they say like I think


---------04:11----------
you're depressed and and then I think


---------04:12----------
you should push back on that you can say


---------04:14----------
like yeah but I really think like video


---------04:16----------
games are my problem in that it may look


---------04:18----------
like depression but and so I think it's


---------04:20----------
very important if you're if you're with


---------04:22----------
a therapist that you say what is on your


---------04:23----------
mind because that's what really helps


---------04:26----------
them if you just say what's on your mind


---------04:27----------
even if you disagree with them that


---------04:28----------
should be fine and if they don't listen


---------04:31----------
to you then you should find a different


---------04:32----------
therapist unfortunately some of them no


---------04:34----------
one's you know no perfect so


---------04:37----------
um thoughts on coronavirus II I think


---------04:40----------
coronaviruses Batman I don't know like


---------04:43----------
what is going on in China where like


---------04:44----------
they're having all these like really bad


---------04:46----------
viruses break out not quite sure like


---------04:50----------
there's some kind of public health issue


---------04:52----------
there what are their breeding bad


---------04:54----------
viruses I don't know if it's because of


---------04:56----------
the way that they like keep their


---------04:57----------
chickens or what because there's so


---------04:59----------
little information about what's going on


---------05:02----------
but it's like that like it's not it's


---------05:04----------
not a coincidence that you know like


---------05:08----------
SARS the corona virus and like other


---------05:11----------
public health catastrophes or like


---------05:14----------
coming like when you have public health


---------05:16----------
catastrophe after public health


---------05:18----------
catastrophe come out of a particular


---------05:20----------
country like that's a problem right so


---------05:23----------
they they have something within their


---------05:24----------
system of reporting or the way that they


---------05:26----------
treat things or the way that they house


---------05:28----------
because these are all zoo and otic


---------05:30----------
infections right that's important to


---------05:31----------
remember as well so these are all like


---------05:33----------
like I think most of them were coming


---------05:36----------
from poultry so I think they've probably


---------05:38----------
got something going on in terms of like


---------05:40----------
the way that they're handling zoonotic


---------05:42----------
stuff so let's use Anakim paracin so mad


---------05:45----------
cow was a big deal you know like a


---------05:46----------
decade or more ago and we haven't really


---------05:49----------
heard much about mad cow mad cow by the


---------05:51----------
way is absolutely terrifying if you all


---------05:52----------
don't really know what it is it's a


---------05:53----------
terrifying concept in medicine and mad


---------05:57----------
cow isn't like as big of a deal now like


---------05:59----------
we don't hear about continual mad cow


---------06:01----------
outbreaks I'm sure they're conspiracy


---------06:03----------
theorists out there who say that oh


---------06:04----------
they're outbreaks happening all the time


---------06:05----------
but the truth is that like people have


---------06:08----------
made I think the UK and the US have


---------06:09----------
implemented like very strong although if


---------06:13----------
you really look at it kind of terrifying


---------06:14----------
levels of oversight like it isn't how


---------06:16----------
little oversight there is but they've


---------06:18----------
implemented sufficient oversight to


---------06:19----------
prevent further outbreaks of Mad Cow


---------06:22----------
which is really really great so my


---------06:24----------
question is I don't know what China's


---------06:26----------
public health policies are I don't know


---------06:27----------
if it's just they're unlucky but like I


---------06:29----------
think it's it's interesting and you know


---------06:31----------
you have to wonder why there are


---------06:33----------
multiple zoonotic bird related


---------06:36----------
infections that are like killing people


---------06:39----------
in China is it is it so bad because they


---------06:42----------
just don't have the infrastructure to


---------06:44----------
support the health like I don't know I


---------06:45----------
don't know what's going on but I think


---------06:46----------
from a systems perspective like that's


---------06:48----------
problematic


---------06:50----------
that's what I think I was wondering if


---------06:56----------
you could advise on recovering from


---------06:57----------
dopamine exhaustion I'm finding that


---------06:59----------
once I cut out gaming I tend to randomly


---------07:01----------
browse the internet and watch shows when


---------07:02----------
I would rather be developing productive


---------07:05----------
up hobbies and habits okay so fantastic


---------07:08----------
you and everyone else myself included


---------07:10----------
right so like it's not just about


---------07:12----------
cutting out gaming so this is a big


---------07:14----------
important point so we'll talk about


---------07:16----------
dopamine exhaustion in a second the


---------07:18----------
first thing to understand like the whole


---------07:19----------
reason that we did healthy gamer like


---------07:20----------
why is it called healthy gamer is


---------07:22----------
because I don't think gaming is actually


---------07:24----------
the problem right so people who take an


---------07:27----------
abstinence approach to gaming abstinence


---------07:29----------
only approach to gaming like for some


---------07:31----------
people it's very successful but like


---------07:33----------
what I think is way way more common than


---------07:36----------
someone cutting out gaming and then


---------07:37----------
transforming their lives is this you cut


---------07:40----------
out gaming and then you just replace it


---------07:42----------
with other crap so you got to get to the


---------07:45----------
root of why you're gaming in the first


---------07:47----------
place right you have to build a healthy


---------07:49----------
life for yourself what are the the


---------07:51----------
emotions that you're avoiding through


---------07:53----------
gaming because you can stop the gaming


---------07:55----------
but your brain is gonna find other way


---------07:57----------
to avoid the emotions and it'll like


---------07:59----------
you'll Sprouse read it and watch TV


---------08:00----------
shows to avoid your emotions you will


---------08:03----------
find a way to procrastinate if you


---------08:04----------
really want to procrastinate your mind


---------08:06----------
is really good at procrastination mind


---------08:08----------
is really good at avoidance so cutting


---------08:11----------
out gaming is a good and significant


---------08:13----------
step but I don't I think it's like a


---------08:15----------
band-aid it's like looking at the


---------08:17----------
symptom of the problem instead of the


---------08:18----------
root the root is like what is it in your


---------08:20----------
life why aren't you moving forward in


---------08:22----------
life what are you trying to avoid and


---------08:24----------
what are you like afraid of about


---------08:26----------
forward momentum so we had an interview


---------08:28----------
a couple weeks ago with crucify was kind


---------08:30----------
of talking about having an invisible


---------08:32----------
wall like when he tries to make progress


---------08:34----------
he runs to an invisible wall and we were


---------08:36----------
I was surprised to discover that his


---------08:39----------
invisible wall it's a great interview by


---------08:41----------
the way isn't actually a wall it's


---------08:43----------
actually himself holding himself back so


---------08:46----------
when he starts to make progress like on


---------08:49----------
if he gets a job like he quits it after


---------08:52----------
seven days but on day three he starts to


---------08:55----------
like not want to go and like that's


---------08:56----------
where the money is


---------08:57----------
and so a bizarre thing that happens is


---------09:00----------
like the better he does in life the more


---------09:01----------
his depression happens and I'd be


---------09:03----------
wondering


---------09:04----------
how common that pattern is so the


---------09:06----------
question is you know what is it that the


---------09:08----------
gaming is actually protecting you from


---------09:10----------
and if you can deal with those feelings


---------09:12----------
of shame or fear or social anxiety or


---------09:15----------
whatever like then you don't need shows


---------09:17----------
on the Internet


---------09:18----------
right because this is a game of


---------09:19----------
whack-a-mole I see this also in people


---------09:22----------
who have borderline personality disorder


---------09:25----------
eating disorders and substance use


---------09:26----------
there's a group of people that I you


---------09:29----------
know work with that all have all three


---------09:31----------
of those things so they have an eating


---------09:32----------
disorder they have something called BPD


---------09:35----------
so they do self-harm at behaviors and


---------09:37----------
they have problems with substances like


---------09:38----------
alcohol so this is like the the sort of


---------09:41----------
this textbook example of this like the


---------09:43----------
question that you're gonna see if you


---------09:44----------
take a medical board exam is like a 17


---------09:47----------
year old girl who cuts uses alcohol and


---------09:52----------
hasn't like is like underway and what we


---------09:56----------
find when we treat these people is if


---------09:58----------
you can control one of them the others


---------10:00----------
get worse and if you can control two of


---------10:02----------
them the last thing gets worse so if you


---------10:04----------
stop them from self harming and cut out


---------10:06----------
the alcohol they're eating gets worse if


---------10:09----------
you force them to eat or you engage in


---------10:10----------
like like anorexia treatment and you


---------10:13----------
stop them from drinking then they're


---------10:16----------
cutting gets worse I mean if you do


---------10:19----------
anorexia treatment and stop them from


---------10:21----------
cutting than their drinking gets worse


---------10:22----------
so like it's a game of whack-a-mole and


---------10:24----------
it can be really frustrating and


---------10:25----------
engender a lot of difficult dynamics


---------10:27----------
between you and the patient but the


---------10:29----------
issue here is that like all three of


---------10:31----------
those are coping mechanisms to deal with


---------10:33----------
negative emotion cutting is actually a


---------10:34----------
coping mechanism it's almost like a


---------10:36----------
meditative practice when you really talk


---------10:37----------
to people about it it's not they're not


---------10:40----------
trying to actually hurt themselves it's


---------10:42----------
just the pain focuses their mind and


---------10:44----------
like relieves them of emotional tension


---------10:46----------
if you talk to people who engage in


---------10:48----------
self-harm behaviors that's actually how


---------10:49----------
they describe it and so the cool thing


---------10:52----------
is that they get better when you start


---------10:53----------
teaching them things like meditation so


---------10:56----------
when you teach the meditation they have


---------10:57----------
something else that they can go to for


---------11:00----------
that emotional relief so you can play


---------11:03----------
whack-a-mole with Netflix Reddit and


---------11:06----------
gaming all you want to


---------11:09----------
and gaming I do think is like more


---------11:11----------
insidious because it engages our brain


---------11:13----------
in a more profound way then let's say


---------11:15----------
reddit or Netflix does like you have no


---------11:17----------
sense of like online identity or


---------11:19----------
accomplishment when you're well maybe


---------11:21----------
when you browse reddit and you get


---------11:22----------
uploaded we'll see there you go


---------11:24----------
that's why read it's addictive so like


---------11:26----------
Netflix is the least addict addictive it


---------11:28----------
sounds like reddit is a little bit more


---------11:30----------
addictive in gaming is even more


---------11:31----------
addictive so the issue is what's at the


---------11:34----------
root now the second thing is this person


---------11:36----------
is talking about dopamine exhaustion


---------11:37----------
there's got to be like YouTube videos on


---------11:39----------
our channel about this I hope if not


---------11:41----------
then I'll make one but this is just a


---------11:44----------
general concept that's important to


---------11:45----------
understand in terms of playing a lot of


---------11:48----------
video games when I work with people who


---------11:51----------
play excessive video games they talk


---------11:52----------
about like being bored and if you really


---------11:54----------
ask them like what's what they hate the


---------11:57----------
most and what they're trying to avoid


---------11:58----------
more than anything is not any kind of


---------12:00----------
emotion or anything like that is boredom


---------12:02----------
they hate boredom and when they stop


---------12:04----------
trying to play games they feel bored and


---------12:06----------
so I feel like the biggest enemy like


---------12:08----------
the biggest challenge is just straight


---------12:09----------
border like that's the challenge that's


---------12:11----------
them it's not some complicated


---------12:13----------
psychological your dad did this or


---------12:16----------
you're afraid of death or you know it's


---------12:19----------
not anything like that it's just boredom


---------12:20----------
so let's think about what boredom is


---------12:25----------
and we're gonna jump to the interview in


---------12:27----------
about five five minutes okay so when you


---------12:32----------
play video games your your mezzo limbic


---------12:35----------
the mesolimbic circuit of your brain


---------12:37----------
releases something called dopamine and


---------12:39----------
the bezel limbic circuit of your brain


---------12:41----------
is is that's one of the dopamine


---------12:44----------
circuits that governs pleasure and


---------12:46----------
reward so there are other dope there


---------12:49----------
other dopamine circuits for example that


---------12:51----------
regulate movement and things like that


---------12:53----------
so people who have Parkinson's disease


---------12:54----------
they also have like they have a dopamine


---------12:57----------
shortage in their brain so there are


---------13:00----------
lots of dopamine does a lot of stuff in


---------13:01----------
your brain it's not just pleasure and


---------13:03----------
reward but the Meisel limbic circuit is


---------13:04----------
devoted to pleasure and reward so when


---------13:06----------
you play a video game you dump a lot of


---------13:08----------
dopamine and on a regular basis in your


---------13:11----------
mieze olympic circuit with spikes of


---------13:14----------
higher reward so if we take a drug like


---------13:16----------
cocaine cocaine causes a large amount of


---------13:19----------
dopamine to be dumped into your reward


---------13:21----------
system like very quickly whereas gaming


---------13:24----------
is like slow steady dopamine with spurts


---------13:27----------
and that's why you can play a game for


---------13:29----------
like 12 hours and then they're like


---------13:31----------
moments in the game what do you feel


---------13:33----------
super excited and it's very kind of


---------13:36----------
activating and engaging so how does the


---------13:39----------
body respond to constant stimuli it does


---------13:42----------
it responds by something called


---------13:43----------
tolerance and so what what tolerance is


---------13:47----------
is like if you drink caffeine every day


---------13:48----------
like at first it kind of wires you and


---------13:50----------
can keep you up all night but if you


---------13:52----------
drink enough of it your your brain


---------13:53----------
actually down regulates caffeine


---------13:55----------
receptors and what that means is it


---------13:57----------
numbs itself to the signal of caffeine


---------14:00----------
so when you needed to drink one cup of


---------14:03----------
coffee and that would have kept you


---------14:04----------
wired through the night if you drink


---------14:06----------
coffee every day like one cup of coffee


---------14:08----------
isn't gonna keep you wired because your


---------14:09----------
brain has kind of numbed itself to the


---------14:11----------
effects of caffeine and so if we look at


---------14:14----------
gaming people who game a lot their brain


---------14:17----------
also adapts same principle so it numbs


---------14:20----------
itself to dopamine and that's what I


---------14:22----------
call dopamine exhaustion you just like


---------14:24----------
run out of dopamine and the dopamine


---------14:26----------
doesn't have really much effect and your


---------14:29----------
your body it's really a tolerance


---------14:30----------
principle but and then you kind of


---------14:33----------
so things like become less fun so then


---------14:35----------
if you stop gaming so gaming remember is


---------14:38----------
like a steady stream of dopamine with


---------14:40----------
spikes but then if you try to do


---------14:42----------
something like read a book reading a


---------14:43----------
book just releases less dopamine then


---------14:46----------
playing a videogame does and so when


---------14:49----------
people start to like to try to do other


---------14:51----------
things they find them boring and the


---------14:53----------
reason they find them boring is because


---------14:55----------
your brain is built up such a tolerance


---------14:56----------
to dopamine it's numbing that signal of


---------14:59----------
enjoyment that's literally why


---------15:00----------
everything is boring because your brain


---------15:02----------
numbs the sensation of reward and


---------15:05----------
pleasure because you've dumped so much


---------15:07----------
dopamine into your Me's Olympic circuit


---------15:09----------
but that's how your brain is gonna adapt


---------15:12----------
so what you need to do is just


---------15:16----------
understand that for two weeks if you cut


---------15:17----------
out gaming you're gonna be bored you're


---------15:21----------
gonna be really bored and that overtime


---------15:23----------
that boredom is gonna go away in and of


---------15:25----------
itself and this is the problem that a


---------15:27----------
lot of gamers make is they conclude that


---------15:30----------
the activity is what's boring right you


---------15:32----------
remove yourself from the equation you're


---------15:34----------
like oh I don't like to read a book


---------15:35----------
books are boring I don't like to garden


---------15:37----------
gardening is boring I don't like to go


---------15:40----------
fishing fishing is boring I don't like


---------15:42----------
to work out working out is boring I


---------15:44----------
don't like to go to job my job job is


---------15:47----------
boring I don't like to go to my classes


---------15:49----------
class is boring so you associate boredom


---------15:52----------
with the activity without acknowledging


---------15:56----------
that your neuro chemistry is actually


---------15:58----------
what's causing it boring when you find


---------16:00----------
your job class fishing working out


---------16:02----------
gardening and reading all boring that's


---------16:06----------
not everything in the world being boring


---------16:08----------
that's you right so you have dopamine


---------16:11----------
exhaustion so what you need to do is


---------16:14----------
stop exposing your brain to dopamine for


---------16:16----------
a long time so take a period of like two


---------16:19----------
weeks do something like a gaming cleanse


---------16:21----------
and just understand that for two weeks


---------16:24----------
I'm not gonna be sad I'm not gonna be


---------16:27----------
shamed I may have low energy level but


---------16:30----------
the main challenge that you have to you


---------16:32----------
have to survive two weeks of boredom and


---------16:34----------
if you survive two weeks a Bourdon


---------16:36----------
boredom something magical happens all of


---------16:40----------
those things that you used to be boring


---------16:41----------
then start becoming fun


---------16:44----------
then the even more magical thing happens


---------16:46----------
what gamers want more than anything else


---------16:49----------
is to enjoy the things that they should


---------16:53----------
do


---------16:54----------
gamers look at themselves and they say


---------16:56----------
oh like I like playing video games and I


---------16:59----------
find school boring I wish I was like


---------17:02----------
those people who found school fun


---------17:06----------
because if I found school fun


---------17:08----------
they'd enjoy it then I could study and


---------17:11----------
then I could get a job and then I could


---------17:12----------
take control of my life


---------17:13----------
I wish I was like those people well


---------17:15----------
here's the thing you can be like those


---------17:18----------
people you can literally do it all you


---------17:20----------
have to do is alter your neuro chemistry


---------17:21----------
through a two-week like gaming cleanse


---------17:24----------
thirty days is better and as your brain


---------17:27----------
rewires and like recalibrates and as


---------17:29----------
your tolerance level goes down then


---------17:31----------
you're gonna enjoy things better and


---------17:33----------
then you will become the very thing that


---------17:34----------
you want it to be and once you become


---------17:36----------
that thing and you enjoy school like


---------17:38----------
that means you're gonna do better in


---------17:40----------
your classes that means you're gonna


---------17:41----------
graduate like you're gonna enjoy working


---------17:42----------
out more your motivation that intrinsic


---------17:45----------
motivation that most gamers are missing


---------17:47----------
will start to come back and as it comes


---------17:50----------
back like that's how you become a


---------17:51----------
healthy gamer like that's my whole point


---------17:53----------
is that like as you build things in your


---------17:55----------
life that you also find enjoyable you're


---------17:58----------
living a healthy and fulfilling life and


---------18:00----------
then you like also get to play video


---------18:01----------
games the crazy thing is is that even


---------18:04----------
the best part the games even become more


---------18:06----------
fun like the gaming becomes more fun


---------18:10----------
minute to minute hour to hour when the


---------18:12----------
rest of your life is in order it gets


---------18:15----------
better


---------18:21----------
okay I just watched the video with


---------18:24----------
reckful and hearing the four states of


---------18:26----------
consciousness got me thinking and


---------18:29----------
apologies for what will probably turn


---------18:31----------
out to be a wall of text apology


---------18:33----------
accepted is game okay so if you guys


---------18:36----------
want to y'all can go back and look at


---------18:38----------
the video with reckful I also talked


---------18:39----------
about this with Devin Nash on one of our


---------18:41----------
earlier streams about the different like


---------18:43----------
for states of like consciousness and


---------18:45----------
mind it's a pretty interesting way to


---------18:47----------
understand how your mind works as gamers


---------18:50----------
do you know that feeling when you're


---------18:51----------
completely immersed in the game and


---------18:53----------
enter into sort of a trance where your


---------18:56----------
mind stops thinking you and you become


---------18:57----------
one with the carrot


---------18:58----------
yes I do that's called a flow state for


---------19:01----------
example when playing a shooter you no


---------19:02----------
longer feel even you no longer even feel


---------19:05----------
moving your mouse or pressing buttons or


---------19:07----------
your keyboard no thoughts or anything


---------19:08----------
you just automatically react react to


---------19:10----------
whatever's on screen get in your groove


---------19:12----------
and just play yeah absolutely so the


---------19:15----------
first thing let's just pause here so


---------19:16----------
that's a flow state right so a flow


---------19:18----------
state is a period of time where your


---------19:20----------
mind is like ultra focused and you lose


---------19:22----------
some sense of self and you kind of like


---------19:25----------
become one with the activity so in a


---------19:27----------
flow state your performance improves you


---------19:30----------
feel better and like you're not plagued


---------19:32----------
with stuff like anxieties I find that I


---------19:36----------
perform exponentially better in that


---------19:38----------
mindset both in in a game environment


---------19:40----------
and when attempting to be productive yes


---------19:43----------
so this is correct


---------19:44----------
okay so let's pause this for a second


---------19:46----------
this is exactly what I'm saying


---------19:47----------
so your productivity has nothing to do


---------19:50----------
with like whether it's a game or school


---------19:52----------
or your cooking or whatever the quality


---------19:55----------
and state of your mind determines your


---------19:59----------
productivity it goes back to what we


---------20:01----------
were saying last time about boredom


---------20:02----------
people think that is a particular thing


---------20:04----------
that makes them bored no your mind is in


---------20:06----------
a pro boredom state and if you can get


---------20:08----------
into a flow state it doesn't matter what


---------20:10----------
you can do you can be playing to music


---------20:11----------
you can be singing music you can be


---------20:13----------
hanging out with your kids you can be


---------20:15----------
gardening you can be playing a video


---------20:16----------
game it all gets better everything gets


---------20:22----------
better and that's because you change


---------20:23----------
right like this is about remember guys


---------20:25----------
like in when you're playing the game of


---------20:27----------
life like you have a character and your


---------20:29----------
character influences things it's not


---------20:31----------
just the environment so like it's like


---------20:33----------
when your character goes into like you


---------20:35----------
know flow mode you are gonna perform


---------20:38----------
better it's like a buff to all of your


---------20:40----------
stats and all of your skills 20%


---------20:42----------
improvement to all of your stats and all


---------20:43----------
of your skills when you're a flow state


---------20:45----------
is that actually it's way more than 20%


---------20:47----------
it's probably 100% is that State of Mind


---------20:51----------
similar to the place I'm trying to enter


---------20:53----------
when meditating yes and no so the goal


---------20:58----------
of this the meditative mind is to have


---------21:01----------
consciousness with no mental activity


---------21:04----------
the goal of a flow state is to have


---------21:08----------
either consciousness with one pointed in


---------21:12----------
focus mental activity or focused mental


---------21:14----------
activity without consciousness that may


---------21:17----------
actually be a flow State I'm gonna have


---------21:19----------
to think about that and explore that


---------21:20----------
myself so the question is like do you


---------21:22----------
lose track of time and awareness of self


---------21:24----------
when you're in a flow state because a


---------21:26----------
flow State may be one pointedness of


---------21:28----------
mind not a variable mind with actually


---------21:30----------
no consciousness I'm not sure or whether


---------21:32----------
consciousness is there or not or not and


---------21:35----------
what what I will tell you is so I I


---------21:38----------
teach people how to get into flow States


---------21:40----------
and these include physicians surgeons


---------21:42----------
investment bankers professional gamers


---------21:45----------
NFL athletes and I teach them and train


---------21:50----------
them how to get into a flow state and


---------21:52----------
like I teach all of these different


---------21:54----------
people because the activity doesn't


---------21:55----------
matter it's the state of mind that


---------21:56----------
matters right so when I work with like


---------21:58----------
an eSports team I teach them how to


---------22:01----------
enter flow States so that like when they


---------22:04----------
start to tilt and their anxiety like


---------22:07----------
raises through the roof and it affects


---------22:08----------
their performance I teach them how to


---------22:10----------
recalibrate their brains so that they


---------22:12----------
don't they get out of that state so it's


---------22:16----------
very similar to end the way I teach that


---------22:18----------
is by teaching meditation and then we


---------22:19----------
kind of do additional things as well but


---------22:21----------
meditation is a great way to facilitate


---------22:23----------
flow States not exactly the same but


---------22:26----------
it's like moving you in the general


---------22:27----------
ballpark I've been chasing that state of


---------22:30----------
mind since I break out of thought loops


---------22:33----------
and just simply do very good does anyone


---------22:37----------
else enter such a mindset when doing


---------22:39----------
work absolutely very productive people


---------22:41----------
do


---------22:42----------
does anyone else even experience what


---------22:45----------
I'm describing or am I just crazy no


---------22:46----------
you're not crazy the reason that you


---------22:48----------
feel like you're crazy is because this


---------22:51----------
is a hard state of mind to duplicate


---------22:53----------
right so you have these flashes of


---------22:55----------
insight where you're in this state of


---------22:58----------
mind and you're like whoa that was


---------22:59----------
amazing like I played a better game I'm


---------23:01----------
able to study and then you try to chase


---------23:03----------
it right and you even said you chase it


---------23:06----------
the problem is that the act of chasing


---------23:09----------
reduces the chance that you'll enter a


---------23:11----------
front flow state so the more that you


---------23:13----------
chase the flow state the harder the flow


---------23:15----------
State is to attain


---------23:17----------
and then you think you're crazy because


---------23:18----------
it happens once and it's like brilliant


---------23:21----------
and wonderful and then like you try to


---------23:24----------
find it again and you can't find it


---------23:25----------
again so then you start to question


---------23:27----------
yourself you're like kind of gaslighting


---------23:28----------
yourself like did that really happen is


---------23:30----------
that really possible does this happen to


---------23:31----------
other people this is kind of weird


---------23:32----------
because 90% of the time or even 95% of


---------23:35----------
time or 99% at a time you're in the


---------23:38----------
thought loop state where your mind is


---------23:40----------
super active because most of the time as


---------23:42----------
we live our day our mind is active


---------23:44----------
that's what it does it's active it's


---------23:47----------
thinking about stuff that's how we do it


---------23:48----------
and then rarely you enter a flow state


---------23:51----------
kind of naturally but that absolutely


---------23:55----------
works for other people and I'd say that


---------23:57----------
the more successful people that I meet


---------24:00----------
tend to enter flow States better and if


---------24:02----------
you think about like where I was when I


---------24:04----------
was failing out of college and where I


---------24:06----------
am now like one of the biggest things


---------24:08----------
that's changed is my ability to enter a


---------24:10----------
flow State so I consistently enter flow


---------24:12----------
States and that's what makes me


---------24:13----------
successful right it's my state of mind


---------24:15----------
but this is what I keep telling people


---------24:17----------
like my personality hasn't changed I'm


---------24:18----------
so lazy I still procrastinate I still


---------24:22----------
like watch the Leipzig major instead of


---------24:25----------
doing my work but the difference is that


---------24:28----------
I enter flow States on a pretty regular


---------24:30----------
basis and since I enter flow States I


---------24:32----------
tend to be productive enough and I do


---------24:34----------
well in life it's not crazy


---------24:37----------
so I'd say absolutely try to cultivate


---------24:39----------
flow States then your question is gonna


---------24:41----------
be how which is a fair question so we'll


---------24:44----------
let me just think about how to teach you


---------24:46----------
guys how to that's like a long thing


---------24:47----------
though


---------24:48----------
I can't just explain that in five


---------24:51----------
minutes beyond meditating but I don't


---------24:52----------
think that's sufficient so let me think


---------24:54----------
I'm just gonna have to add that like I


---------24:56----------
have to so we're developing a curriculum


---------24:58----------
of like start to finish stuff about


---------25:00----------
meditation and Tyrel and Ayurveda so I'm


---------25:03----------
gonna have to add a segment on flow


---------25:04----------
States then how to cultivate them so I'm


---------25:09----------
just gonna have to make a mental note to


---------25:10----------
do that okay


---------25:12----------
by the way so you guys know sometimes I


---------25:16----------
do what I just did and I pause on stream


---------25:19----------
and I like stop doing whatever I'm doing


---------25:21----------
and sometimes when I'm talking to people


---------25:23----------
it's kind of awkward but I'm gonna say


---------25:24----------
I'm gonna just think for a minute that


---------25:27----------
is literally me trying to go into like a


---------25:30----------
little mini flow state like it's like me


---------25:35----------
taking a step back in reducing my


---------25:38----------
thought loops and if I'm really really


---------25:41----------
desperate then I'll really try to go


---------25:43----------
into a flow state because if I'm


---------25:44----------
desperate and I don't know what to think


---------25:46----------
like I literally what that means is my


---------25:49----------
brain is picking up on something that I


---------25:51----------
cannot logically process and it's too


---------25:54----------
much so I have to pause and I have to


---------25:57----------
like get into the flow state and then


---------25:59----------
something like some answer comes out and


---------26:01----------
that's part of what makes me effective


---------26:03----------
like if you guys watch my interviews


---------26:05----------
we'll see if it happens today so keep an


---------26:07----------
eye out so actually this is what we


---------26:09----------
should do today so I want you guys to be


---------26:12----------
more active viewers today okay I want


---------26:15----------
you guys to look watch me and try to see


---------26:19----------
when I enter a flow state and when I


---------26:21----------
don't and try to see when is my thinking


---------26:25----------
logical and when is it not logical and


---------26:29----------
just because it's not logical doesn't


---------26:30----------
mean it's wrong but I think you guys


---------26:32----------
will be able to see some of the stuff


---------26:34----------
that I do is logical in a product of the


---------26:36----------
analytical mind but some of it is not


---------26:38----------
the analytical mind and I'm trying to do


---------26:40----------
like this crap like I don't know how


---------26:43----------
else to describe it but like I it's


---------26:44----------
something like meditation something like


---------26:46----------
a flow state something like intuition as


---------26:49----------
opposed to analysis and try to see if


---------26:53----------
you can tell the difference okay and


---------26:58----------
then we'll talk about it a little bit


---------27:00----------
after the interview okay this is a great


---------27:03----------
question I see you keep flaming therapy


---------27:05----------
is there a situation which therapy is


---------27:06----------
the right move what alternatives do you


---------27:08----------
recommend so I I think therapy is


---------27:10----------
fantastic so I was sharing with you guys


---------27:13----------
my personal beefs with therapy right but


---------27:18----------
that's like


---------27:22----------
I think it's important when you engage


---------27:24----------
in a practice to understand its


---------27:26----------
weaknesses it doesn't mean that the


---------27:27----------
practice is bad right you can also say


---------27:29----------
that like college sucks for all kinds of


---------27:32----------
reasons it doesn't mean that college is


---------27:33----------
bad but college sucks because people are


---------27:36----------
click is sure like you know people their


---------27:38----------
fraternities or like you can say


---------27:40----------
whatever you want to about things being


---------27:42----------
negative so I want to thank you for


---------27:44----------
answering this question because I think


---------27:45----------
therapy is actually really good and like


---------27:47----------
I said I recommended therapy to him so I


---------27:49----------
think that you know I was being critical


---------27:53----------
of a therapist was just really unfair


---------27:55----------
because I didn't understand you know the


---------27:56----------
therapist may have been making their


---------27:57----------
judgment based on all the information


---------28:00----------
that Jake was sharing with them so the


---------28:02----------
therapist may be correct too


---------28:04----------
so it does sound like the dad is


---------28:06----------
emotionally unavailable to be fair right


---------28:08----------
because we can sort of infer that it's


---------28:09----------
not like rocket science so it's kind of


---------28:11----------
a dick thing for me to say I think


---------28:14----------
therapy is actually very good I mean I'm


---------28:15----------
a therapist in my day job so I think


---------28:17----------
it's very effective I think a lot of


---------28:19----------
people could benefit from it I think


---------28:20----------
most people could benefit from it but I


---------28:23----------
think like with anything that you do in


---------28:25----------
life you should understand what the


---------28:27----------
shortcomings and downsides are because


---------28:29----------
that allows you to protect against them


---------28:31----------
so the funny thing is that I think that


---------28:34----------
something like what we do on stream is a


---------28:37----------
very good adjunct to therapy so I think


---------28:40----------
if you want to correct your life you


---------28:43----------
should meditate watch stuff like this


---------28:45----------
stream work out you know watch like


---------28:50----------
professional streams and stuff to like


---------28:52----------
learn how to make a resume and go to


---------28:54----------
therapy I think it's actually oftentimes


---------28:56----------
the right call and very rarely is that


---------28:59----------
the wrong call


---------29:06----------
what's your opinion on Kundalini Yoga so


---------29:08----------
I think Kundalini Yoga is an incredibly


---------29:10----------
powerful spiritual practice that should


---------29:12----------
be done under the guidance of a guru


---------29:14----------
so Kundalini Yoga can like literally


---------29:17----------
make people go crazy so I was talking a


---------29:19----------
little bit I don't know if I mentioned


---------29:20----------
this but there are you know there case


---------29:22----------
reports of meditation induced psychosis


---------29:25----------
meditation is also practiced that comes


---------29:27----------
with risks and Kundalini Yoga is


---------29:29----------
actually one of the more riskier kinds


---------29:32----------
of yoga now if you go to like a yoga


---------29:34----------
studio and they'd have a kundalini yoga


---------29:37----------
class that's not real Kundalini Yoga


---------29:39----------
that's all of that is hot day yoga and


---------29:41----------
it's all awesome awesome is yoga


---------29:43----------
postures so 99% or 95% of what they


---------29:46----------
teach it in yoga classes yoga studio is


---------29:49----------
like in the West is not true inauthentic


---------29:51----------
Kundalini Yoga so true and authentic


---------29:53----------
Kundalini Yoga involves a couple of


---------29:55----------
things leak shock which means initiation


---------29:58----------
the second thing so it involves ASSA and


---------30:01----------
it also involves prana I am so certain


---------30:02----------
breathing practices it also involves


---------30:04----------
very specific modernist mood the resin


---------30:07----------
Bundys pattern are specific meditation


---------30:09----------
or focusing techniques mudras or


---------30:11----------
particular hand signs or locks and


---------30:14----------
Bundys or locks so you lock certain


---------30:17----------
parts of your body to shift the flow of


---------30:20----------
your branagh so true Kundalini Yoga


---------30:23----------
involves like all of that stuff and if


---------30:25----------
you do that under without the guidance


---------30:26----------
of a guru like I really don't think that


---------30:28----------
that's safe but I think it's really


---------30:30----------
powerful I so a big part of my personal


---------30:35----------
practice very early on and what I felt


---------30:37----------
was somewhat transformative was


---------30:39----------
Kundalini Yoga okay hey dr. K just


---------30:42----------
recently found your channel I'm starting


---------30:44----------
my internship this year and will soon be


---------30:46----------
wrapping up my clinical psych PhD as I


---------30:48----------
move into my career I think at some


---------30:50----------
point it would be awesome to do


---------30:51----------
something on the side that benefits the


---------30:53----------
community I grew up in a lot of mmo's


---------30:56----------
and fighting games any suggestions for


---------30:58----------
ways to give back to the community have


---------30:59----------
you ever thought about collaborating


---------31:00----------
with other mental health providers and


---------31:02----------
professionals with this stuff yeah so


---------31:05----------
first of all I think it's great that


---------31:06----------
you're pursuing a psych PhD and that you


---------31:09----------
want to give back to your your gamer


---------31:11----------
bros and girls and everything in between


---------31:15----------
so I think


---------31:18----------
ways to get back to the community so you


---------31:19----------
know you're welcome to get involved with


---------31:21----------
us so we're we're you know as we're


---------31:23----------
training coaches and stuff I'm we're


---------31:25----------
exploring a lot of other kind of options


---------31:27----------
and I think if you're especially a


---------31:29----------
trained psychologist that would be cool


---------31:31----------
so you could try to help us because


---------31:34----------
we're trying to help people and they're


---------31:35----------
more people than I can help and the


---------31:38----------
second thing is have I thought about


---------31:39----------
collaborating with other mental health


---------31:41----------
providers and professionals absolutely


---------31:43----------
so I you know I have a couple of


---------31:44----------
professional connections that are you


---------31:49----------
know all over the place so like there


---------31:50----------
are other therapists and psychiatrists


---------31:51----------
that I talked to about what the work


---------31:53----------
that I'm doing some of them find me


---------31:55----------
because their YouTube algorithm sent me


---------31:57----------
send me their way and then I'm also


---------32:01----------
trying to educate psychiatrists and


---------32:03----------
soon-to-be psychologists about video


---------32:06----------
game addiction and stuff like that so I


---------32:07----------
do some national stuff I teach a lot


---------32:10----------
through residency programs and through


---------32:12----------
HMS I I'm doing stuff with the American


---------32:15----------
Psychiatric Association so I have like


---------32:17----------
this whole academic side like part of


---------32:19----------
the reason that I only stream like six


---------32:20----------
or seven hours a week is because you


---------32:22----------
know I do all this other kind of


---------32:23----------
academic stuff clinical stuff things


---------32:26----------
like that I mean if you're interested in


---------32:28----------
getting involved with that you know we


---------32:29----------
have a prospective collaboration with


---------32:31----------
MIT going on so we'll see how that goes


---------32:34----------
to actually like study neuroscience and


---------32:37----------
things like that so you know if you're


---------32:41----------
interested in getting involved in any of


---------32:42----------
that stuff reach out I think we're gonna


---------32:43----------
try to add a link at the bottom for


---------32:46----------
people who are interested in


---------32:47----------
volunteering or getting involved so yeah


---------32:53----------
yeah if you guys want me to quit in


---------32:55----------
instream full-time you got it I got to


---------32:57----------
get those sweet sweet subs and I've


---------32:59----------
transman dr. K has bills to pay do you


---------33:04----------
think we shouldn't listen to music 24/7


---------33:06----------
because our minds are overstimulated


---------33:09----------
um no I think the bigger problem well I


---------33:14----------
guess yeah maybe maybe the answer is yes


---------33:16----------
so I'd be really curious why you listen


---------33:19----------
to music 24/7 like what do you get like


---------33:21----------
if you're listening to something 24/7


---------33:24----------
aren't you basically drowning it out


---------33:31----------
like do you really listen to it I mean I


---------33:34----------
find music to be incredibly impactful


---------33:36----------
for my mental state like I really like


---------33:37----------
it to get me in the right kind of mood


---------33:40----------
to work or facilitate a flow State or


---------33:42----------
get pumped up but I find that like them


---------33:45----------
you know you you have to be intentional


---------33:47----------
I mean if I intentionally listen to


---------33:50----------
music it pumps me up if it's playing on


---------33:51----------
in the background as less of an effect


---------33:54----------
so I listen to certain music before I


---------33:57----------
stream and I think it puts me in like a


---------33:59----------
good mindset and do I think your mind is


---------34:05----------
gonna be too stimulated yeah so I think


---------34:07----------
that you should give your mind a break


---------34:10----------
for mental activity so remember that


---------34:12----------
your mind is sort of like a cow and


---------34:14----------
likes to chew over things so it's like


---------34:17----------
it wants to like chew cud and things


---------34:20----------
like that so it wants like chew over


---------34:21----------
things so I think if you I found that in


---------34:24----------
my life like I noticed one day that you


---------34:26----------
know I would listen to an audio like I


---------34:27----------
listen to audio lectures and stuff in


---------34:29----------
the morning when I was in med school and


---------34:31----------
then on the train I would listen to an


---------34:32----------
audio lecture when I was walking to the


---------34:33----------
train when I sat down on the train I


---------34:35----------
would study I would listen to an audio


---------34:37----------
book or something like that when I get


---------34:39----------
off the train and walk into class then


---------34:40----------
I'm in class and like basically like the


---------34:43----------
whole day my mind was occupied by you


---------34:46----------
know audio lectures or audio books which


---------34:49----------
I listened to a lot of and there was


---------34:51----------
this phase in my life where I felt like


---------34:53----------
I didn't want to waste a moment I always


---------34:54----------
wanted to be learning something so a lot


---------34:56----------
of audiobooks in between studying and


---------34:58----------
then I realized like actually I'm just


---------35:01----------
my mind is just I need to give my mind


---------35:03----------
time to just be itself because I think


---------35:05----------
something you guys have to remember is


---------35:07----------
that sure you can learn a lot from other


---------35:08----------
people and reading things and stuff like


---------35:10----------
that but do not underestimate what your


---------35:13----------
mind can discover so if you give your


---------35:16----------
mind enough like


---------35:18----------
space it will process things and help


---------35:21----------
you understand things and make


---------35:22----------
discoveries of its own it'll give you


---------35:24----------
creative ideas like just think about


---------35:26----------
this for a second you know like I don't


---------35:27----------
know if you guys are Game of Thrones


---------35:28----------
fans and I'm talking about the show


---------35:30----------
talking about books but you know if you


---------35:32----------
think about that like how did george RR


---------35:34----------
martin like his mind came up with that


---------35:37----------
right if he was constantly listening to


---------35:40----------
stuff and constantly occupying his time


---------35:43----------
he would not be able to create new ideas


---------35:46----------
new ideas and creativity requires space


---------35:52----------
for them to happen and if you feel stuck


---------35:56----------
in life if you feel uninspired part of


---------35:59----------
that may be because you're not giving


---------36:01----------
your mind the space to actually like


---------36:03----------
figure out what it wants to do so I


---------36:08----------
think you should be careful about me


---------36:09----------
listening to music 24/7 and really try


---------36:11----------
to understand what is it doing for you


---------36:12----------
and what is it doing for your mind


---------36:19----------
what's happening in the brain with you


---------36:21----------
all of a sudden stop enjoying games and


---------36:23----------
actually prefer doing more productive


---------36:25----------
things is it still about dopamine levels


---------36:28----------
the short answer is I don't know and no


---------36:31----------
one does okay the long answer is I don't


---------36:35----------
think so so I think that over time if


---------36:39----------
you feel stuck in life or if you engage


---------36:42----------
your mind in other ways that's gonna


---------36:44----------
like create intrinsic motivations or


---------36:47----------
pulls away from video games the other


---------36:50----------
thing that happens over time is that


---------36:51----------
your frontal lobes and prefrontal cortex


---------36:53----------
mature so frontal lobes and prefrontal


---------36:56----------
cortex are responsible for impulse


---------36:58----------
control and being able to delay


---------37:01----------
gratification so when you're like a


---------37:04----------
five-year-old


---------37:05----------
your capacity to enjoy investing a lot


---------37:12----------
of work and getting out of it versus an


---------37:14----------
immediate reward is like really skewed


---------37:17----------
like five-year-olds don't get much


---------37:19----------
accomplishment out of growing a tomato


---------37:23----------
plant over the course of months and like


---------37:25----------
getting value out of like getting that


---------37:28----------
tomato it mean like when spring comes


---------37:30----------
around


---------37:31----------
right they don't have that capacity


---------37:32----------
because their prefrontal cortex so


---------37:34----------
they'll eat the tomato they'll enjoy the


---------37:35----------
tomato but the idea of like invested


---------37:38----------
work and like reaping those rewards is


---------37:41----------
not something that their brain enjoys as


---------37:43----------
much as like impulsive activities as we


---------37:45----------
grow older


---------37:46----------
so our IQ can top out relatively quickly


---------37:49----------
but our brain involves so much more than


---------37:52----------
like analytical capability so our


---------37:55----------
frontal lobes develop until about the


---------37:57----------
age of 30 and some people even say like


---------37:58----------
30 to 35 I suspect in gamers they


---------38:01----------
actually continue to develop because


---------38:02----------
they're like sort of delayed in their


---------38:04----------
development until like 32 to 35 and so a


---------38:07----------
lot of that change in enjoyment is


---------38:10----------
because as your frontal lobes develop


---------38:12----------
your capacity to enjoy activities that


---------38:14----------
involve delayed gratification and your


---------38:16----------
sense of accomplishment from a hard


---------38:17----------
day's work is actually actually changes


---------38:20----------
so that's just one circuit in addition


---------38:22----------
or one neuro scientific principle that


---------38:26----------
in addition to dopamine can explain your


---------38:28----------
response but I think there's all kinds


---------38:31----------
of other stuff that goes on like other


---------38:34----------
kinds of psychological things and stuff


---------38:36----------
like that but the short answer is it's


---------38:37----------
complicated and no one really knows but


---------38:39----------
I do think it's way more than dopamine


---------38:41----------
and the simplest thing is you know as


---------38:43----------
you grow older your capacity to delay


---------38:45----------
gratification and enjoy high investment


---------38:48----------
activities increases dr. K I've noticed


---------38:56----------
quite a few references so we'll do like


---------38:58----------
two more questions then we're gonna wrap


---------39:00----------
up okay dr. K I've noticed quite a few


---------39:03----------
references to spirituality in the videos


---------39:05----------
of yours that I've seen so far do you


---------39:06----------
find spirituality conflicts with


---------39:08----------
scientific research not at all


---------39:09----------
so let me be clear about a couple of


---------39:11----------
things so the reason that I talk about


---------39:13----------
spirituality is because you guys asked


---------39:14----------
for it right so the early phases of our


---------39:17----------
if you guys like go through our healthy


---------39:19----------
game or like the original YouTube list


---------39:20----------
like the twelve videos for the first


---------39:22----------
workshop that I did and we've got about


---------39:24----------
25 other videos that are just collecting


---------39:26----------
dust


---------39:26----------
I talked very little about spirituality


---------39:29----------
it's all psychology and neuroscience


---------39:30----------
well referenced the interesting thing as


---------39:33----------
I've started interacting with my


---------39:34----------
community and as I've started streaming


---------39:37----------
what I see


---------39:40----------
so let's just take our inner what I see


---------39:42----------
is like Adam like what's missing is not


---------39:44----------
the science it's like this the stuff


---------39:48----------
that we call spirituality so if we think


---------39:50----------
about our last interview with Jake we


---------39:53----------
can talk so we did a lot of like


---------39:54----------
psychology stuff at the beginning we


---------39:57----------
talked about emotions we talked about


---------39:58----------
alexithymia we helped him find his


---------40:00----------
emotions and that's like that helps him


---------40:04----------
but it's not like the full story for him


---------40:06----------
right the full story for him I didn't


---------40:09----------
feel like the interview was complete


---------40:10----------
until we talked about Dharma so I think


---------40:14----------
what's missing and what people ask for


---------40:16----------
is like I mean the most questions that


---------40:19----------
I've are about Dharma and so that's


---------40:22----------
what's missing you guys lack purpose


---------40:24----------
it's not just depression and anxiety and


---------40:27----------
that's also why this isn't therapy


---------40:28----------
because therapy is about treating


---------40:30----------
depression and anxiety


---------40:31----------
it's about diagnosing and treating a


---------40:33----------
particular condition this is this goes


---------40:35----------
beyond that right like we started with


---------40:38----------
some psychology and then like we


---------40:41----------
absolutely moved on to spirituality with


---------40:42----------
the end so I'm talking more about


---------40:45----------
spirituality because that's what I'm


---------40:47----------
sensing people need and science I mean I


---------40:52----------
think they're both great I don't think


---------40:53----------
they conflict at all so I think that


---------40:55----------
over time science and spirituality are


---------40:58----------
gonna get closer and closer and closer


---------41:00----------
together so the more that we understand


---------41:03----------
let me just think if I could find a good


---------41:05----------
example of this so this is gonna be kind


---------41:10----------
of a stretch but how to explain this


---------41:17----------
because they're just some assumptions


---------41:20----------
that we take for granted which we think


---------41:22----------
are logical and scientific but are not


---------41:24----------
actually logical and scientific so let's


---------41:27----------
talk for a second about okay so this may


---------41:30----------
not make much sense and I have to


---------41:33----------
probably formulate this argument better


---------41:34----------
but I'm gonna just try


---------41:36----------
so karma is a spiritual concept right


---------41:40----------
like people think about God Amara karma


---------41:42----------
is a spiritual concept it's not a


---------41:44----------
scientific concept but if you really


---------41:46----------
look at this the definition of Karma all


---------41:49----------
karma means is cause and effect


---------41:51----------
garma just says that there are causes


---------41:54----------
and their effects and that if you see in


---------41:57----------
effect now there is a cause in the past


---------42:01----------
that explains why things are the way


---------42:04----------
that they are that is really all the


---------42:06----------
theory of karma says that's the essence


---------42:09----------
of the theory of karma and so we look at


---------42:12----------
that and we say okay the theory of karma


---------42:14----------
is kind of like not scientific right you


---------42:17----------
can look at something like physics and


---------42:19----------
then as people discovered like law like


---------42:21----------
so Yogi's have been saying that all


---------42:23----------
effects are preceded by causes for


---------42:26----------
thousands of years before we understood


---------42:29----------
like Newtonian physics that was not


---------42:31----------
accepted within the scientific community


---------42:34----------
Newton was the one who discovered like


---------42:37----------
the laws you know his laws of physics


---------42:38----------
which is that every action has an equal


---------42:40----------
and opposite reaction that became


---------42:43----------
science and we now all accept that is


---------42:45----------
true but after Isaac Newton but before


---------42:50----------
that garma was saying that all along


---------42:52----------
like karma and Isaac Newton are saying


---------42:54----------
like basically the same thing and now we


---------42:55----------
just assume that that scientific so in


---------42:58----------
our minds a concept that used to be


---------43:00----------
under the umbrella of spirituality has


---------43:02----------
now been moved to scientific because of


---------43:06----------
scientific exploration right like that's


---------43:10----------
what's happened now we regard that


---------43:12----------
concept is not spiritual anymore but its


---------43:15----------
scientific even though it's been talked


---------43:18----------
about by spiritual people for thousands


---------43:20----------
of years so here's the next example of


---------43:23----------
that is genetics so people said okay


---------43:25----------
fine in the realm of physics we can say


---------43:28----------
that every action has an equal and


---------43:29----------
opposite reaction but when someone is


---------43:32----------
born a particular way is that random and


---------43:36----------
the answer is no that the genetics and


---------43:39----------
now we sort of all accept genetics we


---------43:41----------
all understand genetics but you have to


---------43:43----------
like think of like put yourself in the


---------43:44----------
shoes of someone like in the 1800's and


---------43:46----------
like how radical of a concept genetics


---------43:49----------
is


---------43:50----------
that your physical form is not


---------43:53----------
determined by like is determined by like


---------43:57----------
something that is like not under your


---------43:58----------
control at all and has nothing to do


---------44:00----------
with this life like your choices or


---------44:03----------
anything like that that genetics is


---------44:04----------
essentially like the process of some


---------44:07----------
cause that creates a particular effect


---------44:10----------
and that's kind of like a no-brainer


---------44:11----------
right like that's like a no-brainer like


---------44:13----------
Dalek genetics means that my hair is


---------44:15----------
black because both my parents have black


---------44:16----------
hair but that was actually like a


---------44:18----------
relatively revolutionary concept like


---------44:21----------
over a hundred years ago and gadhimai


---------44:25----------
has sort of implies that and you can you


---------44:27----------
can make an argument that karma doesn't


---------44:29----------
imply that and that's a fair argument go


---------44:31----------
down that road but I I think that


---------44:34----------
actually what's happening is that the


---------44:36----------
more we investigate science the closer


---------44:41----------
the more we're finding scientific


---------44:43----------
validity for certain spiritual concepts


---------44:45----------
so I'll give you guys sort of the last


---------44:47----------
example which we don't fully understand


---------44:49----------
yet


---------44:50----------
so I talked a lot about Dharma Dharma is


---------44:53----------
duty or responsibility and it's my


---------44:55----------
belief that Dharma is the thing that


---------44:56----------
allows you to face difficult things in


---------44:59----------
life and choose the right thing despite


---------45:01----------
it being hard so in addiction psychiatry


---------45:05----------
research what we've realized is that for


---------45:08----------
people to quit in addiction so people


---------45:10----------
people took a bunch of people who were


---------45:13----------
addicted to substances and then tried to


---------45:15----------
understand how is it that one person is


---------45:17----------
able to quit and another person is


---------45:19----------
unable to quit so we did qualitative and


---------45:22----------
quantitative research on people who are


---------45:24----------
addicted to substances and we tried to


---------45:26----------
look for the sweet secret sauce like


---------45:29----------
where's the magic like what is it that


---------45:31----------
allows one person to overcome alcoholism


---------45:33----------
and another person to not overcome


---------45:36----------
alcoholism and the answer is something


---------45:40----------
called a competing interest or that's


---------45:41----------
not the answer it's one of the variables


---------45:43----------
right there are a lot of variables we


---------45:44----------
don't know and so competing interest is


---------45:46----------
like a good reason that makes it worth


---------45:50----------
your while to quit the substance and


---------45:52----------
that is Dharma like those are that's the


---------45:54----------
same thing so like science it talks


---------45:56----------
about a competing interest


---------45:58----------
Yogi's talk about Tata MA and it like


---------46:01----------
the end of the day a competing interest


---------46:02----------
in the tournament it's like a good


---------46:03----------
reason a duty or a responsibility if you


---------46:05----------
actually look at what are examples of


---------46:07----------
competing interests and I've talked


---------46:09----------
about this before but I'll give you guys


---------46:10----------
an example so I was like working with


---------46:12----------
someone around smoking cessation and I


---------46:14----------
tried to inform them of all the dangers


---------46:16----------
of smoking cessation like lung cancer


---------46:18----------
heart disease stroke etc and as much as


---------46:20----------
I hate them week after week after week


---------46:22----------
after week after week they didn't quit


---------46:24----------
smoking and then one day I decided to be


---------46:26----------
a dick and I said do you ever want to


---------46:29----------
see your daughter graduate from college


---------46:30----------
do you ever want to see her get married


---------46:32----------
and do you ever want to meet your


---------46:33----------
grandkids that got him to change because


---------46:36----------
that's his Dharma


---------46:37----------
that's a competing interest same thing


---------46:39----------
so I don't think that spirituality and


---------46:42----------
scientific research conflict at all in


---------46:44----------
fact I think the more that we advance in


---------46:46----------
scientific research the closer we will


---------46:49----------
validate certain spiritual concepts the


---------46:52----------
reason I say certain spiritual concepts


---------46:53----------
this is very important because I don't


---------46:55----------
think all spiritual concepts are correct


---------46:56----------
I think as we investigate some we will


---------47:00----------
not find any evidence of them and as we


---------47:03----------
investigate others we will see what's


---------47:05----------
true and what is it because that's


---------47:06----------
what's cool about science science tells


---------47:08----------
us what's true the thing that we have to


---------47:10----------
be careful about though is that we have


---------47:12----------
to understand that science is still


---------47:14----------
progressing in our capacity for science


---------47:15----------
is still in its infancy in some areas


---------47:17----------
especially when it comes to psychology


---------47:19----------
and neuroscience like we understand like


---------47:22----------
Newtonian mechanics pretty well we're


---------47:24----------
getting a better sense of things like


---------47:25----------
quantum mechanics we have a pretty good


---------47:27----------
understanding cardiac physiology we have


---------47:29----------
a pretty good understanding of


---------47:30----------
endocrinology we have less of an


---------47:32----------
understanding of the immune system less


---------47:34----------
of an understanding of the brain and


---------47:36----------
even less understanding of psychology


---------47:39----------
right so what that means is that we have


---------47:41----------
to remember that just because science is


---------47:43----------
not discovered or validated a particular


---------47:45----------
spiritual concept is that concept


---------47:49----------
related to something that is in the


---------47:50----------
neuroscience or psychology round because


---------47:51----------
if so we're gonna suck at investigating


---------47:55----------
that so you have to have you have to


---------47:56----------
remember that some spiritual concepts


---------47:58----------
are gonna be wrong and that you


---------48:00----------
shouldn't accept spirituality just for


---------48:01----------
its own sake that spirituality should in


---------48:04----------
and can be tested by science but also


---------48:07----------
that science has limitations


---------48:10----------
that science is not going to be


---------48:12----------
appropriately equipped to test for


---------48:15----------
things like reincarnation we just don't


---------48:18----------
have the scientific capability of that


---------48:19----------
yet so is it logical to believe in it is


---------48:22----------
it scientific to believe in it


---------48:23----------
absolutely not but it is my hope that


---------48:26----------
one day we will progress science to the


---------48:28----------
point of somehow being able to test


---------48:31----------
reincarnation because if it is real that


---------48:33----------
means that science should be able to


---------48:35----------
test it at some point that's like that's


---------48:37----------
how the world works right and I know it


---------48:39----------
sounds absolutely crazy today but I


---------48:42----------
think you guys just have to remember


---------48:43----------
that like a thousand years ago we didn't


---------48:45----------
understand how electricity worked we


---------48:47----------
sure as hell didn't understand the brain


---------48:48----------
we didn't understand like something like


---------48:50----------
we couldn't send someone to the moon a


---------48:51----------
thousand years ago


---------48:52----------
we couldn't send someone of the room two


---------48:55----------
hundred years ago those would have been


---------48:57----------
completely ludicrous we didn't even know


---------48:59----------
what the moon was a thousand years ago


---------49:01----------
so it's like so there are things that


---------49:06----------
sound absolutely ridiculous and I


---------49:08----------
understand that it sounds absolutely


---------49:09----------
ridiculous to be able to test


---------49:11----------
reincarnation like what the f are you


---------49:13----------
talking about how do you even go about


---------49:14----------
doing that short answer is I don't know


---------49:16----------
I don't have any idea but we should be


---------49:18----------
careful not to have scientific arrogance


---------49:20----------
that our capacity to test and understand


---------49:23----------
the world right now is like anywhere


---------49:25----------
close to complete because there is


---------49:28----------
nothing that I can there I've seen no


---------49:30----------
evidence although our capacity to


---------49:32----------
understand is growing at an asset a


---------49:34----------
exponential rate I have no idea where


---------49:37----------
the asymptote is if that makes sense to


---------49:39----------
people like I don't know like we could


---------49:40----------
continue growing at this rate of


---------49:41----------
scientific understanding for 2,000 years


---------49:43----------
and be like ten thousand times as smart


---------49:46----------
as we are today and still like not


---------49:48----------
understand half of what goes on in the


---------49:50----------
universe so I don't think that those


---------49:53----------
conflict at all and what I actually


---------49:57----------
really like is like what gives me a lot


---------50:00----------
of personal like comfort and confidence


---------50:06----------
is when there are scientific points that


---------50:09----------
validate spiritual concepts and in my


---------50:11----------
personal life and also like in my


---------50:13----------
treatment what I try to do is find the


---------50:16----------
areas where spirituality and science


---------50:18----------
overlap and it's those things that I


---------50:21----------
recommend the strong them the most like


---------50:23----------
we're


---------50:24----------
in the best example of that is every


---------50:26----------
stream I don't talk about iron mother I


---------50:28----------
don't talk about reincarnation I sort of


---------50:30----------
talk about Dharma because that's what


---------50:31----------
you guys want but what is the one thing


---------50:33----------
that I recommend on every single stream


---------50:36----------
you guys know absolutely and why is that


---------50:43----------
it's because there is overwhelming


---------50:47----------
spiritual support for it and


---------50:49----------
overwhelming scientific support for it


---------50:51----------
and let's remember so meditation is the


---------50:55----------
last example that'll leave you guys with


---------50:56----------
let's remember that meditation was


---------50:58----------
thought is like hokey silly stuff that


---------51:02----------
yoga hippies did back in the 60s it had


---------51:04----------
no scientific validation and so people


---------51:07----------
assumed it was false because it had not


---------51:09----------
been studied and now like meditation is


---------51:12----------
like they're just gigantic Institute's


---------51:15----------
that are studying the effects of


---------51:16----------
meditation so let's remember let's be


---------51:20----------
humble and not practice scientific


---------51:21----------
arrogance and remember that just because


---------51:24----------
something has not been scientifically


---------51:25----------
investigated does not mean it is false


---------51:27----------
so reincarnation is where meditation was


---------51:31----------
a hundred years ago just because we


---------51:33----------
don't know how to study it and haven't


---------51:35----------
tried does not mean it is false which is


---------51:37----------
one of the biggest mistakes that I see a


---------51:39----------
lot of people who are like prosigns and


---------51:41----------
anti religion make right it's like we


---------51:44----------
just don't we haven't studied it


---------51:46----------
appropriately so am I asking you to


---------51:47----------
believe in it no but it doesn't it's


---------51:51----------
just like we haven't studied it yet like


---------51:53----------
I don't even know how to study like I


---------51:54----------
don't even know how that works but


---------51:57----------
anyway great question okay last question


---------52:03----------
would you say you're enlightened if yes


---------52:06----------
at what age did it happened and can you


---------52:08----------
get more enlightened what I say I'm


---------52:10----------
enlightened know what at what age it


---------52:14----------
hasn't happened yet and then can you get


---------52:16----------
a more lined sort of so there are many


---------52:18----------
stages of consciousness that apparently


---------52:21----------
like you can purify so there's like a


---------52:23----------
level one enlightenment level to


---------52:25----------
enlightenment level three enlightenment


---------52:26----------
if you read but then Julie's yoga system


---------52:28----------
is he talks about some of this stuff I'm


---------52:30----------
not quite sure about all that stuff


---------52:31----------
because I haven't I haven't experienced


---------52:33----------
it and I haven't seen scientific


---------52:35----------
evidence of it so I don't really like


---------52:36----------
I don't talk about it much so I've


---------52:38----------
studied it and I can talk about it but


---------52:40----------
the things that I tend to rely on are


---------52:42----------
things that are based on my personal


---------52:44----------
experience or clinical experience and


---------52:45----------
that which has scientific validation so


---------52:49----------
there you know there's Samadhi which is


---------52:50----------
a stage of temporary enlightenment and


---------52:52----------
then there are like other stages of


---------52:54----------
enlightenment supposedly after that and


---------52:56----------
then there's the complete enlightenment


---------52:58----------
which is at the end and I just don't


---------53:02----------
talk about it because I don't really


---------53:03----------
understand it and I'm not enlightened so


---------53:07----------
I think one thing one good example of


---------53:10----------
this is that I do think for example


---------53:11----------
different stages of enlightenment or


---------53:13----------
different faculties that they describe


---------53:15----------
to ascribe to enlightened people do map


---------53:19----------
on pretty cool with like different parts


---------53:20----------
of the brain so I think as we understand


---------53:23----------
as people meditate it's not just because


---------53:25----------
enlightenment is sort of like a global


---------53:26----------
level up right it's not like leveling up


---------53:29----------
one skill it's just like it's like like


---------53:31----------
Super Saiyan form it's like a different


---------53:33----------
form of human being where everything is


---------53:35----------
boosted and that's what we actually see


---------53:38----------
so that's how spirituality and yoga


---------53:41----------
describes enlightenment or Dao or


---------53:43----------
Buddhism and we actually see that in


---------53:45----------
science that as you meditate you get


---------53:48----------
your attention gets better your


---------53:49----------
concentration gets better your memory


---------53:50----------
gets better your capacity for empathy


---------53:52----------
gets better your narcissism goes down


---------53:54----------
your capacity to delay gratification


---------53:56----------
gets better your capacity to for impulse


---------54:00----------
control gets better so if we look really


---------54:01----------
look at it scientifically meditation is


---------54:04----------
like a buff to everything which is


---------54:06----------
aligned with what people actually have


---------54:08----------
people describe enlightenment is like a


---------54:10----------
global improvement I mean there are very


---------54:13----------
few things in medicine that actually


---------54:16----------
have global improvements right so I mean


---------54:20----------
I think that meditation and and


---------54:22----------
spirituality and science are like not


---------54:24----------
exclusive at all in fact I think that's


---------54:27----------
it's the areas that they overlap which


---------54:29----------
gives you guidance on both so if there's


---------54:32----------
a scientific concept you know if there's


---------54:35----------
a bet if there's a spiritual concept


---------54:36----------
which has no validation in science then


---------54:38----------
like it's less valuable than the ones


---------54:40----------
that do have ala Dacian science


---------54:43----------

---------54:46----------

---------54:54----------

---------54:57----------
