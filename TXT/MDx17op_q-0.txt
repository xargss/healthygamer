---------00:03----------
that's a question how much money you


---------00:05----------
think the top four nights dreamer Bates


---------00:18----------
how many so 12 million dollars a year


---------00:24----------
right so this is yes so this is the


---------00:31----------
other thing when I talk about video


---------00:32----------
games not mean game so I work with some


---------00:35----------
professional gamers so these are people


---------00:37----------
who like make their living - playing


---------00:40----------
video games and so for you know when you


---------00:42----------
tell your kid like hey I want you to


---------00:44----------
like grow up and be a doctor an


---------00:45----------
investment banker you know and I want


---------00:47----------
you like why do you want to be in the


---------00:48----------
best banker so I can make 500 grand a


---------00:50----------
year and then there's a 16 year old kid


---------00:52----------
he's like I can do that today so you


---------00:55----------
know there are a lot of kids who like


---------00:56----------
play basketball there play football do


---------00:58----------
you think that they're gonna be in the


---------00:59----------
NBA the NFL and the sad truth is that


---------01:01----------
just a you know a tiny percentage of


---------01:03----------
them ever do it and I think when it


---------01:05----------
comes to having a conversation so I work


---------01:07----------
with some people who you know tried to


---------01:08----------
go pro and when I talked to them and I


---------01:11----------
think I talked to them about the numbers


---------01:13----------
so you know if you have a


---------01:14----------
twelve-year-old son


---------01:15----------
you should ask them you know what you


---------01:18----------
know what percentage how much money you


---------01:19----------
wanna make here and what percentage of


---------01:21----------
people make that money how many people


---------01:23----------
play for at night and how many of you


---------01:25----------
people make money from it and I'm not so


---------01:27----------
sure that a twelve-year-old can think


---------01:29----------
that abstractly like a 15 year old of 60


---------01:31----------
year old on Medicaid and so I think when


---------01:34----------
when they really when you really show


---------01:36----------
them the numbers I think that that is


---------01:38----------
one step but with a 12 year old I think


---------01:40----------
you really have to set limits and I


---------01:42----------
think the other thing which will kind of


---------01:44----------
get to is I think one of the most


---------01:45----------
important things that you can do as a


---------01:46----------
parent so is to talk to your kids talk


---------01:49----------
to them about why they play video games


---------01:50----------
because the problem is that you guys I


---------01:53----------
mean this is an indictment that y'all


---------01:55----------
don't understand
