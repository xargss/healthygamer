---------00:00----------
and the more you guys study yourself the


---------00:01----------
better off the the closer the gap come


---------00:04----------
becomes between me and you because


---------00:05----------
ultimately we're all the same we're all


---------00:08----------
we're all lazy mofos okay let's get


---------00:10----------
started with miss gif time so I'm really


---------00:13----------
tired oh I'm sorry man


---------00:15----------
what Scott what's up with that I don't


---------00:19----------
know why I just get um


---------00:21----------
lately I've been getting really bad


---------00:25----------
anxiety at night like I I never had


---------00:29----------
anxiety my entire life but I can't sleep


---------00:31----------
at night anymore because I just get I'll


---------00:34----------
wake up and it's not even like it's a


---------00:36----------
bad dream and my stomach will be turning


---------00:38----------
and I have no idea what to do okay so


---------00:41----------
let's talk about that is that what you'd


---------00:45----------
like to talk I mean is that that seems


---------00:47----------
to be to be the most pressing cuz it's


---------00:49----------
like on yeah I'm your mind it's


---------00:51----------
something that like I mean it's it's


---------00:53----------
really annoying because it affects me


---------00:55----------
for stream for sure cuz I'm a lot more


---------00:57----------
tired but when I get a lot of sleep I


---------00:59----------
feel a lot better when I don't get a lot


---------01:01----------
of sleep I feel like crap okay so I


---------01:04----------
noticed a couple of things have changed


---------01:05----------
miss keV what things my wall nope oh


---------01:09----------
well yeah your wall is changed too but


---------01:11----------
that's not what I was thinking about I


---------01:12----------
was thinking about the time it took you


---------01:14----------
to get a pencil and a piece of paper oh


---------01:17----------
yeah I got that pretty quick


---------01:19----------
yeah that's my first thing I thought


---------01:20----------
about all are you sure


---------01:24----------
so that's a pole


---------01:30----------
I'm back okay so then something else has


---------01:35----------
changed what did you just do I made sure


---------01:38----------
to not have noises and stuff like that


---------01:40----------
so I could focus beautiful well done my


---------01:45----------
friend like you're like a five-year-old


---------01:48----------
yeah right so that that's the feeling of


---------01:50----------
shame but like that feeling is gonna be


---------01:53----------
there right so let's just okay I'm gonna


---------01:55----------
dive in is that okay miss gif mm-hmm


---------01:58----------
okay so you feel like a five-year-old


---------01:59----------
because Here I am and I'm and it's kind


---------02:01----------
of my fault because I'm saying like good


---------02:03----------
job


---------02:03----------
you got your pencil on time and you


---------02:05----------
close the door and I know I didn't mean


---------02:07----------
to make it sound condescending but like


---------02:09----------
seriously miss gif I think this is you


---------02:11----------
got to meet yourself where you're at


---------02:12----------
right and you you have to set up like


---------02:14----------
this is the difference between sucking


---------02:17----------
at life and being good at life it's not


---------02:19----------
about like being ashamed and the problem


---------02:21----------
is that shame gets in the way and makes


---------02:23----------
us want to not do things that we need to


---------02:27----------
do to take care of ourselves right so


---------02:32----------
like I can feel a shame for like needing


---------02:33----------
a personal trainer to work out because


---------02:35----------
so many people work out on their own but


---------02:37----------
if I need a personal trainer I need a


---------02:39----------
personal trainer and in your case I


---------02:41----------
think you've done a masterful job of


---------02:43----------
little things


---------02:44----------
tiny tiny things that are going to


---------02:47----------
improve your you're like output and your


---------02:50----------
attention over the course of the next


---------02:52----------
hour and you've already incorporated


---------02:54----------
them Thanks and just think about it like


---------02:58----------
if if at anyone else if they were in an


---------03:01----------
interview and like if I you know grabbed


---------03:03----------
my like if I just grabbed if I close the


---------03:06----------
door and grabbed a piece of paper and a


---------03:07----------
pen like we wouldn't think anything


---------03:09----------
about it right that would just be


---------03:10----------
completely normal right the only reason


---------03:13----------
I'm pointing it out to you is because I


---------03:15----------
see you making a big difference in your


---------03:17----------
life based on one conversation and so I


---------03:21----------
actually find that really really


---------03:22----------
reassuring because this tells me this is


---------03:25----------
a guy who if I try to share something


---------03:27----------
with him he's actually gonna [ __ ] pay


---------03:29----------
attention and like it will it will do


---------03:32----------
something there's some people that I


---------03:33----------
talked to where like they don't take


---------03:35----------
what I offer them and like that's a


---------03:37----------
waste of my time but you are not like


---------03:39----------
you're the very opposite of waste of my


---------03:41----------
time I'm sorry if it sort of feels kind


---------03:42----------
of gone


---------03:43----------
I really didn't know I know I it's


---------03:46----------
that's fine I don't I didn't care


---------03:48----------
okay so do you want to talk a little bit


---------03:50----------
more about attention and suffer you want


---------03:52----------
to talk about what keeps you from


---------03:53----------
sleeping III think we could do both why


---------03:58----------
I think the sleeping thing to me is


---------04:00----------
probably the most pressing thing cuz I I


---------04:02----------
can't sleep anymore it drives me nuts


---------04:04----------
like yeah it's really rough tell me what


---------04:07----------
what tell me about that what's what's


---------04:09----------
keeping you from sleeping I don't know


---------04:12----------
I'll go to bed and then during the night


---------04:16----------
I'll just have anxiety like oh oh


---------04:18----------
randomly I'll wake up multiple times


---------04:21----------
throughout the night and I'll be really


---------04:24----------
tired


---------04:25----------
the next day because I just can't sleep


---------04:27----------
because I have anxiety so I'll just


---------04:28----------
constantly wake up I probably Rick


---------04:31----------
around 6:00 like 4 to 6 times a night


---------04:34----------
and and then sometimes I can't just I


---------04:37----------
can't go back to bed so so tell me what


---------04:40----------
you mean by anxiety


---------04:41----------
I think it's anxiety I mean it's my


---------04:45----------
stomach is feels like it's turning and


---------04:47----------
then it's like I almost feel like I did


---------04:49----------
an ab workout during while I'm sleeping


---------04:51----------
okay that's what I feel so stomach feels


---------04:54----------
turning so you feel queasy it's it's not


---------04:58----------
like I feel sick I feel like it's like


---------05:00----------
my like if you like flex your abs like


---------05:02----------
that's how it feels like I I feel like I


---------05:04----------
did that the entire time I'm sleeping


---------05:06----------
are you dreaming yes so what I always


---------05:11----------
dream what kind of dreams are you having


---------05:13----------
oh the most ridiculous dreams ever I had


---------05:16----------
a dream there like I had a dream


---------05:20----------
yesterday that I had a wheelbarrow that


---------05:21----------
was electric that cuz that was going


---------05:25----------
down my streets and then people were


---------05:29----------
trying to find me or something I don't


---------05:31----------
even remember the whole story but I just


---------05:32----------
remember I I was really just driving


---------05:34----------
around electric wheelbarrow and and when


---------05:37----------
people were trying to find you was there


---------05:38----------
some sort of fearful emotion around that


---------05:40----------
like did you not want to be found I


---------05:45----------
remember I don't


---------05:47----------
I don't think I was even that worried


---------05:49----------
because I was in a wheelbarrow to be


---------05:51----------
honest with you I think my one thing


---------05:53----------
that would make me feel weird it was my


---------05:56----------
one friend while I was dream while I was


---------06:00----------
dreaming my friend took my stream and


---------06:03----------
went live on it and I got really angry


---------06:06----------
at him I don't know if that would make


---------06:08----------
me like my stomach turn though that's in


---------06:12----------
the dream mm-hmm okay so that didn't


---------06:15----------
actually happen but you dreamed about


---------06:16----------
being you dreamed about dreaming and


---------06:19----------
your friend going live on your stream


---------06:21----------
yeah okay so so it sounds like you felt


---------06:24----------
angry with him in the dream well yeah


---------06:28----------
okay then I woke up okay and and so so


---------06:36----------
your your dreams like I don't know how


---------06:38----------
else can you tell me about like another


---------06:39----------
one just ran like it does it the details


---------06:42----------
actually aren't that important just if


---------06:43----------
something comes into mind if you can't


---------06:45----------
tell me about another one that's fine


---------06:46----------
like if nothing comes to mind that's


---------06:47----------
okay I'm just trying to detect patterns


---------06:50----------
if there are any but you dream all night


---------06:55----------
long basically yeah like my dreams are


---------06:58----------
make no sense they're really stupid but


---------07:01----------
I do dream every single all the time all


---------07:03----------
right whatever I wake up and like wow


---------07:04----------
that she was terrible and then I go back


---------07:05----------
to bed but I it's never like nightmares


---------07:07----------
it's never like oh why was just like a


---------07:09----------
nightmare it's usually just something on


---------07:12----------
the lines of just something happening in


---------07:16----------
my dream it's like I I know two years


---------07:18----------
ago I would have the same kind of dream


---------07:19----------
and I wouldn't feel queasy I've never


---------07:21----------
had this feeling of my ABS hurting at


---------07:23----------
night oh and I'm the street I'm trying


---------07:26----------
to sleep okay and do you have trouble


---------07:29----------
falling to sleep not


---------07:35----------
really that bad honestly it's not a


---------07:37----------
trouble falling asleep I just don't


---------07:39----------
think I get deep sleep ever I I feel


---------07:42----------
like I am very light sleeper like I'll


---------07:45----------
wake up and it's like one of my


---------07:47----------
roommates opens the fridge so I I'm a


---------07:52----------
very light sleeper and it's really bad I


---------07:55----------
just can't sleep at night and it's


---------07:58----------
definitely affecting my stream I mean


---------07:59----------
you can see bags into my eyes so so miss


---------08:02----------
gift what can you tell me about your


---------08:04----------
sleeping environment it's it's pretty


---------08:08----------
dark it's ah I wish I had a picture of


---------08:13----------
it I I think I definitely do it's it's


---------08:18----------
just it's in my closet it's it's just


---------08:20----------
the bed that it literally is just the


---------08:22----------
bed in the closet and that's it okay


---------08:24----------
close do and it's pitch-black deep okay


---------08:31----------
so your bed is in your closet yeah so


---------08:37----------
it's like this


---------08:43----------
that's my bed this is my closet and


---------08:45----------
that's the door


---------08:46----------
gotcha and do you do you have like do


---------08:50----------
you listen to music or anything before


---------08:52----------
you fall asleep or have a noise machine


---------08:54----------
or anything like that


---------08:55----------
mm-hmm nothing you have a given re are


---------08:59----------
you hot when you sleep sometimes but not


---------09:03----------
often because if it's a closet it must


---------09:06----------
not have like like ventilation right it


---------09:09----------
does okay


---------09:11----------
interesting yeah you you're in Texas is


---------09:13----------
that right mm-hmm okay have you ever


---------09:18----------
slept with a weighted blanket I have


---------09:20----------
three okay and tell me about your


---------09:26----------
experience with weighted blankets they I


---------09:29----------
it's the last March I used to get


---------09:32----------
terrible anxiety I had horrible anxiety


---------09:35----------
every night it was this the anxiety I


---------09:38----------
get it now is like 70% reduced ever


---------09:40----------
since I started taking what was I taking


---------09:43----------
I forget um I forgot what I take an


---------09:47----------
antidepressant


---------09:48----------
I forget what antidepressants called


---------09:49----------
okay it's like the very common one you


---------09:54----------
probably know what it is


---------09:56----------
Zoloft lexapro lexapro prozac so ever


---------10:01----------
since I started taking that it's been


---------10:03----------
reduced like 70% I would say but back in


---------10:06----------
like last year around April right like


---------10:09----------
in May my anxiety was terrible I've


---------10:13----------
always had bad knotting bad anxiety but


---------10:15----------
I always kick in my sleep a lot so I I


---------10:18----------
got an ADHD or I got one of those


---------10:21----------
blankets and it's helped me a lot like a


---------10:24----------
lot so I have three of them now are they


---------10:27----------
different weights yeah so one's 15 ones


---------10:31----------
22 and ones 20 how much do you weigh if


---------10:34----------
you don't want to be asking 170 and


---------10:38----------
which one do you which one do you find


---------10:41----------
works the best for you probably the 20


---------10:43----------
cuz I used the 22 for a while and it was


---------10:46----------
a way to heavy weight so just a quick


---------10:50----------
rule of thumb for what kind of weight


---------10:53----------
you want for a weighted blanket you want


---------10:54----------
to be 10 to


---------10:55----------
10 to 12 percent of your body weight so


---------10:58----------
my had to you know recommend one for you


---------11:01----------
would be 20 pounds yes interesting okay


---------11:04----------
so I I was gonna say you're the first


---------11:08----------
person that I've talked to that has like


---------11:09----------
different weights cuz usually what I you


---------11:11----------
know people come and I say like why


---------11:12----------
don't you get away to blanket get one


---------11:13----------
that's ten to twelve percent of your


---------11:14----------
body weight and then they just get you


---------11:17----------
know that so that's that's interesting


---------11:19----------
interesting that you know I've tried


---------11:21----------
multiple ones in the 10 to 12 percent


---------11:23----------
range actually works best for you yeah


---------11:26----------
no they 822 is way too heavy and I was


---------11:29----------
noticing that I was having trouble


---------11:30----------
breathing when I was sleeping cuz I'm


---------11:32----------
like hey just wait was very important


---------11:34----------
yeah and then the light the 15-pound was


---------11:37----------
okay but it was is like I was pretty


---------11:40----------
much Goldilocks and the three bears or


---------11:42----------
whatever it is yeah you know 24/7 yeah


---------11:46----------
it's just right that's great okay so so


---------11:51----------
it sounds like you don't actually have


---------11:52----------
trouble falling asleep it sounds like


---------11:54----------
your sleep is disturbed and then you


---------11:56----------
wake up and then you feel a lot of 10th


---------11:58----------
is attention and your yeah it's it's


---------12:01----------
tensions the word it's really bad and I


---------12:04----------
noticed that every night it feels like


---------12:07----------
my abs are like I I just feel like I did


---------12:10----------
an ab workout and it happens multiple


---------12:12----------
times throughout the night are you


---------12:13----------
worried about something


---------12:18----------
something that's really on my mind that


---------12:21----------
I'm worrying about all the time


---------12:22----------
streaming I mean that's like the one


---------12:24----------
thing I would say I worry about a lot of


---------12:26----------
streaming okay and how many of your


---------12:32----------
wakening x' happen after a dream during


---------12:38----------
a dream usually during a dream usually


---------12:40----------
mm-hmm is it I usually be dreaming and


---------12:44----------
then it will happen like almost be at


---------12:50----------
the beach I remember okay I remember one


---------12:52----------
I was at the beach and there was like a


---------12:53----------
70 foot wave that was coming and it was


---------12:57----------
the middle of the summer and I was in


---------12:59----------
the water but I didn't give a crap and


---------13:02----------
there was and the beach the waves came


---------13:07----------
and crashed but and then I woke up but I


---------13:13----------
didn't I wasn't scared you weren't


---------13:17----------
scared in the dream or you weren't


---------13:19----------
scared when you woke up I wasn't scared


---------13:21----------
in the dream hmm can I think for a


---------13:26----------
second


---------13:36----------
okay so miss gif I've got a couple of


---------13:39----------
different options for you


---------13:40----------
all right they range from various


---------13:43----------
amounts of like conservative and like


---------13:45----------
safe stuff to talk about to like wild


---------13:48----------
and imaginative okay okay so one one


---------13:52----------
option so first of all I don't know that


---------13:54----------
what you're feeling is anxiety okay


---------13:56----------
that's just what you're describing


---------13:58----------
actually feels to me to be tension


---------14:00----------
because you're not like so anxiety when


---------14:02----------
I think about anxiety I think about


---------14:03----------
worry I think about thinking about the


---------14:05----------
future like generally speaking people


---------14:08----------
who have anxiety or worried about what's


---------14:10----------
gonna happen the weirdest thing is that


---------14:14----------
so usually people who have anxiety have


---------14:16----------
trouble falling asleep yeah I have no


---------14:20----------
problem falling asleep because their


---------14:21----------
their mind is active keeps them awake


---------14:24----------
they're like worrying about the next day


---------14:25----------
they're worrying about this worrying


---------14:26----------
about that and they have trouble falling


---------14:27----------
asleep you're not actually describing


---------14:29----------
that the other thing about anxieties


---------14:30----------
anxiety does affect the stomach but it


---------14:33----------
usually affects it in terms of like


---------14:34----------
queasiness as opposed to like tension


---------14:38----------
mmm the other thing is that there seems


---------14:41----------
to be so I'm not so sure how much


---------14:42----------
anxiety like fits with what you're


---------14:44----------
describing which may be it is anxiety


---------14:48----------
but it's kind of like you're not using


---------14:49----------
some of this more standard language for


---------14:51----------
anxiety now I understand that you do


---------14:53----------
have anxiety around the stream so one


---------14:56----------
option is that we can assume that this


---------14:57----------
anxiety is maybe related to like some


---------14:59----------
kind of subconscious anxiety about


---------15:01----------
stream we can talk about your concerns


---------15:03----------
around streaming we can try to help you


---------15:04----------
with some of that anxiety sounds like


---------15:06----------
that would be like a pretty good use of


---------15:07----------
our time and then the hope there would


---------15:10----------
be that generally speaking is the mind


---------15:12----------
becomes more calm in the waking world


---------15:14----------
and as the the you know is there's a


---------15:17----------
weight off of your mind then your sleep


---------15:19----------
will become more peaceful that's kind of


---------15:21----------
like a no-brainer


---------15:22----------
I feel like it's it's a lot I feel like


---------15:26----------
it's a lot that I have a lot of uh I


---------15:27----------
feel a lot of stress all the time when


---------15:30----------
it comes to streaming and when it comes


---------15:31----------
to my life and maybe that is making my


---------15:33----------
this is this was my thought it was that


---------15:37----------
I have a lot of stress constantly and


---------15:40----------
and I'm super stressed and I'm thinking


---------15:42----------
about streaming all the time because the


---------15:44----------
thing is I think the average person when


---------15:46----------
they work right like my dad when he goes


---------15:48----------
to work


---------15:49----------
he what he's done with work it's done


---------15:51----------
when he's done with work he goes to bed


---------15:53----------
or he goes home and he watches CNN and


---------15:55----------
he yells the TV went for me I don't ever


---------15:59----------
get off work my job streaming is a


---------16:02----------
lifestyle it's something where my life


---------16:04----------
is streaming I am Miss Kip 24/7 and


---------16:07----------
while there's a lot of product so that


---------16:08----------
that I really do enjoy there is pieces


---------16:12----------
of it that are bad and I think me


---------16:15----------
worrying about stuff be worrying about


---------16:16----------
streaming me worrying about if I need to


---------16:18----------
do this what am I going to do tomorrow


---------16:20----------
you know am I still doing this am I good


---------16:24----------
enough for this


---------16:25----------
I think worrying about all that stuff


---------16:27----------
constantly is is and then I like being


---------16:34----------
stressed all day is making me wake up in


---------16:36----------
the middle of the night yeah I think


---------16:39----------
that makes a lot of sense so it sounds


---------16:42----------
like that's maybe what we should talk


---------16:43----------
about today yeah okay so tell me a


---------16:46----------
little bit about what it's like to


---------16:48----------
constantly be thinking about streaming


---------16:51----------
it's uh I don't mind it really sometimes


---------16:58----------
when I think about the idea of always


---------17:01----------
thinking about streaming and always


---------17:02----------
thinking about twitch I I don't mind it


---------17:05----------
but sometimes it does suck like you know


---------17:10----------
I'm always stressed if I'm like if I


---------17:12----------
should stream or what I need to do for


---------17:14----------
streaming and I think a lot of like


---------17:16----------
competitive streamers I guess you can


---------17:18----------
call them or people that care about the


---------17:20----------
streams a lot professional streamers


---------17:22----------
care and it's because they they have


---------17:25----------
fears that I think are irrational


---------17:27----------
sometimes but the fear of you know


---------17:28----------
becoming irrelevant the fear of one day


---------17:32----------
you turn on your stream and no one's


---------17:33----------
there


---------17:34----------
the fear that you know you're not you're


---------17:37----------
not good enough anymore you know you're


---------17:38----------
are you really entertaining anymore is


---------17:40----------
do people really care about you mm-hm


---------17:42----------
and those kind of fears constantly our


---------17:44----------
lumen lumen ating or looming me looming


---------17:48----------
yeah and it scares the crap out of me


---------17:52----------
and I think about it all day so you're


---------17:55----------
afraid that you know right now you're


---------17:58----------
streaming and and you have viewers and


---------18:00----------
stuff but that


---------18:01----------
it one day you know that's gonna your


---------18:04----------
viewership will drop off right like you


---------18:06----------
can't stay relevant forever I feel like


---------18:09----------
it's like I it's almost like vines in in


---------18:11----------
a in a jungle and I feel like I've been


---------18:14----------
trying to grab on to I'm like constantly


---------18:17----------
trying to grab on the vines every day


---------18:19----------
I'm barely surviving it's how I feel


---------18:21----------
okay so what I'm hearing from you is


---------18:24----------
like kind of a complete lack of security


---------18:26----------
in your future right it's not so much


---------18:29----------
about success day to day and it's about


---------18:31----------
like when you wake up in the morning and


---------18:33----------
get sort of like you know actually what


---------18:35----------
it sounds like


---------18:36----------
miss gift do you watch football no okay


---------18:39----------
you know what a Hail Mary is yeah it's


---------18:42----------
like every play is a Hail Mary right


---------18:44----------
yeah yeah yeah that's exactly it feels


---------18:46----------
like every day is like L Miriam you know


---------18:50----------
am I actually gonna even be a bit like


---------18:54----------
yeah yeah I couldn't think of anything


---------18:59----------
no I mean I think it sounds awful


---------19:01----------
actually like so what I'm also hearing


---------19:04----------
from you is that you're living life on


---------19:06----------
the edge right like it's you're you're


---------19:09----------
kind of like you're just right on the


---------19:11----------
precipice and if things don't work out


---------19:14----------
you know if you get a couple bad streams


---------19:15----------
than like your viewership drops and this


---------19:17----------
happens and then this happens like


---------19:18----------
you're kind of on the edge of the cliff


---------19:20----------
and like there's there's there's never


---------19:22----------
no matter how successful you are it's it


---------19:26----------
seems to me like it's it's basically


---------19:28----------
impossible from for you to move away


---------19:31----------
from the edge of the cliff yeah and I


---------19:34----------
feel like a lot of that angst comes from


---------19:36----------
when I grew a lot last year when I grew


---------19:39----------
a lot less year in May I started to feel


---------19:43----------
like you know when you double your view


---------19:45----------
count overnight it becomes something


---------19:47----------
like are these people really there for


---------19:49----------
me or are they there because of the hype


---------19:53----------
and I am terrified that they're going to


---------19:57----------
just leave one day and then people are


---------19:59----------
just going to [ __ ] on me and be like oh


---------20:01----------
you know you suck like you're dead


---------20:04----------
stream and blah blah blah all that stuff


---------20:06----------
I think it's not a fun thing to think


---------20:08----------
about it scares me because I don't want


---------20:11----------
them to leave you know I don't want to


---------20:14----------
go back


---------20:15----------
- I feel like I've worked so hard and to


---------20:18----------
go back to like half of what I had or


---------20:22----------
something like that really scares me


---------20:24----------
okay yeah can I think for a second


---------20:27----------
mm-hmm can you tell me about what what


---------20:39----------
it was like to grow so quickly it was


---------20:42----------
it's just pressure and it just comes


---------20:45----------
down to pressure and stress because


---------20:46----------
people are constantly thinking that you


---------20:48----------
need to and it's the thing is I don't


---------20:51----------
even know if it's people thinking this


---------20:52----------
or if it's just me over analyzing it but


---------20:54----------
I I constantly feel like I need to be


---------20:56----------
entertaining or I constantly feel like I


---------20:57----------
need to be doing something or you know


---------21:00----------
they're just gonna leave and never come


---------21:01----------
back or I feel like that you know that


---------21:06----------
they they just think that I need to come


---------21:08----------
I need to constantly be I guess the word


---------21:12----------
is entertaining and it's just stressful


---------21:14----------
and I don't control how entertaining you


---------21:17----------
are yeah for sure


---------21:20----------
I mean I've seen well III think I mean


---------21:25----------
you can ask my friends off stream but I


---------21:26----------
I do always try to entertain there's not


---------21:28----------
a moment besides I guess right now


---------21:30----------
where I am NOT trying to entertain I'm


---------21:34----------
always trying to make people laugh it's


---------21:36----------
it's my life it's been my life since I


---------21:37----------
was a kid was - trying to make people


---------21:39----------
laugh okay so so that's not the question


---------21:42----------
that I asked though so I don't ask can


---------21:44----------
you try to be entertaining I asked can


---------21:46----------
you control how entertaining you are


---------21:51----------
what do you mean by that so trying to be


---------21:58----------
entertaining is like sort of an effort


---------22:01----------
or an action controlling how


---------22:06----------
entertaining you are is about an outcome


---------22:09----------
being


---------22:11----------
entertaining is not actually like is


---------22:13----------
about other people's perception of


---------22:15----------
whether you're entertaining or not it


---------22:17----------
has nothing to do it's not the same as


---------22:19----------
your efforts right so like there's a


---------22:21----------
difference between I tell 10 jokes a day


---------22:25----------
to try to be funny and I tell 10 funny


---------22:29----------
jokes a day Oh does that make sense


---------22:33----------
mm-hmm yeah so I would say can I control


---------22:40----------
if I'm funny or not now so can you


---------22:43----------
control whether you're entertaining or


---------22:45----------
not know maybe like it's some days I


---------22:49----------
have it some days I just don't give a


---------22:51----------
[ __ ]


---------22:52----------
it's really weird which makes sense


---------22:53----------
right because I think that's why like so


---------22:56----------
if I had to put myself in your shoes and


---------22:58----------
I realized deep down that I actually do


---------23:01----------
not control how entertaining I am it


---------23:04----------
logically leads to your fears of


---------23:06----------
everyday as a Hail Mary because you


---------23:07----------
actually can't control what if you it's


---------23:11----------
true right make sense because you can't


---------23:14----------
control whether they're gonna laugh and


---------23:18----------
here you are spending every waking and


---------23:22----------
sleeping moment trying to figure out how


---------23:26----------
to make them laugh yeah that's actually


---------23:29----------
very true and you think I got to think


---------23:36----------
more if I think I think I think I think


---------23:38----------
I think you're the quarterback who looks


---------23:41----------
at the field and says I got to throw a


---------23:43----------
Hail Mary and every waking minute you're


---------23:47----------
thinking how can I make sure that this


---------23:50----------
Hail Mary gets caught yeah and if I


---------23:53----------
think harder and if I think during my


---------23:56----------
sleep and if I think when I'm taking a


---------23:58----------
[ __ ] if I think about it worry about it


---------24:01----------
stress about it how can I make sure that


---------24:03----------
that Hail Mary wins the reality is they


---------24:07----------
can't say I the more you think about


---------24:11----------
trying to be funny like this I I don't


---------24:14----------
remember anything from when I was a kid


---------24:16----------
I just don't


---------24:16----------
I just remember I was a piece of [ __ ]


---------24:18----------
but I remember why one friend Danny


---------24:23----------
he always he always asked me he's like


---------24:24----------
how do you make everybody laugh or how


---------24:26----------
do you always how are you


---------24:27----------
always being funny and I said to him I


---------24:30----------
said the key to being funny is don't try


---------24:34----------
and that's the problem that he had I was


---------24:36----------
like you always are trying to be funny


---------24:38----------
and no one is gonna laugh because you're


---------24:40----------
trying or you're caring too much you're


---------24:42----------
trying to think about it and I think


---------24:47----------
back then it doesn't it's different then


---------24:48----------
compared to being extremely right


---------24:50----------
because I feel that being a streamer I


---------24:52----------
always need to be entertaining


---------24:53----------
especially ever since I grew massively


---------24:58----------
but the reality is in being funny you


---------25:00----------
can't always be funny right it's like if


---------25:02----------
everything is good then you know if


---------25:06----------
everything is considered everything is


---------25:09----------
good then it's not good it's just


---------25:11----------
average right you want to make sure that


---------25:13----------
your jokes are funny you want to make


---------25:15----------
sure that you're being funny and not it


---------25:19----------
almost sounds like you also want to make


---------25:20----------
sure that there are times where you're


---------25:22----------
not funny


---------25:23----------
well you because it's it's important to


---------25:25----------
not force it right I mean if I'm telling


---------25:27----------
jokes seven hours a day or I'm trying to


---------25:30----------
be funny for seven hours it doesn't work


---------25:32----------
you can't be that no one is like that


---------25:33----------
and it's you know it's it's not a


---------25:36----------
reality but I try to be as much as


---------25:40----------
possible entertaining and sometimes I


---------25:43----------
feel like I'm almost like I'm trying to


---------25:46----------
force it when it's just not there and it


---------25:49----------
stresses me because I I think that


---------25:51----------
that's that you what you said is exactly


---------25:52----------
I think about it all day every day and


---------25:56----------
it goes into my sleep where I'm thinking


---------25:58----------
about it all day every day that I need


---------25:59----------
to be entertaining because streaming is


---------26:01----------
a 24/7 job and I feel like I need to be


---------26:03----------
doing that when I was always like that I


---------26:05----------
mean I always was thinking that I need


---------26:07----------
to be entertaining but not to the point


---------26:09----------
now because you know back then if I went


---------26:12----------
to my friend's house and just played


---------26:13----------
halo and I didn't feel like making a


---------26:15----------
joke no one gave a [ __ ] well nowadays if


---------26:17----------
I go live and I play video games super


---------26:19----------
like why aren't you being funny like


---------26:20----------
what are you doing like they're like


---------26:22----------
poking a stick at me like dance monkey


---------26:24----------
how does that feel


---------26:27----------
[Music]


---------26:29----------
not the best but I mean it comes with


---------26:31----------
the job you know you got a you got to do


---------26:36----------
what you got to do so the misc if I want


---------26:39----------
to kind of come back to this core point


---------26:41----------
yeah I mean you shared a lot of stuff


---------26:42----------
about you know being funny and trying


---------26:44----------
and in controlling and and sort of I was


---------26:48----------
kind of confused because I felt like you


---------26:50----------
were saying all the stuff that I'm


---------26:51----------
supposed to say which what part because


---------26:54----------
that I probably think about this all the


---------26:56----------
time yeah does that make sense like I


---------26:59----------
feel like you told yourself exactly what


---------27:02----------
it's my job to tell you which is that


---------27:04----------
you can't control the Hail Mary yeah


---------27:06----------
it's nice to hear from you though cuz


---------27:08----------
you're I mean you know it like yeah I


---------27:13----------
didn't even say it like you said it


---------27:14----------
right you're thinking about your friend


---------27:16----------
and it's almost like you're drawing a


---------27:18----------
parallel between who you are now and who


---------27:20----------
your friend used to be yeah that


---------27:24----------
suddenly use somewhere along the way you


---------27:26----------
started trying okay actually you've


---------27:30----------
always tried somewhere along the way you


---------27:32----------
became trapped by the expectation of


---------27:39----------
being funny yeah that's it you let


---------27:42----------
yourself be bound by it and what you


---------27:46----------
used to do is used to just be you yeah


---------27:49----------
it was easy to be you and people saw


---------27:51----------
that and then they loved it and you grew


---------27:52----------
and somewhere along the way you stopped


---------27:55----------
being you and you started pretending to


---------27:58----------
be you yeah yeah you started trying to


---------28:04----------
become the person that they that


---------28:06----------
attracted them in the first place which


---------28:09----------
is kind of weird because that's sort of


---------28:10----------
you but it's not actually you right you


---------28:15----------
started instead of being yourself you


---------28:17----------
started living like up to this like


---------28:19----------
ideal mischief which is actually like a


---------28:23----------
mythological thing like that's not a


---------28:24----------
real thing man because what they saw was


---------28:27----------
you and I think probably that I've


---------28:28----------
noticed this like time and time again


---------28:30----------
because I talked to a fair number of


---------28:31----------
streamers I don't know if it's a


---------28:32----------
selection bias but I think part of what


---------28:34----------
attracts people to twitch is not seeing


---------28:37----------
someone perfect


---------28:38----------
it's seeing someone flawed mm-hmm right


---------28:43----------
and and I think that this is kind of


---------28:45----------
this is wild because I think miss Kaif


---------28:47----------
unfortunately the real problem here is


---------28:49----------
that actually you're [ __ ] smart guy


---------28:51----------
the real problem is that your mind is


---------28:54----------
able to see futures for you and perform


---------28:56----------
calculations so many calculations where


---------29:00----------
you crash and burn so one thing I've


---------29:03----------
seen about anxiety is the smarter you


---------29:05----------
are the worst liang's ideas mmm yeah


---------29:10----------
negativo


---------29:11----------
and and so your mind is like calculating


---------29:13----------
all of these different options like if


---------29:15----------
you don't do this and if you don't do


---------29:16----------
this and if you don't do this and what


---------29:18----------
you're looking for is the answer right


---------29:20----------
you've got you're like you're a


---------29:22----------
quarterback with a five head and you're


---------29:24----------
thinking about wind speed and this and


---------29:26----------
that how can I calculate to make sure


---------29:28----------
this pass gets caught but the truth is


---------29:32----------
you can't it's a now misc if we come to


---------29:35----------
something that's really really wild


---------29:37----------
terrifying and crazy which is surrender


---------29:41----------
in life you do not control the outcomes


---------29:45----------
you only control your efforts and if you


---------29:50----------
want to be at peace with yourself


---------29:51----------
understand that the more you stress when


---------29:54----------
you talk about stress what you're trying


---------29:56----------
to do is control an outcome it's like


---------29:59----------
you're you're into a girl and you want


---------30:02----------
to say the perfect thing to get her to


---------30:04----------
say yes when you ask her out


---------30:06----------
how can I make her say yes in your mind


---------30:10----------
like does backflips and loops and your


---------30:13----------
drawing on chalkboards and your


---------30:14----------
calculating things out and you're taking


---------30:16----------
notes you're stressing about your


---------30:17----------
thinking about it thinking about it


---------30:18----------
thinking about it thinking about it


---------30:19----------
thinking about it because there are


---------30:21----------
these possibilities and one day like how


---------30:23----------
can you figure out a formula so that


---------30:25----------
every day when you stream you're funny


---------30:28----------
and people like it and they're gonna


---------30:29----------
continue to grow and they'll never


---------30:31----------
abandon you and you can have security


---------30:33----------
for the rest of your life you are


---------30:37----------
setting up a problem for yourself that


---------30:39----------
is so impossible to solve but at the


---------30:42----------
same time you're a smart guy and you


---------30:44----------
rely on solving problems you've trusted


---------30:47----------
yourself because your whole life you've


---------30:49----------
actually been plagued with difficulties


---------30:51----------
and yet your mind Feisal


---------30:52----------
finds a way to overcome them whether


---------30:55----------
it's a TD in school or this or that or


---------30:56----------
whatever like you've always found a way


---------30:58----------
you've relied on your mind it's


---------30:59----------
incredibly powerful it's always showed


---------31:02----------
you a way to like move forward and now


---------31:05----------
you come to the unsolvable problem the


---------31:07----------
constant stress of how do I make sure


---------31:09----------
they stay and you're in an in in an


---------31:12----------
industry where you can't yeah so the


---------31:16----------
bizarre thing here is and I think you


---------31:20----------
sort of have the first half of the


---------31:21----------
answer yourself which is like what you


---------31:23----------
told your friend is that you can't


---------31:24----------
actually guarantee that they're gonna


---------31:26----------
come you can't guarantee that they're


---------31:28----------
gonna stay and you can't guarantee that


---------31:30----------
you're gonna be funny and stress as much


---------31:32----------
as you want to you cannot control the


---------31:33----------
outcomes of your actions and so this is


---------31:37----------
terrifying because what what this means


---------31:39----------
is that for you to be at peace you have


---------31:41----------
to give up control so there is a way


---------31:46----------
forward which is that you try to be


---------31:49----------
yourself right so like this I know this


---------31:51----------
sounds crazy but I know exactly what


---------31:54----------
you're talking about


---------31:56----------
hmm because this is where you've had it


---------31:59----------
similarly right absolutely right from 0


---------32:02----------
to 18 thousand viewers in two months


---------32:05----------
yeah


---------32:07----------
it's terrifying and like I struggled too


---------32:13----------
and so the difference between me and


---------32:16----------
many other streamers is I am so [ __ ]


---------32:18----------
lucky that I've spent 15 years


---------32:21----------
meditating before I started my first


---------32:24----------
stream mmm so I have some tools in my


---------32:26----------
tool kit and I've learned certain things


---------32:28----------
and the first is that as a human being


---------32:30----------
you learn this in medicine real [ __ ]


---------32:32----------
quick it's not just meditation it's also


---------32:34----------
in medicine that I can try I can care


---------32:37----------
about a patient as much as I want to I


---------32:39----------
cannot save them mm-hmm you just can't


---------32:42----------
control like I can I can study I can


---------32:45----------
work but at the end of the day the


---------32:47----------
doctors who get torn alive by themselves


---------32:49----------
are the ones who try to control whether


---------32:52----------
they can save a life or not


---------32:54----------
that's terrifying them what's terrifying


---------32:57----------
about it you know it goes back to the


---------33:01----------
streaming thing it's just the


---------33:02----------
possibility that you can if you don't if


---------33:06----------
you if you lose what you had or if


---------33:08----------
you're not yourself anymore you can just


---------33:11----------
it goes away what goes away everybody


---------33:17----------
your success does people this is where


---------33:22----------
you got to be a little bit careful with


---------33:24----------
your thinking okay because misc if your


---------33:27----------
yours twitch success may go go away but


---------33:30----------
you won't go away and now you have


---------33:32----------
another problem where who you are is


---------33:34----------
getting tangled up with twitch you are


---------33:37----------
starting to derive a sense of value and


---------33:40----------
purpose related to your viewer count


---------33:42----------
which unfortunately is exactly how


---------33:45----------
social media operates like it's not I


---------33:47----------
don't think that it's like diabolical I


---------33:49----------
don't think they designed it like this


---------33:50----------
but it's just like when you see your


---------33:51----------
viewer account like you have an


---------33:53----------
objective measure of your value as a


---------33:55----------
human being and that's becoming like


---------33:57----------
it's terrifying but like you know human


---------34:00----------
beings like if you look at a tribe of


---------34:01----------
Apes they have sort of like a social


---------34:04----------
standing but it's nebulous right there's


---------34:07----------
no like there's no quantitative it's not


---------34:09----------
like like a troupe of chimpanzees have


---------34:12----------
like numbers stamped on their head about


---------34:15----------
like what their value in the tribe is


---------34:17----------
does that make sense yeah and that's how


---------34:20----------
we used to be - right so like used to


---------34:23----------
like if you think about you know 50


---------34:24----------
years ago sure some people were rich and


---------34:27----------
some people had nice cars but some


---------34:29----------
people were really good at making


---------34:30----------
brownies and some people were super nice


---------34:32----------
and some people had kids that were like


---------34:34----------
great at playing the violin and so our


---------34:38----------
sense of worth was like really really


---------34:40----------
nebulous and so we had some degree of


---------34:44----------
comfort in that because like there's no


---------34:46----------
way to like rank like the quality of


---------34:48----------
brownie versus like making ten thousand


---------34:50----------
more dollars in a year yeah you can't


---------34:53----------
you just can't compare that whereas now


---------34:56----------
what's happened is life has given us a


---------34:59----------
way to stamp a number on her forehead


---------35:00----------
about what we're worth


---------35:03----------
I also feel like an issue with that is


---------35:06----------
it's not only that we're stamping a


---------35:08----------
number that were worth it's the social


---------35:11----------
climb never ends you know it's that you


---------35:15----------
know like I was content with what I had


---------35:19----------
a year ago but I wanted a little bit


---------35:21----------
more and I still said that today you


---------35:24----------
know it's it never ends and I'm sure if


---------35:26----------
I grow it's still gonna I'm still gonna


---------35:28----------
want more because there's always out


---------35:29----------
there


---------35:30----------
excellent so I'm glad you recognized


---------35:32----------
that you're actually in a good spot


---------35:34----------
miss-ghetti mmm so I also work with


---------35:37----------
people who are you know have net worth


---------35:39----------
some hundred million five hundred


---------35:40----------
million billion dollars some of them


---------35:42----------
want more it's never enough


---------35:45----------
and so now we get to a couple of really


---------35:47----------
core principles so the first is that


---------35:50----------
satisfaction doesn't come from the


---------35:52----------
outside it comes from within


---------35:53----------
it is much of like a hippie yoga hippy


---------35:56----------
Oprah kind of thing that that's a like


---------35:57----------
that's literally how it works yeah all


---------36:00----------
right and and it's wild to actually


---------36:04----------
think about it second thing is you


---------36:05----------
cannot control the outcomes of your


---------36:07----------
actions you can only control your


---------36:09----------
actions what do you think about that you


---------36:16----------
can't control


---------36:16----------
the outcome of your actions you can only


---------36:18----------
control your actions so you can it goes


---------36:21----------
back to what you said about making jokes


---------36:24----------
or doing things it's you you can't


---------36:28----------
control it you can you can you can't


---------36:31----------
control if they're gonna laugh or not


---------36:32----------
you just gotta be you


---------36:33----------
exactly very good so I'm glad you


---------36:36----------
clarified what it is what you control is


---------36:39----------
whether you make a joke and what the


---------36:41----------
joke is you do not control whether they


---------36:44----------
laugh yeah this is a terrifying and


---------36:48----------
transformative realization for you to


---------36:51----------
embrace fully because our whole life our


---------36:54----------
our society and our system of


---------36:56----------
functioning is based on the idea that


---------36:58----------
you can control the outcomes of your


---------37:00----------
actions it's just terrifying cuz what's


---------37:06----------
terrifying about it good that means you


---------37:08----------
understand at Misgav what still you know


---------37:12----------
it i I it's the idea that people put me


---------37:20----------
on this like pedestal of like what I


---------37:22----------
need to be which is like this streamer


---------37:24----------
that you know it always has to be


---------37:29----------
entertaining or funny and stuff like


---------37:30----------
that and well a lot of times I feel like


---------37:35----------
I am but there's some times where I'm


---------37:37----------
not and I it's terrifying because I


---------37:41----------
don't want to lose them I don't I don't


---------37:44----------
want to lose my people because of they


---------37:50----------
they have too high of expectations very


---------37:53----------
good so two really important things that


---------37:56----------
you said there the first understand this


---------37:59----------
you are trying to live up to the


---------38:03----------
expectation in the mind of a viewer and


---------38:07----------
twitch at at that not just a regular


---------38:10----------
viewer twitch at right well just is i


---------38:15----------
I've asked them and and I've I've also


---------38:20----------
been a twitch viewer and seven years


---------38:22----------
eight years and I know that they just


---------38:24----------
they don't even care like I they don't


---------38:26----------
give a [ __ ]


---------38:26----------
excellent like I I have asked them for


---------38:30----------
they


---------38:30----------
have I I've been there and you know


---------38:33----------
streamers are complaining or thinking


---------38:34----------
about stuff and as a viewer they're just


---------38:36----------
like what are you on about like you are


---------38:38----------
fine nothing is a problem we don't care


---------38:41----------
beautiful next step so what I said is


---------38:44----------
actually false okay the expectation that


---------38:48----------
you are trying to live up to is the


---------38:50----------
expectation of what you imagine twitch


---------38:54----------
at thinks about you yeah it's not


---------38:56----------
actually them it's you the expectation


---------39:00----------
that you fail to live up to is the one


---------39:02----------
that you create for yourself it's not


---------39:04----------
coming from the rest of the world yeah


---------39:06----------
you torture yourself by your own


---------39:08----------
expectation it's created by your mind


---------39:11----------
because twitch chat is actually lovely


---------39:14----------
they're like wonderful people like I


---------39:17----------
know it's crazy no I like I've I I've


---------39:22----------
done plenty of streams for I'm like a


---------39:24----------
you know oh I hang out with my offline


---------39:27----------
chat a lot and I'll be like that was a


---------39:28----------
terrible stream they're like dude what


---------39:30----------
are you one of that was fine I'm like no


---------39:32----------
like it was bad and it's my expectations


---------39:35----------
or I think that I didn't do enough I


---------39:37----------
didn't say enough jokes I didn't try to


---------39:38----------
be funny I wasn't saying stuff like it


---------39:40----------
was fine like it was a good stream okay


---------39:45----------
haven't flown good so let's file that


---------39:48----------
away because I think the problem is that


---------39:50----------
when you get that kind of data it like


---------39:52----------
passes through you right yeah you're


---------39:55----------
like you you have like a strainer you're


---------39:57----------
like a colander that catches all the bad


---------40:00----------
thoughts and lets the positivity flow


---------40:03----------
through like water the bad thoughts are


---------40:05----------
the pasta and the water are the good


---------40:08----------
thoughts and all the reasons that you


---------40:10----------
should trust in your success the fact


---------40:12----------
that you've grown like what you think


---------40:13----------
you've been faking it


---------40:14----------
for a year for two years yeah I haven't


---------40:18----------
been scamming people no actually what


---------40:20----------
you've been is right that's what they're


---------40:24----------
they're they're latching on to is you


---------40:25----------
and then somewhere along the way like


---------40:27----------
instead of just having fun with it which


---------40:30----------
is what is responsible for your eyes you


---------40:32----------
create an expectation for yourself you


---------40:34----------
try to live up to that expectation and


---------40:36----------
thereby you [ __ ] yourself do constant


---------40:39----------
stress how can I be the Miss gif of


---------40:41----------
before


---------40:43----------
in that what you're looking for is


---------40:45----------
security you want them to stay here's


---------40:47----------
the crazy thing you can't make them stay


---------40:48----------
in the same way that a doctor cannot


---------40:51----------
save a life in the same way that even


---------40:53----------
over the course of this hour I can't


---------40:54----------
help you hmm


---------40:56----------
do you understand that like when I when


---------40:57----------
I was a little horse to order absolutely


---------41:02----------
and and they're gonna do what they're


---------41:05----------
gonna do and so the other thing that's


---------41:08----------
terrifying about this is use the word


---------41:10----------
want that's the problem you want and I


---------41:15----------
would guess that when you started


---------41:16----------
streaming you actually didn't want no I


---------41:20----------
wanted okay I want it really bad okay so


---------41:25----------
that's something to be further explored


---------41:27----------
but I think your desire or your


---------41:30----------
expectation so let's stick with


---------41:31----------
expectation so I'm wrong about the one


---------41:35----------
but we can explore that later let's kind


---------41:38----------
of stick with this idea of expectation


---------41:40----------
so I want you to understand this like


---------41:41----------
what what effect does expectation have


---------41:44----------
on an experience for a human being so


---------41:51----------
let's just like pick movies for example


---------41:52----------
like if I have an expectation about a


---------41:54----------
movie what does that do to my like


---------41:57----------
experience of the movie you well if you


---------42:03----------
expect something then it's probably if


---------42:06----------
you think oh it's gonna be really good


---------42:07----------
then if it doesn't live up to that


---------42:09----------
standard or close you're gonna hate it


---------42:10----------
and what if it does live up to that


---------42:12----------
standard it won't be as good what if I


---------42:16----------
expect nothing from that movie it's


---------42:19----------
probably better if you think like the


---------42:20----------
movies gonna suck and then you go into


---------42:22----------
it and it's actually really good yeah


---------42:24----------
under they go wow those really good


---------42:25----------
movie


---------42:26----------
so I remember have you ever seen a movie


---------42:28----------
called what we do in the shadows I never


---------42:30----------
watch movies okay so I I had no idea


---------42:34----------
what this movie was like no idea and I


---------42:37----------
just watched it and I like absolutely


---------42:39----------
loved it even if I knew it's the kind of


---------42:42----------
movie that if you know anything about it


---------42:44----------
I think the more you know about it


---------42:45----------
before you watch the worse it's gonna be


---------42:47----------
hmm and so let's just think about this


---------42:51----------
for a second right so now like you're


---------42:53----------
suffering misg if you get that


---------42:57----------
you're suffering intensely in the size


---------42:59----------
of your expectations has grown and as


---------43:01----------
your expectations grow your suffering


---------43:04----------
gross and the reason that you expect is


---------43:08----------
because you want security from the


---------43:09----------
future you're trying to literally just


---------43:11----------
think about this or thing what I'm gonna


---------43:12----------
say sounds crazy out of the context is


---------43:14----------
conversation you are trying to control


---------43:16----------
the future


---------43:17----------
yes can you control the future


---------43:22----------
no so the earlier that you accept that


---------43:26----------
so this is where we get to surrender


---------43:29----------
okay so if the Yogi's say is for someone


---------43:32----------
who is filled with expectation the


---------43:34----------
solution is surrender surrender


---------43:37----------
surrender surrender acknowledge that you


---------43:40----------
can't control the future acknowledge


---------43:42----------
that there's nothing you can say to make


---------43:44----------
that girl fall in love with you


---------43:46----------
acknowledge that you can't make the Hail


---------43:48----------
Mary acknowledge that there's no way to


---------43:50----------
guarantee success and that


---------43:52----------
acknowledgement is [ __ ] terrifying


---------43:54----------
because it's all of your worst fears


---------43:58----------
right but something something bizarre


---------44:02----------
happens when you surrender is you start


---------44:05----------
to feel at peace the other bizarre thing


---------44:09----------
that I've seen over and over and over


---------44:10----------
again is your life actually does get


---------44:12----------
better materialistically


---------44:14----------
how do I surrender them so I think you


---------44:17----------
just think you focus on the action


---------44:19----------
instead of the outcome so every day miss


---------44:21----------
gift the most that you can do is like


---------44:23----------
stream and do the best that you can if


---------44:25----------
there's some amount of thinking about


---------44:27----------
stuff off stream that's fine like if you


---------44:30----------
have to work off stream to improve your


---------44:31----------
stream then so be it


---------44:33----------
but understand that like focusing on the


---------44:35----------
outcome and stressing about whether


---------44:37----------
you're gonna be good or not is actually


---------44:39----------
like that doesn't you can't be good


---------44:41----------
like understand that like no matter how


---------44:43----------
hard you try and how much you think it's


---------44:47----------
not up to you so some people surrender


---------44:51----------
through God or the idea of God right so


---------44:55----------
they like put things like on God and


---------44:56----------
they kind of acknowledge that there's a


---------44:58----------
higher power like you see this in a a so


---------45:01----------
like what it's kind of interesting


---------45:02----------
because a a like really helps people


---------45:04----------
stay sober you know what a is alcoholic


---------45:06----------
seems and the funny thing about like a a


---------45:08----------
is like they achieve sobriety with like


---------45:11----------
foundation of that they're like a flawed


---------45:13----------
human being and like they're not going


---------45:14----------
to be able to do it that's actually


---------45:16----------
where they start but something bizarre


---------45:18----------
happens to your psychology once you


---------45:20----------
accept that you're not in control and


---------45:22----------
that failure is a real possibility and


---------45:25----------
then what happens because the problem


---------45:26----------
with alcoholics is like they [ __ ] up


---------45:28----------
when they think they're in control does


---------45:30----------
that make sense


---------45:31----------
mm-hmm so the more that they think they


---------45:33----------
can handle it the worse off they do and


---------45:35----------
when they start to accept that they


---------45:37----------
can't control it


---------45:39----------
that they can't handle it they start to


---------45:41----------
treat the alcohol with respect and they


---------45:42----------
stay away from it so in a bizarre way


---------45:45----------
does that make sense kind of it's


---------45:50----------
bizarre it's paradoxical it's not how


---------45:52----------
our mind usually works and so for a lot


---------45:56----------
of people this is like religion and so


---------45:58----------
it doesn't it doesn't have to be


---------45:59----------
religion by the way I'm just using these


---------46:01----------
as examples so some people will


---------46:02----------
surrender to God so they'll say like


---------46:04----------
okay like you know I really want this


---------46:06----------
job but I'm gonna pray in God if it's


---------46:08----------
like if it's in line with what you want


---------46:10----------
for me then wonderful I'll be happy but


---------46:13----------
they kind of like let go of their


---------46:14----------
control yeah and I've worked really hard


---------46:16----------
for this but at the same time if it is


---------46:18----------
in your Divine Will then Soviet so they


---------46:21----------
go down that route so that's like one


---------46:22----------
way you can do it the interesting thing


---------46:24----------
is that you know it doesn't have to be


---------46:26----------
God it's just the idea that you


---------46:29----------
acknowledge that you are not in control


---------46:31----------
of the future that you can't make the


---------46:33----------
hell marylande


---------46:34----------
you can't make a woman fall in love with


---------46:35----------
you that's the important thing is just


---------46:40----------
understand that like every day when you


---------46:41----------
wake up you cannot street you can't


---------46:44----------
create a success on stream you can only


---------46:46----------
give what you have to give yeah it's


---------46:50----------
like enjoyment yep doesn't show me like


---------46:54----------
I feel like that's pretty much how it is


---------46:57----------
or it's like the expectation that I put


---------47:01----------
it's it's not even them which is crazy


---------47:03----------
like they don't care but I put this


---------47:05----------
expectation it's super high for me and


---------47:07----------
then but this is the reality where it's


---------47:10----------
like sometimes I will meet the


---------47:11----------
expectations and like I will do whatever


---------47:13----------
but I always I'm constantly thinking


---------47:16----------
about it I think this is what probably


---------47:18----------
also doesn't help me sleep is I'm


---------47:19----------
constantly thinking about it all day


---------47:21----------
every day which actually makes this go


---------47:23----------
lower


---------47:24----------
because like I said when I told my


---------47:26----------
friend Danny where it's like if you try


---------47:28----------
you're never funny if you try anything


---------47:30----------
no one's gonna laugh cuz it's not funny


---------47:32----------
you could tell what a jokes forced you


---------47:34----------
could tell when something's not


---------47:35----------
authentic and the that actually makes


---------47:41----------
this go lower and this expectation is


---------47:43----------
not gonna be met you know this is the


---------47:46----------
reality and what I have to realize is


---------47:48----------
this is it and it will never be this it


---------47:51----------
can't be this as much as I think about


---------47:53----------
it all day when I think about it gets


---------47:55----------
worse but as much as I think about it


---------47:57----------
all day it this can and will never


---------48:00----------
happen of my expectations and I just


---------48:02----------
have to understand that I am pretty much


---------48:05----------
human and I don't know if this is also


---------48:07----------
affected because of my II do like my ego


---------48:10----------
absolutely yeah he goes absolutely tied


---------48:13----------
into their crap right so right sorry I


---------48:20----------
know you believe it like because because


---------48:21----------
when you said like what I have to accept


---------48:23----------
is that I'm human that's not what your


---------48:25----------
ego thinks miss gif you're miss gift is


---------48:28----------
not your ego does not expect of you to


---------48:31----------
be human it expects of you to be


---------48:32----------
superhuman yeah I I expect myself I'm


---------48:35----------
like a yeah right I am the God that


---------48:39----------
people pray to there's like that I don't


---------48:45----------
think my phone that's that I so so so


---------48:47----------
this is where they're a couple of other


---------48:48----------
things okay so I'm gonna give you a


---------48:50----------
couple of analogies so a lot of this the


---------48:52----------
good news I mean there's good and bad


---------48:53----------
news here the good news is that you can


---------48:55----------
fix this and most of this is going on in


---------48:58----------
your mind the bad news is because it's


---------49:02----------
going on in your mind it's harder to fix


---------49:04----------
than something is that is going on


---------49:05----------
outside of your mind yeah it's like you


---------49:09----------
know hardware and software yeah but I


---------49:11----------
mean like sometimes if there's a bad


---------49:12----------
situation it's external and it's


---------49:14----------
relatively easy to fix fixing yourself


---------49:16----------
is sometimes harder okay so here a


---------49:20----------
couple of things so like let me put it


---------49:22----------
to you this way so when I select like


---------49:25----------
let's just think about a doctor right so


---------49:27----------
like a doctor who's working in an


---------49:28----------
emergency room like when a patient comes


---------49:30----------
in let's say you've got a motor vehicle


---------49:31----------
accident and like they've got broken


---------49:33----------
bones and like you know their heart


---------49:35----------
contusions and things like that you know


---------49:36----------
the doctor is going to do a free


---------49:38----------
that they can but they can't control


---------49:39----------
whether that person survives or doesn't


---------49:41----------
right you just do the best that you can


---------49:44----------
you give of yourself what you are as


---------49:46----------
completely as you can and you leave the


---------49:49----------
rest and I'm just gonna use this


---------49:51----------
phrasing because I think it's like easy


---------49:53----------
to conceptualize you leave the rest up


---------49:55----------
to God right you don't have to believe


---------49:57----------
in God but you can just say you do the


---------49:59----------
most that you can you leave the rest up


---------50:00----------
to fate entropy randomness chaos theory


---------50:04----------
God whatever whatever right there that


---------50:08----------
there's a limit to what you're capable


---------50:10----------
of and the rest of it is responsible


---------50:13----------
someone else is responsible for and I


---------50:16----------
think religious people sort of figured


---------50:18----------
that out right so they called it God and


---------50:21----------
and the other thing that you you have to


---------50:23----------
remember miss Kipp is that like I think


---------50:24----------
the other real solution here for you is


---------50:27----------
I think instead of thinking about ego


---------50:29----------
and being someone I I would really try


---------50:32----------
to encourage you to reframe what you're


---------50:35----------
doing is service really so like your


---------50:41----------
you're not streaming for yourself you're


---------50:43----------
not streaming to live up to an


---------50:45----------
expectation you're gonna show up and try


---------50:47----------
to help people as best as you can okay I


---------50:52----------
so like that actually could help yeah so


---------50:54----------
like teenage suicide rate has gone up by


---------50:57----------
50 percent in the last decade the


---------51:00----------
percentage of people who are NEETs not


---------51:02----------
in education employment and training is


---------51:04----------
in an all-time high climate change to


---------51:07----------
prior mental health has now surpassed


---------51:09----------
cardiovascular disease and cancer in the


---------51:11----------
United States is the most expensive


---------51:14----------
organ so more people there's more loss


---------51:19----------
of productivity and morbidity and


---------51:21----------
mortality so the disease burden of


---------51:23----------
mental health is now number one we've


---------51:28----------
we've we've bypassed the effects of like


---------51:30----------
Mickey D's and and sodas and cancer and


---------51:33----------
cigarettes and all that good stuff so


---------51:35----------
we're number one and understand that you


---------51:38----------
actually fulfill a very important role


---------51:40----------
for these people right which is like our


---------51:42----------
people is people like you which is that


---------51:45----------
they come to your stream and they're


---------51:46----------
looking for entertainment but they're


---------51:48----------
also looking to like have their day be a


---------51:49----------
little bit better they want to take a


---------51:50----------
break from their


---------51:51----------
it's almost like they come to hang out


---------51:55----------
absolutely yeah and and they're not


---------51:58----------
there for a show they're there for me


---------52:01----------
yeah


---------52:02----------
beautifully put right and so should you


---------52:06----------
try to cheer them up


---------52:07----------
absolutely they're coming to hang out


---------52:10----------
you want to make sure that they have a


---------52:11----------
good time that's fine but understand


---------52:13----------
that like you can't make him have a good


---------52:14----------
time right they have to meet you halfway


---------52:16----------
and that's the most that you can do you


---------52:22----------
can just be yourself let go of the


---------52:24----------
consequences of your actions and focus


---------52:26----------
on what you do the other cool thing


---------52:29----------
about this is there's a beautiful source


---------52:31----------
of pride over focusing on your actions


---------52:35----------
because that's something you can control


---------52:37----------
when you sleep at night the question


---------52:39----------
isn't how many lives did I save today or


---------52:41----------
how many of my patients did I die


---------52:43----------
it did died today the question is did I


---------52:45----------
do the best that I can


---------52:48----------
did I like study hard did I pay


---------52:50----------
attention am I going to learn from today


---------52:52----------
and is it going to make me a better


---------52:53----------
person tomorrow because the patients are


---------52:56----------
gonna come tomorrow the viewers are


---------52:57----------
gonna come tomorrow tomorrow is gonna


---------52:59----------
come so did you do everything that you


---------53:01----------
can today to make the most of it to


---------53:03----------
enrich these people's lives like


---------53:05----------
understand that people who watch twitch


---------53:07----------
sometimes when they watch twitch they


---------53:09----------
decide not to kill themselves like


---------53:12----------
that's a real thing like it's crazy


---------53:14----------
right like there are people who watch


---------53:16----------
who are suicidal and something about the


---------53:17----------
connections that we form with each other


---------53:19----------
online keep us from killing ourselves


---------53:21----------
it's the biggest thing that I think like


---------53:25----------
the boomers don't get they talk about


---------53:29----------
like all of the evils of social media


---------53:31----------
like I do because now we have good ways


---------53:33----------
to stamp like a value to herself and so


---------53:35----------
it enhances our shame but the other


---------53:37----------
amazing thing is that there's connection


---------53:39----------
and there's hope and there's strength


---------53:40----------
and there are people who get to know you


---------53:41----------
and they're people who are connected to


---------53:43----------
you there are people who love you I have


---------53:46----------
a feeling of love towards twit twit chat


---------53:48----------
it was really confusing for a while and


---------53:50----------
I was like do I really feel that how can


---------53:51----------
I feel that I don't know I don't


---------53:53----------
understand it but that's what I feel


---------53:54----------
yeah that's why I do this it's what


---------53:57----------
keeps me like it's what helps me not


---------53:59----------
care about my viewer account because


---------54:02----------
there are times where I was like okay if


---------54:03----------
my viewer count drops does that mean I


---------54:04----------
should stop


---------54:05----------
do something else I'm like no what the


---------54:07----------
[ __ ] is wrong with you like you're not


---------54:09----------
doing it for a viewer account you're


---------54:11----------
doing it because like you have something


---------54:12----------
to share and if you can help even if my


---------54:15----------
viewer account is one so be it it's


---------54:18----------
about helping not one person that was my


---------54:21----------
exact that exactly he's to say good when


---------54:26----------
I first started and I think I have


---------54:30----------
noticed what you said was true when the


---------54:33----------
more I I've noticed on days that I say I


---------54:37----------
forget what I think or I forget what I


---------54:40----------
say a lot of times and then but


---------54:43----------
sometimes people you like can jog my


---------54:44----------
memory and I've realized that a lot of


---------54:47----------
times when I am thinking about not


---------54:50----------
putting on a show but more so just like


---------54:52----------
I'm there for them or I'm there to help


---------54:55----------
these people who you know one of these


---------54:58----------
people that I might answer their


---------54:59----------
question in chat because I sometimes


---------55:02----------
forget that I was like a huge pleb I was


---------55:04----------
literally just like them if not worse I


---------55:06----------
you know well I was alone yeah well in a


---------55:11----------
lot of ways I'm similar to them and that


---------55:13----------
I know that if I can view if a streamer


---------55:18----------
read out my message I'm like as lame as


---------55:21----------
it sounds and that's what just they want


---------55:23----------
to make fun of that it does feel cool


---------55:25----------
you do get infinitive like oh like you


---------55:26----------
know it's a little bit of attention that


---------55:28----------
they might need throughout the day if


---------55:29----------
they got like no one that looks at them


---------55:31----------
or no one that cares you know that that


---------55:34----------
feeling of maybe just hanging out with


---------55:36----------
them when playing a video game or just


---------55:38----------
hanging out the more I think like that


---------55:42----------
the more I enjoy streaming because I


---------55:44----------
feel like it's not I don't I don't feel


---------55:47----------
stressed these expectations are they


---------55:49----------
don't care about the readout they like


---------55:51----------
the reality the real person because that


---------55:54----------
might be why they're there you know so


---------55:57----------
I'm sure there are a lot of you there


---------55:59----------
are viewers that care about this


---------56:01----------
expectations be sure there hype viewers


---------56:03----------
they were there when I got banned but


---------56:05----------
something I gotta realize is one that


---------56:08----------
was a year ago like these people that


---------56:09----------
are here aren't here because Oh miss


---------56:11----------
give got banned we're here for the


---------56:13----------
excitement I mean I'm sure you know


---------56:14----------
they're there because of me because of


---------56:17----------
my reality


---------56:19----------
yeah so now so yeah I think thing


---------56:24----------
biscuits so a couple things I'll kind of


---------56:25----------
leave you with okay so the first is that


---------56:27----------
I don't here wanting in there I have no


---------56:29----------
doubt that wanting is there but this is


---------56:31----------
not wanting does that make sense


---------56:33----------
mm-hmm Bodeen by wanting that so I said


---------56:37----------
earlier you kind of said oh I wanted it


---------56:39----------
I have no doubt that you wanted it but


---------56:41----------
this is not wanting what we're talking


---------56:43----------
about is not wanting right label to go


---------56:47----------
on yeah so I think this is about kind of


---------56:50----------
service and it's about like devotion


---------56:53----------
it's about like you know hanging out


---------56:56----------
like hanging out is not wanting it's


---------56:58----------
just chilling like wanting is something


---------57:02----------
else like it's a desire for like a


---------57:03----------
particular thing or a particular outcome


---------57:05----------
and I think so you ask you know how do I


---------57:08----------
surrender well I think you just go back


---------57:10----------
to it right it's not about it's not


---------57:13----------
about going to a new place it's about


---------57:14----------
going to an old place of like why you


---------57:18----------
got into the business to begin with like


---------57:21----------
that's the spirit that's the spirit that


---------57:23----------
you've got to keep alive right it's


---------57:25----------
about like hanging out with people and


---------57:26----------
gaming like that's what we're here for


---------57:28----------
that's what twitch was born about and I


---------57:30----------
hear like some people kind of complain


---------57:32----------
because twitch is changing a lot and


---------57:33----------
like some of the spirit of like what


---------57:35----------
twitch was founded on has changed


---------57:36----------
because people like me show up yeah I I


---------57:40----------
think I think yeah I hear that a lot too


---------57:42----------
and also I was there I mean yeah so I


---------57:45----------
think Trident which now is really good


---------57:47----------
though I think people yeah I think it's


---------57:49----------
one plane yeah so I think the other


---------57:51----------
thing that I you know for what this is


---------57:53----------
worth I think that at some time you know


---------57:55----------
at some point your twitch name like I


---------57:56----------
have I've just difficulty envisioning


---------57:58----------
you is like a 76 year old dude streaming


---------58:01----------
on Twitch like I just have difficult so


---------58:04----------
like I just don't think that that's


---------58:05----------
gonna happen and so I think that your


---------58:07----------
stream will probably have a lifespan


---------58:09----------
because that's usually how things go and


---------58:11----------
this is crazy I think that's gonna be


---------58:14----------
okay I think that this is a that things


---------58:18----------
are gonna change for you things are


---------58:19----------
gonna evolve a lot of people kind of


---------58:21----------
transition and I think that you're


---------58:23----------
capable of that transition too whenever


---------58:25----------
it comes yeah right and so have faith in


---------58:28----------
the person that you are have faith in


---------58:30----------
the in the person that you're becoming


---------58:33----------
and and that's you know that's that's it


---------58:37----------
man surrender let go be what you are


---------58:41----------
today instead of like trying to be


---------58:43----------
something else and now something for


---------58:46----------
everyone watching so I think this is


---------58:47----------
huge because I think out of all of the


---------58:50----------
streams that I've done this is the thing


---------58:51----------
that I think like relates to the what I


---------58:53----------
see is the biggest problems for people


---------58:55----------
who like reach out to me is understand


---------58:58----------
that expectation is what holds you back


---------59:01----------
right understand that so much of why you


---------59:04----------
do not act in life is because you are


---------59:07----------
waiting to act you you're not gonna act


---------59:10----------
until you can guarantee a result because


---------59:12----------
when you were ashamed of yourself like


---------59:15----------
if you were ashamed and you've never had


---------59:17----------
a girlfriend you can't handle a


---------59:19----------
rejection which in turn means that like


---------59:22----------
you're gonna wait until you can make


---------59:24----------
someone fall in love with you and when


---------59:26----------
you know you could make someone fall in


---------59:28----------
love with you then you're gonna ask them


---------59:30----------
because that's the only way that if you


---------59:32----------
feel ashamed about yourself the only way


---------59:35----------
that you're willing to put yourself out


---------59:36----------
there is if you can guarantee a


---------59:37----------
particular result because if you're


---------59:39----------
ashamed and you can guarantee result


---------59:41----------
then you can do it because you don't


---------59:42----------
have to deal with your shame it proves


---------59:43----------
that you don't have to be ashamed


---------59:44----------
everything is hunky-dory


---------59:46----------
everything is good and so that reliance


---------59:50----------
on controlling the future and


---------59:53----------
guaranteeing for yourself that you don't


---------59:56----------
have to deal with your shame you don't


---------59:57----------
have to deal with your failure you don't


---------59:58----------
have to deal with your rejection is what


---------60:00----------
paralyzes you it keeps you from moving


---------60:03----------
forward you are so concerned with being


---------60:08----------
a failure that you never try maturely


---------60:12----------
right that's the crux of it and then


---------60:16----------
people say oh I don't have motivation no


---------60:18----------
the problem is not that you lack


---------60:19----------
motivation the problem is that you are


---------60:21----------
so paralyzed as a failure that you're


---------60:22----------
not willing to act understand this very


---------60:24----------
carefully that is not a lack of


---------60:26----------
motivation it's not that you are not


---------60:27----------
motivated to act is that there is a more


---------60:30----------
powerful force that paralyzes you from


---------60:33----------
action yeah I I had that when I when I


---------60:37----------
first I want to do YouTube videos and


---------60:40----------
stream for or mainly YouTube I wanted to


---------60:42----------
YouTube video since I was like 14 15 I


---------60:45----------
was like


---------60:46----------
like I always wanted to do it but I


---------60:49----------
always it was that feeling of what's the


---------60:51----------
point if it's just gonna be failure


---------60:53----------
what's the point if I do this and then


---------60:55----------
it's gonna fail like oh what if my


---------60:57----------
friends make fun of me and they're like


---------60:58----------
wow you have a video that has 80 views


---------61:00----------
like you know I always felt that fear


---------61:03----------
and then one day I just pretty much


---------61:05----------
pretty much said [ __ ] it I'm like you


---------61:06----------
know what I'm going to just try this if


---------61:08----------
it fails it fails if it doesn't it


---------61:10----------
doesn't and then Here I am today


---------61:12----------
so you know that idea of failure played


---------61:18----------
a big part in why I didn't try something


---------61:20----------
a decade earlier and I had to wait until


---------61:22----------
I was in my mom's basement alone until I


---------61:25----------
finally said you know what I I'm gonna


---------61:27----------
do it now so you know when you say [ __ ]


---------61:30----------
it you know what that is


---------61:31----------
that is surrender yeah [ __ ] it is


---------61:34----------
surrender you're right you get it yeah


---------61:36----------
so this is for all of you at home who


---------61:38----------
are watching who are feeling like you're


---------61:40----------
not motivated understand this very


---------61:41----------
clearly it's not a lack of motivation


---------61:43----------
and this is why cuz these people are


---------61:45----------
smart right like twitch hat is a super


---------61:46----------
smart and if you give them a problem to


---------61:50----------
solve they'll solve the problem the


---------61:52----------
problem is that you the problem that you


---------61:55----------
think you have is not the real problem


---------61:57----------
and that's the other reason you're stuck


---------61:58----------
you look for solutions that increase


---------62:00----------
your motivation it's not an issue of


---------62:02----------
motivation you have motivation just stop


---------62:03----------
and think about this for those of you


---------62:05----------
who want to transform your lives how


---------62:07----------
much do you want to transform your life


---------62:09----------
on a scale of 0 to 100 it


---------62:13----------
a hundred the motivation is gigantic it


---------62:16----------
is like the Mount Everest some


---------62:17----------
motivation you want to change so much


---------62:21----------
what do you think that is that's


---------62:23----------
motivation but I understand that there's


---------62:25----------
a stronger force within you which is


---------62:28----------
bigger than Everest


---------62:29----------
it's k2 right and the k2 is your fear of


---------62:33----------
failure what's gonna do okay


---------62:36----------
k2 is like a harder mountain to climb


---------62:37----------
than Everest I think Everest is actually


---------62:39----------
taller but Katie's like tougher so and


---------62:45----------
so in your case I want you guys to pay


---------62:47----------
attention to what Miss Kip is saying


---------62:48----------
because Miss gif says he used to be a


---------62:50----------
pleb it's ego you're still a [ __ ]


---------62:53----------
plop man like we're all plants like


---------62:55----------
that's the thing like we're a community


---------62:56----------
of plebs


---------62:57----------
and understand that the only difference


---------63:00----------
between you and miss kif is that misc if


---------63:02----------
at some point surrendered and he said


---------63:04----------
you know what I let go of success and I


---------63:07----------
embrace failure and when you embrace


---------63:10----------
failure success comes biggest paradox in


---------63:13----------
the universe that's a paradox right and


---------63:21----------
so what are you doing now


---------63:22----------
miss gift for you embracing failure I'm


---------63:25----------
calling myself a blood good because in


---------63:29----------
your mind when you stress you're


---------63:31----------
avoiding failure at all costs gotto


---------63:35----------
avoid failure can't fail can't crash


---------63:37----------
can't burn Hail Mary after Hail Mary


---------63:40----------
after Hail Mary after hail mere failure


---------63:42----------
is not an option


---------63:43----------
and it tears you apart on the inside


---------63:46----------
just like it tears tore me apart tears


---------63:49----------
them apart it's just how it works so let


---------63:53----------
go be the person that you are and just


---------63:57----------
stream like hang out man yeah and once


---------64:01----------
one day Nell sighs but failure is


---------64:03----------
allowed absolutely that's how you learn


---------64:07----------
tell you grow good judgment comes from


---------64:10----------
what within oh sure it's the answer I'm


---------64:15----------
looking for is experience experience


---------64:17----------
comes from what


---------64:20----------
failure absolutely


---------64:22----------
the other way to put it is experience


---------64:24----------
comes from bad judgment yeah so you get


---------64:31----------
to be good by being bad there's a saying


---------64:34----------
in go so go is like a you know go is


---------64:36----------
it's like a board game yeah yeah so they


---------64:39----------
say that the best way to learn how to go


---------64:40----------
is to lose your we lose your first


---------64:43----------
hundred games as quickly as possible


---------64:45----------
mmm that's how you wanna lose a hundred


---------64:50----------
games as quickly as you can and you'll


---------64:52----------
learn go anyway thoughts or questions


---------64:56----------
for me I nothing I I wrote it all down I


---------64:59----------
think I'm good that I learned that to


---------65:05----------
try the expectations never gonna be hit


---------65:07----------
all the time and the more I think about


---------65:09----------
hitting the expectation the more you'll


---------65:11----------
never hit because your reality is your


---------65:14----------
reality and you can't change that you


---------65:16----------
can't become this 24/7 you know


---------65:19----------
entertaining person it's it's not only


---------65:23----------
your it's just and it's just my


---------65:24----------
expectations the plebs don't think that


---------65:27----------
I think that the reality is my reality


---------65:30----------
and that's it I have to be my reality I


---------65:33----------
can't force something that's not there


---------65:35----------
it's it's not there you know and I also


---------65:37----------
I also have to learn the plebs don't


---------65:40----------
care about the high expectations they


---------65:41----------
don't you know they a lot of them like


---------65:45----------
you said they come here for to hang out


---------65:47----------
they come here just second monitor they


---------65:49----------
come here to have noise and some of them


---------65:51----------
come here because they're upset and


---------65:53----------
distress it's life and you know if I


---------65:55----------
could be there for them then that's good


---------65:56----------
and that's what the point of being a


---------65:58----------
streamer is is to be there for people


---------66:00----------
who need it or who are maybe feeling a


---------66:02----------
little bit lonely and if I could be


---------66:04----------
there for them then that's good and I've


---------66:07----------
sometimes forget about that I forget the


---------66:09----------
reason to be a streamer it is for that


---------66:11----------
reason is to hang out play video games


---------66:13----------
and make Chet happy it's not to be this


---------66:15----------
entertaining god or air constantly need


---------66:18----------
to be doing something that's super


---------66:20----------
entertaining and I took I've been


---------66:22----------
learning that a lot lately


---------66:23----------
I've I think I've been cutting back on


---------66:25----------
forcing stuff or trying to be


---------66:27----------
entertaining so I the stuff that we


---------66:29----------
talked to today I have learned I learned


---------66:30----------
it pretty much in like December


---------66:33----------
I'm kind of start really figuring this


---------66:34----------
stuff out and I also learned that I am a


---------66:39----------
pleb and that failure is allowed and I


---------66:42----------
will fail and I think like we the thing


---------66:45----------
you said about the Hail Marys is very


---------66:47----------
true it's I am constantly thinking that


---------66:50----------
I need to be always throwing Hail Marys


---------66:52----------
when you know what sometimes you're


---------66:54----------
gonna fumble and sometimes things are


---------66:56----------
not gonna go your way but that's okay


---------66:58----------
that's life and you're only human are


---------67:01----------
you only a pleb yeah man we're all plebs


---------67:04----------
it's how it works beautifully play so


---------67:06----------
bisque if I gotta also like give you


---------67:08----------
like props man like you're so good at


---------67:10----------
summarizing really yeah Bobby it's all


---------67:17----------
right here sure but I mean I think you


---------67:20----------
did it last time I think you tied it


---------67:22----------
together beautifully and I you know I


---------67:24----------
think you so props to you for closing


---------67:27----------
the door props for you for grabbing your


---------67:28----------
pencil props to you for like showing up


---------67:30----------
because this is what the result is like


---------67:32----------
right when you show up you kind of


---------67:34----------
accept it in that moment when you close


---------67:36----------
the door you grab your pencil and you


---------67:38----------
grabbed your paper you accepted your


---------67:39----------
reality and you felt a little bit shame


---------67:42----------
because you had an expectation of what


---------67:44----------
you should be able to do see that but


---------67:49----------
the boring shame yeah right yeah I


---------67:54----------
thought you said like you I feel like a


---------67:56----------
five-year-old


---------67:56----------
I don't maybe I'm right


---------68:00----------
and it's that's it another big thing is


---------68:02----------
that there's so like the window like


---------68:05----------
this the gap between expectation and


---------68:07----------
reality is where our shame lives and


---------68:11----------
what we really need to do insulate that


---------68:14----------
shame keeps us from looking at where we


---------68:16----------
really are and there then it keeps us


---------68:18----------
stuck because we start to we try to live


---------68:21----------
where the expectation is instead of


---------68:24----------
living where the reality is and so no


---------68:27----------
wonder we don't move forward because we


---------68:29----------
don't start with like where we are you


---------68:31----------
say to yourself oh I should be better at


---------68:34----------
this but like if you suck at it so be it


---------68:37----------
it


---------68:38----------
stuff that you suck at it and then like


---------68:39----------
get better but the people who get hung


---------68:41----------
up on where they should be never improve


---------68:43----------
because they're not like actually moving


---------68:45----------
from where they are it's like almost


---------68:48----------
like is it like the you know when you


---------68:50----------
think of like a steps they're like


---------68:52----------
trying to skip the first - the first


---------68:55----------
step to the last beautiful beautifully


---------68:58----------
put right


---------68:59----------
so they say like I want to move from


---------69:01----------
step 9 - 10 no I don't want to I don't


---------69:04----------
want to move from step 1 - 2 I'm better


---------69:06----------
than that yeah I'm at step 9


---------69:08----------
I'm smarter than this guy and this guy's


---------69:11----------
at step 9 a [ __ ] smarter than he is I


---------69:13----------
don't have to be in step 1 I shouldn't


---------69:15----------
be at step 1 so be where you are be


---------69:17----------
pathetic be a pleb embrace your plan


---------69:20----------
embrace that you suck and then move move


---------69:25----------
out of it you gotta meet yourself where


---------69:29----------
you are not where you should be and I


---------69:33----------
see you doing that and like awesome man


---------69:35----------
like I couldn't have said it better


---------69:36----------
myself I really it's beautiful I told me

if it's helped but I've realized why I


---------70:41----------
have such terrible shits I a peanut


---------70:48----------

peanut butter cereal that's very high in


---------71:02----------
fiber don't take fenugreek yeah why I


---------71:05----------
real I'm I'm cutting back on the cereal


---------71:07----------
because okay good it's way too much

learned I will take the seeds that I


---------71:17----------
promise okay no but if you're taking a


---------71:19----------
bunch of fiber don't take the seeds


---------71:20----------

---------71:24----------
fiber they're not just fiber but they


---------71:26----------

about that right so like remember that


---------72:49----------
if you guys are feeling stuck like it's

not about a lack of motivation like I

---------72:56----------
sucking at life like I wanted so much to


---------72:58----------
change I just did not want to live my


---------73:01----------
life anymore like I just didn't want to


---------73:03----------
live it like I wasn't really suicidal


---------73:04----------
but I was just like I'm tired of us I


---------73:06----------

like professionally successful and I


---------73:19----------
wanted to like hold my head up with


---------73:21----------
pride like I wanted to just you know the


---------73:24----------
thing that I hated the most is like when


---------73:25----------
my parents would call me and they'd ask


---------73:27----------
me like how is your class today and I


---------73:29----------
didn't [ __ ] go to class that question


---------73:31----------
pissed me off so much and it's just like
