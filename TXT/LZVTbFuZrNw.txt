---------00:00----------
We're good?

---------00:00----------
Yeah man, so tell me -- so, I'm like -- I'm -- I've been living under

---------00:05----------
a rock for many many many years, but

---------00:07----------
Yeah

---------00:08----------
But stream chat is telling me that you're

---------00:10----------
the guy. You're Reckful Gladiator, right?

---------00:13----------
Yeah

---------00:13----------
That's you, yeah. So I'm -- I guess that

---------00:16----------
makes me a fan, but from like a decade
ago.

---------00:18----------
Yeah, that's most of my viewership.

---------00:20----------
They're a fan from a decade ago.

---------00:22----------
That's interesting.

---------00:24----------
So, tell me, what are we talking about today buddy?

---------00:25----------
Um well I

---------00:28----------
And what, am I -- am I calling you
Reckful?

---------00:30----------
You can call me Byron if you want.

---------00:32----------
(What do you prefer?) But yeah I've dealt with depression my whole life pretty much.

---------00:37----------
I mean,  so I was like 14 (Okay), and I'm 30 now.
(Okay) And a bunch of people in my chat

---------00:41----------
were telling me I should call you, (Okay)
so here I am! (Okay) It's actually starting

---------00:46----------
to get better just recently (Uh-huh) cuz I'm like
working on a project with some friends

---------00:50----------
and it gives me a sense of purpose I
guess. (Okay) But uh, (What-- ) yeah go ahead.

---------00:57----------
What's the project? By the way, so a couple of
ground rules: So I'm a psychiatrist, but I

---------01:01----------
can't treat your depression over the internet

---------01:03----------
(Yeah, gotcha) unfortunately, and then the other
thing is I tend to ask a lot of

---------01:07----------
questions. If there's anything that you
don't feel comfortable answering, just

---------01:10----------
don't answer it and just let me know.
Okay um and yeah, 'I need to turn your

---------01:15----------
volume up' they're saying. Okay, I'm
turning it up now.

---------01:19----------
Okay, is that good chat? (Yeah) Yeah, okay, talk a
little okay. Yeah, 1 2 3 testing 1 2 3

---------01:24----------
Should be good. All right yeah you can
ask whatever you want, and if I don't

---------01:29----------
want to answer it on stream (Just don't answer it) I just won't I guess

---------01:31----------
Yeah yeah okay.

---------01:33----------
So tell me um, what do you

---------01:34----------
mean by depression? Let's start there.

---------01:36----------
Well I've been diagnosed with bipolar

---------01:39----------
type 2. (Ah) And when I was six, my brother
killed himself. He also had it.

---------01:50----------
How old was he? He was 21,
a very big age gap. (Okay) And then

---------01:56----------
because of that, when I've gone to get
treated, they can never -- can never give me

---------02:01----------
SSRIs. I've never tried an SSRI. Cuz he tried an SSRI and then that --

---------02:06----------
that happened after. (Okay)
Prozac. (Okay, okay) Um and I've tried a couple

---------02:15----------
things. I've tried like --  I was on a really high dose of lithium at one point.

---------02:19----------
How did that make you feel?

---------02:21----------
Very bland yeah the same thing people
always say. Like kind of dead, you know,

---------02:26----------
kind of -- (Yeah)

---------02:27----------
Yeah, and then um, God I've tried a bunch of

---------02:31----------
other ones, but they're not super
memorable. One of them gave me like some

---------02:33----------
eye pain, so I had to stop taking
it cuz I was really sensitive to light.

---------02:37----------
Maybe you know which one I'm talking
about. (Okay) I don't know, I tried a bunch

---------02:40----------
of different ones. This is like, 14 years
ago, most of it, so now I don't really remember.

---------02:44----------
Umm, but uh --

---------02:49----------
Has medication ever been helpful?
Okay, so the only thing that's been

---------02:54----------
really helpful is when I was in
Amsterdam

---------02:58----------
I took psilocybin and it really worked
for me. You know, so this is fascinating.

---------03:03----------
So the FDA just today I think classified
psilocybin as a breakthrough therapy,

---------03:09----------
I don't know if people know this, for
treatment for anxiety and depression. (Yeah yeah I heard about it yeah)

---------03:17----------
So psilocybin was helpful, and in what way?

---------03:21----------
It's such an intense feeling. It's kind
of hard to explain, but it let me get out

---------03:27----------
of these like thought loops that I was
in that were causing me to be sad. (Yeah)

---------03:31----------
And I just step back and see things in a
new perspective.

---------03:35----------
Okay, so today's supposed

---------03:37----------
to be a stream about meditation. And
Reckful, I'm gonna ask you a couple of

---------03:40----------
other questions. But if it's okay with
you guys, we're gonna talk about that and

---------03:44----------
like what's happening in your mind, and
why psilocybin is helpful, and how you

---------03:48----------
can cultivate that sensation without
using psilocybin. (Okay!) So the first thing

---------03:54----------
is like this this phrase of " thought loop" I
love. So why don't you explain to people

---------03:59----------
"what is a thought loop"? Um okay, now you'd
explain it better! *Laughs* But just certain

---------04:08----------
things -- You're going along through your
day and a certain thing happens. And it

---------04:12----------
always causes you to think in the same
pattern of -- a certain negative feeling at

---------04:17----------
the end. And I always hear it described as
it's like an icy mountain with the sleds.

---------04:23----------
A lot of the sleds have gone down and then
there's these patterns that have formed that your

---------04:28----------
mind tends to go down one of these paths
of the sleds (Yup) And then when you're on

---------04:31----------
psilocybin, it seems like it doesn't. It's
just kind of free to think of whatever. (Yeah so -)

---------04:39----------
Okay. Yeah, so let's talk about thought
loops for a second. So the first thing to

---------04:43----------
understand is that it's a repetitive
pattern of thinking that sort of leaves

---------04:47----------
you -- leads you to the same place every
time. But then you take the ski lift back

---------04:52----------
to the top of the mountain and then you
just go back down it again. (Yes) Right? So

---------04:57----------
like this is important to understand
because your mind thinks that it's doing

---------05:01----------
productive thinking, but it's not doing
productive thinking. It's just thinking

---------05:05----------
the same shit over and over again. So I
kind of think about thought loops like

---------05:09----------
chewing gum. Like they're working working
working, but there's no nutrition. There's

---------05:14----------
no actual resolution, and there's no
benefit. You're just chewing the same

---------05:17----------
shit over and over and over again. (Okay)
The other thing is in your case like I

---------05:23----------
would imagine that your thought loops
are focused on yourself. Right? They're

---------05:27----------
about you. My thought loops are about me?..
I have to think about it, if that's true.. Umm

---------05:36----------
So.. what are the thought loops I have?
Yes, so let's start there. Usually they have to

---------05:50----------
do with, "Oh, leading back to everything
has no purpose" or something like that I think.

---------05:55----------
(Okay, great) But then at the same
time, even when I'm happy, I don't mind

---------06:02----------
the thought that "everything has no
purpose" So that's a strange -- it seems

---------06:09----------
contradictory. (It, it's not.) It's not?
Okay tell me why --

---------06:13----------
It does seem contradictory. (Okay)

---------06:15----------
Okay, so because this is -- Um, so let me ask you -- Okay, now we're gonna get weird

---------06:19----------
Reckful. Do you believe that life -- what
do you think of -- what's your sense

---------06:24----------
of like what life is?

---------06:30----------
Umm, I'm an organism that uhh came to be from two
other organisms who (Sure) liked each

---------06:41----------
other enough to (have a child) have a baby.
Yeah, and is that -- are you -- is that all you are?

---------06:48----------
You're just a biological organism?
And I have consciousness which we can't

---------06:53----------
really explain, "the hard problem". Okay
(Right?) Yeah, so what does that --

---------06:58----------
What do you think about your life? Like
what's the -- like, do you feel like your

---------07:01----------
life has purpose? Most of the time "no", but
recently I've started to think "yes"

---------07:07----------
because I realized I can start trying to
help other people who have had my same

---------07:12----------
problems. So I relate to them and then I
hope by making this game I'm working on

---------07:17----------
that they can find friendship and a
sense of community. Because I'm making an

---------07:23----------
MMO (Okay) like a really..yeah. 
Okay, that's awesome man!

---------07:27----------
Things I wanted as a kid, yeah.
Okay, so I'm gonna

---------07:31----------
just dive into Sanskrit for a second,
okay? So Sanskrit -- the the Yogis like

---------07:37----------
back in ancient India, like thousands of
years ago, basically started to believe

---------07:41----------
that the world was false. And the reason
that they started to believe the world

---------07:45----------
was false is because they sort of
understood that like the sense organs

---------07:50----------
can be falsified. So either (Yeah) through the
use of hallucinogens or dreams. But

---------07:55----------
ultimately that the experience that they
have within a dream is actually the same

---------08:00----------
experience that you have within reality. That even though a dream can be fake or

---------08:04----------
real, YOUR experience of a dream is the
same as your experience of life. That you

---------08:10----------
can feel suffering, you can feel joy, you
can feel hope, you can feel sorrow, (Yes that's true)

---------08:15----------
you can feel abject terror. And so what they realized
is that like ultimately the

---------08:19----------
foundation of reality is actually
consciousness and that the foundation of

---------08:24----------
reality is experience and that the
external world is false.

---------08:28----------
Yeah I've listened to the "case against
reality", maybe you've heard that? Dan

---------08:35----------
Hoffman I think? Uh I haven't heard that one
in particular, but there's a lot of stuff

---------08:40----------
from quantum mechanics that supports
this. I don't know if Dan Hoffman talks

---------08:43----------
about that. (Okay)
But a good example of like

---------08:48----------
understanding this from a quantum
mechanics perspective, which there's an

---------08:51----------
argument against what I'm about to say,
which I'm happy to go into, people who

---------08:54----------
are interested. But basically that
reality exists as a probability, and it's

---------08:58----------
the act of observation that causes a
probability to collapse into a reality.

---------09:03----------
Which is sort of a weird complicated
thing to say but --

---------09:06----------
Say it one more time?

---------09:06----------
So, that reality actually exists as a
probability. Like reality is not static

---------09:13----------
in that the act of observation causes a
probability to collapse into a reality.

---------09:18----------
(Okay) So like the world exists as a
probability waveform, and when you

---------09:23----------
observe something, that probability
disappears and it becomes a reality. (Okay!)

---------09:27----------
Yeah, I mean I've read some quantum mechanics stuff like Sean Carroll or whatever.

---------09:31----------
Yeah, so like Schrodinger's Cat I think
is the best example of this. But then (Yeah)

---------09:35----------
there was this experiment called The Double Slit Experiment, which actually proved

---------09:38----------
that observation -- That was really weird!

---------09:41----------
It's bizarre! (Yeah!) What do you remember

---------09:43----------
about it? Double slit experiment umm okay..

---------09:49----------
They shoot electrons through the two

---------09:51----------
slits. If they look at the electrons, they
show up on the other side as like uhh -- in a

---------09:58----------
in a certain pattern And if they
don't look at it, they show up in two

---------10:01----------
different patterns.

---------10:02----------
Yeah exactly. Yeah, so
they show up as an interference pattern

---------10:05----------
if you don't look at which of the slits
the electron -- I mean, *the photon* goes through.

---------10:10----------
Right? So it's like (Okay the photons, yeah)

---------10:13----------
the bands of light and dark. (Yeah) And then, if you observe

---------10:16----------
which phot -- which *slit* the photon goes
through, then the pattern on the

---------10:22----------
other side disappears. So literally like
what you see depends on where you look!

---------10:28----------
Like if I'm looking at the slit (Yes, it's bizarre!) then I only see one
point of light.

---------10:32----------
And if I'm not looking at the slit,

---------10:33----------
then I actually see an interference pattern. Right? It's crazy! (Yeah, it's bizarre!)

---------10:37----------
So what's it -- what's your -- what's your
interpretation of it?

---------10:39----------
That consciousness creates reality. It's what the Yogis have been saying for

---------10:43----------
thousands of years. (Okay) That the act of
observation: that our consciousness has

---------10:47----------
creative power. Now, (Okay) the interesting
thing is that if you -- so now we get to

---------10:52----------
Sanskrit, and this is kind of a real
roundabout way of getting to this idea.

---------10:56----------
So the Yogis actually came up with two
words for reality. One is Maya: Maya means

---------11:02----------
"illusion", and the other is Lila: and Lila
means "play". And so interestingly enough

---------11:08----------
both of these sort of imply a falseness
to the universe. But I think what's

---------11:13----------
happening is on some sense you've had an
experience, either through psilocybin or

---------11:17----------
other things -- and I suspect other things,
and we'll get to that later -- that has

---------11:21----------
given you a sense that something about
the world is not real. And what happens (Okay)

---------11:25----------
is when (I have had it many times, yeah) when you're happy -

---------11:30----------
Yeah, we'll get to that. - when you're happy

---------11:31----------
you can exist in a Lila state which is
like "it's no big deal that the world

---------11:35----------
isn't real" It's play! Like "let's just
have a good time!" It's actually just like

---------11:39----------
a video game! Like just because -- (It's like the experience machine!) Yeah, and just because a video

---------11:43----------
game isn't real doesn't mean that we
can't enjoy it, right? In fact, quite the

---------11:46----------
opposite: that's actually a big problem
for most of my audience. Yeah, you don't

---------11:49----------
need to know -- you don't need to know how the game works even to enjoy (Absolutely!) playing it

---------11:54----------
You know, you always are trying to figure
out how life works.. NOW we have to be

---------11:57----------
careful. Because even though you can --
you can appreciate Lila, which is play,

---------12:03----------
and you can appreciate that nothing in
the world is real, WHEN YOUR DEPRESSION

---------12:08----------
ACTS UP -- and I want you to understand
that depression is like a pattern of

---------12:12----------
thinking within your mind. It takes the
things that you know and distorts them.

---------12:16----------
So it takes the fact -- It hijacks this
idea that you know that the world is

---------12:21----------
like, not a real place, in some sense.
And then it sort of makes you feel like

---------12:26----------
there's no purpose because nothing is
real. But that's an understanding that

---------12:30----------
doesn't actually mean like anything bad.
It's just -- That's what the depression

---------12:34----------
does. The depression hijacks your
thinking and takes the things that you

---------12:38----------
know and spins them in a particular way
that like actually makes you suffer.

---------12:44----------
Yes, but then I was also saying that even
when I'm happy, and I even if I thought

---------12:48----------
reality was an illusion, I could still be
happy at those moments.

---------12:51----------
Yeah! Absolutely!

---------12:52----------
Right? But those are -- that's because when
you're able to step outside of

---------12:56----------
depression, when you're able to step
outside of yourself. You can appreciate

---------13:00----------
that like life can be happy and joyous,
even though it isn't real.

---------13:04----------
But when your Depression kicks in, you
become nihilistic. So nihilism is this

---------13:09----------
idea that like "life has no purpose and
no meaning so might as well fuck around"

---------13:12----------
which actually isn't the case.
So first, Reckful, why don't you tell me a

---------13:18----------
little bit about what happens in your
mind -- Any questions about this? No, that

---------13:23----------
I can -- that I followed. I mean, okay, it
does follow that what we see as reality

---------13:30----------
is not based reality for sure. Because if
you think how a different animal, let's

---------13:35----------
say we look at an ant. They're not gonna
perceive reality anything similarly to

---------13:38----------
how we do. They perceive reality in a way
that helps them survive. And we perceive

---------13:43----------
in a reality in a way that helps us
survive,  right? Let's say, we have to

---------13:47----------
notice a lion running at us, or whatever,
and we have to notice motion more than

---------13:52----------
other things, or like about you, back in
the day. And the people who actually saw

---------13:59----------
too many things or saw based reality
wouldn't have survived, you know, if --

---------14:05----------
The natural selection would favor people
who just see certain things more --

---------14:09----------
Beautiful! So so now now that that segues
into an important point which is that

---------14:14----------
your mind is designed to survive. It's
not actually designed to protect you

---------14:20----------
from suffering. (Yes) Okay (Yeah) so this is one
of the most simple things that like, I

---------14:25----------
think a lot of people -- I mean, I disagree
with a lot of my colleagues in the sense

---------14:29----------
that my impression of a lot of mental
illness is that it's actually FUNCTIONAL,

---------14:35----------
USEFUL mechanisms of our mind that (I
could believe that) that are kind of out

---------14:40----------
of whack or haywire. So anxiety is a good
example of our mind's ability -- go ahead.

---------14:47----------
Yeah, no, I agree with you. (WHY?) Because I was just saying on my stream earlier today that

---------14:51----------
uh, anxiety actually could get passed on
as a trait from natural selection

---------14:57----------
because it could help. Let's say you're
always worried someone's gonna kill you

---------15:00----------
You could have, a thousand years ago,
survived because of that and that (Absolutely!) that trait could pass on.

---------15:08----------
So let's just tap into a second what anxiety is. And I've talked a lot about anxiety, so we're gonna talk

---------15:12----------
more about depression today. But what I
understand anxiety to be is that anxiety

---------15:16----------
is simply your mind's ability to
look into the future and predict

---------15:19----------
problems. That's all it is. (Okay) It's just the
future-predicting capability. And if you

---------15:23----------
think about someone's experience of
anxiety, what happens is they look into

---------15:26----------
the future and they predict a problem
And the possibility of that problem

---------15:30----------
worries them so much that it sort of
controls their behavior. So if I'm afraid

---------15:34----------
of looking like an idiot when I do
public speaking, that anxiety is actually

---------15:38----------
trying to protect me. It's not trying to
fuck me over. It's trying to protect -- by

---------15:42----------
the way, can I curse on your stream or? --
Do whatever the fuck you want, yeah.

---------15:47----------
And so actually, all really anxiety --
Anxiety's trying to help you out. And the

---------15:51----------
first thing to understand if you want to
conquer your anxiety is that, like it's

---------15:54----------
trying to help you out. And then you just
have to understand that it's it's like a

---------15:58----------
guard dog that is like way too sensitive.
So there are ways that you can calm it

---------16:02----------
down, but the first thing that we need to
stop doing is demonizing our anxiety or

---------16:06----------
trying to like root it out of us.
Because once we understand where it

---------16:09----------
comes from, then we can try to put it
into context, we can try to help it. But

---------16:13----------
let's talk a little bit more about
depression today. So tell me what your

---------16:16----------
experience of depression is.
Okay, it's very hard very hard to explain. The

---------16:25----------
easiest way to explain is I've had years
of my life like this, where I wake up

---------16:29----------
every day, and I don't see a purpose to
doing anything. Well I don't see a

---------16:35----------
purpose in getting out of bed. I don't
care if I stream or don't or if I go eat

---------16:42----------
or don't At some point I get really
hungry. I'm like, okay I guess I have -- like

---------16:45----------
I feel like I -- It forces me to kind of,
you know. (Yeah) But I don't really care

---------16:51----------
one way or the other. And then I
start to think I don't care if I -- when

---------16:58----------
I go to sleep, I don't care if I wake up.
I'd prefer not to, actually. The sleeping

---------17:02----------
was the most peaceful part of my day.
Okay and how long would this like -- how

---------17:07----------
long would this stretch last?

---------17:10----------
Years. (With? -- Okay,  so --)
I've had it since I was 14. And there's like 14 to 16..

---------17:21----------
And then I remember when I found photography,
I was like a little inspired for a

---------17:24----------
little bit and then it went away. And
then maybe 17 to 20.. -- like, it goes for

---------17:31----------
years, and then I'm happy for a little
bit, and then years, and then happy for a little bit.

---------17:35----------
How long is your period of happiness? 
My chat would know better than I do, but it's

---------17:40----------
pretty short. I don't know.. I like -- two
months maybe? (Okay) Yeah, is that? -- You

---------17:51----------
hear about people like that?

---------17:53----------
Yeah, so I think I think this is a really common

---------17:55----------
misconception. I think I think you're -- you
may have clinical depression, but I think

---------17:59----------
what you're describing is not clinical
depression. So I'm gonna explain to you

---------18:03----------
guys what clinical depression is. I think
your problem is that your life is empty.

---------18:07----------
That's different. In fact, that's what we
were going to talk to the other person

---------18:10----------
about today and we will. So I got a bunch
of questions about this because --

---------18:14----------
So you're saying you think I was diagnosed
incorrectly when they said they have  bipolar type 2?

---------18:17----------
You may have depression on top of that. But what I want you to understand is that like

---------18:22----------
there are different flavors of
depression. One of them is a biological

---------18:26----------
organic neurochemical kind of thing. (Okay) And
what I'm hearing from in --  but there are

---------18:31----------
certain features of that that you -- you're not -- you don't really fit that bill.

---------18:34----------
So I'm gonna describe what that is.

---------18:37----------
So you may be depressed on top of being

---------18:39----------
unhappy or having a life without purpose.

---------18:42----------
(Okay) But those are two independent things and

---------18:43----------
the whole point behind what what people
got interested in last week and what

---------18:49----------
we're gonna finish up today is actually
perfect for you! Which is maybe why

---------18:51----------
people are telling you to come on.
So I treat people with depression, (Yeah) and

---------18:55----------
sometimes what happens is I treat them
for a while and they come into my office

---------18:59----------
and they say like -- Okay, so I'll like
assess them for depression I'll be like,

---------19:02----------
"Are you getting out of bed every day? Are
you able to do this? Are you able to

---------19:05----------
concentrate? Are you able to go to work?"

---------19:07----------
And they'll say, "Yeah, but I'm still depressed."

---------19:08----------
And then I tell them, "Well
actually, like I don't think you're

---------19:11----------
clinically depressed. Now you're just unhappy."

---------19:15----------
And there's a difference between

---------19:16----------
clinical depression and unhappiness or a
life without purpose. (Okay)

---------19:20----------
And this is the tricky thing. It's like what's
happened is our society's become so

---------19:24----------
mental health focused, that we've started
to describe all of these things as like

---------19:29----------
mental pathologies. (Okay) But I think that this is like, your problem is that you're at

---------19:34----------
the top of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.
Are you familiar with that? (No) Okay, so

---------19:39----------
Maslow basically said we have a
hierarchy of needs. That at the bottom we

---------19:43----------
need like food and shelter, and then we
need community, and all that kind of stuff.

---------19:46----------
And at the very top is something
called self-actualization.

---------19:50----------
That at the end of the day, like we have a need to become like fully actualized human

---------19:55----------
beings who like derive -- I mean, it's a
need for us to feel like we're

---------20:00----------
accomplishing what we put our mind to. (Okay)
And so I think what you are is

---------20:05----------
unfulfilled, and that you've probably
been inappropriate --

---------20:09----------
(I mean, that's true.)

---------20:10----------
-- insufficiently challenged since you were
a teenager. And that life has not like

---------20:15----------
given you anything that was worth
fighting for.

---------20:17----------
That it's just like it's been like easy mode.

---------20:21----------
Now you may be depressed on top of that, so let's talk about that for a second.

---------20:27----------
So clinical depression is an episodic illness.

---------20:29----------
That's the first thing to understand.

---------20:30----------
So major depressive disorder *or* bipolar disorder is episodic. (Yeah)

---------20:34----------
Which means that for periods of time, you're well.

---------20:37----------
And then you enter a period of depression, which lasts two weeks to

---------20:42----------
about one year. Maybe a little bit over a
year. And that you have a period of like

---------20:47----------
and then it sort of naturally gets
better.

---------20:49----------
Oh, one thing! Now I'm worried that, 'What
if I incorrectly remembered my past

---------20:55----------
when saying I've gone years of being
unhappy?'

---------20:57----------
That's very possible!

---------20:58----------
And now I'm getting -- now I'm getting
misdiagnosed. (No, no --)

---------21:01----------
Maybe I haven't gotten years.. maybe it's been one year.

---------21:04----------
Sure, so that's possible so like I said I
don't think that --

---------21:07----------
How long -- how long do the happy periods -- would the happy periods be?

---------21:10----------
It depends on the person, but,

---------21:11----------
generally speaking, like I'm looking for
a few months to a year to even over a

---------21:15----------
year, right? So I'm looking for like
somewhere between like four and six

---------21:20----------
months of like a period of remission. Now
you could, like I said, you *could* have

---------21:26----------
depression. You could have depression. I don't know

---------21:29----------
that you don't, or bipolar type 2.
But what I'm saying is that like,

---------21:34----------
generally speaking, sometimes I talk to
people, and they say, "I've been depressed

---------21:38----------
since I was the age of 14." And if you've
constantly been depressed for 15 years,

---------21:43----------
that's not how major depressive disorder
works. Because our body has--

---------21:47----------
No, because I've come -- I've come in and out of it.

---------21:48----------
So I've come out of it when I like to started photography.

---------21:50----------
I came out of it when I started liking, uh.. I guess World

---------21:54----------
of Warcraft for a bit. Came out of it when --
like, little periods though -- I came out of

---------21:59----------
it when -- I everytime I find -- But then I
think that could lead back to

---------22:02----------
fulfillment. Every time I find this
'something' I really like, then I come out

---------22:06----------
of it. For sure, so it could just be the
fulfillment thing you're saying.

---------22:09----------
Well, so hold on, let's talk about this. So I
think you're onto something, but that

---------22:12----------
your solution is half correct. (Okay)

---------22:16----------
So why do you think it is that photography -- Like do

---------22:18----------
you remember when you started doing
photography? Like, how old were you?

---------22:23----------
I was sixteen. My dad bought me a camera for my birthday, and I remember taking a bunch

---------22:27----------
of pictures of film camera. And then when I
got it developed, I looked at it. And I was

---------22:31----------
like, "Oh, I really like this. This is fun."
And that's it. Nothing more to it than that.

---------22:35----------
Okay um, how -- do you remember how you
felt before you got like.. -- Tell me about

---------22:42----------
like what high school was like for you.
Early high school.

---------22:47----------
Man, it's kind of hard to dig deep into..

---------22:50----------
Okay. I do remember I, like most students, didn't enjoy being in class.

---------22:56----------
I had a few friends outside of class though. We played -- I started liking

---------23:01----------
playing guitar a little bit. And some of
them played guitar a little. Um, I liked that.

---------23:08----------
There were little periods of enjoyment
here and there. We talked about what kind

---------23:13----------
of music we liked, like high schoolers do
I guess.

---------23:16----------
Did you (Umm..) do you have fond

---------23:18----------
memories of being a freshman in high
school?

---------23:21----------
Some! Some memories are not bad..

---------23:25----------
overall my thought about school is that
I didn't like it but I can remember some

---------23:31----------
good things what I didn't like about it
being in class but I remember liking I

---------23:37----------
did like some I played guitar in front
of a bunch of people like an unplugged

---------23:42----------
concert thing during high school I
remember liking

---------23:45----------
mm-hmm so what didn't you like about
class it was boring uh the things I was

---------23:56----------
learning weren't things that were super
stimulating to me and sometimes I

---------24:00----------
already knew them but not always I
didn't always know them yeah sometimes I

---------24:04----------
just didn't know them but they weren't
what I was interested in huh school was

---------24:07----------
easy school was pretty easy yeah III was
uh yeah I had good grades and SAT and

---------24:17----------
all that yeah yeah
so we're gonna talk more about how you

---------24:21----------
were insufficiently challenged because I
still think that's your problem but

---------24:24----------
we'll get to that
so tell me a little bit about so it

---------24:27----------
doesn't sound like I'm not hearing
anything about depression when you were

---------24:30----------
in high school you said 14 but you're
not describing anything to me that oh

---------24:33----------
yeah no cuz it's hard for me to really
dig deep and remember I mean I listen

---------24:37----------
okay I remember I listened to a lot of
sad music I was a lot of people who

---------24:41----------
killed listen I was idolizing a lot of
people who killed themselves okay at the

---------24:44----------
time because I was listening like
Nirvana and then Elliott Smith and then

---------24:48----------
I don't know a bunch of other I can't
remember but I mean sounds like you were

---------24:53----------
yeah yeah it could be yeah I know I was
but the lyrics were very relatable to me

---------24:59----------
okay what was relatable I mean lyrics I

---------25:07----------
guess just this overall lack of purpose
and meaning something to something

---------25:14----------
it's it I kind of really have to I feel
like I'm not doing justice to my own

---------25:19----------
life you know to my own memories I can't
remember exactly well you're not gonna

---------25:24----------
be able to write so yeah yeah so I I'm
I'm kind of digging around and and

---------25:29----------
you're not expected like I don't
remember much about when I was 14 like

---------25:32----------
you know people don't really remember
much about when they're 14 and that's

---------25:36----------
okay it's just I'm trying to figure out
where where the money is and it sounding

---------25:40----------
like okay so when I was 16 okay when I
was 16 I

---------25:44----------
I tried to kill myself okay so when I
when I was 16 I uh I took 20 to 22

---------25:51----------
sleeping pills and they drank a bottle
of wine and I tied a plastic bag over my

---------25:54----------
head and I fell asleep and I just woke
up later and I had ripped the bag off my

---------25:59----------
head and I was alive and and uh I
worried and asked do you remember what

---------26:06----------
you were feeling when you tried to kill
yourself

---------26:09----------
he was really dumb I there was a game I
was playing called a Sean's khalaf when

---------26:15----------
I was 10 when I was 16 and then that
game was no longer popular no one was

---------26:19----------
playing it and I'd know when to play
with a car - yes right know as an MMORPG

---------26:24----------
okay and it started dying because of all
the Warcraft and no one else was on to

---------26:30----------
play anymore and I felt like the only
thing I cared about and the only thing

---------26:33----------
I'd practice my whole life and really
loved was irrelevant okay yeah great I

---------26:41----------
mean not great but I think I'm starting
to see a pattern okay so great so let's

---------26:51----------
just think about that for a second
reckful let's think about that right

---------26:55----------
yeah what what do you think was going on
in your head there so I think now that

---------27:01----------
you you're leading me to the answer but
the Ashlyn stall was giving me

---------27:06----------
fulfillment and you know a place to try
as hard as I could and be competitive

---------27:11----------
and whatever and meet friends and all
these things all these natural human

---------27:16----------
desires was it hard then uh it was hard
yeah yeah and then uh then it went away

---------27:22----------
and I didn't have that anymore and I was
unfulfilled uh-huh and then when did you

---------27:27----------
get your camera it was around a little
after that yep yeah round yeah and then

---------27:35----------
I started like a photography so tell me
about the photography it's really hard

---------27:41----------
when it's about artistic things I can't
remember like the feet have a feeling

---------27:46----------
and the while like I don't know but I
was in a pictures for a while and then

---------27:50----------
my parents took me on a trip to Europe
to show me where they used to live in

---------27:54----------
Switzerland and
neighbouring countries I took a lot of

---------27:57----------
pictures there and I came back and I I
got a bunch of my pictures printed out

---------28:00----------
and then I walked around a South
Hollywood and like then to art galleries

---------28:06----------
I showed them my pictures and one of
them put my pictures up in the gallery

---------28:09----------
mm-hm and then I remember feeling good
yeah did that happen and and when did

---------28:14----------
the depression come back after the
pictures could have been around the time

---------28:23----------
with the gallery because everyone liked
other people's pictures way more than

---------28:25----------
mine I don't remember exactly what yeah
so I don't know if it was in a weird way

---------28:35----------
I don't know if it's because do you
remember feeling like you were you had

---------28:41----------
done a really good job with the pictures
in the gallery yes for sure and then you

---------28:47----------
know everyone else's pictures were
really edited and it was annoying to me

---------28:52----------
cuz I thought mine were better but
everyone liked the other what's better

---------28:56----------
yeah yeah so okay and then what was
another thing that brought you out of

---------29:03----------
your depression
I don't okay I don't remember the next

---------29:13----------
part because I start playing World of
Warcraft but I don't member ever being

---------29:15----------
happy while playing World of Warcraft I
played it for so many years yeah I

---------29:18----------
remember I remember being really happy
at any moment even when I was at the top

---------29:22----------
okay so I want you to so I think your
periods of happiness like when you came

---------29:29----------
out of your depression those sound to me
like they're not dealing with the

---------29:34----------
underlying problem I think what happened
is you had opportunities for you to

---------29:39----------
distract yourself from the underlying
depression like you can get into

---------29:44----------
something but only for a time and you
can only distract yourself for so long

---------29:47----------
and then what happens is is one of two
things that happens either one is that

---------29:52----------
like something takes that away from you
or oddly enough I think the thing that

---------29:56----------
the reason that that photography may
have lost is it its interest is this is

---------30:00----------
gonna sound really bizarre is not
because other people's photography was

---------30:04----------
better than yours because something
tells me that when someone is better

---------30:07----------
than you at something
that actually pull actually want to try

---------30:11----------
it's a drive yeah what happened your
fucking problem was that you were young

---------30:15----------
you were how old 16 and someone put up
your artwork in a gallery in Hollywood

---------30:24----------
and that is you won the game
that doesn't mean you lost that means

---------30:29----------
you fucking won okay
and I feel like I wanna be okay yeah I

---------30:35----------
know you didn't but I think the real
problem there cuz it's weird right like

---------30:40----------
you would think that I would you would
think so we have to just understand that

---------30:44----------
like we would think certain things but
we have to look at the data of your life

---------30:47----------
and interpret it what was disappointing
what got you out of photography or when

---------30:52----------
it Lots it lost its luster was actually
at the height of your career and you

---------30:55----------
could have kept going it wasn't like him
it wasn't like you walked around and you

---------31:01----------
dropped it because no one displayed your
artwork like that makes more sense like

---------31:05----------
that's a loss right I walked around and
I showed it to a bunch of people and no

---------31:09----------
one displayed it which is like that's
not even that unusual because you're

---------31:12----------
fucking 16 you took some pictures yeah
yeah who's gonna display your artwork in

---------31:16----------
a gallery in Hollywood when you're 16
and you're just like you got a camera

---------31:19----------
months ago well it turns out that
someone will because you're really good

---------31:23----------
at photography because you do a good job
at things that you apply yourself to and

---------31:29----------
that you find challenging and when
you're engrossed in a challenge you

---------31:33----------
don't have to worry about the fact that
your life is like its core meaningless

---------31:37----------
because you can find you can find some
sense of like external challenge and it

---------31:42----------
pulls you out of yourself it pulls you
out of yourself when you're doing

---------31:46----------
photography well that was really
accurate and the thing reckful is that

---------31:49----------
you don't like being yourself and so
when you can pull yourself out of being

---------31:54----------
yourself it's an amazing feeling because
you don't have to be rekted right

---------32:03----------
because reckful is life isn't worth
living like you can wake up today and

---------32:06----------
you can eat or not eat but who the fuck
cares

---------32:09----------
it's just reckful is life but when
you're doing photography you're like

---------32:12----------
you're not reckful anymore right you're
like taking a picture you become kind of

---------32:16----------
like one with the picture and then the
problem is like once you get good at

---------32:21----------
that then you're like back to being
I feel like you've conquered that and so

---------32:24----------
you're like okay well now what so we
gotta understand like what is it about

---------32:29----------
you that makes you feel like like living
your life is not worth living and we're

---------32:35----------
gonna talk for a second I'm gonna get to
that in a second but I want to talk

---------32:37----------
about psilocybin
so what psilocybin looks but so Simon

---------32:42----------
does is it takes you away from reckful
that's why you want it right because you

---------32:48----------
love actively love your shirt whatever
okay but like so so your thought loops

---------32:54----------
in the depression and stuff like that
that all exists within reckful like

---------32:58----------
wreck flows life you have this ego this
thing called a hunger which thinks that

---------33:02----------
your your life is fundamentally like
meaningless and what psilocybin does is

---------33:07----------
it takes you actually outside of your
ego we have a sense of identity that is

---------33:12----------
based on like who we are and like by who
we are like things that go on a resume

---------33:17----------
so you identify as like gender or you
know like you're your you have a certain

---------33:23----------
like professional career you have a
certain age you have a name these are

---------33:28----------
the things that you identify with and
when you're taking a picture you're none

---------33:32----------
of those things does that make sense
okay yeah it does uh I don't like my

---------33:39----------
identity
so you're saying yeah your life and so

---------33:43----------
anytime you have an opportunity so when
you're playing music like you're no

---------33:47----------
longer like a particular age you're just
playing music you become one with the

---------33:51----------
music you become one with the rock Rafi
but this the distraction pulls me out of

---------33:56----------
my immersion in a first-person
experience whatever yeah absolutely and

---------34:01----------
that's exactly what psilocybin does
right so psilocybin is a substance that

---------34:07----------
causes the walls of the self to break
down yeah so whether whether it's

---------34:17----------
psilocybin whether it's music whether
it's photography or and and this is the

---------34:23----------
other interesting thing is you're
finding purpose and why are you finding

---------34:26----------
purpose again what do you like about
what you're doing I like I like that I'm

---------34:34----------
trying to give people something
I wanted as a kid what is what is the

---------34:38----------
who's the focus on who are you thinking
about just few people have an experience

---------34:57----------
yeah so I'll tell you reckful listen
carefully now your depression you're

---------35:05----------
trying to cure the depression that is
growing within kids outs out there today

---------35:10----------
you're trying to protect them from what
happened to you yeah that how does that

---------35:19----------
feel feels good yeah feels meaningful
yeah good is an understatement the

---------35:27----------
understatement of the fucking year it is
vital it is crucial you must do this

---------35:33----------
thing yeah I think it's the fucking
understatement of the year when you say

---------35:42----------
yeah it's like it like gives me a reason
to wake up in the morning like no this

---------35:46----------
is this isn't our MA I've talked about
Tara you may not know what I'm talking

---------35:49----------
about people who watch regularly this
isn't her mo you guys are seeing it

---------35:52----------
right this is like this is duty or
responsibility it's not something that

---------35:58----------
you're doing this is the other thing the
really powerful thing about this and

---------36:01----------
we'll get to the roots of your
depression the really powerful thing

---------36:05----------
about this is that you're not thinking
about yourself anymore I don't know I'd

---------36:11----------
like to feel selfless like that but I
don't know that it's true you know I'd

---------36:15----------
like that your thought yeah well we'll
get to how you're thinking about

---------36:18----------
yourself so I think now we also
understand the roots of your depression

---------36:22----------
because the person if you want to
understand why you're depressed you have

---------36:27----------
to like really envision who is it that
you're trying to help like all of the

---------36:32----------
qualities when you're saying that you
wanted to give people an experience that

---------36:35----------
you didn't have as a kid I don't think
you're talking about playing a fucking

---------36:38----------
video game I think you're talking about
being alone I think you're talking about

---------36:42----------
being abandoned and you don't want
people to feel the way that you felt and

---------36:46----------
so you're trying to make the world a
better place

---------36:55----------
maybe what are you feeling right now I
don't know it's Tapatio automatically I

---------37:03----------
am yeah
I'm not thinking anything take a moment

---------37:18----------
it's nice to feel something yeah it's
kind of weird right because you're

---------37:24----------
crying so most people associate that as
like a thing that they don't want to

---------37:28----------
feel no I liked it yeah how do you feel
what do you feel in your body feel like

---------37:41----------
um in my body I don't know how to
describe it I don't know I I feel I feel

---------37:48----------
like I just passed something yeah and uh
kind of hopeful I guess

---------37:54----------
yeah future maybe yeah I I think I
imagine you feel a little bit lighter

---------38:00----------
but we what we can call it is levelling
a little bit you just leveled up yeah

---------38:07----------
okay you want to keep going or you want
to take a break no it's good uh what we

---------38:16----------
can keep talking but what what what
games have you played what's your how

---------38:20----------
did you know my well stuffer I'm because
I so I played wow like in vanilla and

---------38:26----------
Burning Crusade Brinker shows good why
are we talking older you why are you

---------38:32----------
asking me questions about yourself
myself now of all times

---------38:36----------
what do you think I don't know you tell
me that's us taking a break so I think

---------38:43----------
you've had a lot and now you I think you
need to step away from what you're

---------38:47----------
feeling for a little bit and already
your mind is returning to normal right

---------38:51----------
you're returning to normal reckful or
your thoughts like your mind had shut

---------38:55----------
down for a little bit and as you start
to ask me questions about myself which

---------38:58----------
I'm happy to answer your mind is gonna
start functioning again and that feeling

---------39:02----------
is slowly going to
away uh-huh so shall we take a break

---------39:08----------
what do you mean by break like uh
we're just gonna talk about anything no

---------39:12----------
no about whatever so what I mean by
break is like you just went through

---------39:16----------
something that was like a little bit
powerful and a little bit emotional and

---------39:19----------
that's a strange state of mind to be in
you didn't know what the fuck was

---------39:25----------
happening and it was like it was like
you went underwater

---------39:27----------
and now we're coming up for air so if
you want to we can go back underwater

---------39:32----------
like if you want me to just do that
again we can do that again and you can

---------39:36----------
learn more or not to blow my nose yeah
okay yeah you could talk people okay I

---------39:53----------
mean that was intense

---------40:02----------
yeah I know I'm still live on stream I
just need to process for a second to

---------40:23----------
okay so okay so I should introduce
myself to stream so my name is dr. olive

---------40:34----------
kitteridge I'm a psychiatrist
practicing in Boston Massachusetts my

---------40:39----------
main area of interest is technology and
video game addiction but I have a kind

---------40:48----------
of a different background I spent maybe
I should wait until rectals back but I

---------40:52----------
spent a few years about seven years
studying in India to become a monk and

---------40:57----------
then spent about seven years studying to
become a monk and then ended up going to

---------41:03----------
medical school and became a psychiatrist
if you guys want a Harvard Andy I'm I

---------41:10----------
trained at Harvard Medical School and
I'm faculty at Harvard Medical School

---------41:13----------
which a lot of people seem to get a kick
out of and my main area of interest

---------41:19----------
until about one year ago was
incorporating like Eastern medicine like

---------41:23----------
Eastern ideas and philosophy so studying
a lot of like yoga and meditation and

---------41:28----------
Buddhism Hinduism some of the more
esoteric spiritual practices as well

---------41:32----------
into mental health treatment and my
experience has been that like our

---------41:37----------
Western understanding of mental health
is just wow fully incomplete and there

---------41:42----------
are a lot of reasons for that
and I've had a lot of success through

---------41:45----------
helping people kind of like reckful by
sort of getting to some root issues

---------41:50----------
which is what what the Eastern system
kind of conceptualizes like Western

---------41:54----------
medicine thinks about depression is like
something that you just treat with an

---------41:57----------
SSRI like you just give them medication
and you do some therapy and then like

---------42:01----------
it's just a disease that you live with
for the rest of your life like there's

---------42:05----------
this idea in Western medicine that once
you get diagnosed with depression you

---------42:08----------
have depression your entire life I don't
believe that I mean I think some people

---------42:12----------
do but in my experience I've had some
people in my practice who have had

---------42:15----------
bipolar disorder or who like or off of
medications and they have these sort of

---------42:20----------
really powerful spiritual or
psychological experiences that really

---------42:24----------
get to the root of where their illness
comes from and by getting to that root

---------42:29----------
you can actually like have someone have
a transformative experience which is

---------42:34----------
what I believe
and in in reckful x' case i think that

---------42:39----------
you know he may fit criteria for a
bipolar disorder type ii but i think the

---------42:45----------
basic problem here is that we're gonna
talk to him in a minute

---------42:49----------
you ready to dive in again yeah okay I
kind of wanted to hear what my basic

---------42:57----------
problem was but it's better I don't know
no no it's fine yeah so we're gonna get

---------43:00----------
to that so I think basically like
reckful x'

---------43:04----------
challenges that something like i don't
know if you guys saw this but there's

---------43:09----------
something really powerful about what
he's trying to do and that comes from

---------43:14----------
somewhere right like it's not like you
just waked like he's not trying to help

---------43:19----------
people with like autism he's not trying
to help people with Down syndrome he's

---------43:22----------
not trying to help people with who were
you know like victims of like genocide

---------43:30----------
or the Holocaust he's trying to help
like lonely kids find meaning in

---------43:35----------
community and support and I think that's
that's the route so my question for you

---------43:40----------
reckful is like what was your childhood
like tell me about your childhood okay

---------43:52----------
so I have some early memories of playing
games with my brothers I like those a

---------44:01----------
lot and I remember even just watching I
would try to stay up late and watch them

---------44:05----------
play certain computer games and then two
brothers yeah - I had two brothers yeah

---------44:16----------
and then how was the age difference ones
ten years older ones 15 years older okay

---------44:27----------
so I would just watch them play games I
remember like I was really young like

---------44:33----------
four or five and I couldn't beat a level
in Doom and then my brother went in and

---------44:38----------
like edited the
code of the game so the ceilings were

---------44:42----------
too low for the monsters to run around
they were running in place and I could

---------44:47----------
just go through and beat the level which
I still enjoyed doing yeah of course

---------44:50----------
which brother did that guy my brother
who passed away yeah yeah and when I was

---------45:00----------
six that happened I remember seeing like
hospital cars and for some reason I

---------45:04----------
remember seeing a lady my dad worked
with walk out of the house and I was

---------45:09----------
like my thought at the time was is that
my new mom I remember thinking some I

---------45:13----------
knew something was wrong but I don't
know what happened yeah so hold on a

---------45:17----------
second so you approached the house from
the outside yeah cuz my other brother

---------45:23----------
Gary he drove me Oh to an arcade cuz
something bad had happened I get but he

---------45:32----------
was crying while I was playing arcade
games that I know it was wrong and then

---------45:36----------
we came back home but the hospital car
was still there with the plus side and

---------45:45----------
then everyone was crying I don't
remember too many specifics I mean when

---------45:57----------
I came home from school my mom would
always be crying or not not there she'd

---------46:02----------
be in her room then I'd play games okay
yeah I'd play like Super Nintendo yeah

---------46:10----------
and it seems like your memory is pretty
good when it comes to this well that

---------46:18----------
that yeah that memory is really strong
that with the hospital car mm-hmm but

---------46:25----------
the other I don't remember like coming
home from school specific days I

---------46:29----------
remember before that happen I used to
get so excited to see my brothers when I

---------46:32----------
came over from school I'd be like his
guy home as Gary home you know and me

---------46:36----------
excited to play games with them
um yeah and and that was gone after yeah

---------46:44----------
yeah and yeah my my brother other
brother Gary he never left his room

---------46:48----------
anymore and he was he'd be playing
guitar I'd hear and play guitar so um

---------46:53----------
what do you think life was like for you
after that it's very lonely for sure

---------47:01----------
yeah yeah it's hard for me remember any
more specifics like day-to-day from what

---------47:08----------
I'm six but I just yeah yes I I know I
play games a lot yeah so I mean this is

---------47:15----------
gonna sound like kind of a weird
question maybe a leading question but I

---------47:18----------
can see a certain beautiful purpose with
five year old you in your life what was

---------47:24----------
your project old me yeah what was five
year old his purpose fuck I don't know I

---------47:29----------
just wanted to play I want to be as good
as my brothers to play games with them

---------47:32----------
something I think yeah right it's like
simple but it was it was pure and it was

---------47:36----------
simple and it was it was like it was
absolutely there right like you were

---------47:40----------
excited about that like that's what
that's what you live for like yeah and

---------47:44----------
you would like watch them play yeah yeah
yeah yeah that's okay what are you

---------47:57----------
feeling now I don't know it just happens
automatically yeah so close your eyes

---------48:06----------
for a second okay tell me what you feel
in your body something here yep I'm

---------48:16----------
really bad at describing feelings yes
that's why we're doing this we're gonna

---------48:19----------
teach you right now
okay okay what are you feeling in your

---------48:24----------
chest where people describe this as a
tightness maybe a tightness and I keep I

---------48:35----------
realize I need to breathe more steadily
okay so your breathing is erratic

---------48:39----------
ya know what what's happening so as you
notice the feeling what happens to it

---------48:46----------
it's going away yeah right and what just
what just changed with your breathing

---------48:51----------
your breathing is different it's more
regular yeah yeah what's happening to

---------48:56----------
the feeling it's going away yeah another
way to describe yeah so yeah but it's

---------49:04----------
going away like would you say it's
loosening what I say it's what loosening

---------49:10----------
loosening yeah the tightness is
loosening mm-hmm I'm relaxing mm-hmm

---------49:18----------
yeah okay so now keep your eyes closed
okay so tell me a little bit about

---------49:25----------
five-year-old you and what he wanted
from life he wanted to get out of what

---------49:36----------
school or even when you're 5
kindergarten yeah you wanted to get out

---------49:39----------
of kindergarten as fast he could like
he'd come home play games with his

---------49:43----------
brothers yeah and I'm gonna say
something kind of weird so reckful I

---------49:47----------
think you love five-year-old you a lot
and I think you have a lot of hurt

---------49:54----------
because something really bad happened to
him like you love that kid and something

---------50:04----------
that was just terrible happened to him

---------50:09----------
do you see how like that kid is not you
like that's like it's not right that's a

---------50:19----------
different no but you love him so much
and the problem here is that you're

---------50:24----------
trying to protect him you try so hard to
protect him and take away what happened

---------50:30----------
to him but you just can't do it and you
don't know how to help him yeah what

---------50:39----------
does he need sure
I don't know come to terms with reality

---------50:45----------
nope no just think about it for a second
like what does he need like what do you

---------50:52----------
want to protect him from I have no idea
okay so but but you understand that he's

---------51:00----------
different and you understand that
something happened to him what happened

---------51:03----------
to him let's start there mm you got
quickly shoved out of his comfort zone

---------51:14----------
of family and things he cared about yeah
I think so

---------51:22----------
I'm not I'm not buying its owners of
your tournament yeah I was trying to

---------51:25----------
yeah so so what happened I went
different it's way more powerful than

---------51:29----------
comfort oh it's true how do I worry well
he had he had family uh-huh and he

---------51:46----------
didn't absolutely there you go right
it's so simple

---------51:54----------
yeah so simple it's not fuckin comfort
zone and what do you want for him what

---------52:05----------
does he need family absolutely

---------52:16----------
absolutely it's nice and simple it is
yeah the things that fuck us over always

---------52:34----------
are now this is the really profound
thing reckful is that while this seems

---------52:41----------
like it fucked you over in a sense of
course it did but in a sense it didn't

---------52:45----------
this is your Karma
this is what happened to you and this is

---------52:49----------
what's made you the person that you are
and I think that this is like as long as

---------52:55----------
that feeling is there like this feeling
of loss and loneliness like that your

---------53:02----------
purpose when you saw that that that
medical van or ambulance with the Plus

---------53:07----------
on on the side that was the day you lost
your purpose and for a time you found

---------53:14----------
activities that can help you get past
that you can forget about it

---------53:19----------
but that's the day that like your life
changed right like every reason that you

---------53:23----------
had to wake up in the morning was to go
to class so that you could come home

---------53:27----------
from class and spend time with Diane
Gary and then one day all of that

---------53:32----------
changed and it changed you presumably
irrevocably but I don't think that

---------53:39----------
that's true I think you can get Pat's
past this and I think your lack of

---------53:43----------
purpose is like this is where it comes
from I'm feeling a little better

---------53:59----------
have you talked to anyone about this
yeah but I uh I didn't let myself go

---------54:10----------
deep in it I guess I think I cuz it was
always most the time I was it was when I

---------54:16----------
was 16 when I want to talk to people
yeah I think I was a little more closed

---------54:20----------
off than I am now yep all you need is
the Internet to watch yeah well I became

---------54:29----------
really open with everything because I
realized to help me at some points I

---------54:33----------
guess yeah yeah I think can help others
too yeah so why are you making this game

---------54:55----------
reckful I always wanted to make a game
sure but this reminds me as soon as I

---------55:02----------
said that have you seen the split brain
experiment video where there's a guy on

---------55:10----------
his left side he says pick up the
Rubik's Cube and he picks it up and then

---------55:14----------
he lets us hand it to your other hand
and then he they ask the right his right

---------55:21----------
side why are you holding a Rubik's Cube
and he says I always wanted to learn how

---------55:26----------
to solve one of these which makes me
think a lot of times when people are

---------55:32----------
describing something they're doing and
why they're doing it it's inaccurate

---------55:38----------
absolutely

---------55:43----------
so I don't know brilliant I know I
always wanted yeah yeah I know I always

---------55:50----------
wanted to concave for sure when I
started playing an MMO when I was 10

---------55:55----------
just cuz Gary wanted to make a Pokemon
MMO and we were doing research on other

---------56:00----------
MMOs and then I ended up playing it for
seven six seven years from 1999 so he's

---------56:09----------
got a footy I always thought it was a
cool idea to make a game I started

---------56:14----------
stream on Twitch because some game
company made a game called Forge said

---------56:19----------
that advertises her game I could work
for them or something or you know help

---------56:23----------
design the game and that you know didn't
their game didn't succeed so they never

---------56:28----------
hired me and then now I finally can make
my own game just you know because I'm

---------56:38----------
steering for a long time and can fund it
yeah so reckful I this is really

---------56:42----------
important to understand okay and I'm
gonna reference some stuff that I've

---------56:45----------
talked about before so I I want you to
understand that everything that's

---------56:50----------
happened in your life has brought you to
this point you've always wanted to make

---------56:55----------
a game but that's a desire that's just
like man I've always wanted to make a

---------56:59----------
game cuz I'm a gamer and that's kind of
cool like I also want to like I've

---------57:02----------
wanted to make games like I'm interested
in that I bet a lot of people are but

---------57:07----------
what got you to where you are like like
it has to be the right game the Stars

---------57:13----------
have to align for you to make the game
that you need to make and there's been

---------57:19----------
one really big star missing which is
like purpose and I think the reason that

---------57:24----------
your this game like this game is
different it's got to be because you're

---------57:28----------
trying to solve something with this game
you know and that's gonna give you the

---------57:33----------
strength that you need to actually solve
it yeah I'm a little worried I don't

---------57:37----------
know that I'll initially solve it on
first release right away but I want to

---------57:42----------
you know always be patching and
iterating yet to get there yeah yeah we

---------57:46----------
can talk about that more but I'm you
know I'm not worried about I mean that's

---------57:49----------
just yeah so I think the main thing here
is that you're trying to do something

---------57:54----------
really important
right and I think you're not you're not

---------57:58----------
making the game for some like faceless
kid out there yeah you're saying I'm

---------58:06----------
making the game for a kid like me who
wanted something to go home to and

---------58:10----------
friends just spend time with wait a way
to spend time with friends online and

---------58:15----------
have community and stuff yes which is
true for sure yeah I mean I would take

---------58:20----------
it even one step further I don't think
it was for a game for a kid like you oh

---------58:26----------
you just saying I'm making it for me not
for the you today me as a kid yeah yeah

---------58:31----------
that's where it comes from what do you
think about that that's really accurate

---------58:37----------
I think yeah when you say it I mean
rings true yeah yeah right so I think

---------58:42----------
this comes down to so if you want to get
to the roots of your depression you've

---------58:46----------
got a you've got to help that kid like
within yourself you cut out you don't

---------58:52----------
get to the root what a great time to cut
out right yes to get to the root I think

---------59:00----------
you've got it you've got a help you've
got to help you right that's what you

---------59:04----------
that's what you need like that's where
the hurt is that's where the depression

---------59:08----------
comes from that's where the loss of
meaning in your life comes from because

---------59:11----------
like meaning was taken away from you had
plenty of meaning until one day you

---------59:15----------
didn't and all you've managed to do is
distract yourself and find relief

---------59:21----------
through distraction and you're good at
what you do and you're ambitious and

---------59:27----------
you're intelligent so sometimes you can
trick yourself into thinking that a

---------59:32----------
distraction is purpose but it's not and
I've questioned ya know how did your

---------59:46----------
purpose come to be wanting to help
people I know I'm curious to know

---------59:51----------
Christine are you talking about mine
yeah yeah so my story is kind of funny

---------59:54----------
so I played way too many video games in
high school I mean it probably as a kid

---------60:00----------
even before that but it really started
to become a problem in high school and

---------60:04----------
then after after my first year of
college I had less than a two point

---------60:09----------
and then for the next year I also like
kind of failed out of college I was on

---------60:14----------
academic probation and my dad who's a
really fantastic guy was like

---------60:20----------
something's got to change and they've
tried everything they'd like punish me

---------60:23----------
like sent me to a military school and
like all this kind of crap and I just

---------60:27----------
wasn't getting my shit together and he
said so you have to go to India and I

---------60:31----------
said okay so the summer after my
sophomore year I remember I still

---------60:35----------
remember cuz my memory is clear about
this - we were kind of talking like late

---------60:39----------
into the night and this conversation was
different because like usually when I

---------60:43----------
was I would like fail stuff like they
would yell right like I'd get punished

---------60:47----------
or they'd like be like you know I'm
fucking up but this time my dad was just

---------60:51----------
sort of not really resigned but it was
like a really like problem-solving

---------60:54----------
conversation and we kind of like I felt
like we were on the same team and he was

---------60:57----------
like look we got to do something about
this because this is not working so I

---------61:01----------
went to India or 20 or 20 or so you're
20 yeah so 20 20 or 21 and I went to

---------61:10----------
India and I stayed at this place called
an ashram and an ashram is like a

---------61:14----------
monastery so I spent three months
studying yoga and meditation and

---------61:19----------
absolutely loved it and what I loved
about it is that we we study all kinds

---------61:24----------
of stuff we study physics we study
mathematics we study history we study

---------61:28----------
sociology we don't study ourselves like
even if you study psychology it's about

---------61:33----------
like experiments about other people it's
not like how you work it's not like why

---------61:38----------
do I lack meaning in life like how can I
actually find the answer to that

---------61:41----------
where does meaning come from how does
our mind function so in your case the

---------61:45----------
root of your depression is something
called a some scar which I'll explain

---------61:48----------
later and until that some scar gets
dissolved you're gonna continue to be

---------61:52----------
depressed and this is why you can have
periods of like distraction and whatnot

---------61:56----------
and you can fit clinical criteria for
depression and all that good stuff but

---------62:00----------
the end of the day you have this some
scar that formed the day that you saw

---------62:05----------
that plus sign or maybe the next day
when you realize that when you went home

---------62:09----------
I think the some scar formed the day
that you actually realized which which

---------62:12----------
was your older brother guy or Gary guy
so one day you actually realize that

---------62:17----------
like guy is never gonna be home when you
come home and that's I think when this

---------62:21----------
um scar form
and so it was a system to understand

---------62:25----------
like who you are and how you work like
where desires come from where did

---------62:29----------
desires go to like all this different
stuff about the self and I loved it and

---------62:34----------
so I decided to become a monk I went to
my teachers and I said hey I want to

---------62:39----------
become a monk and they said that's
fantastic come back when you're 30 and

---------62:43----------
finish a doctoral degree and we'll take
you so I went back to the US and decided

---------62:47----------
okay if I want to become a monk then I
have to finish college and then I have

---------62:50----------
to like get a doctoral degree so but you
okay but you had a purpose so you

---------62:55----------
probably did it yeah you finished
college so I finished college every

---------62:58----------
summer I went back and studied in India
over December break so I had spent like

---------63:02----------
four months a year in India for the next
seven years with the goal of becoming a

---------63:05----------
monk ended up meeting my wife got
confused because I was like oh I want to

---------63:10----------
become a monk but I'm really into this
girl and all this stuff so decided your

---------63:14----------
mics cutting in and out a little bit I'm
following the whole conversation I don't

---------63:16----------
know why it's probably cuz I'm maybe the
thresholds a little so met my wife and a

---------63:24----------
couple years later decided that like the
monk path wasn't the right path for me

---------63:28----------
or more importantly realized that you
don't have to be to be a monk to be

---------63:31----------
spiritual then ultimately being a monk
is not what you wear it's actually all

---------63:36----------
about your internal experience so the
way that you deal with your own desires

---------63:40----------
the way that you deal with your own
ambitions the way you deal with your own

---------63:42----------
ego and that for me still coming out Oh
weird sorry is it cutting out for

---------63:48----------
everyone
cutting out for everyone right oh it's

---------63:51----------
no it's the discord people are saying oh
weird maybe we can change the server

---------63:57----------
we're on or something
I'll try to change it we're on us-south

---------64:02----------
let's try us alright and then we're back
mister escort okay so um decided not to

---------64:14----------
become a monk because ultimately I
realized like you can be a monk monk is

---------64:19----------
like like it was for me it was all about
ego it was all about like Oh like I was

---------64:24----------
a failure at life so like the way that
is waged my ego was by saying oh like

---------64:28----------
regular life isn't for me so I didn't
have to fail if I became a monk because

---------64:32----------
I'm truly spiritual and I'm not for this
material world it's all a bunch of

---------64:35----------
bullshit ultimately I realized that if I
are you sure yeah you think it was much

---------64:39----------
thinking you were trying to escape the
chance of a loot Lee absolutely okay

---------64:43----------
right because it's it's it's easy to
like escape from your failure in college

---------64:48----------
if you were not meant for like the
material world and I was like better

---------64:52----------
than that I was meant for the spiritual
world because I'm deeply spiritual and

---------64:56----------
I'm not gonna run in this rat race and I
don't care about grades and all these

---------65:00----------
fucking peons out there that are living
a material life I'm better than them I'm

---------65:03----------
gonna become a monk then I realize that
was a load of bullshit that that's yoga

---------65:08----------
that there are two kinds of ego there's
regular ego and then there's the subtler

---------65:13----------
more devious ego which is the ego of
having no ego

---------65:17----------
look at how spiritual I am you know is
that that that whole like so ended up

---------65:24----------
doing neuroscience research so I've
always been kind of a skeptic and was

---------65:28----------
curious about like what was happening in
my brain when I was learning these

---------65:31----------
things so started doing neuroscience
research ended up going to medical

---------65:35----------
school and then decided that I wanted to
become a psychiatrist and that I was

---------65:42----------
going to incorporate like some of these
Eastern perspectives on mental health

---------65:45----------
- like psychiatric care and teaching
people how to meditate and all that good

---------65:49----------
stuff and then it's funny so how tarmo
works because then life sort of threw me

---------65:55----------
an interesting curveball which was while
I was training I started asking some of

---------65:59----------
my like professors and stuff so I
trained at Mass General Hospital and

---------66:02----------
MacLaine which are both Harvard Medical
School teaching affiliates in the number

---------66:05----------
one psychiatric hospital and all this
good stuff no more in hospital in the

---------66:08----------
country all that jazz so I was
surrounded by a lot of brilliant people

---------66:11----------
and I
started asking them I was like what do

---------66:13----------
you guys think about video game
addiction and no one has a fucking clue

---------66:16----------
right so if we think about the leaders
in the field in the fields in general if

---------66:21----------
we think about like leaders in the
fields of like finance like world

---------66:23----------
leaders leaders in the field of medicine
they're like all in their 50s at a

---------66:26----------
minimum and so I realized like when one
of my supervisors who's a brilliant

---------66:30----------
psychoanalyst said yeah I think the
reason that people play too many video

---------66:34----------
games is the same reason they get
tattoos I was like lady what the fuck

---------66:39----------
are you talking about she has no idea
and that's when it hit me that like no

---------66:43----------
one in psychiatry like has played a
video game like all these Chiefs of

---------66:46----------
Psychiatry and you know like head of the
department of psychiatry at Harvard

---------66:50----------
Medical School and like Yale and Hopkins
and Harvard like none of these people

---------66:55----------
make sense yeah they just they've never
played a video game so realize that like

---------66:59----------
oh it's got to be me because who else is
gonna do it right and I think like

---------67:03----------
that's what's special about you're
nodding right why are you nodding I'm

---------67:09----------
nodding because this is a nice sense of
purpose for you to have and you can

---------67:12----------
relate the people who play games because
you play games yourself I think the

---------67:15----------
other reason being is because you get it
right it's gotta be you reckful oh it's

---------67:22----------
gotta be me know something about you
talking about you and your MMO it's

---------67:26----------
gotta be you oh no I was thinking it's
gotta be you yeah but I'm saying that

---------67:31----------
like the same guys yeah yeah so you're
nodding with understanding so if you go

---------67:35----------
back and you watch this video
you're passively listening until I said

---------67:39----------
that I was anyway that's my possibly
listening possibly listening it sounds

---------67:46----------
like I wasn't really immersed but I was
really immersed yes IIIi don't passive

---------67:51----------
listening is not you weren't paying
attention but a passive just means I

---------67:55----------
wasn't yeah giving back body like yeah
so I think there's something about that

---------67:58----------
statement with which resonated with you
which caused you to to have some more

---------68:02----------
body language it could be again this
Rubik's Cube thing where I'm trying to

---------68:06----------
explain something that happened and it's
not accurate I mean at the end of the

---------68:09----------
day I could be over-interpret if you
haven't seen that video you need to see

---------68:12----------
it it's it's crazy

---------68:14----------
corpus callosum people have their corpus
callosum severed do all kinds of cool

---------68:19----------
things
so then I about in September of 2018 I

---------68:26----------
guess it's a little over a year ago I
actually made the mistake of just

---------68:29----------
randomly posting on Reddit and I said
I'm a psychiatrist that's interested in

---------68:32----------
video game addiction ask me anything so
the post ended up hitting the front page

---------68:36----------
and I started getting like inundated
with calls

---------68:39----------
so like I'd get like people didn't know
how to find me so I started getting like

---------68:43----------
paged I have a pager right because
doctors have pagers nowadays like it's

---------68:47----------
Austin drug dealers were the only ones
left with pagers I don't even know if

---------68:51----------
drug dealers do anymore yeah so so I
started getting paged and people were

---------68:54----------
calling me and emailing me and I
realized like there's just no way that I

---------68:58----------
can help like I'd been working with
gamers for years but there's just no way

---------69:03----------
that I can help like every person out
there and I've got to do like I've got

---------69:07----------
people more and so I'd sort of set
myself up to kind of be like the next

---------69:13----------
Deepak Chopra or something like that I
was like very like ambitious and and you

---------69:16----------
know I had a lot of like in this way
right now

---------69:19----------
you're a o e helping people absolutely
that's exactly what this one yeah it's

---------69:26----------
AoE right yeah so I realized that I
can't like single-target this shit it's

---------69:30----------
just not gonna work like yeah after the
AMA I probably got hundreds if not

---------69:36----------
thousands of requests for help and and
like from all over that all over the

---------69:41----------
fucking place like some dude reached out
to me from Singapore and was like hey

---------69:45----------
can you come to Singapore and like talk
to us cuz we're struggling and I was

---------69:49----------
like sure but I don't know how or why
and and just gets all these random so

---------69:57----------
most even more bizarre is I got a I got
an email a couple weeks ago from two

---------70:03----------
psychologists that worked for the
Serbian military and they're like hey

---------70:07----------
can you help us like you teach us how to
treat video game addiction and I was

---------70:11----------
like yeah I can try so you're absolutely
right that it needs to be a OE right but

---------70:16----------
like not even just a OE and like one
like I need like a global AOE like

---------70:20----------
server whine like a surfer wide virus is
what I need

---------70:25----------
yeah YouTube yeah so we have YouTube and
twitch and that's why I started

---------70:28----------
streaming so I started streaming about
two and a half months ago and you know

---------70:33----------
was advised against doing that by a lot
of people in like many of my colleagues

---------70:38----------
and stuff like that because though I can
get sued and all that good stuff and and

---------70:42----------
talked to attorneys and things like that
so hopefully I don't get sued so I'm not

---------70:45----------
really just delivering medical care but
you know what happens if someone comes

---------70:48----------
on stream and then kills themselves or
something like that I mean I you know I

---------70:52----------
think at the end it I'll try not to kill
myself anytime soon for you yeah thank

---------70:55----------
you I appreciate that I'm serious no
problem I actually I haven't thought

---------71:00----------
about killing myself since I think yeah
I believe that if you if you do happen

---------71:09----------
to have those thoughts again feel free
to reach out you have my discord and

---------71:17----------
yeah I will say you know you're you can
die but not until you've done what you

---------71:22----------
need to for that five-year-old like
unless you do that first you're just

---------71:28----------
gonna have to come back and fix that
problem later death is not I mean so in

---------71:33----------
my religion and through some of my
experiences through meditation I really

---------71:37----------
do understand I believe in things like
reincarnation and and I think the trick

---------71:42----------
but yet going this is where you're gonna
what's the word

---------71:51----------
you're gonna divide your audience that's
fine yeah I know so I so I I also say a

---------71:56----------
lot of things on the stream that are
based in science this is not one of them

---------72:00----------
so I try to draw a distinction between
you know what I believe but I think

---------72:03----------
ultimately like once you meditate you
start to have experiences and then like

---------72:07----------
I can't shake I don't I don't logically
believe in reincarnation it's based on

---------72:12----------
experience so I there are certain
techniques of meditation and stuff where

---------72:15----------
you can remember your past lives and
things like that and I've just seen too

---------72:19----------
much consciousness is pretty weird
absolutely I didn't put it past

---------72:24----------
consciousness that you know I mean how
did it just happen in this organism or

---------72:30----------
in that organism so so uh it could it
could be that there's no organism at all

---------72:34----------
there's making shit up
there's a lot of weird shit I think you

---------72:39----------
know I don't scientifically believe in
reincarnation I don't think it makes

---------72:42----------
sense logically but like once you have
some experience it just it just feels so

---------72:47----------
real is the best way that I can put it
is it a possible hallucination of my

---------72:50----------
mind absolutely but that's a
conversation for a different day kind of

---------72:54----------
how I got to my thermo so now I realize
that like they're gamers out there that

---------72:58----------
need help and that the number of gamers
who need help is like astronomical that

---------73:02----------
for the first time mental health has
surpassed cardiovascular disease and

---------73:07----------
cancer as the number one cause of
morbidity and mortality in the United

---------73:14----------
States that for the firt you have a
little bit of a tick tick there you well

---------73:18----------
like searching for information in your
head or something like uh stats like

---------73:23----------
that you you roll your eyes a little I'm
just telling you you probably don't want

---------73:28----------
to have it yeah why not um why not why
don't you want to have this tick I mean

---------73:42----------
it's up to you yeah maybe you do I don't
care but I'm just I was just letting you

---------73:47----------
know yeah that's okay I tend to me I
have a lot of facial expressions that I

---------73:51----------
that I tend to be pretty transparent
about and if I'm scanning my memory I

---------73:54----------
think it's fine for people to understand
that I'm scanning my memory

---------73:57----------
we're not playing poker true I do play
some poker so I wouldn't want to do yeah

---------74:04----------
it's it's in my professional interest to
actually show what's on my face not

---------74:09----------
conceal it so I tend to be different
from other psychiatrists in that way in

---------74:12----------
the sense that like a lot of people try
to be a blank slate I just show what's

---------74:15----------
on my face I see the blank slate does
suck I've talked to a lot of people in

---------74:20----------
Slate I think it's stupid I mean okay
actually that's kind of judgmental I I

---------74:25----------
just don't think it's for me I'll put it
that way I think some people you know I

---------74:28----------
get that they want to do with that we
could say stupid that's fun so yeah we

---------74:36----------
were talking about her money yeah so I
mean now I I realize like I just need to

---------74:40----------
help people and that mental health is
getting worse in this country and I

---------74:44----------
think part of the reason for that so the
other interesting thing that's happened

---------74:48----------
recently is life expectancy between
ages of 25 and 64 has gone down for the

---------74:54----------
first time suicide suicide is a big part
of it suicide is increased by 50% in

---------75:00----------
teenagers over the last decade
so like Justin it makes a lot of sense

---------75:04----------
they're constantly comparing themselves
other people on yeah so I think

---------75:08----------
technology and stuff absolutely so
social media has really started to prey

---------75:13----------
on certain like aspects of our
psychology that were kind of unaware of

---------75:17----------
and so my sense is that like the field
of mental health needs to be addressed

---------75:21----------
way more quickly and are in a way
broader sense and what I mean by this is

---------75:25----------
like people need to understand some
fundamentals about how their mind works

---------75:28----------
like I think it's infuriating that you
go to a psychologist and you ask them

---------75:32----------
how does my mind work and they're not
gonna give you an answer like there are

---------75:36----------
answers I think there are very simple
answers like I think your problem is

---------75:39----------
that you have a some scar most people's
problems are that you have this kind of

---------75:43----------
ball of undigested emotion that lurks
beneath the surface and exerts its

---------75:48----------
influence on your mind it's like you've
you've had a debuff since the age of six

---------75:53----------
in that deep office no she's called
depression and there are some times

---------75:58----------
where you can get temporary buffs like
learning how to play guitar or like I

---------76:03----------
like that elegy yeah and so you've just
got this fucking debuff and the thing is

---------76:08----------
you had the debuff for so long that you
think it's like it's debuff sucks by the

---------76:12----------
way absolutely I hate and and and you
think it's some part of like you think

---------76:15----------
you you got it during character creation
you think it's you right because when

---------76:19----------
you get diagnosed with type two bipolar
that's like during character creation

---------76:22----------
like you picked a trait to give you
yourself extra character points and

---------76:26----------
you're like I'm picking type two bipolar
and I get five more character points and

---------76:30----------
I'm gonna I'm gonna pick like good it
Wow

---------76:34----------
who the fuck would pick that yeah but
but the cool thing is it's not it's not

---------76:40----------
static right I believe and I could be
wrong and and maybe you're stuck with

---------76:43----------
this for the rest of your life but I
think you can get significantly better

---------76:46----------
and I think it's like right beneath the
surface man like I'm good I'm starting

---------76:50----------
to believe it I'm sorry I'm good at my
job but I mean like 15 minutes dude 15

---------76:55----------
minutes is what it took and it's just
right there and it's so big

---------76:59----------
that's why it's so easy to get to
because you have this whole you have

---------77:03----------
this whole like iceberg
and it's just like right beneath the

---------77:06----------
surface and if you if you resolve
something it's not just about grief it's

---------77:12----------
not just losing your brother but it's
like shattering your perception of like

---------77:16----------
what life is about like life became
meaningless to you after that because

---------77:21----------
that's what you that's what life was
about and then suddenly like that's no

---------77:24----------
longer on the table you give a kid a
purpose in life you give his life like

---------77:29----------
because that's the thing about the child
right it's such a simple and pure

---------77:32----------
purpose and then you yank it away it's
not complicated it's not complex it

---------77:37----------
doesn't have different shades so it can
be shattered in an instant and then it's

---------77:42----------
completely broken if you lose your
purpose at the age of 30 that's

---------77:46----------
different because you have different
dimensions of your life at that point

---------77:49----------
you have something to fall back on but
you didn't have anything to fall back on

---------77:52----------
because that's all it was
and then your other brothers say it in

---------77:56----------
his room all the time
mm-hmm right not his fault was just I

---------78:01----------
realize my my just was thinking of my
parents are probably watching this

---------78:03----------
that's fine so that's interesting yeah I
mean they're welcome to come on to but

---------78:12----------
that's it's nice anyway yeah and and I
don't think it's anyone's fault right

---------78:17----------
and there's there's other stuff here
which if you want to have a conversation

---------78:21----------
one day about forgiveness and whether
your brother deserves forgiveness or

---------78:26----------
whether you've forgiven him that's
probably an important crime oh I

---------78:28----------
definitely know I don't blame him at all
okay because I know what it's like to go

---------78:34----------
through day by day having no desires and
suffering the whole time

---------78:39----------
and for it you just want it to be over
yeah and I don't I don't blame her yeah

---------78:46----------
not even a little bit so questions
reckful other people know you did a

---------78:55----------
really good job you're you're good at
what you do what do we do good I'm happy

---------79:00----------
to hear you say that but what did we do
you just talked me through my problems

---------79:05----------
and helped me find them okay nice

---------79:10----------
I made some realizations about myself
and it gives me a little more purpose in

---------79:20----------
the future good a lot a lot a lot of
yeah so I just want you to remember that

---------79:25----------
when you feel depressed like it's not
that those feelings aren't real and

---------79:29----------
there's a lot of science that suggests
that it's not just to some scar right

---------79:32----------
because you have a family history of it
there's probably some genetic component

---------79:36----------
to it there's something going on in your
neurotransmitters which is absolutely

---------79:40----------
real you know but these are just sort of
different like dimensions of the self

---------79:46----------
and so you can have that biological
stuff going on and you can sort of have

---------79:51----------
what I would call sort of like the roots
of your depression or spiritual they're

---------79:54----------
not even psychological and that you have
you have an unfulfilled governme you

---------80:00----------
have something that you owe to the the
six year old you and all of the kids who

---------80:05----------
could be that six year old you and you
have to help the world become a place

---------80:09----------
where like that kid like you want to
build the safety net that you need it

---------80:14----------
yes I was gonna sorry I was thinking
there was a period of time where I

---------80:19----------
started meditating when I was in Japan
yeah and I remember feeling just like

---------80:27----------
serenity yep and I wanted you to tell me
a little bit about meditation yeah great

---------80:35----------
so let's talk about meditation
so what's meditation reckful well now

---------80:44----------
that putting it in the perspective of
what you were telling me earlier I guess

---------80:48----------
I like it cuz it takes me out of myself
yep

---------80:50----------
because I'm not myself at the time yeah
so I want y'all to understand so like we

---------80:55----------
have a mind and we think we are a mind
but we are not our mind our mind is just

---------81:00----------
a part of us right like if you think
about you can observe your own thoughts

---------81:06----------
absolutely and then you're the observer
it kind of it's kind of mine fucking

---------81:10----------
actually to think it is my fucking your
if you're observing the thoughts yeah so

---------81:13----------
you can't you can't the observer cannot
be the observed so you can look at

---------81:17----------
yourself in a mirror but then what
you're actually looking at is the mirror

---------81:20----------
right you're not actually looking at
yourself so the Yogi's realize that

---------81:24----------
there's this thing called consciousness
which is actually outside of the mind

---------81:28----------
and sometimes when you meditate you
enter this state of mind where you have

---------81:32----------
no thoughts and no real perception of
time because time also exists within the

---------81:37----------
mind and that the more that you step out
of your mind the closer you get to the

---------81:41----------
most basic version of yourself which is
what consciousness is and meditation is

---------81:47----------
the systematic practice of stepping
outside of your mind and existing in a

---------81:52----------
conscious state without the activity of
the mind and we tend to associate those

---------81:57----------
two but there's a very simple
understanding of the states of

---------82:01----------
consciousness go ahead ask ask I was
just gonna say we can agree on

---------82:05----------
everything else without agreeing that
time exists in the mind right

---------82:09----------
uh so one of the hallmarks of the
meditative state is you lose the

---------82:14----------
perception of time yeah okay I mean
psilocybin - yeah right so that so

---------82:21----------
that's because the perception of time
comes from within the mind so for

---------82:24----------
example like when your mind yeah the
perception of time is yeah from

---------82:28----------
consciousness from consciousness from
the mind right so so let's let's go

---------82:34----------
through this what do you mean exactly so
first thing to understand is like we

---------82:38----------
think about consciousness and mind as is
one thing but let's understand that you

---------82:42----------
can have a state where you're conscious
without mind unconscious with mind

---------82:48----------
conscious with mind in unconscious
without mind there's like a two-by-two

---------82:52----------
table
okay I need explanation yeah so let's

---------82:54----------
start with this so when you're when
you're sleeping are you conscious is

---------83:01----------
your mind active yes yes when no it's
not okay so let's think about that when

---------83:09----------
you're dreaming ah beautiful right but
you're not always dreaming so but I

---------83:14----------
think even when you're not dreaming
you're repeating events of the day like

---------83:19----------
let's say you play piano and then you go
to sleep sometimes you'll wake up and

---------83:21----------
you'll know how to play it better
because I think while you're sleeping

---------83:24----------
your mind repeats it over well no no so
what you're talking about is memory

---------83:27----------
consolidation which happens during sleep
although I don't know if memory

---------83:30----------
consolidation is an activity of the mind
or not but if we look at sleep you don't

---------83:34----------
know if memory consolidation is an
active mind activity within the amygdala

---------83:37----------
the amygdala is activating or something
yeah so your brain is not your mind so

---------83:41----------
your brain is doing all kinds of shit
when you sleep but that's not mind what

---------83:46----------
do you mean by money great so we're
gonna understand this all right all

---------83:49----------
right okay so this is the first thing to
understand it's like if we think about

---------83:52----------
mine so mind is like thoughts its
sensations its sensory perceptions

---------83:57----------
that's mine

---------84:00----------
okay so thoughts in sensory experiences
let's just call that mind so in sleep is

---------84:07----------
that the what to call this something
cortex well it depends I mean each the

---------84:12----------
cortex has different fields for
different perceptions so there's a

---------84:14----------
somatosensory cortex there's an auditory
cortex there's an olfactory cortex there

---------84:18----------
lots of different cortices so all the
cortex combined is that mine no so the

---------84:22----------
brain is different from the mind ok so
remember that the yoga I'm having yellow

---------84:26----------
so we're we're good so let's take a step
back from neuroscience for a minute and

---------84:31----------
understand experience right so we can
talk about neuroscience and what the

---------84:34----------
different parts of the brain's brain
does but let's take let's take the

---------84:38----------
perspective perspective a yogi or an
individual so we're gonna talk about

---------84:41----------
stuff that's not science but that anyone
who's watching can understand about

---------84:46----------
their mind so the way in which we
experience it is what we're focusing on

---------84:50----------
we could talk about the science
separately ok ok so when you're sleeping

---------84:55----------
you can be dreaming or not dreaming
right so when you're not dreaming you're

---------85:02----------
not conscious you're not aware and your
mind isn't doing anything particular

---------85:07----------
like you're not thinking and when you
dream like you you acknowledge the state

---------85:13----------
of dreaming and not dreaming or like
fundamentally different yes No let's

---------85:16----------
start there I'll acknowledge that except
that they're fundamentally different but

---------85:22----------
I maybe this thing of organizing the
memories could possibly be similar to

---------85:28----------
dreaming and we just don't remember it
yeah possible yeah so there may be other

---------85:32----------
functions that were not aware of
I completely agree so like there's a lot

---------85:36----------
of stuff that our brain does that may be
the dividing line that I'm setting is

---------85:39----------
not as simple as I think ok I'll
acknowledge that and we can move on so

---------85:43----------
but essentially like when we're dreaming
we're not really it's sort of activity

---------85:49----------
of the mind without awareness so we're
not really like conscious but our mind

---------85:53----------
is still like it's like running a movie
in our head the other thing is there's

---------85:57----------
also this state called daydreaming and
daydreaming is when we're awake but

---------86:02----------
we're not actually aware like when
you're daydreaming you quote-unquote

---------86:05----------
zone out right so that's actually sate
of conscious a lack of consciousness or

---------86:10----------
no consciousness
with activity in the mind daydreaming is

---------86:17----------
a lack of consciousness with activity
yeah that's why we call it daydreaming

---------86:20----------
intuitively we understand that that
state of mind is similar to what happens

---------86:25----------
in sleep which is why we use the same
word we use the word dream because any

---------86:30----------
human being can okay yeah but I maybe I
would think that we're still conscious

---------86:34----------
and it's just a different type sure yeah
I don't know if I would call it fine so

---------86:38----------
a different type is fine I'll take that
right so like that like okay there's

---------86:43----------
something fundamentally different
between what you're doing right now in

---------86:46----------
your head and daydreaming agreed agree
so what I would say you have right now

---------86:52----------
is consciousness or awareness with the
activity of mind

---------86:56----------
so they're both turned on right now when
you're in a coma or you're not dreaming

---------87:02----------
they're both turned off when you have
dreaming your mind is on but your

---------87:08----------
awareness is off because you're not
aware like you're zoned out but your

---------87:11----------
mind is still doing Shannon okay hmm
neuroscience stuff we can talk about

---------87:16----------
later then we come to the last state
which is a state of consciousness

---------87:20----------
without mind this is the state of
meditation this is the state that

---------87:26----------
psilocybin sometimes helps you get to

---------87:30----------
right so the simplest way to understand
this reckful yeah go foreign without the

---------87:37----------
mind is the thought yes
so without yep we're just gonna show you

---------87:40----------
God and we're still conscious no I get
it yeah no we're gonna show you we're

---------87:44----------
gonna what you're right about so I think
we can talk about this shit until we're

---------87:47----------
blue in the face but I think the
simplest way to help people understand

---------87:49----------
is to actually enter that state of mind
and then you guys will know what I'm

---------87:52----------
talking about
so can we meditate yeah fuck yeah sit up

---------87:57----------
straight alright okay so someone's
asking someone's commenting about lucid

---------88:05----------
dreaming so lucid dreaming is a great
example of consciousness active while

---------88:09----------
you're dreaming right cuz you're aware
mm-hmm okay so reckful do this open your

---------88:16----------
eyes mmm can you guys do this right hand
I'm gonna do that

---------88:22----------
yeah but

---------88:30----------
okay so we're gonna take our thumb and
we're gonna block are right nostril

---------88:35----------
block are right now oh I'm doing the
other hand then okay wait you wanted me

---------88:39----------
to do fit oh my god my autism is showing

---------88:44----------
people say I am in this at this so
breathe in

---------88:48----------
I'm not autistic guys okay so okay lock
your right nostril and B then use the

---------88:56----------
other two fingers to block the opposite
nostril and then breathe out let go of

---------89:02----------
the thumb and then breathe out breathe
in through the same nostril switch read

---------89:13----------
out in through the same nostril switch
out in okay I was conscious but not

---------89:34----------
thinking stop just keep doing it you
just started thinking again I know I'm

---------89:40----------
just I I realized that I was good we'll
talk more okay so right now I don't like

---------89:45----------
the nose thing I prefer to just breathe
in think about that but it's harder oh

---------89:49----------
you don't like the nose thing because
both of your nose do you have a deviated

---------89:52----------
septum no just I feel like I've to blow
my nose now no that's okay one of your

---------89:59----------
sides is gonna be more open than the
other that's normal

---------90:01----------
which side is more open mmm this one
right now that's left okay I look okay

---------90:07----------
so do so okay we're gonna try this
because I want people at home do this

---------90:11----------
because this is a good technique for
people at home you don't have to do it

---------90:14----------
but so block the right nostril and BRE
then I'll do it I'll do

---------90:21----------
when you take a full breath switch and
breathe out in through the same nostril

---------90:39----------
switch out in switch out in switch out

---------91:17----------
in

---------91:23----------
switch out now remember that you breathe
in through the same nostril that you

---------91:32----------
breathe out before you switch and now
continue at your own pace

---------91:38----------
close your eyes we'll practice for about
three minutes

---------93:19----------
go ahead and finish the breath that
you're on let your eyes main closed just

---------93:28----------
relax

---------94:07----------
now put your palms together in front of
you and start to rub feel the warmth of

---------94:14----------
the friction and then cut them over your
eyes take a deep breath in and as you

---------94:22----------
exhale slowly open your eyes when
they're fully open go ahead and relax

---------94:42----------
that facial expression means you did it
right yeah how does your chest feel I

---------94:57----------
wish you how would you describe how
would you describe how your loosen happy

---------95:00----------
and good is a beautiful way to describe
it okay it's beautiful right okay so

---------95:15----------
reckful you don't have to be an expert
to be right about what you think right

---------95:19----------
because I'm getting the sense then
you're competent in some areas and your

---------95:23----------
confidence you're confident that you're
competent in those areas and outside of

---------95:27----------
those areas you may be feel like you're
not that competent but you're good dude

---------95:31----------
yeah you're sure you're good trust
yourself I'm okay with I'm okay with

---------95:36----------
being unconfident in the areas that I
don't know well I don't mind it yeah I

---------95:41----------
think it's fine it's just like you
thought it was fine to do the eye roll

---------95:45----------
I like that I'm not if I state something
as a fact then not that it is a fact but

---------95:55----------
I'm Way more certain of it in my head
than most people will have to be certain

---------96:02----------
of something to stay something as if I
great so

---------96:06----------
what was your mind doing during that
practice just now like not oh it was in

---------96:13----------
the practice it was off yeah but you
were conscious right so what you

---------96:20----------
experienced is what I would call
consciousness without the mind and maybe

---------96:23----------
your mind activated here or there like
it would have a thought yeah that's

---------96:29----------
that's normal
but I I think this actually helps this

---------96:31----------
this whole play helps with you stopping
the mind from activating yes keeps you

---------96:37----------
focused yes yeah that's what it is
exactly right so the attention required

---------96:42----------
to maintain the hand business is enough
at like of a pole to keep your mind from

---------96:50----------
getting bored that's why I like this
technique because if you just sit there

---------96:54----------
you tell people to observe their breath
if they have thought loops which is this

---------96:58----------
kind of momentum of the mind you need
something to break the thought loops the

---------97:02----------
cool thing is that if you if you get
good at this technique and you start to

---------97:05----------
enter a depressive thought loop you
could do the technique and it'll shut

---------97:09----------
off the mind and then the thought loop
will go away because the thought loop

---------97:12----------
exists within the mind i I found for me
instead of this when I get distracted I

---------97:19----------
and I remember then I account a point
just like a game is I'm like okay one

---------97:24----------
every time I remember and also it's
enough of a bowl so that that's what you

---------97:29----------
need right a pull a pull all so there
are a lot of different techniques of

---------97:34----------
meditation all they are is a pull the
sanskrit word for this is da da da da

---------97:39----------
daaaa means focus and if you do the
Tarna correctly if you do the focusing

---------97:45----------
practice then you enter a state of mind
called Gyan Gyan is not something you do

---------97:51----------
it's something that happens to you it's
like going to bed and falling asleep you

---------97:55----------
can't so I'll tell you if you got sorry
a few years ago I thought this was all

---------98:01----------
bullshit but then I don't know why I
thought that because actually people

---------98:07----------
have been meditating and practicing and
learning it for such a long period of

---------98:11----------
time 2500 years yeah

---------98:15----------
it makes sense that it does something
yeah but I definitely thought it was the

---------98:21----------
beginning I thought it was bullshit too
so like I grew up Indian and so had

---------98:24----------
plenty of opportunities to learn yoga
and meditation went to like a yoga class

---------98:28----------
when I was like eight and thought it was
a load of bullshit even went to like you

---------98:33----------
know because and what I really loved
about going to India is I found people I

---------98:37----------
would ask challenging questions and they
could fucking answer because they knew

---------98:40----------
what they were talking about yeah
instead of the people like in my

---------98:43----------
hometown which had like learning this
stuff and really didn't understand what

---------98:45----------
they were saying I think it's completely
reasonable to actually think it's

---------98:48----------
bullshit I think it's completely
reasonable to think reincarnation is

---------98:51----------
bullshit - I think what happened do you
know why I brought I do you know why I

---------98:55----------
brought up thinking about it well why
would you think I brought it up

---------98:59----------
because you don't think it's bullshit
now no cuz I was thinking that a lot of

---------99:04----------
people watching will think it's bullshit
and then that it's relatable for that us

---------99:07----------
to have thought it was bullshit before
and then yeah so I think that's great so

---------99:10----------
that's why I mentioned the reincarnation
for the same reason right so I think

---------99:13----------
that the main thing to understand about
meditation this is why I teach

---------99:16----------
meditation on stream because you could
talk about it like I don't care like

---------99:20----------
whether whether I believe in
reincarnation or I think meditation is

---------99:23----------
helpful or you think it's helpful is
completely right I don't believe in

---------99:26----------
reincarnation it doesn't know I said
yeah no I mean I think it's reasonable

---------99:30----------
to not believe in reincarnation I think
it's like that's a scientific and

---------99:34----------
logical perspective because we have no
evidence of it right so the whole goal

---------99:39----------
of this is like if you really want to
understand the benefits of meditation

---------99:43----------
and what the nature of your mind is you
actually have to sit and do it because

---------99:47----------
we can talk back and forth about
consciousness and mind but the second

---------99:50----------
you meditate it took you like two
breaths to be like okay my mind Chandra

---------99:53----------
Sheriff yeah because the whole time
we're talking about it our mind is not

---------99:56----------
absolutely so we don't rewrite it yeah
we don't experience and so now we also

---------100:00----------
kind of see like when you're playing
music when you're doing photography now

---------100:03----------
we come full circle when you're playing
music when you're doing photography even

---------100:07----------
when you're playing PvP and wow like you
stopped being you write for yeah I'm the

---------100:12----------
mercy Europe you know experienced
reckful disappears and you're just one

---------100:17----------
with the experience when you do
psilocybin the the barriers of the

---------100:21----------
identity fall apart when you're
depressed you're in your own head you're

---------100:26----------
stuck there
the thoughts are constant you're stuck

---------100:31----------
inside yourself you're stuck inside
yourself stuck stuck stuck stuck stuck

---------100:34----------
stuck you can't get away oh should I eat
should I not eat III me me me it doesn't

---------100:40----------
matter what I do it doesn't matter what
someone says people think I'm a piece of

---------100:43----------
shit all of those thoughts me i me i me
I I'm worthless I'm worthless I'm

---------100:49----------
worthless I'm worthless I'm worthless
IIIi I step outside of it learn to step

---------100:56----------
outside yeah I I have recently started
to yeah it's nice yeah

---------101:01----------
and also when I had those experiences in
the past so yeah with photography and

---------101:05----------
Wow and nationals : yeah sometimes
relationships yep right and yeah

---------101:14----------
definitely actually yeah but sometimes
relationships don't do in your mind

---------101:17----------
right can go either way
yes it goes both ways yeah hmm I'm glad

---------101:26----------
you weren't against the psilocybin yeah
I mean nobody a lot of people yeah so I

---------101:34----------
think that like you know drugs people I
get questions about drugs a lot and I

---------101:39----------
think that you know you just I think a
lot of people don't understand like we

---------101:42----------
don't understand what stuff is doing to
our brain so I think you've got to be

---------101:45----------
careful like for example a lot of people
think like oh marijuana doesn't make

---------101:49----------
people stupid no it doesn't make people
stupid what what it does is hampers your

---------101:52----------
motivational circuitry that's like worse
and I think that if you're that actually

---------101:57----------
is what I think if your brain is
developing you shouldn't pollute it with

---------102:01----------
shit like I think if you want to do I
mean I'm not advocating drug use but I

---------102:05----------
think that the damage that's done to a
developing brain because it's developing

---------102:09----------
his way worse than what's done to a
fully formed ring okay and and I think

---------102:15----------
that these substances like I don't know
if people know this but like Yogi's and

---------102:20----------
stuff even Shiva who's sort of the first
Yogi's like a Hindu deity but presumably

---------102:25----------
was a man at some point he was just like
a meditator like he smoked pot like

---------102:31----------
because that's what Yogi's some of the
Yogi's and some of the traditions of

---------102:35----------
meditation use but I think that all of
this stuff should be done under the

---------102:39----------
guidance of a guru or done like it's not
just sitting around

---------102:42----------
hi because generally speaking I don't
know many people who are soup well I

---------102:46----------
mean actually I do know a lot of people
who were successful and get high on a

---------102:48----------
regular basis but I know many more
people who smoke pot and or nothing

---------102:53----------
and so I think that you know all
substances have a role nothing is

---------103:00----------
nothing is really a judgment sure turn
though sure I think what it what does it

---------103:07----------
mean to be nothing you know I mean maybe
they're enjoying if they're enjoying

---------103:10----------
their life it's okay I I don't think so
you don't think oh yeah I don't think

---------103:17----------
enjoyment I don't think enjoyment is a
meaningful life I think if you're living

---------103:21----------
your community then for some people it
might be the I mean everyone is entitled

---------103:27----------
to their opinion but if they're enjoying
it and with a group of people what if

---------103:31----------
they're all enjoying it together
so I think you think it individually is

---------103:35----------
fine I think as long as you're
fulfilling your Dharma if you're doing

---------103:38----------
your duty to like yourself and to other
people and you're making the world a

---------103:41----------
better place then you can do whatever
the fuck you want to in your free time

---------103:44----------
but you should you should have a life of
Dharma where you fulfill your Dharma and

---------103:49----------
I don't think that hedonism or just the
sake of like living a life of pleasure

---------103:53----------
is like I'd say that that life is
nothing okay

---------103:57----------
is that judgmental absolutely I don't
claim to be non judgement oh no I'm fine

---------104:01----------
with you think I'm fine with you
thinking that yeah

---------104:05----------
I'm not completely against hedonism I
would say let's say we found a way to

---------104:11----------
manipulate our brain chemistry to be
happy all the time and we all wanted to

---------104:16----------
do it I wouldn't be against it I mean
our goals suddenly would be different

---------104:23----------
maybe maybe our civilization wouldn't
advance as much as it is but well I mean

---------104:27----------
there there is a way to be happy all the
time

---------104:29----------
so I advocate for people trying to be
happy all the time that that state I'm

---------104:34----------
not saying there isn't I'm you know it'd
be more readily achievable if we

---------104:38----------
manipulated our neurotransmitters or
something yeah maybe with yeah yeah I

---------104:48----------
mean I've there are a lot of concepts
there that I think need to be dug into

---------104:53----------
more but maybe not that we have time for
today I'm wondering do people have

---------104:58----------
questions yeah yeah oh yeah people have
questions in answer yeah let me see if

---------105:04----------
there's I have like a question bond but
it seems like I'm gonna go eat soon and

---------105:09----------
like probably like 10 minutes or
something I had a really good time

---------105:12----------
talking I want to hear you answer the
questions actually I want to but I don't

---------105:16----------
see oh by the way his how do I um can
somebody help me tee up questions oh

---------105:28----------
here we go
somebody help him please his stream is

---------105:33----------
healthy gamer underscore GG people are
linking it my mods are linking it in the

---------105:37----------
chat so people are is there okay there's
a lot of stuff okay so what is the

---------105:45----------
fulfilling life is there a way to be
happy all the time there's a quiet

---------105:50----------
debate on when the brains develop I have
heard many different when is the same

---------105:55----------
brain fully developed did it work you
won't just okay okay look let's okay

---------106:07----------
there are a lot of questions about flow
in the zone and being happy all the time

---------106:11----------
and can you get addicted to meditation I
think is what one of the questions is so

---------106:16----------
let's start with like so meditation you
step outside of your mind and it can be

---------106:20----------
relieving the other cool thing about
meditation though is that I think it

---------106:24----------
lets you understand the other patterns
within yourself that keep you stuck so I

---------106:30----------
don't think that you can really get
addicted to meditation because I think

---------106:33----------
when you meditate a lot you're gonna
start to process things that you don't

---------106:39----------
through other forms of distraction
that's why I think meditation is o P

---------106:42----------
because sure it helps you feel better in
the moment but it's not like getting

---------106:47----------
high because getting high isn't gonna
like people think they have a lot of

---------106:51----------
realizations when they get high because
the

---------106:54----------
perceives that it understands things but
then you wake up the next day and your

---------106:57----------
life isn't actually changed my
overwhelming experience

---------107:01----------
in my own life and also teaching
meditation in my day job is that when

---------107:05----------
people start to meditate regularly they
change like the way that they view the

---------107:11----------
world changes the way that they interact
with the world changes there's

---------107:14----------
overwhelming neuro scientific evidence
that that the brain changes when you

---------107:18----------
meditate I don't know of go ahead I was
just gonna say I really do believe and

---------107:27----------
since I've been changing psilocybin
sniffing psilocybin is different so

---------107:32----------
there there's a set of naga for Academy
and psilocybin ayahuasca ibogaine that I

---------107:41----------
do believe can can transform people so
there's no there's overwhelming and not

---------107:46----------
overwhelming there's very promising
preliminary evidence that some of these

---------107:51----------
substances can like profoundly change
people for the positive MDMA is another

---------107:56----------
one so there are trials that have pilot
studies that have been done I'm doing a

---------108:00----------
for PTSD and psilocybin for treatment
refractory depression I also I mean I'm

---------108:06----------
an addiction psychiatrist in my day job
so like I had a patient who used opiates

---------108:11----------
for many many he's been using substance
some some substance or another since he

---------108:15----------
was a teenager and then used some of
these substances and had some really

---------108:18----------
powerful transformative experiences that
I can't relate because they're very

---------108:22----------
specific but just weird like
supernatural like metaphysical like soul

---------108:27----------
body reincarnation level shit and he is
like a transformed person in his sober

---------108:32----------
for the first time in his life for like
eight months like since he was a

---------108:36----------
teenager started experimenting with
drugs when he was a teenager and has

---------108:40----------
finally stopped using him
the really mind-blowing thing about him

---------108:43----------
is that when he went to this treatment
center that uses this stuff after he was

---------108:48----------
telling me about some of his
transformative experiences and then like

---------108:51----------
I thought that he wouldn't continue
treatment because he felt cured and then

---------108:55----------
he blew my mind when he made this
statement he was like yeah I felt like

---------108:58----------
there was a spiritual route to my
addiction which has been cured but

---------109:02----------
there's also a psychology to that and I
need to work on that so continued with

---------109:06----------
addiction treatment in
with actually like a gung-ho inist ever

---------109:09----------
seen him do before it's really
fascinating so I think a lot of these

---------109:12----------
mind-altering substances do have roles
in terms of like helping people but

---------109:18----------
you're cutting I don't know I do believe
that they have roles in helping people I

---------109:24----------
just don't know you know I think it's it
needs to be explored okay so people are

---------109:33----------
asking about being happy all the time
yeah so I think what happens is like

---------109:36----------
there's a state called enlightenment
which is something that people who

---------109:39----------
meditate very regularly do like I mean
very few people have attained

---------109:43----------
enlightenment but enlightenment is sort
of like this background level of like

---------109:47----------
peace and calm which you can cultivate
over time which starts to affect like

---------109:53----------
the rest of your life so when you
meditate for a regular very regular

---------109:57----------
period of time there are some
neuroscience changes the most prominent

---------110:00----------
of which is probably frontal lobe
inhibition of your amygdala and limbic

---------110:04----------
system which okay which lets you just be
like more chilled out and yeah I was

---------110:21----------
restarting I was changing a server
because it I didn't want to but it kept

---------110:25----------
it in interrupting yeah it should be
good night yes so you told him what the

---------110:31----------
problem is so someone's asking you told
them what the problem was but how do you

---------110:34----------
fix it what do you think reckful what do
you think about what we talked about

---------110:37----------
today I I think you made it pretty
obvious I just pursue my purpose my

---------110:44----------
meaning there was a word you kept Dharma
d-h Dharma yeah is that okay

---------110:51----------
I think that's part of it and I think
the other thing is that that I think

---------110:54----------
hopefully
reckful you understand that like this

---------110:57----------
has a root somewhere inside you and I
think we got pretty close to the root

---------111:02----------
today which is why you had sort of this
powerful kind of experience and just

---------111:07----------
understanding that there's a route to
like your suffering and understanding

---------111:12----------
that that route is legitimate right you
didn't just get sure you may have gotten

---------111:16----------
the short straw in life in terms of
having a family history of depression

---------111:19----------
and having like a biological
predisposition but ultimately I think a

---------111:23----------
lot of your suffering or your lack of
meaning like started at a particular

---------111:27----------
point and that understanding can
actually be like the first step of a

---------111:31----------
very important journey and I don't know
exactly where that journey leads I say

---------111:35----------
if you have a therapist you can work
with them otherwise I mean I think

---------111:38----------
reckful I have faith in you just that
through reflection and through work and

---------111:43----------
if you start meditating regularly you're
gonna understand this on your own

---------111:46----------
without anyone's help
although help will accelerate the

---------111:49----------
process but I mean I think just
continued I like to yeah I think I think

---------111:56----------
you've accomplished amazing things and
that you will continue to do so and that

---------112:00----------
when you put your mind to something it
sounds like you're pretty fucking good

---------112:02----------
at it so I think this is just what you
need to turn your mind to when you're

---------112:06----------
ready to write Thanks
thanks for today by the way thanks for

---------112:12----------
coming on I really appreciate this cause
yeah there was uh this was a this one

---------112:21----------
day was a important moment in my life
and thank you thank you for letting me

---------112:26----------
do my Dharma this is why I do what I do
man and now you go do what you need to

---------112:31----------
do and go eat something first okay yeah
thanks a lot

---------112:36----------
oh I'll see you uh yeah oh you got a lot
of hearts in the chest yeah let me just

---------112:45----------
switch this but thank you very much okay
