today's conversation there's a there's a


---------00:01----------
lot to learn from today's conversation


---------00:03----------
the first thing that i want to talk a


---------00:04----------
little bit about


---------00:05----------
is inappropriate affect and so sometimes


---------00:08----------
like over the course of today people may


---------00:10----------
notice that


---------00:11----------
you know there's like it feels kind of


---------00:13----------
weird as they're watching the


---------00:14----------
interaction


---------00:15----------
and that just tells you that there's


---------00:16----------
like some parts of your brain that are


---------00:18----------
able to like


---------00:19----------
clue in and like something's not adding


---------00:21----------
up here


---------00:22----------
and so we'll we'll really see like this


---------00:25----------
connection between


---------00:26----------
inappropriate affect and like suppressed


---------00:27----------
emotions and that the more you


---------00:30----------
familiarize yourself with this the more


---------00:32----------
that you dig into this like that's where


---------00:33----------
there's stuff underneath


---------00:34----------
also really a great exploration of of


---------00:37----------
psychological defense mechanisms


---------00:38----------
because we see them all in action and at


---------00:40----------
the end of the day


---------00:41----------
you know someone was kind enough to come


---------00:43----------
on and share


---------00:45----------
their experience of growing up in a cult


---------00:50----------
welcome buddy hey nice over here


---------00:54----------
um so and what's your name what do you


---------00:55----------
go by uh you can call me zorian


---------00:58----------
missourian okay welcome zorian


---------01:01----------
and so i i didn't realize this until i


---------01:04----------
you know hit the go live button on


---------01:06----------
stream but apparently we're gonna be


---------01:07----------
you're you were a


---------01:08----------
member of a cult before yes i was a


---------01:11----------
cultist


---------01:12----------
okay oh a cultist so that that sounds


---------01:15----------
like


---------01:15----------
that sounds like a class you know it


---------01:18----------
makes it sound fancier right


---------01:19----------
yeah and and um people are curious are


---------01:23----------
you're a cultist of of our cult or a


---------01:25----------
different cult


---------01:27----------

---------01:34----------
oh


---------01:34----------
okay so


---------01:38----------
um is that what you want to talk about


---------01:39----------
today or you want to talk about


---------01:40----------
something else or


---------01:42----------
yes so we can talk about that and i was


---------01:44----------
thinking maybe


---------01:46----------
uh we can talk about the psychological


---------01:51----------
the harm it did to me i suppose like the


---------01:53----------
insecurities i have because i grew up in


---------01:55----------
that environment or


---------01:56----------
what happened after leaving yeah


---------02:00----------
zorin i would love to hear about that


---------02:02----------
and if there's some way that


---------02:03----------
that you know we can support you with


---------02:05----------
some of that stuff i'd


---------02:07----------
really love to try um so why don't we


---------02:09----------
start with um


---------02:10----------
you know kind of like how you joined


---------02:13----------
or actually let's start with like like


---------02:14----------
where you grew up and stuff like


---------02:16----------
you know okay so here's how i joined


---------02:19----------
i that's all was born


---------02:22----------
okay so tell us a little bit about you


---------02:25----------
know what


---------02:26----------
growing up was third third generation


---------02:28----------
third


---------02:29----------
okay wow like my parents were already in


---------02:32----------
the cold when i


---------02:33----------
when i joined okay when you were born


---------02:37----------
sure you can call it that okay and do


---------02:39----------
you feel comfortable telling us like


---------02:41----------
what the cult


---------02:41----------
was or is that something you want to you


---------02:43----------
know we don't want to do anything that


---------02:44----------
will


---------02:45----------
get you in trouble or anything like that


---------02:48----------
it's not a big deal okay yeah so what


---------02:51----------
can you tell us about the


---------02:52----------
like what growing up was like in the


---------02:54----------
cult


---------02:56----------
yes so you asked earlier what the cult


---------02:59----------
was about


---------03:00----------
did you okay sure so


---------03:04----------
it's it was a sex cult okay the leader


---------03:06----------
was a pedophile


---------03:08----------
okay oh god yes


---------03:11----------
what does that mean it was a sex cult


---------03:13----------
like what is the


---------03:16----------
okay so the cult had a tradition


---------03:20----------
of free sex okay


---------03:24----------
and uh the idea was there was a


---------03:27----------
tradition called


---------03:28----------
flirty fishing where women


---------03:31----------
would give like they would prostitute


---------03:34----------
themselves


---------03:35----------
to gain converts to gain comforts


---------03:39----------
converts to converts okay okay


---------03:42----------
conversions yeah


---------03:43----------
yeah and and like so is this like an


---------03:45----------
organization or what like how does


---------03:47----------
this it's called the family


---------03:49----------
international


---------03:51----------
the fourth or the children of god have


---------03:52----------
you heard of it and


---------03:54----------
no but what is that does that sound like


---------03:56----------
a call dude


---------03:57----------
the family internet it up oh wikipedia


---------04:00----------
look it up


---------04:01----------
okay sometime so can you tell us zorian


---------04:04----------
a little bit about like you know


---------04:05----------
what tell us maybe a little bit about


---------04:07----------
your parents and


---------04:08----------
and what it was like living with them


---------04:10----------
growing up


---------04:12----------
sure so i had a


---------04:15----------
kind of a unique situation uh even


---------04:17----------
inside the cult because my parents


---------04:20----------
were missionaries for the cult okay


---------04:24----------
uh they what they would do is they would


---------04:27----------
go around from city to city


---------04:29----------
proselytizing okay yeah


---------04:33----------
and as a result life growing up was


---------04:39----------
we would resettle every 18 to 24 months


---------04:43----------
okay new house new home new neighborhood


---------04:45----------
a new city


---------04:46----------
different country etc and and how would


---------04:49----------
they


---------04:50----------
proselytize


---------04:54----------
so we would go out


---------04:58----------
and let me see if i can remember exactly


---------05:02----------
so


---------05:03----------
we would get people interested about the


---------05:05----------
cold like maybe


---------05:07----------
try to shame them or guilt-trip and


---------05:09----------
guilt-trip them


---------05:10----------
into their negative habits


---------05:14----------
and then they would we would tell them


---------05:16----------
about jesus


---------05:18----------
right and we would get them to


---------05:22----------
say a prayer and then we would like


---------05:26----------
my parents how they did it was


---------05:30----------
from what i recall vaguely they did a


---------05:33----------
sales pitch


---------05:34----------
on the the cult i think


---------05:38----------
okay and just getting people to join


---------05:40----------
that was the idea um


---------05:42----------
so zorian can we actually take a step


---------05:43----------
back from the cult for a minute and like


---------05:45----------
just what was it


---------05:46----------
like growing up for you like were you in


---------05:49----------
school


---------05:49----------
and like siblings i was i was


---------05:55----------
i was homeschooled a lot okay so


---------05:58----------
and social interaction was limited


---------06:01----------
for example no no like i had no access


---------06:05----------
to books


---------06:06----------
no accident like unsaid there was heavy


---------06:09----------
sensors censorship


---------06:10----------
no books no internet no music except


---------06:13----------
music designed by the cult


---------06:15----------
no magazines nothing nothing that could


---------06:18----------
harm the image


---------06:22----------
in our heads of the cult and what was


---------06:25----------
the


---------06:25----------
clue what was the image that you grew up


---------06:28----------
with of the cult


---------06:30----------
um so i felt like we were the chosen


---------06:33----------
ones


---------06:34----------
okay can you tell me a little bit about


---------06:36----------
that yeah sure so


---------06:39----------
so let's see so the cult was rife with


---------06:42----------
conspiracy theories


---------06:46----------
like there was this this idea that the


---------06:49----------
illuminati


---------06:50----------
was pulling the world strings and that


---------06:53----------
the system


---------06:54----------
anything outside the cult was evil


---------06:57----------
right kind of scare us from trying to um


---------07:02----------
access outside information right


---------07:05----------
okay and they try to instill


---------07:09----------
a sense of superiority in us


---------07:12----------
to try and push non-believers away so


---------07:16----------
that we wouldn't get contaminated


---------07:19----------
right that's that's my analysis


---------07:22----------
yeah and and so if you if your parents


---------07:25----------
move to a new city like i'm curious when


---------07:27----------
you're like eight years old


---------07:28----------
and you don't go to school and you're


---------07:31----------
not given access to books or the


---------07:32----------
internet like literally how would you


---------07:34----------
spend your day


---------07:35----------
like what so that's interesting when i


---------07:38----------
was um


---------07:42----------
so let's be let's be


---------07:46----------
a little bit more into details so i went


---------07:49----------
to a regular school


---------07:50----------
second grade and third grade okay and


---------07:52----------
then from fourth grade up


---------07:54----------
my parents decided to homeschool me


---------07:56----------
completely because uh


---------07:58----------
i don't know what the reason was


---------08:00----------
actually i think i begged


---------08:01----------
i begged them to homeschool me


---------08:05----------
maybe that was my fault um


---------08:09----------
do you remember how you felt when you


---------08:11----------
begged them


---------08:12----------
yes so i was constantly bullied okay


---------08:17----------
and um so i had okay


---------08:20----------
so i the reason why i backed them to


---------08:22----------
homeless homes homeschooled me was


---------08:24----------
because before second grade they were


---------08:26----------
already homeschooling i see oh


---------08:29----------
so so they were homeschooling you then


---------08:31----------
you went to second grade and


---------08:32----------
do you have a sense of why you got


---------08:34----------
bullied


---------08:37----------
i was


---------08:42----------
so it's very very long time back but


---------08:46----------
a lot of times people don't remember no


---------08:50----------
i think it was uh i had a sense of being


---------08:53----------
holier than you


---------08:55----------
okay so so it was sort of like a


---------08:57----------
superiority kind of thing that was baked


---------08:58----------
into you


---------09:00----------
okay and then yeah so once you started


---------09:03----------
getting homeschooled then what was that


---------09:05----------
what were your days like i would


---------09:08----------
receive classes in the morning i guess


---------09:11----------
oh yeah so there's there was this thing


---------09:13----------
um this horrible horrible tradition


---------09:16----------
so i hate it absolutely called


---------09:18----------
devotionals


---------09:20----------
which is like um


---------09:24----------
mandated brainwashing


---------09:28----------
uh routine activities


---------09:32----------
shall we call it like okay so my parents


---------09:36----------
would gather us children


---------09:39----------
for um a time of


---------09:42----------
prayer you could say you could call them


---------09:45----------
and we'll read the bible we will read


---------09:50----------
materials like written or published by


---------09:53----------
the cult


---------09:54----------
uh would listen to music we would pray


---------09:58----------
we would do stuff like that memorize


---------10:01----------
bible verses that kind of stuff


---------10:02----------
okay we're listening to music designed


---------10:05----------
by the cult


---------10:06----------
and how long would those devotionals


---------10:08----------
last like


---------10:10----------
anywhere from one to two hours okay so


---------10:13----------
you would do that every day and so it


---------10:14----------
sounds like you're


---------10:15----------
you were also learning like mathematics


---------10:17----------
and how to read and things like that


---------10:19----------
yes yes and so


---------10:23----------
i it's kind of an unusual circumstance


---------10:26----------
because i was


---------10:28----------
taught i guess


---------10:31----------
these things um from a very early age


---------10:35----------
like my parents


---------10:36----------
believed in education which was abnormal


---------10:39----------
for the cult


---------10:43----------
so i was taught to read and write in two


---------10:46----------
languages from the age of two


---------10:48----------
i was taught early math i was taught


---------10:51----------
uh geography i was


---------10:55----------
taught from earlier age okay


---------10:58----------
and then what were things like as you


---------11:00----------
grew a little bit older like let's say


---------11:01----------
12 13


---------11:02----------
15 17. so so


---------11:06----------
actually before we go into the


---------11:08----------
adolescent period yeah


---------11:09----------
i would also my parents would take me


---------11:12----------
proselytizing like


---------11:15----------
yeah it's fine that's hard you have to


---------11:16----------
pronounce that but


---------11:18----------
i i have this vivid memory of me


---------11:21----------
going like up to people


---------11:26----------
and converting them to the cult


---------11:31----------
how would you do that i was i was like


---------11:35----------
six or seven years old and they


---------11:38----------
basically


---------11:38----------
used my cuteness my because


---------11:42----------
children are cute right they you give


---------11:44----------
you're more likely to give a


---------11:46----------
child a chance yeah sure than an adult


---------11:49----------
yep right so they would use me as a tool


---------11:52----------
sometimes


---------11:53----------
to convert people and i had


---------11:56----------
like i had a like a little speech


---------11:58----------
memorized


---------12:00----------
that i would do and people would fall


---------12:01----------
for it it was


---------12:03----------
do you remember what the speech was or


---------12:04----------
like pieces of it


---------12:11----------
oh let me see and you know sorry you


---------12:14----------
don't have to share anything that you


---------12:15----------
don't feel comfortable with


---------12:16----------
it's just i'm i'm so curious about you


---------12:18----------
know what


---------12:19----------
what do you teach a seven-year-old to


---------12:22----------
say


---------12:23----------
to convert people to your


---------12:27----------
so uh the facade


---------12:31----------
seemed very harmless right uh


---------12:35----------
even to outsiders i would basically pray


---------12:39----------
with them


---------12:39----------
and they would i would recite a prayer


---------12:43----------
and like i would convince people to


---------12:46----------
say a prayer with me


---------12:49----------
and i don't remember the exact words but


---------12:51----------
it was something like jesus coming to my


---------12:53----------
heart forgive me for my sins that kind


---------12:55----------
of [ __ ]


---------12:55----------
okay and then and


---------12:59----------
wow okay so


---------13:02----------
and then maybe what my parents would


---------13:04----------
take over and explain


---------13:06----------
stuff and a little and stuff i couldn't


---------13:08----------
comprehend yet


---------13:09----------
okay what country were you in if you


---------13:11----------
don't mind me asking


---------13:12----------
i think so at the time of this anecdote


---------13:15----------
i think i was in peru


---------13:17----------
okay all right and and so


---------13:20----------
you know what what happened is you kind


---------13:22----------
of grew up and hit adolescence


---------13:25----------
what was that period of your life like


---------13:29----------
okay so let's see i was very very


---------13:32----------
convinced that i wanted to spend the


---------13:33----------
rest of my life


---------13:34----------
in the school okay um


---------13:37----------
we were taught that we were the chosen


---------13:39----------
ones and


---------13:41----------
there were all sorts of like wacky


---------13:42----------
things going on for example


---------13:45----------
a lot of the lore was based on


---------13:52----------
okay are you familiar with the bible


---------13:54----------
yeah


---------13:56----------
there's a book at the end called


---------13:57----------
revelations yeah very familiar with it


---------13:59----------
a lot of the stuff came from


---------14:03----------
that chapter or that book in the bible


---------14:07----------
um it was very we were our group was the


---------14:11----------
chosen one


---------14:12----------
and there was gonna be a lot a period of


---------14:15----------
seven years


---------14:16----------
before the end of the world as we know


---------14:19----------
and


---------14:21----------
the anti-antichrist was gonna take over


---------14:24----------
from like uh


---------14:25----------
the illuminati and whatever [ __ ]


---------14:28----------
they were experiencing


---------14:29----------
and our group would have special powers


---------14:32----------
to attack or defend against


---------14:35----------
uh who like the antichrist or whoever


---------14:38----------
was on top right


---------14:40----------
and there were like doomsday prophecies


---------14:42----------
and that


---------14:43----------
we were living like one of the phrases


---------14:45----------
that was most commonly repeated was


---------14:47----------
we are living in the times of the end


---------14:53----------
right yeah wow okay


---------14:58----------
so things i've heard from god zorian so


---------15:00----------
i i'm


---------15:01----------
so sometimes you know i'll ask people a


---------15:02----------
little bit about growing up in their


---------15:04----------
adolescence and things like that


---------15:06----------
and and i'm kind of noticing that i


---------15:08----------
don't know


---------15:10----------
it's interesting i it seems like


---------15:13----------
sometimes when i ask you questions about


---------15:15----------
time


---------15:16----------
it's like hard for you to put together


---------15:18----------
like sort of a timeline


---------15:21----------
and and i mean is that i'm not trying to


---------15:24----------
you know shame you or anything it's just


---------15:26----------
an interesting observation that i'm i'm


---------15:28----------
wondering if actually like


---------15:29----------
your experience of growing up was not


---------15:32----------
like


---------15:32----------
marked by like landmarks of change


---------15:37----------
it seems to like oh it feels to me like


---------15:39----------
it all kind of blurs together


---------15:41----------
yes right and it's also the fact that


---------15:44----------
i've been trying to forget most of these


---------15:46----------
things


---------15:47----------
for the last 10 years sure okay


---------15:50----------
like after i left at the age of 18. i


---------15:52----------
felt like i left


---------15:54----------
and how did that happen my parents


---------15:58----------
i love them deeply they


---------16:02----------
my dad had this policy that after you're


---------16:06----------
18


---------16:06----------
you can do whatever whatever the [ __ ]


---------16:08----------
you want


---------16:10----------
right okay


---------16:13----------
so at close around the age of 17 i was


---------16:17----------
already getting fed up with the [ __ ]


---------16:19----------
what is that what [ __ ] is that i was


---------16:22----------
starting to be aware uh


---------16:23----------
gain awareness that i was being


---------16:25----------
emotionally manipulated


---------16:27----------
and how are you being emotionally


---------16:28----------
manipulated


---------16:31----------
so son of stuff for example i was


---------16:35----------
uh forced to do chores


---------16:38----------
uh


---------16:42----------
based on the idea that


---------16:47----------
this is gonna sound completely stupid


---------16:49----------
and completely out of field but


---------16:53----------
it was it was a kind of god is watching


---------16:56----------
you


---------16:56----------
and taking notes right so if you fail to


---------17:00----------
do your chores


---------17:01----------
he's gonna take that as a sign of


---------17:03----------
rebellion or that maybe you


---------17:05----------
you can't go into heaven or that kind of


---------17:06----------
stuff


---------17:08----------
right that you're supposed to honor your


---------17:11----------
parents or honor your


---------17:12----------
your mother and father that kind of


---------17:14----------
stuff and it was


---------17:16----------
basically yeah it was coercion


---------17:20----------
and why do you think that that sounds


---------17:22----------
stupid


---------17:24----------
good question i have no idea okay so let


---------17:27----------
me ask


---------17:27----------
no no okay wait okay i remember now so


---------17:31----------
it sounds a bit it smells a bit like uh


---------17:34----------
entitlement you know like


---------17:36----------
i could have i suppose


---------17:39----------
no no it's like first world uh


---------17:44----------
cold life you know like


---------17:48----------
worse things could have happened to me


---------17:50----------
than being coerced


---------17:52----------
to do my chores right


---------17:56----------
okay like i could have been coerced into


---------17:58----------
child prostitution for example which


---------18:00----------
did not happen to me thank god


---------18:03----------
yeah so i it's interesting i'm hearing


---------18:05----------
some


---------18:06----------
you know a couple of things here so one


---------18:08----------
is like i wonder if you say it sounds


---------18:09----------
stupid because i i don't think it


---------18:11----------
it doesn't sound stupid to me at all it


---------18:12----------
sounds like you know you are in a cult


---------18:14----------
so of course you're going to be like


---------18:15----------
forced to do things that are


---------18:17----------
emotionally like you know based on


---------18:18----------
emotional minifigures yeah but it sounds


---------18:19----------
like a kind of an odd thing to complain


---------18:21----------
about like it's not such a big deal


---------18:22----------
right you're first forced to do tours so


---------18:24----------
what


---------18:26----------
yeah so i i think i feel like most


---------18:28----------
people would say gain some perspective


---------18:30----------
kid


---------18:32----------
yeah so i it gets me to my question is


---------18:34----------
do you feel stupid


---------18:36----------
no okay


---------18:40----------
and when you say most people would say


---------18:41----------
gain some perspective kid like what


---------18:46----------
you know that that sounds why do you


---------18:48----------
think people would say that


---------18:50----------
oh because i look at myself from the


---------18:51----------
outside and i try to


---------18:54----------
i see things objectively i guess


---------18:58----------
yeah so has when you've shared this


---------19:00----------
stuff with people on the outside has


---------19:01----------
anyone told you that


---------19:03----------
i've never shared it with anyone well oh


---------19:06----------
not this specific detail i haven't


---------19:07----------
shared it no


---------19:08----------
okay and because i


---------19:11----------
you know i know it's this is going to


---------19:12----------
sound kind of weird saurian but i think


---------19:14----------
that your attempts to be objective are


---------19:16----------
actually the most subjective thing that


---------19:18----------
you do


---------19:19----------
completely you're right you know and


---------19:21----------
it's interesting because when you when


---------19:22----------
you talk when you


---------19:23----------
think about like i want to just like


---------19:25----------
notice and like


---------19:27----------
okay so so it's not objectivity it's


---------19:29----------
subjectivity


---------19:31----------
from a second point of view yep so i


---------19:34----------
think that's the view with which you


---------19:36----------
judge yourself


---------19:37----------
it's you judging yourself on the outside


---------19:39----------
because i don't think that like at least


---------19:41----------
i mean i could be wrong here and i'm not


---------19:43----------
really paying attention to twitch chat


---------19:44----------
but like


---------19:45----------
at least i'm i'm sort of feeling very


---------19:47----------
very strongly that like i don't


---------19:48----------
fault you for anything that happened but


---------19:50----------
what i'm detecting from you is that like


---------19:52----------
maybe you beat yourself up a little bit


---------19:55----------
for like


---------19:56----------
falling for their emotional manipulation


---------19:58----------
and like who are you to complain because


---------20:02----------
you know other other people in the cult


---------20:03----------
got child prostitution and you got out


---------20:05----------
early and your parents taught you two


---------20:07----------
languages so like


---------20:08----------
who are you to complain


---------20:12----------
yeah okay so it sounds like i i fault


---------20:14----------
myself


---------20:15----------
or somehow blame myself for uh


---------20:18----------
being part of the cult yeah wasting my


---------20:20----------
time basically


---------20:21----------
yeah that's a good way to put it what do


---------20:23----------
you think no


---------20:26----------
okay uh and here's here's why here's my


---------20:28----------
my explanation


---------20:30----------
correct me if i'm wrong so


---------20:35----------
after the cold when i left i


---------20:38----------
felt a grave sense of loss


---------20:42----------
um i felt like my


---------20:46----------
most of my life or my entire life had


---------20:47----------
been stolen from stolen from me


---------20:49----------
yeah um and


---------20:53----------
uh i felt very very bitter i suppose you


---------20:56----------
could say


---------20:57----------
and when did you start to feel like it


---------20:59----------
had been stolen from you


---------21:02----------
right after i left okay


---------21:05----------
probably okay probably not the exact


---------21:08----------
same day i left


---------21:09----------
but in the next two years and


---------21:12----------
and so i mean it sounds like you left at


---------21:14----------
18. so you are unhappy


---------21:16----------
with like something about needing to do


---------21:17----------
chores and being guilted


---------21:19----------
how did you make the decision to leave


---------21:23----------
i don't know i suppose i just didn't


---------21:24----------
like being coerced


---------21:27----------
and i told when i was


---------21:30----------
on the on my 18th birthday i went


---------21:34----------
to my pastor i told them


---------21:38----------
i'm an atheist and i went to my


---------21:41----------
parents and i told them i'm an atheist


---------21:45----------
they accepted it so really


---------21:48----------
yes what did they say


---------21:53----------
well my dad was like you're 18. so do


---------21:57----------
whatever the [ __ ] you want


---------22:00----------
did he use the word [ __ ] there like was


---------22:02----------
he upset


---------22:03----------
probably not probably not no he wasn't


---------22:05----------
upset


---------22:08----------
but here's the thing i later discovered


---------22:10----------
that my parents had actually left the


---------22:11----------
cult when i was 15.


---------22:15----------
they were just continuing with the


---------22:17----------
culture i guess


---------22:19----------
uh of child rearing after they left


---------22:23----------
like they dumped all the books all the


---------22:25----------
cultist material aside


---------22:27----------
when i was 15 three years earlier but


---------22:29----------
they continued to use the same


---------22:30----------
manipulative


---------22:32----------
techniques they had learned from the


---------22:33----------
cult interesting


---------22:36----------
how do you understand i suppose that


---------22:38----------
played a role


---------22:39----------
in their accepting my leaving the cult


---------22:44----------
yeah because i mean it's it's strange


---------22:46----------
right when i think about you know


---------22:47----------
life i mean like multi-generation cults


---------22:50----------
like in a kid comes out at 18 and says


---------22:52----------
i'm leaving i i imagine based on you


---------22:56----------
know i don't really have any experience


---------22:57----------
with cults but


---------22:58----------
yes but you've read the stories right


---------23:00----------
yeah so i'd imagine that your parents


---------23:02----------
would like you know freak out i've


---------23:03----------
certainly


---------23:04----------
you know worked with people who have had


---------23:05----------
like very religious upbringings and they


---------23:07----------
sort of tell their parents hey like


---------23:09----------
you know i'm not really into this and


---------23:11----------
then their parents will like


---------23:12----------
flip out we'll ostracize them we'll like


---------23:16----------
you know like don't you understand what


---------23:17----------
you're doing to us


---------23:20----------
and to everyone around you like it's


---------23:22----------
such a bit like you know and i'm it's


---------23:24----------
kind of weird that your parents were


---------23:25----------
sort of okay with it


---------23:26----------
i consider myself lucky in the extreme


---------23:28----------
yes


---------23:29----------
yeah so you consider yourself lucky but


---------23:31----------
like what do you think about them


---------23:33----------
tossing out the books but still


---------23:34----------
continuing to do the emotional


---------23:35----------
manipulation


---------23:37----------
wow i mean my parents are a little bit


---------23:41----------
feel like they're simpletons


---------23:44----------
what does that mean like the reason for


---------23:47----------
leaving the cult


---------23:48----------
was dumb what was their reason for


---------23:52----------
feeling


---------23:52----------
leaving the cult i was


---------23:56----------
they received the sign from god did you


---------23:58----------
believe it


---------24:01----------
and what was their sign from god the


---------24:04----------
sign from god


---------24:05----------
was my younger sister got


---------24:08----------
sick to the point where she was


---------24:12----------
uh i'm not gonna share something oh sure


---------24:16----------
of course yeah um and and


---------24:19----------
why do you think she got my younger sis


---------24:21----------
got really really [ __ ] sick


---------24:22----------
and the cult had this tradition like


---------24:26----------
people inside the cult were taught that


---------24:29----------
if anything negative


---------24:30----------
happens to you it happens for a reason


---------24:33----------
right that god is punishing you in some


---------24:34----------
way


---------24:36----------
right if you got a cold god would be


---------24:39----------
punishing you


---------24:40----------
you had to pray and seek his guidance


---------24:44----------
right um and i think


---------24:47----------
that is where my mom got the idea that


---------24:51----------
she should leave the cult because my


---------24:52----------
sister was so [ __ ] sick


---------24:56----------
interesting and you think that that's a


---------24:58----------
stupid reason


---------25:00----------
yeah okay how do you feel about your


---------25:03----------
parents


---------25:05----------
i love them um


---------25:06----------
[Music]


---------25:09----------
i also think they're dumb sure are you


---------25:12----------
angry with them


---------25:14----------
so i was angry with them in the first


---------25:17----------
four years


---------25:18----------
and then i forgave them what were you


---------25:21----------
angry with them for


---------25:23----------
for having raised me in a cult that's a


---------25:26----------
damn good answer


---------25:29----------
well said and


---------25:32----------
and then how did you how did you find


---------25:35----------
how did you find the ability to forgive


---------25:37----------
them


---------25:38----------
i don't know i i do remember


---------25:42----------
what what's the mental process the


---------25:44----------
experience that led me to forgive them


---------25:46----------
so i think


---------25:50----------
i had an experience where


---------25:54----------
i started to see evidence that my hate


---------25:58----------
was ruining my life can you help us


---------26:01----------
understand that


---------26:02----------
okay so i was extremely bitter and


---------26:04----------
extremely angry


---------26:05----------
about everything that had happened


---------26:07----------
inside the cult


---------26:09----------
and like i felt like 18 years of my life


---------26:12----------
had been wasted


---------26:14----------
i lost most of the opportunities


---------26:18----------
to learn things and


---------26:23----------
i felt like most of it had been coerced


---------26:25----------
like ed it was not my fault


---------26:29----------
and i remember going on a date with a


---------26:32----------
chick


---------26:35----------
and she noticed


---------26:38----------
that i was very hateful inside and uh i


---------26:41----------
think i think


---------26:43----------
the sign of it was i attacked


---------26:47----------
uh an indigenous person


---------26:51----------
that was selling trying to sell candy to


---------26:53----------
me on the street


---------26:55----------
and i attacked them and i told them


---------26:58----------
to go kill themselves


---------27:01----------
right and my date was like no you can't


---------27:04----------
do that just


---------27:06----------
stop we're we're done the date is over


---------27:09----------
right


---------27:10----------
and then i went back to my place


---------27:13----------
i spent the entire night in reflection


---------27:17----------
and then i came to realize my conclusion


---------27:19----------
was


---------27:20----------
my hate is ruining my life


---------27:24----------
right so i did a 180


---------27:28----------
and first things i did forgive my


---------27:30----------
parents i told


---------27:31----------
my parents i forgive or gave them and


---------27:33----------
then i


---------27:34----------
tried i started


---------27:39----------
i started trying altruism


---------27:44----------
or helping people with no strings


---------27:46----------
attached provided they


---------27:48----------
didn't ask for my help


---------27:51----------
okay and what was your experience of


---------27:53----------
that


---------27:58----------
[Music]


---------28:00----------
he became a pretty strong hell belief


---------28:02----------
until


---------28:03----------
like a few days ago


---------28:07----------
what happened a few days ago okay


---------28:10----------
someone


---------28:12----------
so there's this ego this ego what


---------28:17----------
construal what does that mean


---------28:22----------
so a construal is a symbol right


---------28:25----------
like a phrase okay and


---------28:29----------
it represents your ego okay


---------28:32----------
and you talk about this all the time


---------28:34----------
right ego uh


---------28:36----------
when eel conflicts with emotions ego


---------28:38----------
wins and when emotions conflict with


---------28:40----------
logic


---------28:41----------
emotions went right okay sure


---------28:44----------
and this altruism thing of helping


---------28:47----------
people with no strength attached was my


---------28:49----------
ego


---------28:50----------
and it was it was ruining my life


---------28:54----------
how so i was giving until i had nothing


---------28:57----------
to get


---------29:01----------
and a few weeks ago i started to hit


---------29:03----------
like rock bottom


---------29:04----------
rock bottom because i started sleeping


---------29:07----------
on the floor


---------29:07----------
because i just i couldn't help myself


---------29:10----------
but


---------29:12----------
just help people i guess


---------29:16----------
so what does that have to do with


---------29:18----------
sleeping on the floor


---------29:19----------
well sleeping on the floor is


---------29:20----------
uncomfortable i guess right


---------29:23----------
i have no i don't have enough money to


---------29:25----------
buy myself a mattress


---------29:26----------
okay and then but


---------29:30----------
i sort of settle into it i start to feel


---------29:32----------
comfortable or


---------29:34----------
what's what's not comfortable content i


---------29:36----------
have


---------29:37----------
i've learned contentment shall we say


---------29:41----------
do you find that you're more content


---------29:43----------
like the more you kind of deprive


---------29:45----------
yourself of stuff like does it feel


---------29:48----------
like perversely good to like help people


---------29:51----------
to the point where you don't have enough


---------29:52----------
money to buy a mattress


---------29:54----------
yes or not enough money to pay the bills


---------29:57----------
and stuff like that


---------30:00----------
and then


---------30:04----------
a friend recently uh


---------30:09----------
argued me out of that value or that ego


---------30:14----------
like he made an art he presented a


---------30:16----------
logical argument


---------30:18----------
that my ego control was unethical


---------30:25----------
that by helping people


---------30:29----------
until i have nothing to give i'm


---------30:31----------
actually helping


---------30:33----------
bad people gain power


---------30:36----------
because i'm losing power by helping


---------30:38----------
others


---------30:40----------
interesting so so not the person that


---------30:43----------
you're helping but some other


---------30:45----------
the more the less power you have


---------30:48----------
if i yes if i start to help to a point


---------30:51----------
where i'm losing


---------30:52----------
power then i'm not i'm


---------30:55----------
[Music]


---------30:57----------
i'm not making as much of as of an


---------31:00----------
impact as i possibly could


---------31:01----------
sure sure right yeah


---------31:05----------
and he argued it was unethical


---------31:08----------
and so i mean you're sort of saying that


---------31:10----------
a logical argument kind of brought you


---------31:12----------
out of this so what's going on with your


---------31:14----------
ego


---------31:15----------
yeah so i have uh that that's


---------31:18----------
interesting that's interesting i


---------31:20----------
have an ego that says i must have a


---------31:22----------
logical explanation for everything i do


---------31:26----------
okay so this is how


---------31:30----------
logic trump's emotion okay in my case


---------31:34----------
because my it's my ego


---------31:37----------
how do you feel about being so


---------31:38----------
altruistic


---------31:43----------
that feels good i guess but


---------31:49----------
no it's that's irrelevant um


---------31:52----------
how do i feel about being so altruistic


---------31:55----------
that's a good question


---------31:57----------
i'm not sure zorian do you feel stupid


---------32:02----------
for being so altruistic


---------32:06----------
yes yes i beat myself up for it yep


---------32:10----------
we noticing a theme here


---------32:13----------
i beat myself up for things yes


---------32:15----------
definitely all the time yeah absolutely


---------32:17----------
right


---------32:17----------
and i know where it comes from i can


---------32:19----------
tell you i know you i know you do so


---------32:20----------
tell me


---------32:23----------
so i am afraid


---------32:26----------
of opportunity cost


---------32:30----------
okay opportunity cost


---------32:35----------
drives terror to me


---------32:38----------
yep i think that makes a lot yeah


---------32:43----------
and can you see where that comes from


---------32:47----------
sure what's your name


---------32:52----------
um you're sure you want me to answer


---------32:55----------
first


---------32:58----------
okay i was making i was like i'm happy


---------33:00----------
to


---------33:01----------
but but i i think that we'll learn more


---------33:04----------
from you than we will from me okay fair


---------33:06----------
enough


---------33:06----------
you're absolutely right this is an


---------33:08----------
education session so


---------33:13----------
hold on pause for a second zorian let's


---------33:15----------
think about what's happening right now


---------33:18----------
i'm happy to give you an answer it makes


---------33:19----------
a lot of sense to me that you're


---------33:21----------
terrified of opportunity


---------33:23----------
um and and


---------33:26----------
i'm happy to share what i think about


---------33:28----------
that but


---------33:30----------
i just want to make sure that it felt


---------33:32----------
like you've never you never asked me


---------33:34----------
before like we've been talking about a


---------33:35----------
lot of stuff


---------33:36----------
this is the first time that you're like


---------33:37----------
asking me about something


---------33:40----------
so i almost feel like it's a test of


---------33:42----------
sorts


---------33:43----------
and i'm happy to take the test and pass


---------33:45----------
her no no it's not it's not a test it's


---------33:47----------
not a test i have a


---------33:48----------
habit of asking people to make an


---------33:50----------
educated guess about things because i'm


---------33:52----------
a teacher


---------33:53----------
okay do you want to teach me i can guess


---------33:57----------
no okay okay


---------34:01----------
my fear of opportunity cost comes


---------34:04----------
from my parents moving around


---------34:07----------
a lot when i was a kid how so


---------34:12----------
when i was very very young let's say


---------34:14----------
nine to ten years old


---------34:16----------
i would go out into the neighborhood and


---------34:19----------
make friends with


---------34:21----------
kids and i would go


---------34:25----------
i would grow kind of attached to the


---------34:26----------
neighborhood


---------34:28----------
and then my parents would move and that


---------34:31----------
was


---------34:32----------
unpleasant it was it meant losing my


---------34:35----------
friends


---------34:36----------
forever right


---------34:39----------
that was like irreversible and bad


---------34:46----------
so i because this happened so often


---------34:50----------
i started to pay attention


---------34:54----------
to any signs that we might be moving


---------34:57----------
okay and my parents could be planning a


---------35:00----------
move


---------35:01----------
okay and when that happened i felt


---------35:04----------
afraid


---------35:05----------
okay yeah so what i would say


---------35:09----------
um zorian can i share my answer


---------35:12----------
sure so i think it's similar but i think


---------35:14----------
that when you say you're terrified


---------35:16----------
of opportunity costs i i think it's more


---------35:18----------
of like what i would


---------35:19----------
sort of detect from that is like a sense


---------35:21----------
of grief and loss really not


---------35:23----------
really grief but more loss that you've


---------35:25----------
had you've you've had so much taken away


---------35:28----------
from you


---------35:29----------
that like everything that you do like


---------35:32----------
it's almost like you've had


---------35:33----------
so much taken away from you that like


---------35:35----------
you don't really


---------35:37----------
like you like every decision that you


---------35:39----------
make now like has to be weighed very


---------35:42----------
very heavily


---------35:43----------
because it's sort of like you've already


---------35:45----------
used up


---------35:46----------
all of your freebies and so like you


---------35:49----------
know you're on the verge of getting


---------35:51----------
knocked out of the tournament


---------35:52----------
like every single time like every


---------35:54----------
decision you make is like the last


---------35:56----------
decision that you get to make and if you


---------35:58----------
screw


---------35:58----------
up i'm terrified of irreversible


---------36:01----------
mistakes yep right


---------36:05----------
and and so so so i want to just point


---------36:07----------
something out zorin so i i think that


---------36:10----------
do do you have a sense of how you're


---------36:12----------
feeling right now


---------36:14----------
no okay


---------36:17----------
so uh um


---------36:20----------
something like some people might call


---------36:22----------
this alexa plymouth when i was


---------36:24----------
uh what i remember when i was like


---------36:28----------
around 17 18 19


---------36:32----------
i felt like i was a robot


---------36:35----------
i felt like i had no feelings


---------36:38----------
it was weird um


---------36:41----------
but then over time as i reflected a lot


---------36:45----------
i came to realize that i do have


---------36:47----------
emotions they're just


---------36:48----------
kind of identifying them becomes


---------36:52----------
it's a little bit [ __ ] it takes time


---------36:56----------
okay so how how do you feel about that


---------37:02----------
don't ask me i


---------37:04----------
[Laughter]


---------37:06----------
okay so how do i feel


---------37:09----------
about so what hold on so we just got


---------37:12----------
something there right you say don't ask


---------37:14----------
me


---------37:15----------
right so when i ask you how does that


---------37:17----------
make you feel


---------37:19----------
i don't have information yep so when


---------37:22----------
someone get your teacher right so when


---------37:24----------
someone asks a question and and someone


---------37:27----------
doesn't have an answer how does that


---------37:28----------
person feel


---------37:32----------
wait wait wait can you say that again


---------37:34----------
sure so you're a teacher right


---------37:37----------
yes so when someone asks a question and


---------37:39----------
someone else


---------37:40----------
doesn't have an answer how does the


---------37:42----------
person without the answer feel


---------37:46----------
so when a student asks me a question


---------37:48----------
nope


---------37:50----------
sure just in general when when i ask


---------37:52----------
when there's a


---------37:53----------
someone who asks a question and someone


---------37:55----------
doesn't have an answer how does the


---------37:56----------
person without the answer feel


---------38:04----------
who is the person without an answer the


---------38:06----------
person who asked or the person who


---------38:07----------
doesn't have an


---------38:08----------
answer have the answer to respond the


---------38:10----------
have doesn't have the answer to respond


---------38:14----------
i don't know so i would say that when


---------38:17----------
people ask me questions especially when


---------38:19----------
i'm like


---------38:20----------
you know in school and i didn't have an


---------38:21----------
answer i felt stupid


---------38:24----------
oh okay what do you think


---------38:29----------
i don't have an answer no


---------38:32----------
i don't feel stupid for being ignorant


---------38:35----------
okay


---------38:36----------
so i think this is what's kind of


---------38:38----------
confusing so here's here's what i'm sort


---------38:40----------
of


---------38:40----------
getting from you can i share some


---------38:42----------
thoughts what sure


---------38:44----------
you're laughing


---------38:48----------
what what is that


---------38:52----------
i don't know so if you look at necessary


---------38:55----------
conditions for laughter


---------38:57----------
unexpected comes to mind


---------39:00----------
and it needs to be


---------39:04----------
i don't know


---------39:09----------
so it needs to be something unexpected


---------39:11----------
that is seen as


---------39:12----------
not not harmful yeah okay so sorry we're


---------39:15----------
going to take a step back because i


---------39:16----------
think there's a lot of stuff going on in


---------39:18----------
this conversation


---------39:19----------
that i think can be hard to follow so


---------39:21----------
we're going to try to i'm going to try


---------39:22----------
to share with you what i understand okay


---------39:25----------
i could be completely wrong here um


---------39:28----------
so there there's some weird there's some


---------39:30----------
weirdness


---------39:32----------
and i i get the sense that you're


---------39:33----------
smiling but you actually are feeling


---------39:35----------
deeply deeply uncomfortable


---------39:37----------
what do you think i don't feel anxiety


---------39:40----------
i'm not yeah so i i like when i look at


---------39:43----------
your eyes i don't think you're having a


---------39:45----------
good time


---------39:46----------
like when i look at your face i see you


---------39:48----------
smiling


---------39:49----------
but i see a lot of tension but i really


---------39:52----------
don't think that this is


---------39:53----------
normally when we see someone smiling


---------39:54----------
like this we think like oh is this


---------39:56----------
person having fun


---------39:57----------
i don't think you're having fun are you


---------39:59----------
having fun


---------40:01----------
okay so it's a feeling of euphoria do


---------40:04----------
you feel euphoria right now


---------40:07----------
peony kind of genie okay so when we have


---------40:10----------
a big smile and we feel a tiny bit of


---------40:12----------
euphoria i think there are other


---------40:13----------
emotions in there


---------40:15----------
and part of what makes this really yeah


---------40:17----------
so


---------40:18----------
so i'm just going to toss a couple of


---------40:19----------
things out the first zorian is that


---------40:21----------
because i think it's like really


---------40:24----------
how can i i was about to say strange but


---------40:27----------
i think


---------40:29----------
there's a lot going on in this


---------40:30----------
conversation that is not being talked


---------40:32----------
about


---------40:33----------
so it's sort of like there's like a


---------40:35----------
stage but then there's like this whole


---------40:37----------
audience on the outside that we're not


---------40:39----------
really addressing


---------40:40----------
and i think that's part of what is is a


---------40:43----------
little bit unusual about this


---------40:44----------
conversation


---------40:45----------
because i think you have a lot of stuff


---------40:47----------
going on on the inside which you've done


---------40:49----------
such an amazing job


---------40:51----------
of keeping at the borders of like your


---------40:54----------
consciousness


---------40:56----------
so i know it sounds weird so the first


---------40:57----------
thing that i want to do zorian is like


---------40:59----------
really commend you


---------41:00----------
um because i i think that you've really


---------41:03----------
shown


---------41:04----------
to me so like i know that you know there


---------41:06----------
are all kinds of psychological impacts


---------41:07----------
from cults and stuff like that but


---------41:09----------
i think it's really hard to grow up in a


---------41:11----------
cult and like have


---------41:13----------
you know the fortitude to leave when


---------41:14----------
you're 18


---------41:16----------
to notice some of the impacts that it's


---------41:17----------
had on you to really because like like


---------41:19----------
it's because if we really think about it


---------41:21----------
like you know you kind of


---------41:22----------
got screwed and you have to be a little


---------41:24----------
bit careful about your self-judgment in


---------41:26----------
terms of like you know if you look at


---------41:27----------
like the average person they were given


---------41:29----------
so many opportunities like


---------41:31----------
you know people read them bedtime


---------41:33----------
stories like their parents read the


---------41:34----------
bedtime stories like their parents would


---------41:36----------
go on trips


---------41:37----------
and you got to like there was just


---------41:39----------
really basic stuff right like


---------41:41----------
most people get the opportunity to make


---------41:44----------
friends and keep friends and really


---------41:47----------
really like


---------41:48----------
basic human stuff that was really taken


---------41:50----------
away from you at a young age


---------41:53----------
and and so i'm sure that there's a part


---------41:55----------
of you so i think there's this like


---------41:56----------
thread


---------41:57----------
of like stupidity and judgmentalness


---------42:00----------
which you have towards yourself which


---------42:01----------
you try to push away through logic


---------42:04----------
but the interesting thing is that when


---------42:05----------
you talk about the construction between


---------42:07----------
like logic overcoming emotion


---------42:10----------
that still means that the emotion is


---------42:11----------
there your logic may win


---------42:14----------
but like really i think moving forward


---------42:16----------
is like sure


---------42:17----------
like logic needs to win like let's say


---------42:19----------
it's 51 49


---------42:21----------
but then you're still like even if you


---------42:22----------
can overcome that feeling of stupidity


---------42:24----------
what i think really like


---------42:26----------
what i what i what i see is like the


---------42:28----------
next step of your growth


---------42:30----------
is not letting logic win but not having


---------42:33----------
logic


---------42:33----------
need to win right it's really truly


---------42:37----------
letting go of some of these things like


---------42:38----------
ego and emotions and stuff like that


---------42:41----------
and you're even doing it now right so


---------42:42----------
there's been a change a little bit


---------42:44----------
in in the way that you're kind of


---------42:45----------
looking there's a change in the way like


---------42:47----------
you seem more relaxed


---------42:49----------
i don't know exactly what's going on but


---------42:50----------
i just noticed you had like a big sigh


---------42:52----------
which i think is good yes


---------42:54----------
so i think you've managed to it's


---------42:56----------
interesting because i think you've like


---------42:58----------
been forced to come up with your own


---------43:01----------
methods of survival in recovery


---------43:05----------
of trying to build a life out of the


---------43:07----------
shambles that you were given


---------43:10----------
and i think everything i have i invented


---------43:12----------
on my own absolutely


---------43:13----------
and i think it's it's truly amazing that


---------43:15----------
you've come as far as you have


---------43:18----------
and at the same time i think that you


---------43:21----------
know a little help will go a long way


---------43:24----------
and and that there are some things that


---------43:25----------
i think it's worth sort of


---------43:27----------
re-conceptualize or like rethinking and


---------43:29----------
i think i feel really good about this


---------43:30----------
because i think you


---------43:32----------
you've demonstrated so clearly that if


---------43:33----------
you're given building blocks you can


---------43:35----------
really build something


---------43:36----------
so really what i want to do is not


---------43:37----------
really give you answers but give you


---------43:39----------
kind of building blocks let you play


---------43:40----------
around with them and let you see if


---------43:42----------
things are going better okay that's all


---------43:44----------
nice


---------43:45----------
um so the first thing is that i think


---------43:47----------
we're seeing a lot of what calls in


---------43:50----------
what what i would call inappropriate


---------43:51----------
affect or discongruent affect


---------43:54----------
so the display of emotion that you have


---------43:56----------
is kind of like


---------43:58----------
not doesn't jive with like what we're


---------44:01----------
actually talking about


---------44:02----------
really right so yeah right because


---------44:04----------
you're like smiling a whole lot


---------44:07----------
but like we're not talking about


---------44:09----------
anything funnies organ


---------44:11----------
nothing happens to me it's funny to me


---------44:14----------
yeah so


---------44:15----------
let's think about that right so so and


---------44:17----------
this is what sometimes i think


---------44:19----------
is going to make it hard for you to


---------44:21----------
connect


---------44:22----------
with other people maybe yes


---------44:26----------
yeah right so like what's funny about


---------44:28----------
what we're talking about


---------44:31----------
like that's unexpected what's unexpected


---------44:36----------
because you seem like you're at the


---------44:37----------
verge of tears to me


---------44:39----------
okay so


---------44:42----------
[Music]


---------44:45----------
i feel like my unconscious brain comes


---------44:47----------
up with predictions that are different


---------44:50----------
from


---------44:51----------
most people's predictions


---------44:54----------
yep and


---------44:57----------
that may be from having a distorted


---------44:59----------
world view


---------45:00----------
from growing up in a cult or building my


---------45:03----------
own


---------45:04----------
world view after leaving


---------45:07----------
okay i guess


---------45:11----------
so i mean there are unexpected things


---------45:13----------
happen all the time it doesn't make them


---------45:14----------
funny


---------45:16----------
i don't know what what what makes


---------45:17----------
something funny is when the unexpected


---------45:20----------
is


---------45:20----------
harmless


---------45:24----------
okay so here's an alternate hypothesis


---------45:27----------
for you okay


---------45:28----------
so sometimes we use humor as a defense


---------45:30----------
mechanism


---------45:32----------
okay okay this humor might be a defense


---------45:35----------
mechanism


---------45:36----------
yeah so i i think it is and i i think


---------45:38----------
it's it actually is like


---------45:39----------
it can make it


---------45:43----------
strange for people to like observe this


---------45:45----------
conversation because like


---------45:47----------
there's a lot of inappropriate affect


---------45:49----------
right


---------45:51----------
and it's so easy to bring out like i


---------45:54----------
mean


---------45:54----------
if if i didn't know better i thought i'd


---------45:56----------
think that you were like


---------45:57----------
listening to a comedian on stage with


---------45:59----------
like how much you're laughing


---------46:01----------
and then the more that we point it out


---------46:03----------
the funnier it becomes


---------46:05----------
so as we call attention to things and we


---------46:08----------
bring awareness to things it becomes


---------46:09----------
funnier and funnier and funnier


---------46:12----------
and generally speaking we're bringing


---------46:14----------
emotion out of you but it's weird


---------46:16----------
because you've got such a


---------46:17----------
fat defense mechanism that we just get


---------46:20----------
laughter


---------46:24----------
right you can see it like it's just


---------46:25----------
bubbling up like you can't even control


---------46:27----------
it it's like what


---------46:28----------
i'm just saying zory and you're laughing


---------46:30----------
right now and you're like


---------46:31----------
that's so funny that's so it's not funny


---------46:34----------
bro


---------46:35----------
okay and uh so right now


---------46:38----------
um tears are welling up in my eyes


---------46:42----------
yeah so you you does that have any


---------46:44----------
meaning


---------46:46----------
well i mean what kind of tears are they


---------46:50----------
they're not they're not tears of joy


---------46:52----------
yeah i feel like


---------46:53----------
yeah right so i i it might be suppressed


---------46:56----------
emotion it might be


---------46:57----------
uh some kind of defense like in


---------47:01----------
in order to avoid falling into a crisis


---------47:04----------
where i just


---------47:04----------
yeah yeah so i it's okay bro do you feel


---------47:10----------
like


---------47:11----------
what you're doing is okay or is there


---------47:13----------
some part of you that you're overcoming


---------47:15----------
that is telling you like this is dumb


---------47:17----------
and you should know how to do this


---------47:22----------
you know so if you're saying i may have


---------47:24----------
self-esteem issues


---------47:26----------
that's a no no that's not what i'm


---------47:29----------
talking about


---------47:30----------
what i'm talking about is right now in


---------47:32----------
this moment is there a part of you that


---------47:34----------
feels stupid and another part of you


---------47:36----------
that's telling yourself that you don't


---------47:37----------
need to feel stupid it's completely


---------47:38----------
understandable


---------47:40----------
no there's no such dialogue inside my


---------47:42----------
head okay


---------47:43----------
so the the first thing but but when you


---------47:46----------
said


---------47:47----------
it's okay bro i


---------47:50----------
almost felt like i could cry yup that's


---------47:53----------
why i said it


---------47:55----------
right so i think this is where like how


---------47:57----------
do you understand that


---------48:06----------
why i kind of get emotional


---------48:10----------
when you say


---------48:13----------
this is you you give a sign that this is


---------48:15----------
a safe place it's okay


---------48:20----------
i don't understand really i don't


---------48:21----------
understand the relationship between


---------48:22----------
those two things


---------48:24----------
sure i'm just gonna cry a little bit on


---------48:26----------
my own if that's okay with you


---------48:29----------
sure go ahead so


---------48:33----------
what what does it mean to you when i say


---------48:35----------
it's okay


---------48:38----------
it's okay to show the repressed emotions


---------48:41----------
that


---------48:42----------
are wrong


---------48:45----------
no i don't know yeah i i don't watch you


---------48:48----------
i don't know what


---------48:48----------
it is it's stupid yeah no it's it's good


---------48:50----------
right so i think you're very good at


---------48:52----------
educated guesses because they're logical


---------48:54----------
and i hate saying wrong because that


---------48:56----------
could make you feel stupid but but i i


---------48:57----------
don't know i i love being told i'm wrong


---------48:59----------
i love it it's


---------49:00----------
it's okay it's fine okay sorry


---------49:04----------
so what i'm trying to do is i'm trying


---------49:07----------
to accept you


---------49:08----------
okay okay i got you how does it feel to


---------49:12----------
be accepted


---------49:13----------
i don't need it there it is


---------49:19----------
right why don't you need it


---------49:22----------
i haven't thought about that because you


---------49:25----------
have an answer for me real quick there


---------49:28----------
no laughter you don't need it


---------49:34----------
yeah and that's the sad that's the


---------49:36----------
saddest damn thing


---------49:38----------
really yes absolutely


---------49:42----------
because you you're someone who's grown


---------49:44----------
up without acceptance


---------49:46----------
and so you've learned to live and


---------49:49----------
function


---------49:49----------
my parents loved me unconditionally is


---------49:52----------
that not acceptable


---------49:53----------
so that's a logical answer right like


---------49:57----------
you're saying like if parents love you


---------49:59----------
unconditionally isn't that acceptance


---------50:01----------
so let me toss something else out at you


---------50:03----------
and i'm sure you'll swat this aside


---------50:05----------
but like when your parents leave a cult


---------50:07----------
at the age of 15


---------50:08----------
and [ __ ] leave you in it they don't


---------50:10----------
tell you


---------50:11----------
and they continue emotionally


---------50:13----------
manipulating you like you


---------50:15----------
worked up the courage to leave the cult


---------50:16----------
at 18 and they had done it three years


---------50:18----------
ago


---------50:19----------
and they left you behind so


---------50:23----------
what do you think about that


---------50:27----------
i hadn't thought about it that way i'm


---------50:29----------
gonna be honest uh


---------50:32----------
not consciously yeah no no


---------50:37----------
it feels a little bit depressing what


---------50:40----------
does that mean


---------50:43----------
i don't know so it's gonna take time


---------50:46----------
okay so


---------50:49----------
here here's what i'm thinking zorian so


---------50:51----------
the first thing is i think you're doing


---------50:52----------
phenomenally well


---------50:55----------
um i think that it's truly amazing how


---------50:57----------
you've learned to become


---------50:58----------
independent and survive on your own but


---------51:01----------
i think it's like really challenging


---------51:03----------
right because you don't need anyone's


---------51:04----------
acceptance but boy do you want it


---------51:07----------
because everyone wants it right you


---------51:10----------
learn to live without a basic human need


---------51:13----------
and when i start to demonstrate


---------51:15----------
something to you unconditionally when i


---------51:17----------
don't qualify anything that your


---------51:19----------
your intellect can get around when i


---------51:21----------
just say


---------51:22----------
it's okay bro yes what is okay i'm not


---------51:26----------
telling you


---------51:27----------
why is it okay i'm not telling you what


---------51:28----------
are we even talking about i'm not


---------51:30----------
telling you


---------51:31----------
there's nothing for your intellect to


---------51:33----------
latch onto with that statement


---------51:34----------
which is why it sort of sinks deep yes


---------51:37----------
you're right


---------51:38----------
right and even the you're right stuff


---------51:42----------
like you got to be careful because


---------51:43----------
that's your intellect being like oh that


---------51:44----------
is correct


---------51:46----------
now we understand the equation you're


---------51:47----------
like stepping out of the emotion


---------51:49----------
and then when i catch you in the act


---------51:51----------
your other defense mechanism steps in


---------51:52----------
and it's like


---------51:53----------
[Laughter]


---------51:56----------
so do you think my intellect is also a


---------51:58----------
defense mechanism


---------51:59----------
abs [ __ ] lutely amazing


---------52:03----------
right and it's it's it is for everyone


---------52:07----------
and because here's the thing like zorian


---------52:09----------
you've got so much stuff to protect


---------52:10----------
against on the inside


---------52:12----------
because let's remember i don't know if


---------52:13----------
you knew this but you were raised in the


---------52:15----------
cult that was incredibly


---------52:17----------
emotionally manipulative and probably


---------52:19----------
quite traumatic


---------52:20----------
so there's gonna be a lot down there and


---------52:22----------
it's not like it it's a testament to


---------52:25----------
your intellect that your intellect has


---------52:26----------
grown


---------52:27----------
so much your ego has grown so much but


---------52:30----------
also makes like let's face it bro


---------52:32----------
really stupid decisions like you're


---------52:34----------
sleeping on your floor because you go


---------52:36----------
out of your way to help people and i


---------52:37----------
don't doubt that there's a


---------52:38----------
certain kind of logic to that and and


---------52:41----------
hopefully you don't feel bad i'm really


---------52:42----------
careful about the word stupid but i'm


---------52:44----------
trying to actually


---------52:45----------
really walk a title up here so if you


---------52:47----------
call me stupid


---------52:48----------
i suspect i highly suspect i will not


---------52:50----------
feel bad i think so i think so as well


---------52:53----------
in this situation because of the way in


---------52:55----------
which in any situation


---------52:57----------
okay sure if you say so


---------53:04----------
yeah so just because you don't feel bad


---------53:06----------
doesn't mean it doesn't hurt


---------53:09----------
right so if you're especially if you're


---------53:10----------
lexa-thymic


---------53:13----------
but this is where i think you've like


---------53:14----------
you've like like it's it's fascinating


---------53:16----------
because i


---------53:16----------
what i see is like you you know i


---------53:18----------
imagine someone who's shipwrecked on an


---------53:20----------
island


---------53:21----------
and has to like build everything for


---------53:23----------
themselves


---------53:24----------
yeah and that's what i see you as i see


---------53:26----------
you as like some guy who


---------53:28----------
through like ingenuity grit and a lot of


---------53:30----------
hard work has constructed


---------53:32----------
a water wheel in a rain catching thing


---------53:34----------
and constructed like


---------53:36----------
fish traps and like all these other


---------53:37----------
things to like help you survive


---------53:40----------
and at the same time all over again


---------53:43----------
i'm not familiar with the reference but


---------53:46----------
anyway


---------53:46----------
so so so this is where like i also think


---------53:49----------
that there's a lot


---------53:50----------
of work that you still have ahead of you


---------53:53----------
and some of it is going to be tough


---------53:54----------
because


---------53:55----------
what's happening is that you have like


---------53:56----------
adaptations on adaptations on


---------53:58----------
adaptations


---------53:59----------
which are fine like they're good they've


---------54:01----------
helped you and things like that


---------54:02----------
but at the same time i think that for


---------54:04----------
example like you're still very angry at


---------54:06----------
your parents


---------54:07----------
like you've forgiven them but i think


---------54:09----------
that like


---------54:10----------
like you're still incredibly angry with


---------54:12----------
them which can be


---------54:14----------
hard when they love you so much which


---------54:16----------
can be hard


---------54:17----------
when you've forgiven them which can be


---------54:19----------
hard but like i think it's


---------54:21----------
it's tough man and i've noticed yeah


---------54:24----------
i think it's understandable so then the


---------54:26----------
other thing is that you may not be angry


---------54:28----------
at your parents you may just be [ __ ]


---------54:29----------
pissed at the world


---------54:30----------
and now we have to we get into really


---------54:32----------
tricky territory because


---------54:33----------
i think you've got to learn how to feel


---------54:35----------
emotions that don't do anything for you


---------54:38----------
because a lot of times when i see people


---------54:40----------
who are hyper intellectual


---------54:41----------
what happens is they're like there's no


---------54:43----------
use to feeling that emotion i can't do


---------54:45----------
anything about it


---------54:47----------
and if they can't do anything about it


---------54:48----------
they sort of discard it


---------54:50----------
they're like there's no point they bury


---------54:52----------
it the thing is the emotion doesn't


---------54:54----------
really like go away just sort of like


---------54:56----------
you know get saved on some remote corner


---------54:58----------
of your hard drive where it just like


---------55:00----------
kind of lingers


---------55:01----------
and we're seeing a lot of things that


---------55:03----------
you know sometimes you have these like


---------55:04----------
drastic emotional


---------55:06----------
reactions that you sort of recognize


---------55:08----------
that you have hate within you once again


---------55:10----------
really really awesome you know thing


---------55:11----------
that you figured out it's amazing


---------55:13----------
really i'm i'm really impressed sorry


---------55:15----------
with how far you've come on your own


---------55:17----------
and at the same time i still think that


---------55:19----------
there's like a lot of stuff


---------55:20----------
like going you know


---------55:23----------
underneath like i mean you kind of say


---------55:25----------
that your parents are simpletons which


---------55:26----------
sort of makes sense


---------55:28----------
but also like they came out of the cult


---------55:30----------
were raised in the cult and emphasized


---------55:31----------
education for you


---------55:33----------
i think they had second thoughts about


---------55:34----------
the cult a long time


---------55:36----------
you know like they in the way that you


---------55:38----------
were raised


---------55:40----------
they were looking for an excuse to leave


---------55:42----------
i mean i think they realized a long time


---------55:44----------
i i think they realized that they didn't


---------55:46----------
want to like raise you


---------55:48----------
in the way that they were raised but


---------55:50----------
anyway it gets complicated yeah


---------55:52----------
definitely definitely so they were both


---------55:54----------
orphans


---------55:56----------
yeah so so i'm not quite sure you know


---------55:58----------
what's going on there but


---------55:59----------
um you know you know


---------56:03----------
there's just there's just a lot of stuff


---------56:05----------
like going on here zorya like it's


---------56:07----------
it's it's hard to describe but some of


---------56:09----------
the inappropriate affects some of the


---------56:10----------
hyper intellectualization


---------56:12----------
and and i think that you're not i hope


---------56:14----------
i'm not making you feel


---------56:16----------
kind of like naked or anything like that


---------56:18----------
but but i i think that you know you


---------56:20----------
really do have because it's it's kind of


---------56:21----------
weird like i think whatever logical


---------56:23----------
system you're using to that whines you


---------56:25----------
sleeping up on the floor


---------56:26----------
out of altruism may make sense but it


---------56:29----------
feels to me like


---------56:30----------
there's a blind spot somewhere in there


---------56:32----------
and i think basically the blind spot


---------56:34----------
is is is like some amount of these like


---------56:37----------
emotions which


---------56:38----------
i don't doubt that you've genuinely


---------56:40----------
forgiven your parents but like i also


---------56:42----------
think there's just like a roiling


---------56:43----------
massive emotion like somewhere in there


---------56:47----------
and and just yeah


---------56:54----------
so don't you think if after four years


---------56:57----------
of being


---------56:58----------
extremely angry inventing at the world


---------57:00----------
and


---------57:01----------
uh like all the negative emotions


---------57:05----------
come out and eventually dissipate


---------57:08----------
yes and no so this is where you know the


---------57:12----------
we haven't even gotten to what the


---------57:13----------
psychological impact is and and


---------57:15----------
potentially what you


---------57:16----------
are dealing with now but so i think that


---------57:18----------
like i kind of think about them as like


---------57:20----------
little spawning machines


---------57:22----------
that will generate thoughts so there's


---------57:25----------
like a portal that like you know


---------57:26----------
thoughts are coming out of


---------57:27----------
and you can vent the individual thought


---------57:29----------
but the portal can still be down there


---------57:32----------
and and i think that you've done some of


---------57:34----------
the process of digesting that but just


---------57:36----------
the the degree of your inappropriate


---------57:39----------
affect suggests to me that there's some


---------57:40----------
kind of negative emotion


---------57:42----------
that is under there um


---------57:45----------
i see what i see what you mean right


---------57:47----------
yeah i said it you got it so


---------57:49----------
and and it's just like because it you


---------57:52----------
know sure


---------57:53----------
you can logically say that things are


---------57:54----------
unexpected and that's why they're funny


---------57:56----------
but like


---------57:57----------
you know all kinds of unexpected stuff


---------57:58----------
happens that isn't harmful


---------58:00----------
but we don't i mean maybe the other


---------58:03----------
option other thing on the


---------58:04----------
differential diagnosis here is that


---------58:06----------
maybe you're enlightened because


---------58:08----------
sometimes enlightened people will laugh


---------58:09----------
at all manner of things


---------58:10----------
um oh [ __ ] see that's a genuine laugh


---------58:14----------
right like that's actually funny


---------58:18----------
i can see it in your eyes this time um


---------58:22----------
what what do you think about all this


---------58:25----------
[Music]


---------58:31----------
oh i just realized so the other thing is


---------58:34----------
that have you forgiven yourself


---------58:38----------
i'm very bad at forgiving myself yeah so


---------58:41----------
this is


---------58:41----------
maybe this is the piece that i was


---------58:43----------
missing is that like we talked about


---------58:45----------
forgiving your parents and you may not


---------58:46----------
have anger towards themselves but if we


---------58:48----------
look at this sort of like


---------58:50----------
you know your inability to forgive


---------58:51----------
yourself and like how frankly how stupid


---------58:53----------
you feel


---------58:54----------
like i know that you don't consciously


---------58:56----------
own that you feel stupid but we can


---------58:58----------
definitely detect a theme


---------59:00----------
of self-blame yes so when i make a


---------59:03----------
mistake


---------59:05----------
uh i feel self-loathing


---------59:10----------
right so but


---------59:13----------
how do you understand that so it's a


---------59:16----------
certain kind of mistake it's a


---------59:18----------
irreversible mistake something that


---------59:20----------
costs me an opportunity


---------59:22----------
and


---------59:25----------
[Music]


---------59:28----------
okay so i tend to go into


---------59:34----------
i'm not sure if i'm answering your


---------59:35----------
question but i tend to go into swearing


---------59:37----------
fits


---------59:37----------
to suppress blaming uh feeling bad about


---------59:41----------
things that like mistakes i've done


---------59:47----------
so okay there's i don't know if it was


---------59:50----------
the


---------59:51----------
answer to my question but boy do i like


---------59:53----------
it more than anything else that you


---------59:54----------
could have said


---------59:56----------
okay so so i think there's a lot there


---------59:58----------
right so you say you go into swearing


---------60:00----------
fits what are you swearing at


---------60:02----------
myself okay so like


---------60:06----------
like this is where like uh and this is


---------60:08----------
no this is gonna sound weird but like


---------60:11----------
the way that you feel about yourself


---------60:15----------
when did you start to feel that way


---------60:17----------
about yourself


---------60:19----------
the way i feel about myself what's the


---------60:21----------
way i feel about myself


---------60:23----------
let me just jump to it so you know i


---------60:26----------
think you left the cult but the cult


---------60:28----------
didn't leave you


---------60:29----------
right what i'm hearing here is that like


---------60:32----------
like the way that when they talk to you


---------60:34----------
about


---------60:35----------
your doing your chores and things like


---------60:38----------
that and like god is watching and like


---------60:40----------
you know it's not okay and like you're


---------60:42----------
not worthy and or maybe you guys were


---------60:44----------
chosen ones


---------60:45----------
and it's it's sort of like i i could i


---------60:47----------
could connect those two dots


---------60:49----------
that once again is a hypothesis for you


---------60:53----------
that like you know the self-loathing


---------60:54----------
because when i think about when you talk


---------60:55----------
about emotional manipulation and


---------60:57----------
guilting and stuff like that like i


---------60:58----------
think you've


---------60:59----------
carried it with you yes so


---------61:04----------
so i'm gonna just keep going


---------61:07----------
some of the cult stuff is so [ __ ]


---------61:09----------
painful that i've avoided talking about


---------61:12----------
it for 10 years


---------61:15----------
okay i just i just tried to forget and i


---------61:17----------
push it into the corner


---------61:19----------
of my mind that i i like i put it on


---------61:22----------
their locking key and i do not talk


---------61:23----------
about it


---------61:26----------
how do you feel about yourself for doing


---------61:28----------
that


---------61:30----------
i i have no ability to answer that


---------61:32----------
question do you feel weak


---------61:36----------
asking that question to a person with


---------61:37----------
alexa time is a little bit


---------61:39----------
it's okay i i have no ability to


---------61:42----------
identify if i feel weak


---------61:44----------
do you feel stupid when you say does it


---------61:47----------
feel stupid


---------61:48----------
yeah is it


---------61:51----------
an okay answer to say it rings a bell


---------61:54----------
sure


---------61:58----------
zorian any answer is an okay answer


---------62:04----------
so here's what i would say you set it


---------62:07----------
aside because it's so painful i


---------62:08----------
completely understand i mean i don't


---------62:10----------
complete i really don't understand at


---------62:11----------
all to be honest


---------62:12----------
but here's what i would say it's okay


---------62:14----------
bro


---------62:17----------
whatsoever you do with it it's okay


---------62:23----------
everything that you've accomplished is


---------62:25----------
fantastic


---------62:28----------
and the fact that you haven't


---------62:29----------
accomplished things is also fine


---------62:34----------
you've missed out on opportunities


---------62:36----------
you've made irreversible mistakes


---------62:38----------
it's okay bro you're allowed to make


---------62:41----------
mistakes


---------62:43----------
i'm not


---------62:49----------
i'm not allowed to make mistakes


---------62:53----------
why not there's the smile again


---------63:01----------
even if you don't allow yourself to make


---------63:03----------
mistakes i'll allow you to make mistakes


---------63:05----------
okay so mistakes


---------63:08----------
cost time that's how i see it


---------63:12----------
sure and i don't have enough time some


---------63:14----------
of my time has been


---------63:15----------
stolen i suppose so yes the remainder of


---------63:18----------
the time that's left


---------63:19----------
is more valuable when you put it into


---------63:22----------
that perspective


---------63:24----------
you can put it into that perspective all


---------63:25----------
you want to it's not one that i'm going


---------63:27----------
to adopt


---------63:28----------
okay but irrespective of how logically


---------63:31----------
correct it is


---------63:34----------
right and this is where like like zorin


---------63:36----------
what you really


---------63:37----------
learn gotta learn how to do and it's


---------63:38----------
gonna be really hard because it goes


---------63:40----------
against


---------63:41----------
everything because you're trying to make


---------63:43----------
up for lost time


---------63:45----------
you're trying to fix the past if you can


---------63:48----------
maximize the time that you have left at


---------63:50----------
the end of the day the scales will be


---------63:52----------
even


---------63:55----------
but here's the crazy thing like you


---------63:56----------
can't ever make up for what's happened


---------63:58----------
in the past


---------64:00----------
yes i can only compensate no the same


---------64:03----------
[ __ ] thing it's a synonym


---------64:06----------
okay fine right so that's that's what


---------64:09----------
you need to let go of and it's hard to


---------64:11----------
admit that like you got screwed bro


---------64:17----------
and that that maybe you blame yourself


---------64:19----------
for it maybe you blame your parents for


---------64:21----------
it maybe you blame the universe maybe


---------64:23----------
you blame god whatever


---------64:24----------
because god's off the table because


---------64:26----------
you're an atheist and you've learned to


---------64:28----------
forgive your parents


---------64:29----------
so who's left where does the


---------64:31----------
responsibility lie


---------64:36----------
and now we see where the self-loathing


---------64:38----------
comes from


---------64:40----------
right because it's kind of strange like


---------64:42----------
this is a really interesting


---------64:43----------
like issue that kids have is before kids


---------64:47----------
develop theory of mind which is the sort


---------64:49----------
of


---------64:49----------
understanding that other human beings


---------64:51----------
exist they feel like they are in a


---------64:53----------
single


---------64:54----------
player game yep and so like all of that


---------64:57----------
fault is yours and what i'm seeing from


---------65:01----------
you time and time and time again


---------65:03----------
is like harsh harsh


---------65:06----------
lack of acceptance towards yourself


---------65:09----------
i mean we we knew that before you told


---------65:12----------
us that you swear


---------65:13----------
to keep feelings at bay okay


---------65:17----------
right and so like then you tell us like


---------65:20----------
an hour into the conversation that i


---------65:21----------
swear at myself


---------65:23----------
and i beat myself up and it's like yeah


---------65:24----------
okay i think we saw that coming


---------65:27----------
and and so this is where it's it's going


---------65:29----------
to be really challenging


---------65:31----------
zorian because i think and and this is


---------65:33----------
where


---------65:35----------
you know i'm going to toss something out


---------65:36----------
like i think you've got to let those


---------65:38----------
feelings out


---------65:40----------
and and this is the really challenging


---------65:42----------
even harder than that i think you can


---------65:43----------
let the feelings out


---------65:44----------
problem is that i don't think you can do


---------65:46----------
it with someone


---------65:49----------
i don't know if you can tolerate showing


---------65:51----------
the ugliest


---------65:52----------
and worst parts of yourself to another


---------65:54----------
human being


---------65:56----------
and the hardest part about that because


---------65:58----------
i just did it just a tiny bit


---------66:00----------
is like them accepting you for being


---------66:04----------
all that loathing that you feel towards


---------66:06----------
yourself


---------66:09----------
uncovering it is the first hardest thing


---------66:12----------
uncovering it with someone else is the


---------66:14----------
second hardest thing


---------66:15----------
okay and then even then you've got an


---------66:17----------
easy out go ahead


---------66:20----------
you're right i i do not feel accepted


---------66:24----------
yeah i feel like i need to be accepted


---------66:26----------
but i'm too afraid


---------66:27----------
to show the part of myself and


---------66:30----------
because there's a fear of rejection nope


---------66:34----------
it's not a fear of rejection what is it


---------66:36----------
then it's a fear of acceptance


---------66:40----------
my friend really i think so how


---------66:44----------
because if they reject you is that new


---------66:48----------
no it's not can you survive that


---------66:50----------
rejection


---------66:51----------
yes absolutely because you [ __ ] do it


---------66:54----------
to yourself


---------66:55----------
every single day okay okay what you fear


---------66:59----------
is acceptance what you're terrified of


---------67:02----------
what gets you going


---------67:03----------
is not me telling you that you're stupid


---------67:05----------
as you've told us when you say you're


---------67:06----------
stupid when i if i call you stupid


---------67:08----------
you're like


---------67:09----------
doesn't touch me it's when i say it's


---------67:11----------
okay bro that you're like [ __ ]


---------67:14----------
you're right okay okay you're right


---------67:20----------
abuse zorian you grew up in a cult


---------67:23----------
your abuse resistance is 100


---------67:27----------
oh i see


---------67:32----------
[Music]


---------67:33----------
it's unconditional love it's acceptance


---------67:38----------
it's admitting that you don't need to


---------67:40----------
change


---------67:41----------
that it's okay to let go of your


---------67:43----------
opportunities that you don't need to be


---------67:45----------
perfect


---------67:46----------
yes all of those things that you're


---------67:48----------
saying right now those make me feel like


---------67:50----------
i want to cry


---------67:57----------
how do you feel about that


---------68:00----------
i feel good about it i'm happy for you


---------68:04----------
zorian because it's like it's a painful


---------68:06----------
journey but it's a good one


---------68:08----------
and it's worth the opportunity cost


---------68:14----------
i don't i feel like it's not even a


---------68:16----------
worthwhile question to ask how do i get


---------68:19----------
uh how do i overcome this barrier


---------68:24----------
good great question why isn't that a


---------68:26----------
worthwhile question


---------68:30----------
sounds stupid there it is you see it


---------68:35----------
always lurking every step forward that


---------68:38----------
you try to take the question that you


---------68:39----------
need to ask the important question


---------68:40----------
there's your mind


---------68:41----------
it's stupid don't do it zorian it's a


---------68:44----------
dumb question


---------68:47----------
so how do you move forward it's the most


---------68:48----------
important question to ask


---------68:51----------
so and and then then we get into a


---------68:54----------
really tricky thing because if i say


---------68:55----------
it's the most important question to ask


---------68:57----------
maybe then you feel stupid for like


---------69:00----------
hesitating to ask it so it's a dumb


---------69:04----------
question because


---------69:05----------
it should have a i suspect the answer is


---------69:08----------
pretty obvious right and there there it


---------69:12----------
is again


---------69:12----------
okay so now like hopefully like twitch


---------69:14----------
chat is following at this point maybe


---------69:16----------
you're following


---------69:17----------
because like do you see how no matter


---------69:19----------
how we cut this problem


---------69:21----------
the conclusion is like it's a dumb


---------69:23----------
question to ask because it's obvious and


---------69:25----------
if it's obvious then you are


---------69:29----------
an idiot there it is like like it's it's


---------69:32----------
a thing like your your logic


---------69:34----------
is falling underneath this


---------69:37----------
like emotional or like some scott or


---------69:40----------
like the like


---------69:42----------
you see like it doesn't matter how you


---------69:44----------
cut this pie like the conclusion is


---------69:45----------
always gonna be like zorian's an idiot


---------69:49----------
right and if i say that to you it


---------69:51----------
doesn't bother you at all because you


---------69:52----------
tell yourself all the time like what


---------69:53----------
difference does it make if like another


---------69:54----------
person tells you you're an idiot because


---------69:56----------
you tell yourself all the time no big


---------69:57----------
deal yes


---------69:58----------
i'm a big son i don't think you're a big


---------70:01----------
idiot


---------70:02----------
matter if it's true huh does it matter


---------70:06----------
what you think


---------70:06----------
if it's true


---------70:12----------
that's it doesn't matter what you think


---------70:13----------
if i know it's true maybe


---------70:15----------
exactly right so so there it is again


---------70:17----------
like you're discounting what i say


---------70:19----------
you're like swatting it away like


---------70:20----------
because where so what's the conclusion


---------70:23----------
from that statement


---------70:24----------
when i say i don't think you're an idiot


---------70:25----------
you're like


---------70:27----------
that's not true he doesn't know what


---------70:29----------
he's talking about


---------70:30----------
and the conclusion is that you are an


---------70:34----------
idiot there it is we can play this game


---------70:36----------
as many rounds as you want to go we're


---------70:38----------
always going to end up in the same damn


---------70:40----------
place


---------70:41----------
which in turn can make you feel even


---------70:43----------
stupider so it's like


---------70:45----------
it's just not productive like well


---------70:47----------
there's a certain amount of


---------70:48----------
productivity there so what what do you


---------70:51----------
do about it that's a good question


---------70:53----------
okay okay so it's like even if i call


---------70:56----------
you smart you think you're stupid and


---------70:57----------
even if i call you stupid you think


---------70:58----------
you're


---------70:59----------
it's like you just can't win and that


---------71:01----------
doesn't make you stupid it's just that's


---------71:02----------
the that's the emotional thing that


---------71:04----------
you've worked so hard to bury


---------71:07----------
that it's like there and it's like


---------71:08----------
clogging up your heart you're like this


---------71:10----------
hidden folder


---------71:11----------
on your hard drive that's clogging it up


---------71:13----------
but like you it's hidden so you don't


---------71:14----------
see it


---------71:15----------
but it's action is always going to be


---------71:16----------
there so the first thing you've got to


---------71:18----------
do is


---------71:19----------
awareness so i think zory this is


---------71:20----------
something that you're gifted at the more


---------71:22----------
that you're able to notice this pattern


---------71:24----------
in your mind


---------71:25----------
the more it starts to dissolve yes


---------71:28----------
that awareness will start the process of


---------71:30----------
emotional digestion


---------71:31----------
second thing is that you say you haven't


---------71:32----------
talked to anyone you haven't told anyone


---------71:34----------
so like


---------71:35----------
that's a good place to start right so


---------71:38----------
this is where you know i'd highly


---------71:39----------
recommend


---------71:40----------
so sometimes i talk about our coaching


---------71:41----------
program but this is definitely a case


---------71:43----------
where i would recommend you see a real


---------71:45----------
therapist


---------71:46----------
right like like like go and and i it


---------71:49----------
sounds like your financial situation


---------71:51----------
isn't maybe the best right now so i


---------71:52----------
don't know exactly what resources are


---------71:54----------
available to you


---------71:55----------
but i i think that you know this is


---------71:57----------
definitely something where i would go


---------71:59----------
and


---------71:59----------
and talk to someone right because i


---------72:02----------
think that


---------72:03----------
you were conditioned to loathe yourself


---------72:07----------
that's what cults do yes you're right


---------72:10----------
and so it's interesting but to learn


---------72:13----------
how to love yourself is like


---------72:17----------
difficult like conditioning it doesn't


---------72:20----------
matter


---------72:21----------
like all conditioning is conditioning


---------72:22----------
that we can condition you to load


---------72:24----------
yourself


---------72:24----------
we can condition you to love yourself


---------72:26----------
and sometimes like what you need from


---------72:28----------
people


---------72:29----------
like because people are going to show


---------72:30----------
you right like i'm going to make these


---------72:31----------
weird statements


---------72:32----------
which aren't logical like it's okay


---------72:36----------
bro like good job zorian and you're like


---------72:39----------
good job at what


---------72:40----------
and i'm like everything anything i don't


---------72:43----------
know


---------72:43----------
all of it like it's those things like


---------72:46----------
like


---------72:47----------
someone's gonna have to show you and


---------72:49----------
sometimes people are lucky enough to


---------72:51----------
find this in a romantic relationship


---------72:52----------
although i wouldn't recommend it


---------72:54----------
you know it's like a roll of a dice kind


---------72:55----------
of thing


---------72:57----------
that you know like you need to be sure


---------72:59----------
like taught how to accept yourself


---------73:02----------
and it's going to be these little


---------73:03----------
moments where like you're learning your


---------73:05----------
brain your neurons are rewiring right


---------73:07----------
now as these emotions come up as you


---------73:09----------
start crying and things like that like


---------73:11----------
there's rewiring going on in your brain


---------73:13----------
as we speak


---------73:14----------
so you just need to continue doing that


---------73:16----------
rewiring


---------73:18----------
and then like one day you're gonna wake


---------73:19----------
up and like you're gonna when you make a


---------73:22----------
mistake


---------73:23----------
like there's gonna be like another


---------73:25----------
dialogue that pops in


---------73:26----------
up in your head which is like man that


---------73:28----------
was kind of stupid


---------73:29----------
but it's okay i'm never gonna argue with


---------73:33----------
you


---------73:33----------
about whether it's stupid or not stupid


---------73:35----------
that's an argument that i can never win


---------73:38----------
so the current way i avoid


---------73:41----------
or get over beating myself up


---------73:44----------
is whenever i catch that feeling


---------73:48----------
whenever i start to insult myself


---------73:50----------
i replace it with


---------73:55----------
i what i like i write down what i


---------73:58----------
learned from that experience


---------73:59----------
nope incorrect okay


---------74:02----------
you don't want to replace it that's the


---------74:04----------
very opposite of acceptance


---------74:07----------
you see that if we're replacing it


---------74:09----------
you're not accepting it it's


---------74:11----------
subtle really tricky so when it happens


---------74:13----------
but i never load myself again after i do


---------74:15----------
that


---------74:16----------
so why does happen no no so so this is


---------74:20----------
when you load yourself


---------74:21----------
you should accept yourself for loathing


---------74:23----------
yourself


---------74:24----------
okay right don't just get stuck at the


---------74:27----------
loading layer notice that


---------74:29----------
hey this is me like beating myself up


---------74:31----------
again and like


---------74:32----------
it's something that i'm gonna work on


---------74:34----------
but it's okay it's okay for me to feel


---------74:36----------
this way


---------74:37----------
okay oh because when you load yeah


---------74:41----------
let me just finish this point when you


---------74:43----------
load yourself it's the opposite of


---------74:45----------
acceptance


---------74:47----------
yes right so like if even if we it's


---------74:49----------
subtle really subtle


---------74:50----------
if we replace the loathing what we're


---------74:52----------
doing is still not accepting ourselves


---------74:56----------
so just unconditionally like


---------75:00----------
accept whatever you are right i'm not


---------75:02----------
saying that you aren't stupid what i'm


---------75:03----------
saying is that it's okay


---------75:05----------
it's okay it's okay it's okay


---------75:08----------
okay so what's the point of this


---------75:13----------
why should i accept this


---------75:17----------
what are the benefits let me think about


---------75:19----------
that question for a second


---------75:21----------
like is this the path to enlightenment


---------75:25----------
this question feels like a trap to me


---------75:28----------
no it's not but oh i think it may be


---------75:31----------
hold on


---------75:32----------
okay i'm trying to decide if i'm reading


---------75:36----------
too much into this


---------75:37----------
when you say what's the point of this


---------75:39----------
yes


---------75:40----------
okay i'm gonna just answer so i think


---------75:42----------
the point is because like


---------75:45----------
i don't think you have to live this way


---------75:46----------
anymore i don't want you to live this


---------75:48----------
way anymore i think it's it's incredibly


---------75:51----------
sad and devastating


---------75:52----------
that you've been living this way this


---------75:53----------
long


---------75:58----------
okay okay


---------76:02----------
you okay that's okay


---------76:08----------
i could use a little bit of reassurance


---------76:16----------
it's okay let me yeah


---------76:19----------
what i'm thinking about that


---------76:23----------
zorin i kind of feel like we are at


---------76:27----------
i want you to really like sort of sit


---------76:29----------
with how far we've gotten


---------76:31----------
i'm a little bit concerned because that


---------76:32----------
that other the next the last question


---------76:34----------
you asked i think is like opening up a


---------76:35----------
new thing do


---------76:38----------
so i'm sort of feeling like this is a


---------76:40----------
good place to stop


---------76:42----------
at least from my exploration now if you


---------76:44----------
have questions i'm more than happy to


---------76:46----------
answer them but like


---------76:47----------
i think how far we've come is actually


---------76:49----------
like a like i want you to sort of


---------76:51----------
not go any farther than this because i


---------76:53----------
think this is the thing


---------76:55----------
okay does that make sense no


---------76:59----------
okay so like i think that there are


---------77:01----------
further conversations that need to be


---------77:03----------
had


---------77:03----------
but this piece you need to work on first


---------77:07----------
i think okay and i don't think any


---------77:09----------
amount of other


---------77:10----------
intellectual understanding is going to


---------77:13----------
like really


---------77:14----------
improve anything okay


---------77:19----------
does this would you say a good


---------77:23----------
step in the right would say it's step in


---------77:26----------
the right direction


---------77:26----------
if i get rid of my


---------77:31----------
intellectual ego sort of


---------77:34----------
because i think once again getting rid


---------77:36----------
of replacing


---------77:38----------
is not what we want to do so your


---------77:40----------
intellectual ego


---------77:42----------
will subside when it no longer needs to


---------77:45----------
be there


---------77:46----------
so it's not about getting rid of the


---------77:48----------
intellectual ego it's about no longer


---------77:50----------
needing it to protect you


---------77:52----------
right so so right now your intellectual


---------77:54----------
ego is like the tool that you fashioned


---------77:57----------
that allows you to like start to put


---------77:59----------
your life back together so i'd say don't


---------78:01----------
get rid of it


---------78:02----------
it's there for a reason okay but


---------78:06----------
that ego comes at the cost of like


---------78:08----------
burying all this stuff and this weird


---------78:10----------
self-loathing that you have left over


---------78:12----------
and you can work intellectually with


---------78:13----------
your ego as long as you want to i


---------78:15----------
suspect i mean maybe you can overcome it


---------78:17----------
i guess


---------78:18----------
technically you can but i'd say that


---------78:19----------
they're easier


---------78:21----------
not easier faster ways that may be


---------78:25----------
a little bit it's going to be


---------78:26----------
uncomfortable for you because like you


---------78:27----------
have you fashioned such a brilliant and


---------78:30----------
capable intellectual ego that letting it


---------78:33----------
go and


---------78:33----------
and like entering a territory where it


---------78:35----------
can't do its job it can be very scary


---------78:38----------
but i think ultimately that's what you


---------78:40----------
need is like


---------78:42----------
emotional healing


---------78:53----------
okay


---------78:57----------
any other questions is getting rid of my


---------79:01----------
fear


---------79:02----------
of irreversibility


---------79:05----------
a path to accepting myself


---------79:10----------
same problem getting rid replacing


---------79:15----------
right wait is replacing a better word


---------79:18----------
nope they're all the same word they're


---------79:19----------
all synonymous


---------79:21----------
right so so like like the thing is like


---------79:23----------
i don't think you need to get rid of


---------79:24----------
your fear


---------79:25----------
this is the whole problem is that like


---------79:27----------
you're always rejecting parts of


---------79:29----------
yourself


---------79:30----------
well yeah because i need to improve no


---------79:33----------
you don't


---------79:34----------
that's what needs to change it's okay


---------79:37----------
bro


---------79:42----------
that is deeply unsettling yep


---------79:47----------
it feels wrong yep


---------79:51----------
should i should i navigate to a place


---------79:54----------
where it feels right


---------79:55----------
nope to accept


---------79:59----------
who i am right now and just not want to


---------80:01----------
move any


---------80:02----------
more yep


---------80:05----------
is that the destination you're there's


---------80:08----------
no destination you're already there


---------80:11----------
[Music]


---------80:12----------
what do you mean you're you're great


---------80:14----------
just the way that you are you don't need


---------80:16----------
to do a damn things orient


---------80:20----------
okay so you're saying there is not a


---------80:21----------
tool i can fashion


---------80:23----------
[Music]


---------80:27----------
just sit with your [ __ ] emotions


---------80:30----------
close your eyes you feel deeply


---------80:34----------
unsettled don't go anywhere


---------80:37----------
just sit with that feeling of being


---------80:39----------
unsettled


---------80:43----------
you don't already okay


---------80:47----------
so it's so like what all you need to do


---------80:50----------
is just sit with it you don't need to do


---------80:53----------
you need to go anywhere you don't need


---------80:54----------
to change it


---------80:56----------
you're great it's not a good idea to


---------80:58----------
like make it surface


---------81:00----------
and then sit with it


---------81:03----------
sure you can make it surface and sit


---------81:05----------
with it


---------81:06----------
but okay we sort of did that just now


---------81:09----------
and i think there's a certain amount of


---------81:10----------
tolerance you have which will build up


---------81:12----------
over time


---------81:13----------
so this is why like i think you should


---------81:14----------
see a therapist right because the


---------81:16----------
therapy is


---------81:17----------
different huh maybe my friends will help


---------81:20----------
me


---------81:21----------
yeah so i think this is where like they


---------81:23----------
can teach you how to learn how to sit


---------81:24----------
with yourself that's all you need to do


---------81:29----------
you can't fix that which isn't broken


---------81:34----------
interesting so i i think what's broken


---------81:37----------
is that this is very meta


---------81:42----------
what's broken is


---------81:46----------
i don't recognize that i don't


---------81:50----------
need to be fixed


---------81:55----------
something that's preventing me from


---------81:58----------
realizing that


---------82:00----------
yeah that's that's also that's gonna go


---------82:02----------
like add infant item


---------82:04----------
because that in and of itself is what's


---------82:06----------
like you're just i'm


---------82:07----------
i'm starting with the presumption now


---------82:08----------
we're getting intellectual that you're


---------82:10----------
not broken


---------82:11----------
and you're like what's broken is that i


---------82:12----------
can't recognize i'm broken and there we


---------82:14----------
are again


---------82:15----------
like you can play this game like you can


---------82:17----------
run circles around me zorin


---------82:22----------
it feels true yep yep absolutely right


---------82:25----------
so like


---------82:25----------
look who isn't alexa thymic anymore it


---------82:28----------
feels true


---------82:30----------
absolutely because it's a feeling


---------82:33----------
you start with the the conclusion


---------82:36----------
the emotional conclusion that you are


---------82:39----------
busted in some fundamental way


---------82:42----------
and so as long as that is there like no


---------82:45----------
matter how much logic you use you're


---------82:46----------
going to wind up in the same damn place


---------82:50----------
so it's like an emotional thing that


---------82:52----------
needs to happen so i'm gonna leave you


---------82:54----------
with a different kind of meditation


---------82:56----------
practice


---------82:58----------
if that's okay


---------83:01----------
is it okay if i give you a meditation


---------83:03----------
practice and we wrap up or do you have


---------83:04----------
other questions


---------83:07----------
no i'm fine with it let's let's do it


---------83:10----------
let's do the meditation


---------83:11----------
okay i want to give you a colon


---------83:14----------
because i think that'll a koan is like


---------83:17----------
one of these paradoxes


---------83:21----------
um but i have to try to think about i'm


---------83:23----------
just trying to think about a good koan


---------83:26----------
so it's like something that meditators


---------83:27----------
use to try to break themselves


---------83:29----------
out of this intellectual cycle because


---------83:32----------
your intellect will like so it's


---------83:33----------
something that fundamentally doesn't


---------83:35----------
make sense


---------83:36----------
um


---------83:41----------
okay but it doesn't make sense no


---------83:45----------
there's no trick to it the point is that


---------83:47----------
you have to abandon all tricks


---------83:48----------
so this is what i want you to do i want


---------83:52----------
you to watch


---------83:52----------
a rock grow


---------83:56----------
okay i can do that okay just watch your


---------83:59----------
rock grow


---------84:02----------
sounds like fun okay good that's the


---------84:05----------
point


---------84:06----------
okay well that's sort of what i've got


---------84:10----------
for you


---------84:10----------
zorian i didn't mean to hopefully i


---------84:13----------
wasn't too abrupt with how we ended


---------84:14----------
things but i really think it's going to


---------84:15----------
get repetitive and you're actually


---------84:17----------
moving


---------84:18----------
further away from like where you need to


---------84:20----------
be with the more questions that you ask


---------84:22----------
and maybe that makes sense maybe it


---------84:24----------
doesn't but you're


---------84:26----------
now we re-engage your intellectual mind


---------84:28----------
and all your questions are like i think


---------84:29----------
we like


---------84:30----------
we had a couple of wins in there when


---------84:31----------
you were like this feels deeply


---------84:34----------
uncomfortable like good


---------84:35----------
that's what we want right like this


---------84:36----------
feels wrong


---------84:38----------
this feel like so like you're becoming


---------84:40----------
less lexa-thymic over the course of the


---------84:42----------
conversation which is really good


---------84:44----------
so now you need to kind of like practice


---------84:45----------
some of those skills go see a therapist


---------84:47----------
and watch


---------84:48----------
watch your rock grow i'm serious like


---------84:50----------
sit down and just watch it grow


---------84:53----------
and then pay attention to all the things


---------84:55----------
that your mind does at first it's like


---------84:56----------
oh look like


---------84:57----------
it's this is going to be the trick that


---------84:58----------
teaches me things and then that's going


---------85:00----------
to be there for a little while


---------85:01----------
then you're going to be like actually


---------85:02----------
this is stupid i'm not the trick isn't


---------85:04----------
working


---------85:05----------
and then your mind is going to tell you


---------85:06----------
to stop and then


---------85:08----------
you're going to be like no no if i


---------85:09----------
continue then i'll discover the trick


---------85:11----------
i'll discover the trick of it


---------85:13----------
and then you're gonna be frustrated


---------85:14----------
again you're like there's no stupid


---------85:16----------
trick


---------85:16----------
there's no it's dumb


---------85:20----------
and then like if you continue with it


---------85:21----------
then hopefully you'll figure it out


---------85:24----------
but there's no trick and as long as you


---------85:26----------
think is that there's a trick you won't


---------85:27----------
find it


---------85:32----------
right so you're telling me that if i sit


---------85:35----------
long enough with this eventually i'll


---------85:37----------
get used to it


---------85:38----------
nope i don't know what's gonna happen


---------85:45----------
i'm telling you it's a waste of time and


---------85:47----------
you should do it anyway


---------85:51----------
i like that okay right


---------85:55----------
okay good luck to you zorian and thank


---------85:58----------
you very much for coming


---------86:03----------
i hate the fact that it's ending so soon


---------86:05----------
but yeah


---------86:06----------
i understand it can feel unsatisfying


---------86:10----------
but this this is it i hope you don't


---------86:12----------
view this as an


---------86:13----------
end i really think like this is an


---------86:15----------
important beginning


---------86:17----------
and we're not i'm i'm happy


---------86:21----------
in a weird way that you feel a little


---------86:23----------
bit hungry because like that means that


---------86:25----------
this was good for you and so like


---------86:26----------
i encourage you to go eat again like


---------86:28----------
find a therapist seriously


---------86:32----------
okay take care man see you emma i love


---------86:35----------
you


---------86:36----------
love you too


---------86:39----------
all right chat
