---------00:00----------
there we go there he is yeah okay


---------00:04----------
now that in combination over here now we


---------00:06----------
got to get you on this I have a very


---------00:08----------
special


---------00:09----------
where I put it


---------00:11----------
and if you're getting reverb I have my


---------00:14----------
gaming headset that I can put on no way


---------00:17----------
awesome


---------00:18----------
should I just plug that in last time


---------00:20----------
there was reverbs it might be again if


---------00:22----------
it's the same setup


---------00:23----------
I think we've improved every we're


---------00:26----------
learning more Devon


---------00:27----------
oh god don't tell me about it how have


---------00:29----------
you I installed this thing called VST


---------00:32----------
host okay and then I have a I have like


---------00:36----------
a Yamaha mixer oh [ __ ] and so we're like


---------00:41----------
upgrading and I'm learning how to do


---------00:43----------
this thing called streaming what's it


---------00:45----------
like to have like 10,000 IQ dude like it


---------00:48----------
took me like two years to figure out oh


---------00:51----------
so definitely let's be clear when we say


---------00:55----------
when I say we're doing this stuff


---------00:56----------
someone who knows how to do this stuff


---------00:58----------
is doing it for me got it okay window


---------01:01----------
capture


---------01:03----------
so like literally I watched a YouTube


---------01:05----------
tutorial and and set up this set up this


---------01:12----------
stuff in then Tama nation time do you


---------01:14----------
know domination time they came by the


---------01:17----------
chat and I think I was like in the


---------01:18----------
middle of a talk so I didn't see them so


---------01:20----------
tom has been incredibly helpful but also


---------01:22----------
also was I've educated myself about


---------01:26----------
trolls and I I think I'm vastly


---------01:29----------
underestimated what trolls are capable


---------01:31----------
of yeah we had that conversation for the


---------01:36----------
before did we yeah I mean I still want


---------01:39----------
to talk to trolls on your channel and or


---------01:41----------
trolls on mine like I were thinking


---------01:44----------
about actually creating like a separate


---------01:46----------
like if you're a troll and you you know


---------01:49----------
like creating a separate email address


---------01:50----------
that trolls could email to come on


---------01:53----------
stream and talk about why they troll


---------01:54----------
things


---------01:56----------
I mean I'm sure you could get like a


---------01:58----------
self-conscious one at some point the but


---------02:01----------
like true trolls just want to watch the


---------02:03----------
world burn that's the problem with them


---------02:04----------
there's no there's no compromising with


---------02:06----------
them yeah so I mean I think if you give


---------02:08----------
them a microphone they won't like it


---------02:09----------
because that's not how they operate


---------02:11----------
right they like they like to throw fruit


---------02:14----------
and vegetables from the audience on the


---------02:16----------
stage leadership man I don't know I


---------02:19----------
think all they want is a microphone


---------02:20----------
interesting thing is about attention


---------02:22----------
that that's like it like the only way


---------02:25----------
that I've found to stop them is by


---------02:28----------
actually just ignoring them right here


---------02:31----------
yes so we'll we'll see what we end up


---------02:35----------
doing well this problem it's you I mean


---------02:40----------
I I would like to talk to trolls though


---------02:41----------
yeah I'm curious because I think you're


---------02:44----------
right like they want to watch the world


---------02:45----------
burn so the question is why do they want


---------02:47----------
to watch the world burn like what's


---------02:49----------
what's important about that to them


---------02:53----------
um do you know a do you know a dude


---------02:57----------
named Jordan Peterson yeah he probably


---------03:00----------
has the best view on this because he's


---------03:02----------
probably encountered the most amount of


---------03:04----------
trolls and his theory is that it's it's


---------03:08----------
a


---------03:10----------
expression of an inner hatred of the


---------03:13----------
world as a result of like a really nice


---------03:14----------
view on things so it's like you hate


---------03:17----------
your own existence and lack of purpose


---------03:19----------
so much that you despise anybody that


---------03:21----------
has yeah so I mean didn't we talk about


---------03:23----------
that last time we talked about trolls


---------03:25----------
like why are people trolling you know we


---------03:27----------
didn't cover that I thought we did I


---------03:29----------
thought we said I thought I mentioned


---------03:31----------
that I think the reason you're getting


---------03:32----------
trolled is because you're doing


---------03:33----------
something with your life and that


---------03:35----------
offends them and that they say that


---------03:37----------
people come to your stream in order to


---------03:39----------
make substantial positive changes in


---------03:41----------
their life and that's what I think


---------03:45----------
that's consistent with what Jordan


---------03:46----------
Peterson says because you guys are in


---------03:48----------
the search for meaning and they they've


---------03:50----------
had trouble finding meaning so anyone


---------03:52----------
who is building what they have looked


---------03:55----------
for and not found it really hurts them


---------03:58----------
it affects their ego yeah you said you


---------04:02----------
tell them the truth you don't want to


---------04:03----------
hear since your message is one of


---------04:06----------
empowerment of agency over your life


---------04:07----------
what invites the most hatred is meeting


---------04:10----------
the person that you want to be that's


---------04:11----------
good


---------04:12----------
yeah that's pretty cool that's that's a


---------04:17----------
that's pretty neat so you've been you've


---------04:20----------
been like moving forward with the whole


---------04:22----------
streaming thing in the week that we've


---------04:24----------
or two weeks or whatever that we've been


---------04:26----------
not yeah so I think we've been streaming


---------04:28----------
we've had a couple people on and it's


---------04:30----------
been fun I enjoy talking to people I had


---------04:33----------
my first like kind of challenging


---------04:34----------
interview because I think someone came


---------04:36----------
on stream and like didn't really know


---------04:38----------
why they wanted to come on stream or


---------04:40----------
didn't really know what was wrong


---------04:42----------
and so it was kind of like they were


---------04:44----------
being super vague and so it was really


---------04:48----------
challenging because I think that they


---------04:49----------
like sense that something was missing


---------04:50----------
further from their life but they didn't


---------04:52----------
know what it was or how to articulate it


---------04:54----------
does not usually take a really long time


---------04:56----------
in therapy to like build that up because


---------04:59----------
you have to understand that first you


---------05:01----------
have to understand why they're there or


---------05:03----------
they yes they are there so I mean we did


---------05:05----------
it in half an hour


---------05:07----------
[Music]


---------05:08----------
but but it was challenging I mean I


---------05:10----------
didn't know if we would you know if we'd


---------05:12----------
get there because it was it was tricky


---------05:14----------
but it's it's been fun to you know talk


---------05:16----------
to a lot of people and and see how


---------05:17----------
things are going good man and reaching


---------05:21----------
out to people hopefully helping some


---------05:22----------
people so as the majority of what you're


---------05:24----------
doing


---------05:25----------
still direct one-on-one type of therapy


---------05:30----------
basically and then using that as an


---------05:31----------
example for how other people can follow


---------05:33----------
it or are you doing more yes oh I think


---------05:35----------
I think so first of all to be clear it's


---------05:37----------
not therapy and I can't dispense medical


---------05:40----------
advice over the internet but so I think


---------05:43----------
what I do is just talk to people and so


---------05:46----------
usually my stream like I stream for like


---------05:48----------
two hours at a time and I may have like


---------05:50----------
a little intro where all I kind of talk


---------05:52----------
a little bit about what we've talked


---------05:53----------
about or if I just have thoughts that


---------05:55----------
I'd like to share with the universe and


---------05:56----------
then we usually do like an interview


---------05:58----------
that the last 45 minutes to an hour and


---------06:00----------
it'll be on different kinds of topics


---------06:02----------
and so it's just that that's based on


---------06:05----------
like what people you know want to talk


---------06:06----------
about so last last week we had someone


---------06:10----------
from rise above the disease or


---------06:12----------
disheartened disorder sorry


---------06:14----------
crystal Navarro yeah I know crystal so


---------06:18----------
crystals Jason crystal versus Jason dr.


---------06:21----------
Jason that was the guy that I want to


---------06:23----------
connect you with last week oh yeah yeah


---------06:25----------
yes there's him doc yeah so so it's


---------06:27----------
funny actually someone at the conference


---------06:29----------
that I was at I was at a conference this


---------06:30----------
morning and yeah a conference about like


---------06:34----------
technology in in in healthcare and


---------06:36----------
someone there also wanted me to connect


---------06:39----------
to me it wanted to connect me with with


---------06:41----------
Jason as well I could totally do I'm on


---------06:44----------
the board of rice gets this order


---------06:45----------
oh really yeah so it's a small work


---------06:48----------
world yeah or just a small group of


---------06:51----------
people that are interested in solving a


---------06:53----------
really big problem yeah


---------06:54----------
perfect yeah anyway so I so she was on


---------06:59----------
for about half an hour we talked about


---------07:00----------
that a little bit and then since she had


---------07:01----------
to go


---------07:02----------
we actually like switched gears and


---------07:04----------
someone came on and talked about he so


---------07:08----------
his question is why do I date people


---------07:09----------
that are like my parents oh that was fun


---------07:13----------
we talked about that for a little while


---------07:15----------
and then and then this other guy came on


---------07:16----------
so usually I'll like talk a little bit


---------07:18----------
we'll do like an interview for about 45


---------07:20----------
minutes and then we'll sort of do Q and


---------07:23----------
a afterward based on like stuff that


---------07:24----------
comes up in the interview so like do


---------07:27----------
other people feel like they you know


---------07:28----------
they date like do they find themselves


---------07:30----------
dating like the same kind of person over


---------07:31----------
and over and over again like why is that


---------07:33----------
and then yeah I mean so so that's


---------07:37----------
usually the format got it okay and so


---------07:41----------
you and I are doing something kind of a


---------07:43----------
little bit more


---------07:45----------
[Music]


---------07:46----------
I think since we're also like sort of


---------07:48----------
starting to commit to like more regular


---------07:50----------
talks which I am loved I love that idea


---------07:53----------
yeah that is amazing you're very good at


---------07:55----------
asking questions by the way oh really


---------07:57----------
thank you really yeah you are I have a


---------08:01----------
big reason for that I think as I prep a


---------08:03----------
lot like I spend a lot of time and also


---------08:06----------
another big reason for it is like I read


---------08:08----------
so many books and I've listened to so


---------08:11----------
many podcasts and I've like done so much


---------08:12----------
work on trying to understand


---------08:14----------
self-improvement that said now that I


---------08:15----------
finally have someone in front of me that


---------08:17----------
it can answer all those questions it's


---------08:19----------
like a genie that I could just like


---------08:21----------
continuously ask questions just pop


---------08:23----------
answers out of a freaking magic lantern


---------08:25----------
and I'm like this is amazing like this


---------08:26----------
is everything I've always wanted you


---------08:27----------
know so it's like really easy to do yeah


---------08:30----------
I think that's good questions you asked


---------08:32----------
questions that capture the nuance or


---------08:33----------
essence of things which is hard thank


---------08:35----------
you thank you so much that means a lot


---------08:38----------
it's really cool I think one of the


---------08:41----------
things that we could do is sort of build


---------08:44----------
a over over the course of time build a


---------08:46----------
foundation of understanding of some of


---------08:49----------
these like topics and the thing that I


---------08:51----------
want to nail you on most of all is some


---------08:56----------
kind of and we have to get into that


---------08:57----------
right now because I have a couple of


---------08:59----------
like interest stuff but like some kind


---------09:01----------
of


---------09:02----------
objective template for because here's


---------09:07----------
what I was thinking about between the


---------09:08----------
last time we talked and now and actually


---------09:11----------
before we well say that and then we


---------09:14----------
should probably reintroduce you the


---------09:15----------
people that are watching for the first


---------09:16----------
time they'll be a lot of those people so


---------09:20----------
there are going to be people who don't


---------09:22----------
absorb the full percentage of what you


---------09:25----------
say or even they're gonna give you like


---------09:27----------
a certain amount of time of day that's


---------09:29----------
like relevant to their attention span


---------09:30----------
and how unjust they are in the subject


---------09:31----------
so as much as possible we have to work


---------09:34----------
to try to distill into a template like


---------09:37----------
objectively if you were going to infer


---------09:39----------
self-improvement what are some of the


---------09:40----------
things that people can do and why and I


---------09:44----------
think once we sort of like build the


---------09:45----------
foundation of that understanding and and


---------09:47----------
like at a high level and a granular


---------09:50----------
level


---------09:50----------
it'll be really clear yeah I mean I


---------09:53----------
think that's that's you know that's a


---------09:56----------
big task so I think somewhere along the


---------09:58----------
way like whenever I teach about


---------09:59----------
meditation and stuff like that people


---------10:00----------
ask me like oh this is really helpful is


---------10:02----------
there a book we can read and then the


---------10:05----------
really disappointing thing is I say no


---------10:07----------
so there are a lot of books on a


---------10:09----------
meditation out there but I think the


---------10:12----------
real problem with a lot of dissemination


---------10:14----------
of information is that especially in the


---------10:15----------
meditative world is you have teachers


---------10:17----------
who learn from their teachers who learn


---------10:20----------
from their teachers who learned from a


---------10:22----------
master and so they start following a


---------10:25----------
script and then they start to lose how


---------10:29----------
that script was made right so it's like


---------10:31----------
it's like you're instead of


---------10:33----------
understanding like equals mc-squared


---------10:34----------
you're just like copying and pasting


---------10:36----------
like iterations of that formula instead


---------10:39----------
of understanding the basic elements that


---------10:41----------
allow you to develop a meditative


---------10:44----------
tradition and I don't what's so weird


---------10:46----------
about that is that I feel like


---------10:48----------
meditation is ace introspective practice


---------10:51----------
that I guess if you just do it will bear


---------10:55----------
fruit but you're saying it doesn't


---------10:56----------
unless it's technique based like if


---------10:59----------
someone just starts medicine like so


---------11:01----------
happens is people emphasize the


---------11:03----------
technique right so if you go to a


---------11:05----------
meditation like a particular tradition


---------11:06----------
of meditation they're gonna say like for


---------11:09----------
example if you go to a Zen meditation


---------11:10----------
they're gonna say this is the way to


---------11:12----------
meditate yeah and they don't really


---------11:15----------
acknowledge that they're like thousands


---------11:16----------
of ways to meditate say they say this is


---------11:18----------
our way but like the person who


---------11:20----------
developed a Zen is the one who truly


---------11:22----------
understood it yeah and so what's


---------11:25----------
happening is like everyone else is just


---------11:27----------
following a playbook but like in order


---------11:29----------
to really understand the stuff in order


---------11:31----------
to do what you're talking about you have


---------11:33----------
to be


---------11:33----------
able to make the playbook you have to be


---------11:35----------
able to create your own place because


---------11:37----------
that's when you truly understand the


---------11:38----------
pieces involved did you ever read


---------11:40----------
Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse yeah many


---------11:42----------
years ago yeah there's a there's a scene


---------11:45----------
in it where so in Sidharth this world


---------11:47----------
Buddha already exists so Siddhartha is


---------11:50----------
going through the world and meets the


---------11:51----------
Buddha as a separate person who's


---------11:54----------
already become enlightened yeah and he


---------11:56----------
says exactly that to the Buddha he says


---------11:58----------
this is assuredly the absolute best path


---------12:01----------
to reach enlightenment that can be


---------12:03----------
taught the problem is that because I'm


---------12:05----------
lacking that self element I can't follow


---------12:07----------
it you have to go find that answer for


---------12:09----------
myself yeah sorry I think that that's


---------12:11----------
the challenge right is like creating


---------12:13----------
you're asking - you're saying like how


---------12:15----------
do we distill what we're talking about


---------12:17----------
to be like a road that people can follow


---------12:19----------
and honestly like I think if you wanted


---------12:22----------
so I'm working on that it's funny I sat


---------12:23----------
down and I actually result of the


---------12:26----------
streaming a lot of stuff is colas for me


---------12:27----------
and I wrote like three pages about


---------12:29----------
anxiety and like it's sort of like


---------12:31----------
everything you need to understand about


---------12:33----------
anxiety just pulled out and boil down to


---------12:34----------
three pages and it's like where does


---------12:37----------
anxiety come from why do we have anxiety


---------12:39----------
what are the collective physiologic


---------12:41----------
anxiety versus cognitive anxiety how do


---------12:44----------
how does anxiety affect your mind in the


---------12:46----------
moment and where the roots of anxiety so


---------12:49----------
if you're thinking about tackling


---------12:50----------
anxiety you have to tackle the roots of


---------12:52----------
it and you have to tackle the actual


---------12:54----------
activity like in your thought process in


---------12:56----------
the moment and that division is very


---------12:58----------
fundamental and so I think you know


---------13:02----------
that's my goal - the other wild and


---------13:05----------
crazy thought that I had was that so


---------13:07----------
I've been thinking about distilling


---------13:08----------
stuff - and I was thinking about like


---------13:10----------
you know we do a lot on Twitch and we


---------13:13----------
like you know I think twitch chat


---------13:14----------
appreciates what we do and that's why we


---------13:16----------
do it right so that people can watch and


---------13:18----------
learn but ultimately there's a part of


---------13:20----------
me that says that you know you're never


---------13:23----------
gonna learn like what you want us to do


---------13:26----------
Devin is not gonna be possible through


---------13:27----------
twitch that's why we're syndicating it


---------13:30----------
to YouTube every every talk that we do


---------13:33----------
goes yeah you're right well and actually


---------13:35----------
this is a fundamental problem with this


---------13:37----------
platform that I've talked about to


---------13:39----------
twitch a lot right and I don't know how


---------13:42----------
you solve it is like how do you


---------13:44----------
how do you convey meaningful information


---------13:48----------
that sticks with people and live


---------13:51----------
somewhere in a wide format very hard


---------13:53----------
yeah so I had a crazy idea which is a


---------13:56----------
little bit tangential to what you're


---------13:58----------
saying I was think so we held our first


---------13:59----------
retreat like our healthy gaming retreat


---------14:02----------
in August and it was a lot of fun we


---------14:05----------
went out to Yosemite National Park


---------14:06----------
gamers from all over the country showed


---------14:08----------
up and and it was it was fun and it was


---------14:12----------
like we I think it was like Wednesday to


---------14:14----------
Sunday and I had this idea that I'm kind


---------14:17----------
of tempted to just like just tell the


---------14:20----------
internet and this is probably a terrible


---------14:22----------
idea but just tell people that I'm gonna


---------14:25----------
be somewhere for ten days and if you


---------14:27----------
guys want to learn stuff like


---------14:29----------
legitimately learn like show just show


---------14:31----------
up and whoever wants to show up can show


---------14:34----------
up and we're just gonna like work


---------14:35----------
through this stuff we're gonna teach you


---------14:37----------
how to meditate we're gonna teach you


---------14:38----------
about anxiety we're gonna teach you


---------14:39----------
about whatever you want to learn about


---------14:40----------
and let's like workshop like make a


---------14:44----------
retreat where people can just show up


---------14:45----------
and then we're gonna get through


---------14:47----------
whatever we want to get through and we


---------14:50----------
sort of good go ahead


---------14:53----------
say there's a really interesting idea


---------14:55----------
and that is that what if you use your


---------14:57----------
twitch as a lead generation in to those


---------14:59----------
kind of events that do have that impact


---------15:00----------
what is a lead generation what does that


---------15:02----------
mean it's a marketing term that means


---------15:05----------
there's a if you imagine a funnel okay


---------15:07----------
and at the top is a big circle and at


---------15:10----------
the bottom is a very small bigot right


---------15:12----------
at the at the top everything sort of


---------15:14----------
falls into it and it gets shot out the


---------15:16----------
the so the top of the funnel would be


---------15:19----------
the way that you put ingredients in so


---------15:23----------
if you're gonna pour water into the


---------15:24----------
funnel imagine water as people that need


---------15:26----------
help for example yeah right all kind of


---------15:28----------
go down in the funnel and they end up in


---------15:29----------
the place you want them to be so in this


---------15:32----------
case the the the lead generation of mean


---------15:34----------
bringing new people into the funnel from


---------15:37----------
one source so they can come out into


---------15:39----------
another source so they come in from the


---------15:42----------
they come in from twitch for example and


---------15:44----------
they come out the other end onto a


---------15:45----------
seminar or a retreat or something that


---------15:48----------
you want them yeah I mean I think that's


---------15:50----------
because I'm just recognizing the


---------15:52----------
shortcomings of like just not being able


---------15:54----------
to help everyone right so I think a lot


---------15:57----------
of people learn from interviews and like


---------15:59----------
oh like what we're gonna talk about


---------16:00----------
today and stuff but ultimately I think


---------16:02----------
the most transformative experiences of


---------16:04----------
my life have been kind of like in person


---------16:07----------
where you're kind of working with


---------16:09----------
someone intensely and and if people want


---------16:11----------
to you know I don't think I think


---------16:13----------
they're issues of like scalability and


---------16:14----------
stuff so I think the upside of something


---------16:16----------
like twitch is that you can reach way


---------16:18----------
more people like you know you can reach


---------16:21----------
hundreds of people or thousands of


---------16:22----------
people or tens of thousands of people at


---------16:24----------
a time which you really can't do in a


---------16:26----------
retreat but I mean I think this is a


---------16:29----------
crazy idea for a couple of reasons cuz


---------16:31----------
like it's not it's not gonna be planned


---------16:32----------
and like I don't know who's gonna show


---------16:33----------
up I don't know if someone's like you


---------16:35----------
know if they're gonna be hygiene issues


---------16:37----------
or like if people are gonna be


---------16:38----------
respectful of each other and and things


---------16:40----------
like that like that's all problems like


---------16:42----------
I was just thinking the other day so we


---------16:45----------
had a bedbug scare in our house where


---------16:47----------
there was like concerned that we had


---------16:48----------
bedbugs and I have younger kids and they


---------16:50----------
pick up bedbugs from all kinds of places


---------16:52----------
and so like I was just thinking like


---------16:54----------
what if one dude like one [ __ ]


---------16:55----------
Internet role shows up with bedbugs but


---------16:58----------
like lice and then like our we're gonna


---------17:01----------
have to like quarantine and everyone is


---------17:02----------
gonna leave on day two because we're in


---------17:06----------
with disease like there's like there's


---------17:09----------
gaming conventions of like a hundred


---------17:12----------
thousand people that go to like PAX West


---------17:14----------
or whatever and and have it had some


---------17:16----------
kind of epic pandemic beyond you know


---------17:18----------
the flu or whatever which is miraculous


---------17:21----------
it is yeah it makes you really think


---------17:23----------
about the sort of the sort of divine


---------17:28----------
wave that there must be to to make that


---------17:30----------
kind of stuff happen I can't believe


---------17:31----------
something hasn't happened to yeah some


---------17:33----------
mutated virus hasn't come out of a


---------17:35----------
gaming event and killed us all yeah yeah


---------17:38----------
in terms of in terms of twitch there's


---------17:42----------
an interesting thing about scale is that


---------17:43----------
you you always have to continuously do


---------17:45----------
things that get you the greatest


---------17:47----------
awareness possible because of the way


---------17:49----------
the scale works if you can make one


---------17:52----------
person's life or ten people's life fifty


---------17:54----------
percent better you can make a thousand


---------17:55----------
people's lives one percent better right


---------17:57----------
the the right answer I think is to do


---------18:00----------
both but twitch is one of those


---------18:02----------
platforms that you can really uniquely


---------18:04----------
do that because there's gonna be so many


---------18:05----------
people that don't even you don't even


---------18:08----------
ever meet by the way right because the


---------18:10----------
vast majority of people that are in your


---------18:11----------
chat we're not talking listening and and


---------18:15----------
those people will walk away with impact


---------18:16----------
that you may never hear about or months


---------18:18----------
later you'll get an email from somebody


---------18:19----------
that's like hey this small catalyst was


---------18:23----------
enough for me to change X well yeah


---------18:25----------
that's the reason you stay on twitch


---------18:27----------
right now


---------18:28----------
yeah it's funny I did a reddit AMA like


---------18:30----------
a year ago and I still get messages from


---------18:32----------
people from it so one reason for that


---------18:35----------
though is because reddit lives right so


---------18:37----------
that that AMA still exists yes somewhere


---------18:39----------
it actually found it I think when I was


---------18:41----------
looking for stuff for yeah yeah so like


---------18:44----------
the one problem with twitch is like once


---------18:46----------
that vaad goes there there isn't a no


---------18:48----------
dies yeah right yeah


---------18:51----------
so that's one of the reasons why I I


---------18:54----------
think it's really important to sort of


---------18:55----------
document your whole twitch journey by


---------18:57----------
editing every video and putting it


---------18:59----------
somewhere I think it's absolutely


---------19:01----------
imperative yeah I think so far we're


---------19:04----------
doing that so good all of the interviews


---------19:06----------
if you guys want it yeah so if you want


---------19:09----------
to see I think the first meme of our


---------19:11----------
channel was born on today's Friday on


---------19:13----------
Wednesday and it was with us guy who was


---------19:16----------
unclear whether he was like I think he


---------19:18----------
was you know I think he's just not from


---------19:21----------
the US so his pattern of speaking was a


---------19:23----------
little bit different but there was some


---------19:25----------
concern that he was a troll I think it's


---------19:26----------
just he was just speaking differently I


---------19:28----------
do wonder a little bit if honestly I


---------19:30----------
wonder if he was high but you know but I


---------19:35----------
think it's just it's a probably just a


---------19:38----------
foreign accent and maybe a dick thought


---------19:39----------
for me to have but yeah so I think where


---------19:43----------
we're trying to chop up videos and so


---------19:44----------
people can watch if there's like issues


---------19:46----------
that are relevant to them so we've


---------19:47----------
talked about self judgment we've talked


---------19:49----------
about we talked some about borderline


---------19:52----------
personality disorder we talked some


---------19:54----------
about you know how like what kind of


---------19:57----------
patterns we get into when we date people


---------19:58----------
we talked about feelings of inadequacy


---------20:01----------
and and kind of how to move forward so


---------20:04----------
all that stuff is sort of being collated


---------20:06----------
so I'm behind what you're saying man


---------20:09----------
excellent yeah I stayed here I got there


---------20:12----------
YouTube pulled up I'll link it in chat


---------20:13----------
to you guys should subscribe to this


---------20:15----------
there's a lot of so what are we talking


---------20:17----------
about today Devon well let's start off


---------20:21----------
with like


---------20:23----------
so people are know from your from the


---------20:25----------
title that your psychiatrist but can you


---------20:29----------
give like a short overview of who you


---------20:32----------
are so for people that are new sure so


---------20:36----------
um like 60 seconds Oh


---------20:39----------
however long you want yeah so ill


---------20:42----------
conveys the message sure so my name is


---------20:44----------
olive Kanodia I'm a psychiatrist I


---------20:46----------
practice in Boston Massachusetts my


---------20:49----------
practice is kind of has like two pieces


---------20:51----------
to it I spent several years studying to


---------20:54----------
become a monk before going to medical


---------20:55----------
school and that was actually I get


---------20:58----------
things I guess things start with me


---------20:59----------
almost failing out of college due to


---------21:01----------
being addicted to video games and just


---------21:03----------
playing too many video games all the


---------21:04----------
time which oddly enough is not something


---------21:06----------
I regret I actually had a lot of fun


---------21:08----------
those years and play just a bunch of


---------21:11----------
video games almost failed out and then


---------21:13----------
decided something needed to change so I


---------21:15----------
ended up going to India the summer after


---------21:18----------
my sophomore year and decided then to


---------21:20----------
become a monk and spent about seven


---------21:22----------
years coming back and forth between


---------21:23----------
India in the u.s. studying yoga and


---------21:25----------
meditation ended up meeting my wife and


---------21:28----------
so then that made the monk and celibacy


---------21:31----------
thing a little bit tricky and so also


---------21:35----------
she wanted to be married to a doctor so


---------21:37----------
I decided to go to medical school and


---------21:39----------
did did a few years of neuroscience


---------21:44----------
research studied medicine and then


---------21:46----------
ultimately became a psychiatrist trained


---------21:48----------
up here in Boston and now I'm I still


---------21:51----------
have a staff position at McLean Hospital


---------21:53----------
and I'm instructor in psychiatry at


---------21:55----------
Harvard Medical School which is where I


---------21:57----------
trained and most of what I do now in my


---------22:01----------
practice is actually like holistic


---------22:02----------
psychiatry so I incorporate meditation


---------22:05----------
Eastern medicine nutrition different


---------22:09----------
kinds of psychotherapy and I do a lot of


---------22:11----------
like performance enhancement sort of


---------22:13----------
psychotherapy so optimizing your


---------22:15----------
performance I work with a lot of


---------22:16----------
investment bankers entrepreneurs CEOs


---------22:19----------
NFL athletes and more recently eSports


---------22:22----------
athletes so that's that's been a lot of


---------22:26----------
funds and then on the other side I've


---------22:28----------
started working with gamers so half of


---------22:30----------
my time is spent just working with


---------22:32----------
people who are


---------22:33----------
I want to say to start off with like


---------22:35----------
addicted to video games but I think a


---------22:37----------
lot of times there are other issues at


---------22:38----------
play like issues of confidence or issues


---------22:40----------
of shame not understanding like what


---------22:44----------
emotions are going on like not


---------22:45----------
understanding their behaviors why is it


---------22:48----------
that they can't do anything besides play


---------22:50----------
video games in the central question that


---------22:52----------
I work with gamers on and this I think


---------22:54----------
is the biggest problem for gamers is


---------22:56----------
they're very analytically intelligent


---------22:58----------
and so they know what the right answer


---------23:00----------
is they just can't seem to do it


---------23:01----------
so what I really help gamers do is


---------23:04----------
bridge the gap between like being able


---------23:06----------
like is that the funny thing is most


---------23:08----------
people don't know what to do but gamers


---------23:10----------
know what to do they just can't bring


---------23:11----------
themselves to do it and that's a lot of


---------23:14----------
the work that I do now and that's


---------23:16----------
because at the end of the day you know


---------23:18----------
as much as I like I enjoy working with


---------23:20----------
my clients and like investment banking


---------23:21----------
and stuff I find that work engaging but


---------23:24----------
I actually don't care about Investment


---------23:25----------
Banking as a feel like I don't you know


---------23:28----------
I care about gamers and I like I'm a


---------23:29----------
gamer and I like gamers and I feel good


---------23:31----------
with gamers so that's who I am that's


---------23:33----------
what I do


---------23:36----------
um so for for me the idea of breaching


---------23:43----------
that gap what we started to talk about


---------23:45----------
last week um intense versus manifesting


---------23:49----------
action is the most interesting thing


---------23:51----------
because it is absolutely my biggest


---------23:53----------
problem for sure so I have a personal


---------23:55----------
connection to that I get I guess where


---------23:59----------
we could start is how much do we


---------24:04----------
understand right now about the brain and


---------24:09----------
the control we have over it because I


---------24:12----------
think when you look at neuroscience as a


---------24:14----------
field there's a lot of pop science I


---------24:18----------
think is what it's called


---------24:19----------
we're like people write these sort of


---------24:21----------
books about it and it's like a 200-page


---------24:25----------
thing that's like distilled from a


---------24:26----------
couple of studies and it ends up being a


---------24:28----------
New York Times bestseller that everyone


---------24:30----------
thinks that that's the way that you


---------24:31----------
think about things right yeah and then


---------24:33----------
there's other people that are trying to


---------24:34----------
get a little bit deeper into it like


---------24:36----------
Daniel Kaufman or Thinking Fast and Slow


---------24:37----------
but like I've I don't feel like


---------24:41----------
the I don't feel like people really


---------24:44----------
understand and I don't understand what


---------24:47----------
we actually know about how we can


---------24:50----------
control this thing


---------24:51----------
but because after a little bit of that


---------24:54----------
that's our mind because after a little


---------24:56----------
bit of like exportation of it I've just


---------24:58----------
realized how little I seem to have power


---------24:59----------
oh yeah so I think if you want to


---------25:02----------
understand your mind you have to take a


---------25:04----------
step back and in a weird way I think


---------25:05----------
you're looking for answers in the wrong


---------25:07----------
place okay


---------25:08----------
so let's remember that medicine is about


---------25:11----------
populations right so the field of


---------25:14----------
neuroscience tries to understand like


---------25:17----------
different parts of the brain and tries


---------25:18----------
to figure out okay the amygdala governs


---------25:20----------
our fear and survival response our


---------25:23----------
frontal lobes are the things that give


---------25:27----------
us impulse control and allow us to plan


---------25:29----------
and execute actions but what medicine is


---------25:33----------
focused on is not the individual it's


---------25:36----------
focused on like the common elements of


---------25:38----------
humans and I think the biggest challenge


---------25:41----------
that people face is if you're looking


---------25:43----------
for neuroscience to give you an answer


---------25:44----------
into like how you can be a more


---------25:47----------
productive human being I think you're


---------25:48----------
looking in the wrong place because


---------25:50----------
neuroscience is about averages medicine


---------25:52----------
is about averages so let me just give


---------25:55----------
you an example so do you know how we


---------25:58----------
came up with the 2,000 calories a day


---------26:00----------
FDA recommendation No


---------26:04----------
so in 1960 or 1950 there was something


---------26:08----------
called the Ann Haynes study where


---------26:10----------
basically like the Food and Drug


---------26:12----------
Administration or Department of Public


---------26:15----------
Health I don't know I think it was the


---------26:16----------
FDA sent out a survey to Americans and


---------26:18----------
said are you healthy and what do you eat


---------26:21----------
over the course of a week and then what


---------26:24----------
they did is they took all the people


---------26:25----------
that are healthy and they averaged what


---------26:27----------
they ate and they broke it down into


---------26:29----------
like calories carbs fat and protein and


---------26:32----------
they said okay this is our


---------26:34----------
recommendation in its 2,000 calories a


---------26:36----------
day


---------26:38----------
and so that's not based on any science


---------26:40----------
and it's not based on any individuality


---------26:42----------
it's just based on the average of what


---------26:45----------
people eat and so Natick all the people


---------26:49----------
that are healthy what does that mean so


---------26:50----------
like people who said I have no diseases


---------26:52----------
they took their answers and they


---------26:55----------
averaged them all together and that's


---------26:57----------
how they came up with it huh


---------26:58----------
subjectively yes okay


---------27:01----------
they just said like are you healthy like


---------27:03----------
you do you take any medication do you


---------27:06----------
have any diseases and people who said no


---------27:08----------
for both of those are the ones that they


---------27:11----------
took their answers and they average them


---------27:13----------
altogether and then we have a 2,000


---------27:14----------
calorie and a recommendation 50 years


---------27:16----------
later has there been silence since then


---------27:18----------
on that that people must have gone back


---------27:20----------
and looked at it and seen if there was


---------27:22----------
no or people just assume that that's the


---------27:25----------
answer that that's what we hear like


---------27:29----------
it's crazy


---------27:29----------
okay so like we know a lot so I can


---------27:31----------
study like in this is what you have to


---------27:34----------
understand is that medicine is about


---------27:35----------
averages so when they say that like the


---------27:38----------
amygdala governs a fear response the way


---------27:40----------
that they do that because this is the


---------27:41----------
way that medicine works right so they


---------27:43----------
take a they take 50 people and they scan


---------27:46----------
their brains and they say okay we're


---------27:48----------
gonna show 50 people like pictures of


---------27:49----------
zombies and we're gonna see how much


---------27:51----------
part of the brain lights up and for each


---------27:53----------
person their response to a zombie is


---------27:56----------
gonna be different but then what happens


---------27:58----------
is we drop we average all of their brain


---------28:00----------
scans and we say okay this is the part


---------28:02----------
that governs fear but what you have to


---------28:04----------
remember is that like each person is


---------28:06----------
like that's gonna apply poorly to any


---------28:08----------
individual person so any conclusion from


---------28:12----------
medicine is going to apply so from


---------28:14----------
scientific research is gonna apply to


---------28:17----------
very few people you get that no because


---------28:22----------
it seems to me that if you make a


---------28:24----------
conclusion based on the average response


---------28:26----------
to something then it would follow that


---------28:28----------
the average person would respond in that


---------28:30----------
way absolute not every single person is


---------28:32----------
but but but the highest count that we


---------28:35----------
can get beautiful Devin so let me ask


---------28:37----------
you something if you want to develop a


---------28:38----------
strategy so that your intentions become


---------28:40----------
manifestations do you want to develop


---------28:42----------
that strategy based on the average


---------28:44----------
person or based on you


---------28:47----------
ultimately it has to be on you but you


---------28:49----------
have to have some kind of observational


---------28:50----------
hypothesis first to be able to even have


---------28:51----------
an idea of how to do it absolutely I


---------28:53----------
completely agree with you so then the


---------28:55----------
question becomes where does your


---------28:56----------
observational hypothesis come from so


---------28:59----------
you can I would assume studies averages


---------29:00----------
things like that yeah so yeah


---------29:02----------
what would a yogi say


---------29:05----------
they would probably say to just go do it


---------29:07----------
yourself and figure it out right yep


---------29:09----------
yeah I think that's gonna be better all


---------29:12----------
right so I think you can use a lot of


---------29:13----------
neuroscience for sure I think you should


---------29:16----------
I mean like I'm I I've studied I mean


---------29:18----------
I'm a neuroscience researcher or not


---------29:20----------
anymore but I used to be and so I'm a


---------29:21----------
big fan of neuroscience I got really


---------29:23----------
excited about neuroscience I think it's


---------29:24----------
huge but I think if you're talking about


---------29:26----------
individual transformation you can read


---------29:29----------
as many studies as you want to on


---------29:30----------
neuroscience and like all of those


---------29:32----------
studies are gonna be about the average


---------29:33----------
person they're not going to be about you


---------29:36----------
so ultimately you can use that as a


---------29:39----------
starting point so like I'm not saying


---------29:41----------
you shouldn't use that information but


---------29:43----------
I'm saying if you're really thinking


---------29:44----------
about how to transform your life like


---------29:46----------
it's been my experience that you know


---------29:49----------
there's neuroscience


---------29:51----------
there's applied neuroscience there's


---------29:55----------
psychology and then there's like


---------29:57----------
psychotherapy like do you see that that


---------30:00----------
spectrum that we're moving from like


---------30:03----------
general knowledge to individual change


---------30:09----------
I do see that especially with the advent


---------30:11----------
of I think more Eastern practice in the


---------30:13----------
West the the problem with the totally


---------30:17----------
personal quest is that there is no


---------30:19----------
sounding board for it so what I mean by


---------30:21----------
that is there's no way for me


---------30:23----------
individually to tell how much control I


---------30:26----------
have over myself especially if I don't


---------30:29----------
yet have control over myself so the only


---------30:32----------
way for me to do that is to go to


---------30:33----------
studies or go to our understanding of


---------30:36----------
science to help buff at that does that


---------30:38----------
make sense no not at all


---------30:40----------
so okay let me challenge that so when


---------30:44----------
you say that there's no sounding board


---------30:46----------
like so what like so let's say that you


---------30:48----------
have an assumption that you have 50%


---------30:50----------
control over over yourself uh-huh and


---------30:53----------
then you go and you read a neuroscience


---------30:54----------
study about motivation like how is that


---------30:56----------
gonna help you figure out how much


---------30:57----------
control you have over yourself like how


---------31:00----------
is that an effective sounding board


---------31:01----------
because it's the only signing board


---------31:04----------
because I have no idea what my potential


---------31:07----------
is right so if I set if I set out to


---------31:11----------
complete ten things and then I complete


---------31:13----------
two things and then the next day I


---------31:14----------
complete four things the next day I


---------31:16----------
complete know things right I have no


---------31:18----------
idea what the hell is going on but if


---------31:19----------
there's a study that says on average


---------31:21----------
human beings do five things at there at


---------31:23----------
this level once they do these practices


---------31:25----------
I can use that as a sounding board to


---------31:27----------
self-improve right


---------31:29----------
I understand where your logic is I just


---------31:31----------
disagree with you because I think that


---------31:32----------
the problem here is that you're judging


---------31:34----------
yourself based on the average person and


---------31:36----------
like that's not a good way to judge


---------31:39----------
yourself but my argument would be there


---------31:41----------
is no other way to judge yourself


---------31:43----------
oh sure there is you can just judge


---------31:45----------
yourself purely subjectively right so


---------31:47----------
it's not so like do you stop at five


---------31:49----------
because that's the average do you stop


---------31:50----------
at six because that's the average you're


---------31:52----------
above average


---------31:55----------
you would you would stop when you got to


---------31:57----------
your point but mmm okay here this might


---------32:00----------
be a better way to say it okay um let's


---------32:02----------
take something that's like more that


---------32:04----------
that's like less subjective like mine


---------32:07----------
stuff let's take something like physical


---------32:09----------
okay so we know that after like a


---------32:11----------
certain a certain amount of


---------32:12----------
cardiovascular training a human being


---------32:14----------
can run a mile and a certain number of


---------32:16----------
minutes right


---------32:17----------
okay helps to know that because if you


---------32:20----------
are doing something like an army PT test


---------32:22----------
where you where you need to create an


---------32:25----------
average of people to perform at a


---------32:27----------
fitness level that you know to


---------32:29----------
accomplish certain tasks right then what


---------32:32----------
you do is you set up a series of studies


---------32:35----------
that determine what that level of


---------32:36----------
fitness is and then you apply that


---------32:39----------
across an average population so maybe


---------32:41----------
the best example to use when we're


---------32:42----------
talking about averages is the army right


---------32:44----------
we're yeah


---------32:45----------
so come I completely agree but let's so


---------32:47----------
now you're talking about a different


---------32:49----------
thing because you're talking about a


---------32:50----------
standard for a population and I think is


---------32:53----------
what medicine is yeah so I think if you


---------32:56----------
want to use a populace oh if I like


---------32:57----------
let's talk about like how you become


---------33:00----------
licensed to be a doctor so I have my own


---------33:02----------
individual barometer of like my


---------33:05----------
understanding of medicine okay and I


---------33:07----------
don't think it matters how much more or


---------33:10----------
less I know about medicine than the


---------33:13----------
average person like the important thing


---------33:15----------
to me is whether I'm satisfied with my


---------33:17----------
knowledge and whether my knowledge is


---------33:19----------
sufficient to help the people that I


---------33:20----------
want to help


---------33:22----------
oh now that's a personal journey now if


---------33:25----------
I want to be a practicing physician I


---------33:27----------
sure as well sure as hell want to know


---------33:30----------
what I need to get on the licensing


---------33:32----------
exams to get a license Yeah right so I


---------33:35----------
agree with you there that if you're


---------33:37----------
talking about but in that moment I'm not


---------33:39----------
like an individual I'm someone who's


---------33:40----------
trying to be to hit a certain benchmark


---------33:43----------
to become part of a population does that


---------33:45----------
make sense it makes it makes sense so


---------33:48----------
but my question would be can you imagine


---------33:51----------
a world where science actually goes into


---------33:54----------
the mind enough that it disproves a


---------33:57----------
concept like willpower for example


---------34:00----------
I mean I think if science disproves


---------34:02----------
willpower that's fine I think that the


---------34:04----------
challenge is that that doesn't help the


---------34:06----------
individual so well understand do you


---------34:09----------
think that understanding our limits


---------34:10----------
helps well understand our limits our


---------34:13----------
understanding what are what are and are


---------34:14----------
not our limits would help an individual


---------34:16----------
on their personal quest as to what would


---------34:18----------
towards what we're talking about so our


---------34:20----------
understanding are limits on a personal


---------34:22----------
level or on a scientific level on a


---------34:23----------
scientific level


---------34:25----------
I mean I think it helps so I think this


---------34:28----------
this is where it kind of comes back to


---------34:29----------
what you're saying about kind of


---------34:31----------
hypothesis generation so I think science


---------34:33----------
is useful in terms of helping us sort of


---------34:36----------
like start the process of self


---------34:38----------
exploration okay right so I think sign


---------34:41----------
up so like it's useful to know for


---------34:43----------
example from science I think this is but


---------34:46----------
ultimately it comes down to the


---------34:47----------
individual I think it's useful to know


---------34:50----------
for example that our frontal lobes and


---------34:52----------
our amygdala have a reciprocal


---------34:54----------
inhibition so that mean


---------34:57----------
so the frontal lobe is the part of our


---------34:59----------
brain that allows us to do the things


---------35:01----------
that we should do it allows things like


---------35:03----------
impulse control it allows things like


---------35:05----------
delaying gratification okay and then we


---------35:09----------
also know that that the frontal lobe


---------35:11----------
does a good job of shutting off our


---------35:13----------
amygdala which is in our limbic system


---------35:15----------
which is kind of our centers of negative


---------35:16----------
emotion we also know that our amygdala


---------35:19----------
and limbic system our centers of emotion


---------35:21----------
shut down the frontal lobe so I think


---------35:24----------
it's a useful mechanism to understand


---------35:26----------
that like when I get emotional my


---------35:28----------
ability to delay gratification and


---------35:31----------
control my impulses goes down mm-hmm and


---------35:34----------
it's also important to know that if i


---------35:36----------
strengthen my frontal lobe the better I


---------35:38----------
get at delaying gratification the less


---------35:40----------
power emotions will have over me


---------35:42----------
there's a reciprocal inhibition so both


---------35:45----------
of them sure each one has the ability to


---------35:47----------
shut off the other but I think in a


---------35:50----------
simple way like you can study science to


---------35:52----------
arrive at that conclusion and then I can


---------35:55----------
just ask you the simple question Devin


---------35:58----------
when you're pissed off do you make good


---------35:59----------
decisions or bad decisions yeah


---------36:01----------
typically bad right and like ultimately


---------36:05----------
like we needed a thousand studies to


---------36:07----------
teach us that lesson


---------36:09----------
well you might have needed a thousand


---------36:11----------
someone probably needed a thousand hours


---------36:12----------
of meditation to ask that question


---------36:14----------
absolutely right so I think that that in


---------36:17----------
my experience so what I find is actually


---------36:19----------
one of the biggest things that and maybe


---------36:22----------
I have a bias because of the people that


---------36:23----------
I work with I work with people who are


---------36:25----------
highly motivated and highly successful


---------36:28----------
and one of the biggest problems that


---------36:30----------
they have in terms of finding peace or


---------36:32----------
happiness and this is true of gamers too


---------36:34----------
is that they enter a comparative mindset


---------36:37----------
yeah and the big problem that I have


---------36:39----------
with the spirit of what you're saying


---------36:41----------
like I don't think we should abandon


---------36:43----------
neuroscience like I use it a lot I use


---------36:45----------
it every day


---------36:45----------
the problem is that when you set your


---------36:48----------
standard when you assume a standard that


---------36:50----------
is external or comparative because if if


---------36:54----------
you set a standard and you say most


---------36:56----------
people are able to achieve five tasks a


---------36:58----------
day and you're able to achieve - like


---------37:01----------
how does that help you today all it


---------37:04----------
tells you is that you're doing a shitty


---------37:05----------
job like that doesn't actually like


---------37:07----------
that's all it tells me but if it tells


---------37:09----------
you that you can do that then it could


---------37:11----------
give you the impetus to improve I agree


---------37:14----------
but I think that in a weird way I'm not


---------37:16----------
sure that you can do that right because


---------37:19----------
in this moment I don't know that it's


---------37:21----------
actually possible for you to do five


---------37:23----------
tasks right like I think you have to


---------37:27----------
focus on doing two tasks tomorrow so I


---------37:29----------
think that the problem with setting an


---------37:31----------
external standard for yourself is that I


---------37:33----------
mean let's just think about it this way


---------37:35----------
so you know I look around and I see that


---------37:38----------
all my friends are I'm just thinking


---------37:40----------
about myself like back in high school I


---------37:42----------
look around at all my friends and and


---------37:44----------
see that like they have girlfriends and


---------37:46----------
I don't and so I know it's theoretically


---------37:48----------
possible for me to have a girlfriend and


---------37:50----------
I can try to work at it but in a weird


---------37:52----------
way like the way that I ended up getting


---------37:54----------
actually getting a girlfriend is has


---------37:56----------
nothing to do with striving to get a


---------37:58----------
girlfriend which doesn't mean that there


---------38:02----------
isn't positive stuff that can come out


---------38:04----------
of like striving to get a girlfriend but


---------38:06----------
I would argue that it's actually like


---------38:08----------
damaging to strive for that and most of


---------38:11----------
the people that I work with I'd say that


---------38:12----------
if you want a girlfriend actually don't


---------38:14----------
try to get a girlfriend just focus on


---------38:15----------
yourself and become a better person and


---------38:17----------
you'll become like more attractive to


---------38:19----------
other people and oftentimes as they make


---------38:22----------
a comparison to other


---------38:23----------
they're looking for something that


---------38:25----------
someone else has which in turn blinds


---------38:28----------
them to what they actually would benefit


---------38:30----------
from so it's damaging to strive for it


---------38:33----------
because you're going after the wrong


---------38:36----------
reasons for pursuing it versus it's an X


---------38:41----------
whenever you go after something what


---------38:42----------
you're saying is when you go after


---------38:43----------
something that is externally driven


---------38:45----------
you're not gonna get a response that's


---------38:48----------
authentic to yourself absolutely if


---------38:51----------
we're talking if your main question is


---------38:53----------
how does intention how can if I want to


---------38:55----------
do something and I want to make that a


---------38:57----------
reality I think the more that you focus


---------39:00----------
on yourself and the less you use an


---------39:02----------
external standard the better you're


---------39:04----------
gonna be at being able to do that


---------39:07----------
so we talk about jobs we talk about


---------39:10----------
careers but we don't talk about callings


---------39:12----------
and I think that's a big problem


---------39:17----------
you tell me


---------39:20----------
talk about jobs and we talk about


---------39:22----------
careers but we don't talk about calling


---------39:31----------
I would say that maybe a calling in the


---------39:35----------
way that you're describing it is Devin


---------39:37----------
why do you stream it why do I stream


---------39:40----------
yeah to make the greatest amount of


---------39:43----------
positive impact on people is that a job


---------39:46----------
I'm a weird case cuz I don't need to do


---------39:48----------
it cuz I do another job but most people


---------39:51----------
probably stream to make money or like as


---------39:54----------
a job yeah I don't do that as a job okay


---------39:56----------
so so yeah so case in point right so


---------40:00----------
like that's something like do you do you


---------40:02----------
when you stream how do you feel about


---------40:05----------
yourself usually pretty bad okay


---------40:12----------
streaming is extremely difficult it's


---------40:14----------
really negative most of the time and it


---------40:16----------
requires like really long hours and


---------40:18----------
there's just a lot of negativity on the


---------40:20----------
internet that gets to me okay


---------40:22----------
yeah so I sort of actually broadcast in


---------40:25----------
spite of that and and I know like the


---------40:27----------
maybe the typical answer is supposed to


---------40:29----------
be like oh like I feel so great I feel


---------40:30----------
like I'm achieving my calling and stuff


---------40:32----------
it's more like an obligation of


---------40:34----------
something that I feel like I should do


---------40:36----------
because I'm providing value which is


---------40:40----------
just like I have to sit so beautiful


---------40:42----------
it's not the wrong answer Devin it's the


---------40:44----------
right answer it's the best answer so now


---------40:47----------
this is very very important to


---------40:49----------
understand most human beings when they


---------40:51----------
have an intention what gets in the way


---------40:54----------
is the negative feelings or negative


---------40:57----------
outcomes you get that yeah and somehow


---------41:03----------
you are able to do something in spite of


---------41:07----------
those negative feelings or negative


---------41:09----------
outcomes you have somehow stumbled upon


---------41:11----------
the silver bullet which is to do


---------41:13----------
something even though it hurts


---------41:16----------
yeah but I feel like that this creates


---------41:18----------
over a perpetually sucks that we need to


---------41:24----------
work on yeah so we can work on that so


---------41:27----------
that's it sounds like that's what we're


---------41:28----------
talking about today but but I just want


---------41:32----------
you to like legit spas and think about


---------41:34----------
this for a second you're able to like


---------41:36----------
enter this shitstorm of streaming on a


---------41:39----------
daily basis


---------41:42----------
and there's a part of you that hates


---------41:44----------
doing it and yet if we think about what


---------41:46----------
are the things that get in the way from


---------41:48----------
intention to manifestation isn't it the


---------41:51----------
bad stuff like if becoming a millionaire


---------41:53----------
was like involved eating burritos every


---------41:56----------
day like people could do it like you


---------41:59----------
could give gaming and like eating sushi


---------42:01----------
and traveling the world was what was


---------42:04----------
necessary to become a millionaire


---------42:05----------
everyone could do it


---------42:07----------
the reason that becoming a millionaire


---------42:09----------
is hard is because you have to do things


---------42:11----------
that you don't like to do in what I hear


---------42:14----------
from you is that you're able to do


---------42:16----------
things that are actually painful and


---------42:18----------
difficult for you but somehow you find


---------42:20----------
the strength to get up every day and do


---------42:22----------
it yeah eventually never one time but


---------42:26----------
yeah that's that's fine yeah right so


---------42:29----------
let's just think about this for a second


---------42:31----------
if we have a life where we're no longer


---------42:34----------
restricted by pain suffering and


---------42:37----------
negative emotions and negative feedback


---------42:40----------
and we can do things in spite of that


---------42:42----------
like imagine how much control you have


---------42:44----------
over your life


---------42:48----------
I doesn't make sense to me if we live


---------42:50----------
the life without negative new notions we


---------42:52----------
have a lot of control so sorry


---------42:54----------
no no not without if we lived a life


---------42:56----------
where negative negative experiences did


---------43:00----------
not prevent us from doing the things


---------43:02----------
that we want to do did not prevent us


---------43:04----------
from doing them yeah how much freedom do


---------43:05----------
you have in life I would assume a lot


---------43:08----------
assuming that's the assuming that's the


---------43:10----------
actual barrier but I'm not sure it is


---------43:13----------
okay I think many people it's it's one


---------43:17----------
big one right because generally speaking


---------43:19----------
people don't do things because they're


---------43:20----------
hard they do things that are easy like


---------43:22----------
why do people play video games because


---------43:23----------
it's [ __ ] easy


---------43:25----------
yeah but don't you think there's do you


---------43:27----------
think that there's also sort of a


---------43:29----------
societal or cultural aspect of this


---------43:32----------
where we have sort of pushed the tasks


---------43:36----------
so like once you get into doing things


---------43:39----------
like pay-per-click advertising for


---------43:42----------
example and you're like it's not like


---------43:44----------
really technical work and it's actually


---------43:45----------
pretty fun it's almost like a game in of


---------43:47----------
itself to figure out like these


---------43:48----------
demographics in like these audiences


---------43:49----------
it's actually really similar to gaming


---------43:51----------
it's kind of weird how that it's a


---------43:52----------
parallel but we've sort of as a society


---------43:55----------
push these topics over here and said


---------43:56----------
these are not fun and now everyone sort


---------43:59----------
of grown up knowing that how much of it


---------44:01----------
do you think like in terms of


---------44:04----------
distribution of these tasks is actually


---------44:06----------
stuff that human beings don't want to do


---------44:08----------
or just think they think they don't want


---------44:09----------
I don't understand your question it's


---------44:13----------
important because


---------44:16----------
what's these the millionaire burrito


---------44:18----------
example that you had so so you said if


---------44:20----------
being a millionaire was easy and


---------44:21----------
everyone just had to eat burritos to do


---------44:23----------
it they would do it but but what if


---------44:25----------
society as a whole


---------44:26----------
just like believed that burrito eating


---------44:30----------
was really difficult not fun and


---------44:33----------
disgusting okay like what I'm saying is


---------44:36----------
this is a really hard concept as much


---------44:38----------
for me to get this right but


---------44:41----------
the tasks that move people to the top of


---------44:45----------
hierarchies they be cut they are


---------44:48----------
difficult and uncommon


---------44:53----------
by virtue of a sort of cultural


---------44:55----------
significance around that thing right


---------44:56----------
like like there's people say building a


---------44:59----------
business is difficult but we don't know


---------45:01----------
that building a business is actually


---------45:02----------
that difficult but there's been a lot of


---------45:05----------
like societal stigma around it and now


---------45:08----------
the perception is the difficult so many


---------45:09----------
people don't even try yeah so let me see


---------45:11----------
if I understand you so how much of how


---------45:14----------
much of our perception see your so my


---------45:16----------
okay let's just track back exactly how


---------45:19----------
much of a section is social barriers


---------45:21----------
psychologically I am making a claim that


---------45:24----------
if you are no longer controlled by your


---------45:26----------
negative experiences you have freedom in


---------45:28----------
life and what you intend will become


---------45:30----------
real that is the claim you're making and


---------45:33----------
you are saying but how much of so that


---------45:37----------
involves like freedom from negative


---------45:38----------
experience but your responses how much


---------45:41----------
of our definition of negative experience


---------45:43----------
is determined by society and may be


---------45:45----------
false right which matters because even


---------45:48----------
if you get rid of the negative


---------45:50----------
experience you still have that barrier


---------45:51----------
after that if that's true I yeah so now


---------45:53----------
we come back to what I was saying


---------45:55----------
earlier which is this is why you should


---------45:57----------
not look externally for a comparison bar


---------46:00----------
all right so then let's go back to that


---------46:03----------
question should say let's assume that


---------46:06----------
what let's assume that's right and that


---------46:09----------
we can't look externally


---------46:12----------
where do we look and I know the answer


---------46:14----------
isn't obviously into the self because


---------46:16----------
that doesn't mean anything


---------46:16----------
no no I know so so I think I think we


---------46:18----------
look at so what we're what we're


---------46:20----------
highlighting now is the difference


---------46:22----------
between a job in a calling okay


---------46:26----------
like a job is what society tells you to


---------46:28----------
do in order to be successful insecure a


---------46:30----------
calling is something that like you you


---------46:32----------
feel like is a duty or a responsibility


---------46:34----------
last time we talked about Dharma you


---------46:36----------
remember that and you said that like


---------46:38----------
you're the reason that you stream is


---------46:39----------
because you feel like it's an obligation


---------46:41----------
yeah


---------46:42----------
do to your responsibility yeah so you do


---------46:45----------
this because you see that something is


---------46:46----------
wrong in the world and that you feel


---------46:48----------
like you have the capacity to try to fix


---------46:50----------
it exactly and that's where you get the


---------46:52----------
strength to deal with trolls the


---------46:54----------
negative emotions that whatever makes it


---------46:55----------
difficult for you to stream yes and you


---------46:58----------
also say that the you know some people


---------47:00----------
make premises like Oh starting a


---------47:01----------
business is hard whereas what you're


---------47:03----------
telling me is that you actually really


---------47:04----------
enjoy doing things that other people


---------47:06----------
find to be boring or difficult and you


---------47:08----------
thrive off of that absolutely and so I


---------47:11----------
think what you're doing is exactly what


---------47:13----------
I'm advocating which is stop looking at


---------47:16----------
what other people are doing and start to


---------47:18----------
think a little bit about what is it that


---------47:19----------
you enjoy what is it that you want to do


---------47:23----------
what is the change that you want to see


---------47:24----------
in the world and then like take a stab


---------47:27----------
at it I mean this is a fancy way of


---------47:29----------
saying look in the self but I think


---------47:30----------
looking in the self is very difficult


---------47:32----------
and it's like kind of directionless


---------47:33----------
something that yoga hip you say like oh


---------47:35----------
so let's be scientists about it so what


---------47:37----------
does that actually mean it means like


---------47:39----------
thinking about what are the things so


---------47:41----------
this is I think if you want a concrete


---------47:42----------
task so here's one what are the things


---------47:45----------
that you can do despite them being


---------47:47----------
difficult that you like oddly enough


---------47:49----------
other people are bitching and moaning


---------47:51----------
about but you're actually completely


---------47:53----------
fine doing


---------47:55----------
meditating going to exercise like yoga


---------47:58----------
or things like that reading books these


---------48:01----------
are things that come pretty easy to me


---------48:03----------
personally that are often like difficult


---------48:05----------
things for other people yeah so I think


---------48:07----------
when when for your for your listeners


---------48:10----------
and my listeners and all of the


---------48:11----------
listeners and everyone who's watching


---------48:12----------
vods you know I think that's a question


---------48:14----------
that they should ask themselves so


---------48:15----------
looking into yourself is a systematic


---------48:18----------
process that involves a lot of different


---------48:20----------
dimensions and one is like what are the


---------48:22----------
things that are hard objectively right


---------48:26----------
that the standard people say are


---------48:27----------
difficult but that I actually enjoy


---------48:28----------
doing so what are things that come easy


---------48:30----------
to me that seem hard for other people


---------48:31----------
yeah yeah and I think if you capitalize


---------48:34----------
on that if you understand that if you


---------48:36----------
try to build a life based on that then


---------48:38----------
you're not going to be like even though


---------48:39----------
things are objectively hard they're not


---------48:42----------
going to be like you're gonna be able to


---------48:44----------
do it you're going to be able to succeed


---------48:47----------
and would that did an amazing thing he


---------48:49----------
recognized that look look means


---------48:52----------
suffering is different from pain he said


---------48:55----------
there are two layers of human-like


---------48:59----------
experience there's emotions which is


---------49:02----------
like happiness sadness pain grief shame


---------49:07----------
and then there's this other layer which


---------49:09----------
is peace or suffering so like for


---------49:12----------
example eight years ago my dad passed


---------49:14----------
away and it was really like awesome


---------49:18----------
experience for me in a weird way because


---------49:19----------
I felt a lot of negative emotion and I


---------49:22----------
was a piece it's a really bizarre thing


---------49:25----------
because we tend to associate negative


---------49:27----------
emotion with a lack of peace but you can


---------49:31----------
actually attain a state where there's a


---------49:32----------
part of me that sort of recognized and I


---------49:34----------
think people who have lost especially


---------49:35----------
parents you know will get to this point


---------49:37----------
hopefully at one point where you sort of


---------49:38----------
accept it like yeah you missed them but


---------49:40----------
you're also at peace with it and you can


---------49:41----------
like you can sleep easy at night because


---------49:43----------
they lived a happy life and they


---------49:45----------
provided for you and you guys had like a


---------49:46----------
valuable relationship and it meant a lot


---------49:49----------
to you but now they're gone and that's


---------49:50----------
okay right that's peace and you can have


---------49:54----------
grief and peace at the same time


---------49:57----------
the the Buddha described dukkha I


---------49:59----------
believe as a sort of sense of


---------50:02----------
uncomfortableness right a sort of a sort


---------50:06----------
of sense of just like things lot of


---------50:08----------
people mistranslated as suffering right


---------50:10----------
but it's actually just a sense of


---------50:14----------
not being comfortable with the state of


---------50:17----------
things


---------50:19----------
it's that way we think of suffering is


---------50:21----------
like okay you're really cold or or your


---------50:23----------
or you're starving but it's not that


---------50:25----------
it's it's right it's the sense of


---------50:28----------
unfulfilled meant yeah so I think that's


---------50:30----------
one source of new care but I think


---------50:32----------
you're so I think suffering I think is


---------50:34----------
actually a pretty good translation I


---------50:36----------
mean this is why I think ultimately we


---------50:37----------
have to use sunscreen because but but


---------50:39----------
what would that would say I think the


---------50:40----------
reason that we get you say it's quote


---------50:42----------
unquote mistranslated is because people


---------50:44----------
equate suffering to physical or


---------50:47----------
emotional pain that's what I mean yeah


---------50:49----------
but it's that's the whole point I'm


---------50:50----------
saying is that suffering in the way that


---------50:52----------
would that talks about it is independent


---------50:54----------
of those things yeah okay


---------50:56----------
so my first clinical experience teaching


---------50:59----------
meditation was teaching meditation to


---------51:01----------
cancer patients and cancer patients have


---------51:03----------
really bad pain and we were doing a


---------51:05----------
study where we wanted to teach cancer


---------51:07----------
patients pain and we wanted to say okay


---------51:09----------
this like this is gonna improve their


---------51:10----------
pain so we give them a questionnaire and


---------51:12----------
we say like okay how bad is your pain


---------51:14----------
today and they scale up from one to ten


---------51:15----------
and so most people will say like nine


---------51:18----------
because our studies criteria was people


---------51:20----------
who are very sick and then they take


---------51:22----------
that survey every day for a week and


---------51:23----------
they say it's basically nine every day


---------51:25----------
then we teach a meditation for a month


---------51:27----------
or two months and then we ask him okay


---------51:30----------
now let's ask you what your pain is and


---------51:32----------
guess what their number is


---------51:35----------
uh I actually the resume is lower isn't


---------51:38----------
it it's like 20% lower it's 9 it's still


---------51:41----------
9 it's still mine so then I scratch our


---------51:44----------
heads we start scratching our heads and


---------51:46----------
we're like hmm so like did we not do


---------51:49----------
this right and we start talking to


---------51:51----------
people maybe our study didn't succeed


---------51:52----------
and then when I talk to people like


---------51:54----------
there was one woman who like blew my


---------51:56----------
mind she said no I think I loved it I'm


---------51:58----------
glad you guys taught me this I find it


---------51:59----------
incredibly helpful and that I'm kind of


---------52:01----------
scratching my head I'm like but if it's


---------52:02----------
you're saying it's incredibly helpful


---------52:04----------
but you're still in a lot of pain like


---------52:06----------
how does that work


---------52:06----------
and she says what after learning how to


---------52:08----------
meditate I can put a window between me


---------52:11----------
and the pain so the pin is still there


---------52:13----------
actual pain it reduces your response to


---------52:16----------
it absolutely yeah so she's more at


---------52:18----------
peace she feels more content now this is


---------52:20----------
the interesting thing


---------52:21----------
her pain score is still a 9 what do you


---------52:23----------
think happens to the amount of pain


---------52:25----------
medication she uses does it lower


---------52:28----------
absolutely really to the tune of 363


---------52:32----------
dollars a day oh my god what because her


---------52:38----------
ability to change her response to that


---------52:39----------
pain is that significant absolutely do


---------52:42----------
any of the mental factors around stress


---------52:44----------
or anything to increase as a result of


---------52:45----------
that well I don't understand the


---------52:47----------
question ok so if you're if you're


---------52:49----------
assuming that you have less pain


---------52:52----------
medication and more pain


---------52:54----------
wouldwould any kind of like stress


---------52:56----------
increase or bad mental states increase


---------52:58----------
as a result of that not having pain


---------53:00----------
medication yeah cuz she's renewing her


---------53:03----------
pain medication yes on the contrary so


---------53:06----------
it's it's because her stress level is


---------53:08----------
better that she can tolerate higher


---------53:10----------
levels of pain in her overall mental


---------53:13----------
state is actually way better because


---------53:15----------
she's not like hopped up on pain meds so


---------53:18----------
she's not like slipping in and out of


---------53:20----------
consciousness because she's like got a


---------53:22----------
bunch of narcotics I don't know why


---------53:24----------
someone's buzzing hold on yeah sure


---------53:26----------
what's up here


---------53:28----------
[Music]


---------53:33----------
give me just one second


---------53:36----------
that's a good chance to the bathroom


---------53:38----------
quick hopefully he'll figure that


---------53:47----------
you


---------53:49----------
[Music]


---------53:52----------
all righty


---------53:58----------
[Music]


---------54:02----------
hey Tom how are you


---------54:06----------
[Music]


---------54:09----------
yeah you scared me straight man it's


---------54:12----------
really frightening actually what trolls


---------54:13----------
can do it's like crazy I didn't realize


---------54:15----------
that they would go that far


---------54:18----------
[Music]


---------54:20----------
so just a while where while we have a


---------54:23----------
little bit of a break do you guys have a


---------54:24----------
sense of what what do you guys is there


---------54:29----------
something in particular that you want to


---------54:30----------
talk about today


---------54:32----------
[Music]


---------54:37----------
you


---------54:38----------
[Music]


---------54:40----------
hello Kate


---------54:42----------
[Music]


---------54:45----------
okay so say your wife yeah hello it's


---------54:52----------
nice to meet you yes it is hello yeah


---------54:55----------
talking right now okay so we continuing


---------55:01----------
with just yes yeah okay let's do it so


---------55:04----------
we we last left off with your study yeah


---------55:07----------
yeah


---------55:08----------
okay so you've given these you've given


---------55:10----------
these patients a meditation practice


---------55:13----------
their pain is still the same their


---------55:15----------
response to the pain is lesson and also


---------55:18----------
their stress levels of losses yeah and


---------55:21----------
you equate that reduction of stress


---------55:25----------
- the reason why their response to pain


---------55:28----------
is better um so I mean I don't like the


---------55:31----------
word stress because I don't know exactly


---------55:33----------
what you mean by that


---------55:34----------
but huh so if we look at it so what it


---------55:37----------
is is their ability to tolerate so let


---------55:39----------
me put it this way their ability to


---------55:40----------
tolerate higher levels of pain improves


---------55:42----------
so their discomfort from the pain is


---------55:45----------
better


---------55:46----------
okay


---------55:49----------
this come from the paper okay so so so


---------55:52----------
this goes back to what we were talking


---------55:53----------
about which is the separation of


---------55:57----------
physical and emotional pain from what


---------55:59----------
suffering actually is yeah alright and


---------56:03----------
that's important because when we go


---------56:07----------
pursue this self-improvement in


---------56:09----------
ourselves that's a critical thing we


---------56:12----------
need to know well I mean I think it's


---------56:14----------
just important to understand that like


---------56:16----------
so a lot of people live like the puppet


---------56:19----------
in their life is their negative


---------56:21----------
experience I'm sorry the puppet master


---------56:24----------
in their life like their puppets and


---------56:26----------
they're controlled by their negative


---------56:28----------
experiences right so like a sensitivity


---------56:31----------
to find like when you say negative


---------56:33----------
experience do you mean past do you mean


---------56:35----------
so I'll give you it so like let's say


---------56:36----------
that I'm I'm in class and I have


---------56:39----------
something that I think would be a


---------56:41----------
valuable point to make but I'm afraid of


---------56:45----------
how I'm gonna sound because I'm like


---------56:46----------
self-conscious about my voice so I'm


---------56:49----------
embarrassed by it and so then I don't


---------56:51----------
speak


---------56:53----------
right so if we keep a so in that way


---------56:55----------
it's controlled your action yeah so like


---------56:56----------
anxiety controls people's lives


---------57:00----------
and so if you want to overcome anxiety


---------57:02----------
like there are a lot of different ways


---------57:03----------
to do it but if we're talking about like


---------57:05----------
you know what like what I want to do


---------57:07----------
something in life like what gets in the


---------57:09----------
way so I think anxiety is a great


---------57:11----------
example of some kind of emotion or some


---------57:14----------
kind of internal experience or some kind


---------57:17----------
of like suffering that prevents me from


---------57:21----------
doing the thing that I want to do if I


---------57:23----------
really like a girl and I want to ask her


---------57:25----------
out but I'm afraid she's gonna say no


---------57:26----------
and I never end up asking her and then I


---------57:28----------
regret it for years like what is the


---------57:31----------
thing that kept me from doing the thing


---------57:33----------
that I like I really wanted to do it's a


---------57:35----------
fear of rejection


---------57:38----------
right it's the lack of self-confidence


---------57:39----------
and so why does the sorry yeah go for it


---------57:43----------
why does that just makes no sense to me


---------57:45----------
why does the brain do this where it'll


---------57:48----------
it'll offer you like an initial fear of


---------57:50----------
rejection and let's put on a scale of 1


---------57:53----------
to 100 that's like a 1 in a negative


---------57:55----------
experience but the [ __ ] experience of


---------57:58----------
40 years of regret of not asking that


---------58:00----------
girl out is like so much infinitely


---------58:03----------
worse what why does the brain preload


---------58:05----------
you why do we preload ourselves better


---------58:07----------
question to that narrative well yes


---------58:11----------
whereas the cost versus benefit in that


---------58:13----------
like so I think there are a lot of


---------58:15----------
things that the brain does that seem


---------58:17----------
like their mistakes to us but we have to


---------58:20----------
understand that the brain is not stupid


---------58:22----------
the brain is just operating under a


---------58:24----------
different set of like values so the


---------58:27----------
brains priorities which is different


---------58:29----------
from what we want them to be


---------58:31----------
okay right so like this is where so so


---------58:34----------
for example this is something that I was


---------58:35----------
explaining to people earlier anxiety is


---------58:38----------
not real I mean it's an illness but when


---------58:40----------
I really stop and think about it what I


---------58:41----------
realized one day is that anxiety is a


---------58:43----------
learned behavior


---------58:45----------
so like anxiety is not like sure it


---------58:48----------
causes people a lot of suffering but


---------58:49----------
anxiety is generally speaking something


---------58:52----------
that people learn at some point that's a


---------58:54----------
protective mechanism so if you have a


---------58:56----------
kid who gets bullied in school they


---------58:58----------
learn early on that like if I like when


---------59:02----------
their so when you have like a six year


---------59:03----------
old who's getting bullied there's a part


---------59:05----------
of their brain so I want you to just


---------59:07----------
envision this scenario so there's a


---------59:09----------
there's a kid on the playground he's six


---------59:12----------
years old and he's being made fun of by


---------59:14----------
like half a dozen kids and the kids are


---------59:17----------
sort of in a semicircle or even like


---------59:19----------
full circle and he's been being


---------59:20----------
surrounded yeah and they're making fun


---------59:22----------
of him right so that's something that I


---------59:24----------
definitely experienced when I was a kid


---------59:25----------
I think a lot of gamers go through


---------59:26----------
something like that what do you think is


---------59:28----------
happening what is what is that person's


---------59:30----------
brain teaching them in that moment


---------59:36----------
that any kind of self expressions he'll


---------59:38----------
lead to this kind of scenario is bad


---------59:39----------
sure yeah and then let's say 15 minutes


---------59:42----------
the bullies get bored and they move on


---------59:44----------
and then how does the how does the kid


---------59:47----------
feel


---------59:48----------
horrible right like I never wanted to do


---------59:50----------
that again I never want to do that again


---------59:52----------
but they also feel relief


---------59:55----------
oh now that it's over now that it's over


---------59:57----------
right and so the brain teaches them


---------59:59----------
something very simple which is that when


---------60:01----------
they're there a bunch of people looking


---------60:02----------
at me I'm in danger


---------60:05----------
do you see that


---------60:07----------
yeah the one of the one of the ways I


---------60:09----------
heard this said was in reference to


---------60:11----------
agoraphobia so the example was like


---------60:14----------
somebody has like a a bad feeling or


---------60:18----------
something bad happens in like a public


---------60:19----------
place like a mall and now the mall then


---------60:22----------
becomes the associate and then they go


---------60:23----------
home and they feel better


---------60:24----------
so the mall becomes that place of like


---------60:26----------
negativity they never go back there the


---------60:28----------
home is the place that's secure right


---------60:29----------
that's another thing same yeah okay so


---------60:31----------
do you want to just tell people what a


---------60:32----------
agoraphobia is the fear of like public


---------60:35----------
places are like social events or things


---------60:38----------
like absolutely mmm-hmm so what happens


---------60:41----------
is like then so the brain from a very


---------60:43----------
primitive point like like early on in


---------60:45----------
development right when like all the


---------60:47----------
play-doh is still soft before it starts


---------60:49----------
to like harden and we like so a lot of


---------60:52----------
stuff that happens very early on is very


---------60:54----------
impactful for our programming for the


---------60:56----------
rest of life like things like learning


---------60:58----------
how to walk in the capacity to learn


---------61:00----------
language so our brain is really laying


---------61:03----------
down very very important foundation when


---------61:05----------
we're young and so in this kid is very


---------61:07----------
young he learns a very simple thing


---------61:09----------
which is that when I'm being looked at


---------61:12----------
I'm in danger and as long as no one sees


---------61:14----------
me I'm fine and so the next day he goes


---------61:18----------
to school and I mean if this is this is


---------61:22----------
what happened to me is like I was smart


---------61:24----------
right so like I knew the right answer


---------61:25----------
and the teacher would call on me


---------61:27----------
everyone's looking at me and I'd give


---------61:29----------
the right answer what do you think would


---------61:30----------
happen at recess after I gave the right


---------61:32----------
answer what people I should make funny


---------61:34----------
oh yeah because the stupid kids who were


---------61:38----------
larger than I was didn't know the right


---------61:40----------
answer so they'd call me smartypants or


---------61:42----------
teachers Pat or whatever and and so then


---------61:45----------
like then my my brain is learning even


---------61:47----------
more it's like okay if I open my mouth


---------61:49----------
even in a relatively safe place like I'm


---------61:52----------
gonna pay for it later yeah so then what


---------61:55----------
happens is I end up with something


---------61:57----------
called social anxiety which is that like


---------61:59----------
I can be out at a restaurant with people


---------62:01----------
that I don't know and even though no one


---------62:04----------
no one has bullied me for years


---------62:06----------
that programming has gotten laid down


---------62:08----------
that like when everyone is looking for


---------62:10----------
me like I'm in danger and if you ask


---------62:12----------
someone about social anxiety they'll


---------62:14----------
tell you they're like I know these


---------62:15----------
thoughts are crazy but when I'm at a


---------62:18----------
dinner table with six people that I've


---------62:19----------
never met and I opened my mouth my heart


---------62:22----------
starts racing


---------62:23----------
that's a danger response that's a


---------62:24----------
physiologic response they can't help


---------62:27----------
themselves that's their brain


---------62:29----------
quote-unquote doing that to them and


---------62:31----------
this is where we kind of say like why


---------62:33----------
does the brain do stupid [ __ ] to us and


---------62:34----------
it's because that's just what the brain


---------62:36----------
knows how to do like it just it doesn't


---------62:38----------
understand it's trying to protect you so


---------62:41----------
this is something go ahead well I have a


---------62:44----------
really important distinction that's


---------62:46----------
gonna be a thick a super hard answer but


---------62:48----------
when you say this leads back to the


---------62:50----------
brain's priorities are different from


---------62:52----------
what we want them to be


---------62:55----------
who's we


---------62:57----------
because if the if this is all made up


---------62:59----------
into the brain


---------63:02----------
were some outside force that's opposing


---------63:05----------
this obviously since we have the


---------63:06----------
consciousness to do so right like


---------63:08----------
there's one part of you the saying I


---------63:10----------
don't want to be socially anxious


---------63:12----------
there's another part that is it seems


---------63:14----------
almost coded in it's absolutely coded so


---------63:17----------
so so I guess like the example of like


---------63:19----------
an actual ice person maybe they might


---------63:21----------
actually have that response of a dinner


---------63:22----------
table but then the awareness comes in


---------63:24----------
they say okay here's this response I'm


---------63:26----------
going anyway right what is creating that


---------63:28----------
opposition yeah so this is where okay so


---------63:31----------
like it's a good question so yeah yeah


---------63:36----------
I'm gonna I'm gonna there's like a more


---------63:39----------
scientific answer and there's a less


---------63:40----------
scientific answer so the more scientific


---------63:42----------
answer is something that people call the


---------63:44----------
observing self so there's a part of you


---------63:46----------
that is able to in a detached way like


---------63:49----------
notice things about yourself and like


---------63:51----------
observe things kind of objectively so


---------63:54----------
this is the part of you that allows you


---------63:56----------
to reflect on your thought process so


---------63:58----------
the observer and the observed are two


---------64:00----------
different things


---------64:01----------
and if we think about it like sometimes


---------64:03----------
you're caught up in your thoughts like


---------64:04----------
this may sound weird but sometimes


---------64:06----------
you're caught up in your thoughts in


---------64:07----------
your thinking and you're kind of not


---------64:08----------
really aware of what you're thinking


---------64:10----------
you're just lost in the thinking yes


---------64:12----------
right now and then there are other times


---------64:14----------
where you can actually notice your


---------64:16----------
thought so there's something outside of


---------64:18----------
your thinking mind that is noticing what


---------64:21----------
the thoughts are and you may have that


---------64:22----------
that may cause thoughts to arise but


---------64:25----------
there's some amount of like self


---------64:27----------
reflective capacity okay so this is in


---------64:32----------
in in psychology or neuroscience or


---------64:36----------
whatever people sort of talk about this


---------64:38----------
thing called the observing self now on a


---------64:42----------
far deeper level like so people have


---------64:44----------
just made the observation that oh I have


---------64:46----------
the capacity to like understand


---------64:47----------
something about what I do what I do yeah


---------64:51----------
or what I find with the Yogi's actually


---------64:54----------
they went someone put so they went one


---------64:59----------
step further and they actually tunneled


---------65:01----------
down and explored the depth of the mind


---------65:03----------
and what they realized is there is some


---------65:06----------
part of us that they call the othman


---------65:07----------
which is more loosely translated as soul


---------65:09----------
self yeah or consciousness


---------65:14----------
and the consciousness is separate from


---------65:16----------
the mind the mind is a thinking machine


---------65:18----------
but that consciousness is separate and


---------65:20----------
that the purest form of consciousness is


---------65:22----------
like something that's divine and when


---------65:24----------
you when we like become pure


---------65:26----------
consciousness then we're enlightened


---------65:27----------
when your comment kind of completely


---------65:29----------
free from the mind and there's so this


---------65:31----------
may be kind of a weird thing that people


---------65:33----------
have trouble understanding so we can go


---------65:35----------
through a quick exercise where I can


---------65:36----------
kind of lay it out for you sure yeah so


---------65:38----------
people tend to think first of all that


---------65:40----------
consciousness and mind are the same


---------65:42----------
thing so let's understand the different


---------65:44----------
states of mind and being that we all


---------65:46----------
experience and see how consciousness and


---------65:49----------
mind are acts actually separate mm-hmm


---------65:52----------
so the first thing is what are we do it


---------65:54----------
like so right now Devon is your


---------65:55----------
consciousness active yes or no


---------65:58----------
yes yes it is your mind active yes okay


---------66:03----------
so the other way to put this is are you


---------66:05----------
aware


---------66:07----------
yes or no I am these are really


---------66:11----------
difficult words because they could mean


---------66:13----------
a water no just just answer the question


---------66:15----------
simply are you aware that Devon I think


---------66:18----------
so yeah the answer is yes don't worry we


---------66:21----------
got a step away from [ __ ] philosophy


---------66:23----------
okay like that's a weird [ __ ] yeah all


---------66:25----------
of that stuff so Yogi's didn't care


---------66:27----------
about like all like are we in the matrix


---------66:29----------
and they're not in the mail like just


---------66:30----------
forget just like are you aware right now


---------66:32----------
like yeah you're aware yeah I'm aware of


---------66:35----------
us and are you having thoughts I am okay


---------66:38----------
so now let's think about what is the


---------66:40----------
state of mind where we don't have


---------66:42----------
consciousness and we have no thoughts


---------66:45----------
what does the state of mind where we do


---------66:48----------
what we do have consciousness so so


---------66:50----------
first actually we take a step back so


---------66:51----------
your state of mind right now we're gonna


---------66:53----------
call wakefulness okay okay this is


---------66:56----------
wakefulness so what state of mind has no


---------66:58----------
consciousness and no thoughts sleep


---------67:01----------
absolutely easy right no consciousness


---------67:04----------
no thoughts now what is the State of


---------67:07----------
Mind of dreaming what


---------67:11----------
are they fine huh do we know that yes do


---------67:16----------
you have thoughts yes or no in dreaming


---------67:18----------
this is really hard man like notes is a


---------67:22----------
dream considered a thought what do you


---------67:24----------
think I don't think so


---------67:27----------
so do you have thoughts when you dream


---------67:32----------
you can think Walter I mean yes so the


---------67:34----------
mind is active in area right yeah are


---------67:37----------
you conscious in a dream


---------67:41----------
sometimes but not always not usually


---------67:44----------
yeah not usually right so now we have


---------67:47----------
and then we also have something called a


---------67:49----------
daydream why do we call it a daydream


---------67:51----------
what is their playing are you aware in a


---------67:55----------
day train awake


---------67:56----------
not usually absolutely yeah do you have


---------68:00----------
thoughts in a daydream yes absolutely


---------68:03----------
right so now we have when when caught in


---------68:05----------
consciousness consciousness plus


---------68:08----------
thinking is wakefulness no consciousness


---------68:12----------
no thinking is sleep and then we [ __ ]


---------68:17----------
human beings we understand this stuff so


---------68:19----------
well that we came up with a word that


---------68:21----------
describes the other and then we are


---------68:23----------
dreaming which is no consciousness with


---------68:25----------
thoughts and then we have daydreaming


---------68:27----------
which is no consciousness with thoughts


---------68:29----------
so do you see that like even between


---------68:32----------
sleep and wake we have found a common


---------68:35----------
state of mind and we use the same word


---------68:37----------
to describe it daydream versus dream yes


---------68:40----------
because human beings intuitively


---------68:42----------
understand that I'm lost in my thoughts


---------68:44----------
and I'm kind of not aware of what's


---------68:46----------
going on yes they do in Sedona so now so


---------68:49----------
now we're filling out a two-by-two table


---------68:51----------
right you got that up yeah I do


---------68:53----------
and so then now the question becomes


---------68:55----------
what is consciousness without thought


---------68:59----------
it's meditation absolutely yeah their


---------69:02----------
nests yeah so when people ask me what is


---------69:05----------
meditation that's it that is meditation


---------69:09----------
super cool okay I totally get that


---------69:14----------
meditations consciousness without


---------69:15----------
thought yep now you've heard that phrase


---------69:19----------
a thousand times before


---------69:21----------
but like not in context but we don't


---------69:23----------
understand like we don't like we don't


---------69:24----------
explain what that means and it's


---------69:26----------
actually like it's mind-blowing ly


---------69:28----------
simple yeah it is you can teach this


---------69:30----------
stuff you can ask a six-year-old these


---------69:32----------
questions and they'll give you the right


---------69:33----------
answers the six-year-old will give me


---------69:36----------
more confident answers than you will


---------69:37----------
because you [ __ ] read too many books


---------69:41----------
that's sure that's the whole Zen


---------69:43----------
practice of yes and you know what


---------69:46----------
happens with so now Devin we're gonna


---------69:48----------
come full circle so what's what's the


---------69:51----------
difference between a six-year-old


---------69:52----------
answering these questions and you I've


---------69:55----------
read too many books yeah so what is that


---------69:58----------
that's relying on an external standard


---------70:02----------
wait way run that by me again how do you


---------70:05----------
mean so you remember how we were talking


---------70:06----------
about like using science as a Berlocq is


---------70:08----------
a comparison like using an objective


---------70:10----------
standard you've read so many books that


---------70:13----------
you have all these objective standards


---------70:14----------
that are actually interfering with what


---------70:16----------
you actually know


---------70:19----------
I have objective standards that are


---------70:21----------
interfering with what I actually know


---------70:22----------
yeah right because you've you've spent


---------70:26----------
so much time studying science and


---------70:28----------
studying things outside of yourself that


---------70:30----------
they're now interfering with your


---------70:31----------
ability to even tell what's going on


---------70:33----------
within you


---------70:34----------
I am losing you at your connection now


---------70:36----------
losing like you're losing it no no


---------70:40----------
internet yeah like physically yeah give


---------70:43----------
it just a sec okay no yeah I think we


---------70:47----------
decided so can you repeat what USA yeah


---------70:50----------
so like the difference between the


---------70:52----------
six-year-old and you is like remember


---------70:53----------
how you were saying how do you know what


---------70:56----------
to what standard to set yourself against


---------70:58----------
unless you look at something objective


---------70:59----------
and external right you were saying like


---------71:02----------
how do you know like how what you should


---------71:04----------
strive for unless you look outside so


---------71:07----------
the difference between you and the


---------71:07----------
six-year-old is you've read a bunch of


---------71:09----------
books yeah so you have a lot of external


---------71:11----------
standards in your mind that are actually


---------71:13----------
you have to like dismantle to get to


---------71:16----------
your actual experience like when I asked


---------71:18----------
you are you aware a six-year-old is


---------71:20----------
gonna say yeah whereas you're like well


---------71:23----------
what is awareness like yeah are we and


---------71:26----------
you guys I'm saying I basically [ __ ]


---------71:27----------
up my whole life because I read some of


---------71:29----------
it herself in from in books and now I


---------71:30----------
have to work through all that [ __ ]


---------71:31----------
because I like to get back to where I


---------71:34----------
started


---------71:34----------
yes right and tonight so so Devin Devin


---------71:38----------
now you understand now so now you're


---------71:41----------
ready to understand what Leonardo da


---------71:43----------
Vinci said if it took my entire life to


---------71:46----------
paint like a child


---------71:48----------
it took me my entire life to paint like


---------71:50----------
a child now you get it


---------71:52----------
that's what he was saying


---------71:56----------
and I you cut out with us who's saying


---------71:58----------
Leonardo da Vinci


---------72:00----------
that's what he said yeah


---------72:04----------
so


---------72:06----------
okay okay but all those presupposes that


---------72:08----------
you have all the answers inside you like


---------72:10----------
where does that where do we where do we


---------72:12----------
come to with that that that seems like a


---------72:14----------
weird like me me like yogi thing right


---------72:16----------
like um so are you saying that there


---------72:18----------
literally is no value in external no no


---------72:21----------
I think there's there's a max value in


---------72:22----------
external stuff there's some ends value


---------72:25----------
it's just that what's the dicot I don't


---------72:27----------
understand like what's the dichotomy cuz


---------72:29----------
like it's like on one hand I have to


---------72:31----------
forget every Tony Robbins speech I've


---------72:33----------
ever heard to become enlightened right


---------72:35----------
like but on the other hand I have to


---------72:37----------
like like there's some value in it so


---------72:40----------
I'm gonna share a story with you okay so


---------72:42----------
like this is where like I can we can I


---------72:44----------
can try to explain it a couple ways I'm


---------72:45----------
just gonna share a story to see if this


---------72:46----------
resonates so if you ever heard of the


---------72:48----------
story of how would that became


---------72:49----------
enlightened oh yeah


---------72:51----------
what's your understanding of the story


---------72:54----------
well it's a really long so okay okay I


---------72:57----------
understand sorry let me just tell my


---------72:59----------
version okay okay she was doing a lot of


---------73:03----------
strict asceticism so he had started with


---------73:06----------
a lot of teachers and he was like doing


---------73:07----------
the really hardcore meditation stuff


---------73:09----------
because he wanted to be enlightened he's


---------73:10----------
like I'm gonna starve myself so he did a


---------73:13----------
lot of intense fasting he was a schemata


---------73:15----------
like he would live in the forest with


---------73:16----------
the one so he was like he was he was


---------73:18----------
like gray and on the brink of death and


---------73:21----------
had like it thought like okay like it's


---------73:23----------
not enough I'm not enlightened yet so


---------73:25----------
I'm gonna go further I'm gonna go


---------73:26----------
further I'm hardcore this is what all


---------73:28----------
the texts and all the external people


---------73:31----------
say that I should do and I know that


---------73:33----------
even like people haven't gotten


---------73:34----------
enlightened this way so I'm gonna do it


---------73:35----------
he's doing it he's doing it he's on the


---------73:37----------
brink of death he's emaciated he's like


---------73:38----------
all skin and bones and this young girl


---------73:41----------
walks by I kind of envisioned her as a 9


---------73:42----------
year old girl and she's got a pail of


---------73:44----------
rice pudding and she sees this dude


---------73:46----------
who's clearly like an ascetic and she


---------73:49----------
kind of says she's like she also sees


---------73:51----------
that he's like he was not like really


---------73:53----------
looking great like he looks sick he's


---------73:55----------
paying he's thin and she's like hey man


---------73:58----------
do you want some rice pudding and then


---------74:00----------
rice pudding is like you know it's it's


---------74:02----------
it's dense it's delicious its creamy its


---------74:04----------
sweet it's a dessert and like hear


---------74:07----------
Buddha is like he's not even eating like


---------74:08----------
crusts of bread he's like depriving


---------74:10----------
himself of water he like looks at her


---------74:12----------
and he's like you know what yes I do and


---------74:16----------
then he eats the rice pudding and he's


---------74:18----------
like you know what this [ __ ] is [ __ ]


---------74:19----------
delicious and then he's like why the


---------74:22----------
hell if I've been doing this this whole


---------74:25----------
time he's like how can something so


---------74:27----------
simple and so pure that I enjoy so much


---------74:30----------
like how can the road to enlightenment


---------74:32----------
like mean avoiding this or giving this


---------74:35----------
up and then in that moment he says [ __ ]


---------74:37----------
it this is all stupid


---------74:39----------
all of this strict asceticism everything


---------74:41----------
that I've done it just doesn't work it's


---------74:43----------
stupid there's just no way to become


---------74:45----------
enlightened it's all false and then he's


---------74:48----------
like it's I'm just gonna like that's it


---------74:50----------
I'm done and then he goes in you again


---------74:52----------
you know I'll [ __ ] I'm hitting the


---------74:54----------
climax can you hear me I've totally lost


---------74:56----------
him now oh I see you Oh God


---------75:01----------
I think my zone that money gone out


---------75:05----------
twice


---------75:09----------
there


---------75:11----------
okay Oh God let me try to change this


---------75:14----------
server of the call cuz like my internet


---------75:18----------
seems to be okay I don't know why yours


---------75:21----------
is yeah is mice let me see if my stream


---------75:24----------
is my stream is fine it's probably


---------75:27----------
discord hold on hold on hold on tom is


---------75:30----------
saying hit a ctrl shift escape


---------75:35----------
people are saying this Court does this a


---------75:36----------
lot it does yeah yeah my CPUs like at


---------75:40----------
20% I don't think it's my CPU


---------75:44----------
I'll leave it open we'll just click an


---------75:46----------
eye on it can you chat can you change


---------75:48----------
the can you change the server of a


---------75:50----------
discord call was that actually pause I


---------75:51----------
don't know when people are saying such


---------75:53----------
spiritual conversation that the


---------75:54----------
bandwidth can't handle its share yeah


---------76:00----------
top right okay oh you can this is why ya


---------76:02----------
hang up he's gotta toss ourselves on to


---------76:04----------
a better server thank you but if the


---------76:08----------
conversations going into another


---------76:09----------
dimension so alright okay better well


---------76:14----------
this should hopefully be better and if


---------76:15----------
it's not what changed alright okay so


---------76:17----------
the buddha has rice pudding and he goes


---------76:19----------
why hell have I ever why was I yeah this


---------76:24----------
is stupid like like I've deprived myself


---------76:25----------
of all the stuff this is such a pure and


---------76:28----------
simple joy like all these people are


---------76:30----------
idiots I've tried it it doesn't work he


---------76:32----------
says [ __ ] it and then he goes in sits


---------76:34----------
under a people tree and gets enlightened


---------76:37----------
forty days later yeah right like huh no


---------76:41----------
he goes assistant or poetry and it takes


---------76:43----------
from 40 days I don't know well I thought


---------76:46----------
he I thought he didn't eat also during


---------76:47----------
that I don't know okay okay so the point


---------76:52----------
being that there is actually an answer


---------76:53----------
to why he didn't have the rice pudding


---------76:54----------
right it's that that separation from


---------76:56----------
that desire was what was supposed to


---------76:58----------
spark that enlightenment in the first


---------76:59----------
place


---------77:02----------
I'm sorry can you say that again yeah


---------77:04----------
this is so the whole reason he's set out


---------77:06----------
to do all the stuff that Ramana does


---------77:07----------
which is like basically try to destroy


---------77:11----------
themselves is to get away from desire to


---------77:14----------
get away from that attachment so that


---------77:16----------
you reach a point where you're not


---------77:18----------
dependent on those things and you're


---------77:19----------
free from them that was the whole point


---------77:21----------
of going through all that suffering that


---------77:22----------
was the whole point and then though he's


---------77:24----------
real oh [ __ ] I'm cutting out now and


---------77:27----------
what he realizes is that I wonder if I


---------77:30----------
should just bump up my internet


---------77:32----------
connection


---------77:32----------
we're on Central rose again - yeah we'll


---------77:36----------
try to track you're on the west coast I


---------77:38----------
am yeah


---------77:40----------
but add you on East and that was working


---------77:42----------
out okay


---------77:46----------
we'll try that that might be better for


---------77:47----------
you yeah okay thank you yeah so I think


---------77:51----------
that yes so that that's the the crazy


---------77:54----------
thing about enlightenment is that like


---------77:55----------
you know you conquer all of the desires


---------77:58----------
except for the desire of enlightenment


---------78:01----------
and it's the desire for enlightenment


---------78:04----------
that causes you to get rid of everything


---------78:05----------
else but ultimately that's a desire that


---------78:07----------
has to be given up to


---------78:11----------
I say mmm and that's what he's holding


---------78:14----------
bud the back was that he's still desired


---------78:19----------
to become enlightened yeah


---------78:21----------
so when he says [ __ ] it I'm done that's


---------78:24----------
when it happens but that's because he


---------78:26----------
already did all the other work hasn't it


---------78:31----------
technically if you really look at sand


---------78:33----------
traditions no so remember that


---------78:35----------
enlightenment enlightenment is binary


---------78:37----------
it's not yeah it's on our honor ophea


---------78:40----------
right so what you did before that moment


---------78:43----------
it's not like he got 50% of the way


---------78:45----------
there so that yeah that's why like when


---------78:47----------
you look at Zen masters like you know


---------78:48----------
what they do when they become


---------78:49----------
enlightened what they laugh because they


---------78:54----------
realize the futility of everything


---------78:55----------
they've been doing


---------78:57----------
I see


---------79:00----------
yeah Alan Watts has a really good


---------79:02----------
segment on this where he talks about


---------79:04----------
exactly this that like you there's a way


---------79:07----------
that zine masters trick their students


---------79:09----------
right they have a they have a sort of in


---------79:12----------
the beginning like you go in and you say


---------79:14----------
I really want to learn how to become


---------79:16----------
enlightened you can teach me


---------79:18----------
and then the Zen master says no I can't


---------79:20----------
teach you I have nothing to teach you


---------79:21----------
and the student says no I know that you


---------79:24----------
have something to teach me because there


---------79:25----------
are all these people hanging around and


---------79:27----------
they are trying to learn from you and


---------79:29----------
the master goes no I didn't ask them to


---------79:32----------
be here they're just hanging out and I


---------79:34----------
can't get him to leave and and and like


---------79:36----------
the master kind of convinces you that


---------79:38----------
there really is nothing to teach you


---------79:39----------
that is the answer but that doesn't


---------79:41----------
become self apparent until you spend


---------79:43----------
years in the ashram because you haven't


---------79:45----------
actually internalized that you finally


---------79:48----------
reach the end of it and you get there


---------79:50----------
and you're like oh my god that old


---------79:51----------
bastard was right there really was


---------79:53----------
nothing for me to know yeah and so now


---------79:55----------
Devan we come back to you my friend yeah


---------79:58----------
what's the value of 700 books


---------80:02----------
I have to feel like it had some value


---------80:04----------
but maybe that's maybe that's my ego


---------80:07----------
trying to defend the amount of


---------80:09----------
investment of time that I had no no it


---------80:11----------
does have some value you have to spend a


---------80:13----------
lot of time reading those books to


---------80:16----------
recognize how useless they are


---------80:20----------
Oh


---------80:24----------
that's that I totally understand that


---------80:26----------
okay here we go yeah I completely


---------80:29----------
understand that um chat we're having


---------80:31----------
them at worst I'm still having a massive


---------80:33----------
difficulty with you cutting out I think


---------80:36----------
one way we could do this is um do you


---------80:39----------
want I can send you a zoom meeting okay


---------80:43----------
and then you literally just click that


---------80:45----------
and then we switch over that because


---------80:46----------
discord right now seems to be well now


---------80:49----------
it's better but it seems to be going in


---------80:50----------
and out we'll do that next call no


---------80:52----------
matter what okay um I'll just get you


---------80:54----------
set up on that it's way better okay okay


---------80:56----------
so I need it seems to be good now so I


---------80:59----------
need to read the books to understand


---------81:02----------
that I don't


---------81:05----------
need to know what's in the books yeah


---------81:06----------
[Music]


---------81:08----------
right so this is this is that this is


---------81:11----------
transcendence like you have to move


---------81:12----------
above and beyond the phenomena of like


---------81:15----------
reading and all that good stuff so like


---------81:18----------
this is where we when we kind of go back


---------81:20----------
to neuroscience here you are you're


---------81:21----------
telling me like isn't neuroscience


---------81:22----------
important is that neuroscience important


---------81:24----------
and I'm saying well oh [ __ ] one second


---------81:33----------
guys


---------81:37----------
yeah we'll get up on zoom' meeting this


---------81:39----------
next time chat so that that will work


---------81:42----------
like 1% that's how we do D and D never


---------81:44----------
interrupt and we have like six people


---------81:49----------
right


---------81:51----------
it's discord because you like we know


---------81:55----------
because when we switch services changes


---------81:59----------
that's why


---------82:01----------
so so Devin does that


---------82:06----------
so I think like oh yeah let's have value


---------82:08----------
and neuroscience has value and


---------82:11----------
ultimately I think one of the biggest


---------82:13----------
problems that I see practically is that


---------82:15----------
people go looking for answers in books


---------82:17----------
and I think you can learn a lot from


---------82:19----------
books but I've never mmm actually I was


---------82:23----------
about to say so I think I I was about to


---------82:26----------
say I've never heard of a book changing


---------82:27----------
someone's life but that's not true it


---------82:30----------
definitely can yeah and I mean I was


---------82:31----------
just thinking about my own life they're


---------82:33----------
books that have changed my life so but


---------82:36----------
changing your life is such a broad term


---------82:38----------
right yeah I mean I think I think what


---------82:40----------
you meant by change your life when you


---------82:41----------
initially said that was different like


---------82:42----------
chained your wife like an internal


---------82:44----------
realization like a moment of Satori


---------82:47----------
yeah Japanese yeah mm-hmm so I was um


---------82:51----------
this is a really good segue into


---------82:52----------
something that I definitely want to talk


---------82:54----------
to you about I was on a podcast I'm on


---------82:56----------
I'm on the there's the number one


---------82:58----------
podcast on twitch is this podcast called


---------82:59----------
the scuf podcast and I guess I've


---------83:01----------
somehow finagle my way into being


---------83:03----------
co-producer of this podcast and we bring


---------83:05----------
on different personalities usually


---------83:06----------
provocative personalities and there was


---------83:09----------
one particular person the show goes out


---------83:10----------
to tens of thousands of people's


---------83:12----------
significant right one particular person


---------83:14----------
came out and said the absolutely 100%


---------83:18----------
video game addiction does not exist


---------83:21----------
and the the way that they justified that


---------83:26----------
was they said there are no hard Studies


---------83:29----------
on video game addiction existing and


---------83:33----------
that it's basically this sort of


---------83:34----------
fabrication of mainstream media and and


---------83:38----------
and people to promote this idea of video


---------83:42----------
games being like this toxic influence on


---------83:44----------
people's lives now I countered with the


---------83:46----------
fact that I knew anecdotally and by


---------83:48----------
observation including of myself of a lot


---------83:51----------
of people that had video game addiction


---------83:54----------
and furthermore that by dismissing it in


---------83:58----------
the same way that you would dismiss like


---------83:59----------
depression or something will actually do


---------84:01----------
damage to all these people who really do


---------84:03----------
have these addictions and and


---------84:05----------
essentially like anything can be


---------84:06----------
addiction addiction but I because I


---------84:08----------
didn't have the science there I couldn't


---------84:11----------
mount a good argument and okay and more


---------84:14----------
or less III don't feel good about how it


---------84:18----------
ended up and I'd like to be better


---------84:19----------
equipped to handle that because of the


---------84:21----------
influence it can have was the person


---------84:23----------
researcher know they're a journalist


---------84:26----------
even worse okay yeah so you're you're


---------84:29----------
asking like what's the argument to make


---------84:31----------
that video game addiction exists I I


---------84:34----------
think it's a no I think I'm I'm starting


---------84:37----------
a conversation with you about video game


---------84:39----------
addiction and your take on it and then


---------84:41----------
from there maybe extrapolating onto like


---------84:44----------
where we can go uh if we have that


---------84:49----------
conversation with people okay wait wait


---------84:52----------
what's the what's the what's the thought


---------84:54----------
process you have around this well so I'm


---------84:56----------
tempted to kind of respond to that


---------84:57----------
person's point so like yeah is it okay


---------85:00----------
if I start there so the first thing is


---------85:02----------
Devin does the depression exist


---------85:03----------
[Music]


---------85:05----------
100% how do we know


---------85:09----------
well we know through a combination of


---------85:12----------
observation but also a lot of very


---------85:14----------
concrete studies that show beautiful


---------85:16----------
chemical differences in the brain yeah


---------85:19----------
as we keep serotonin lost and dopamine


---------85:21----------
yeah nope nope that's not what the


---------85:23----------
studies show it's not what the studies


---------85:26----------
show well with it were they let they


---------85:28----------
show so now we have to understand a


---------85:30----------
little bit about how psychiatric


---------85:31----------
diagnoses are made okay so


---------85:36----------
a millennia ago not really millennia ago


---------85:38----------
there was a group that came up with this


---------85:40----------
book called the DSM which is the


---------85:42----------
Diagnostic and statistics manual yeah so


---------85:45----------
what people were doing so a bunch of


---------85:47----------
Psychiatry researchers sat down they


---------85:49----------
scratch their head and they said we want


---------85:51----------
to study depression but like how do we


---------85:53----------
know who has depression and who doesn't


---------85:56----------
and specifically these people were very


---------85:58----------
interested in pharmacologic trials so


---------86:01----------
someone says like okay if I want to


---------86:03----------
study a drug to treat depression how can


---------86:06----------
i how can I decide like who qualifies


---------86:09----------
for depression and who doesn't like


---------86:11----------
where is the dividing line between


---------86:13----------
depression and not depression make


---------86:16----------
sounds so they came up with something


---------86:18----------
called the DSM which is like a checklist


---------86:20----------
of features so for example for major


---------86:24----------
depressive disorder there are nine


---------86:25----------
possible things and you have to check


---------86:28----------
five out of the nine boxes and if you


---------86:30----------
subject what you're checked huh because


---------86:32----------
I Freddie yeah we have this for


---------86:33----------
everything schizophrenia absolutely


---------86:35----------
absolutely absolutely so if you check


---------86:37----------
five out of the nine boxes you qualify


---------86:39----------
as depression and the whole reason they


---------86:41----------
came with the DS came up with the DSM is


---------86:43----------
because researchers were trying to


---------86:45----------
figure out if I'm studying a drug how


---------86:47----------
are we gonna know that the people that


---------86:49----------
I'm testing are the same people that


---------86:51----------
you're testing yeah so we have to come


---------86:54----------
up with a consensus for research to make


---------86:57----------
sure we're talking about generally


---------86:59----------
speaking the same thing okay this is


---------87:03----------
where the criteria for depression came


---------87:04----------
from and this is where the studies on


---------87:06----------
depression came from when we proved that


---------87:08----------
depression existed


---------87:10----------
we used a checklist that a group of


---------87:12----------
people came up with and we just sort of


---------87:13----------
by Fiat got together and decided this


---------87:16----------
means depression


---------87:18----------
there's no real scientific foundation


---------87:23----------
for our diagnosis of depression


---------87:26----------
there's no real be huh that can't be


---------87:30----------
because we can notice a chemical


---------87:32----------
difference in the brain and people that


---------87:33----------
are depressed I know we can do that okay


---------87:35----------
so but let's remember like order of


---------87:38----------
operations right when did we classify


---------87:40----------
depression as an illness and and as


---------87:43----------
neuroscience has come a really far away


---------87:44----------
but they're actually even now disputes


---------87:47----------
about whether people with depression


---------87:49----------
have lower serotonin levels than people


---------87:51----------
who don't have depression really yes all


---------87:53----------
we know is that serotonin boosting


---------87:56----------
agents seem to improve depression and we


---------87:58----------
have some really generous studies which


---------88:01----------
suggest that some neurotransmitters are


---------88:03----------
kind of messed up but if you actually


---------88:05----------
talk to neuro translating this research


---------88:07----------
it's so far from clinical application


---------88:10----------
because we just don't understand how the


---------88:11----------
brain works it's not like your serotonin


---------88:13----------
does all kinds of things it governs like


---------88:17----------
it governs like peristalsis in the gut


---------88:19----------
it governs like all kinds of chemical


---------88:22----------
signaling it governs like how your eyes


---------88:24----------
are able to see it governs all sorts of


---------88:27----------
stuff what yeah so let's think about


---------88:29----------
this think do you know how many


---------88:30----------
neurotransmitters there are no like a


---------88:34----------
dozen okay so there's like dopamine


---------88:37----------
there's serotonin


---------88:38----------
there's like there endogenous opioids


---------88:40----------
there like there's like there aren't


---------88:42----------
that many neurotransmitters because


---------88:44----------
remember that a neurotransmitter is a


---------88:45----------
signal mm-hmm it's something that like


---------88:48----------
and gets dumped into it something called


---------88:50----------
a synaptic cleft and then travels to a


---------88:51----------
neuron and then hits a receptor I mean


---------88:54----------
the kind of receptor that


---------88:57----------
how can i is it the kind of receptor it


---------89:00----------
activates triggers a completely


---------89:01----------
different thing


---------89:03----------
so we only have like a dozen


---------89:05----------
neurotransmitters and like even though


---------89:07----------
we have a dozen neurotransmitters our


---------89:08----------
brain is capable of doing all kinds of


---------89:11----------
things from creating music to holding in


---------89:14----------
our urine to falling in love and that's


---------89:19----------
just governed by a dozen


---------89:20----------
neurotransmitters okay but when we


---------89:23----------
remove dopamine from mice they don't eat


---------89:27----------
yep they lose motivation do anything


---------89:29----------
right so so what we can we can


---------89:31----------
individually control some of these


---------89:34----------
neurotransmitters to affect behavior yes


---------89:36----------
from that do you not think that we can


---------89:39----------
make some kind of conclusion as to what


---------89:41----------
these things are influencing yes


---------89:42----------
absolutely but let's be clear that's


---------89:44----------
just that's just some kind of conclusion


---------89:46----------
right so that's the money statement so


---------89:49----------
like our sense of Science in psychiatry


---------89:52----------
in addiction and stuff like that is very


---------89:54----------
different like so when when someone gets


---------89:56----------
pneumonia like that's pneumonia we can


---------89:58----------
see the bug we can give it an antibiotic


---------90:00----------
we can kill the bug and the person gets


---------90:02----------
better mental health is not like that so


---------90:05----------
I absolutely believe that depression


---------90:07----------
exists but if you really look at the


---------90:09----------
data the gap between basic science and


---------90:12----------
clinical application in psychiatry is


---------90:15----------
huge compared to any other system of


---------90:17----------
medicine you're saying there is no way


---------90:19----------
we can see depression in the brain


---------90:20----------
reliably no we have to observe it in the


---------90:24----------
behavior of the individual and their


---------90:25----------
self-report actually let me rephrase so


---------90:27----------
I'm not saying there's no way that we


---------90:28----------
can see it but what I can tell you is


---------90:30----------
that in the diagnosed so when I'm making


---------90:31----------
a diagnosis of depression an MRI is not


---------90:34----------
part of the diagnostic workup well


---------90:35----------
obviously no yeah well why is that


---------90:38----------
obvious because aren't we talking about


---------90:39----------
objectively because it's very hard from


---------90:44----------
a medical standpoint to like extract all


---------90:46----------
the chemicals to do a brain reading of


---------90:48----------
all the chemicals absolutely that's why


---------90:49----------
we do it so it's not because yeah the


---------90:52----------
first thing to understand is that for


---------90:54----------
this person to say there are no hard


---------90:55----------
studies that diagnose video game


---------90:57----------
addiction is a stupid statement because


---------90:59----------
there are nose into hard studies to


---------91:01----------
diagnose depression because depression


---------91:03----------
is a clinical diagnosis it's not a


---------91:07----------
biopsy like you can't buy up some biopsy


---------91:11----------
someone brain scan someone blood test


---------91:13----------
someone for depression you


---------91:15----------
just it's a clinical diagnosis in


---------91:17----------
addictions our clinical diagnosis and so


---------91:21----------
you can come up with criteria you can


---------91:23----------
make a clinical assessment with the idea


---------91:26----------
that there's some kind of silver bullet


---------91:27----------
like there is for a blood culture like


---------91:29----------
HIV is it sure I mean even then


---------91:31----------
practically you make it a clinical


---------91:32----------
diagnosis but there's a test that you


---------91:34----------
can prove whether someone has HIV or


---------91:36----------
doesn't have HIV this is also the case


---------91:39----------
of things like like herpes simplex virus


---------91:43----------
right we're like you can you can sort of


---------91:45----------
see that there are certain antibodies in


---------91:50----------
the bloodstream but there is absolutely


---------91:51----------
no way to see the actual virus like


---------91:53----------
things like there's all kind of stuff


---------91:55----------
like that right well yeah but I mean so


---------91:56----------
but that's just because seeing the


---------91:57----------
antibodies is easier but you can see the


---------92:00----------
actual like you can you can actually see


---------92:02----------
the virus because you can do something


---------92:04----------
called a viral load so that's like what


---------92:07----------
you do is you take some like I think


---------92:08----------
sample of I don't know if they test the


---------92:10----------
RNA but you can you can do like a load


---------92:12----------
which shows like what amount of HIV so


---------92:15----------
the antibody just tells you whether


---------92:16----------
you've been infected in the past or not


---------92:18----------
but there's another test called a viral


---------92:20----------
load which shows you like what's the


---------92:22----------
burden of virus in this person's body so


---------92:25----------
why don't we do that why don't we do


---------92:27----------
that for what like when we're doing


---------92:30----------
blood tests for people with viruses and


---------92:32----------
stuff to figure out how we do for HIV so


---------92:34----------
like for example so for HIV let's say


---------92:37----------
that like cuz you're gonna you know that


---------92:38----------
with HIV we have a lot of like resistant


---------92:40----------
strains so when I when I give you a


---------92:42----------
medicine I don't know if your HIV is


---------92:44----------
gonna be resistant to it or not so even


---------92:47----------
though you can have a positive antibody


---------92:48----------
a positive antibody just means that your


---------92:50----------
immune system has seen it before it


---------92:52----------
doesn't mean that you're actively


---------92:53----------
infected or not actively infected but


---------92:55----------
usually it means that you basically been


---------92:56----------
exposed which means there's a decent


---------92:58----------
chance you're infected but in order to


---------93:00----------
determine whether the medication is


---------93:02----------
working we do viral loads so you can do


---------93:05----------
that okay


---------93:06----------
interesting but there's nothing like


---------93:09----------
this no matter how granular you get with


---------93:12----------
mental health not yet


---------93:14----------
right because our understanding our


---------93:16----------
understanding of the brain in the mind


---------93:18----------
is in its infancy compared to like the


---------93:21----------
physiology of the heart or like our


---------93:23----------
understanding of like the gut


---------93:26----------
okay so then how do we evaluate that


---------93:30----------
someone actually has a real problem


---------93:32----------
it's it's it's the DSM and observational


---------93:34----------
yeah so so one so now the destroy the


---------93:38----------
DSM I'm not done yet


---------93:39----------
so remember them actually it's not a


---------93:41----------
clinical manual so the DSM was it's not


---------93:44----------
it's just it's a research manual so it's


---------93:46----------
a group of researchers saying how can we


---------93:48----------
agree that we're all talking about the


---------93:50----------
same thing okay so the the DSM was


---------93:53----------
developed for inclusion criteria for


---------93:55----------
studies so when you go and sign up for a


---------93:57----------
study they ask you are you depressed


---------93:59----------
so like if I if I'm doing a study and


---------94:01----------
I'm gonna say like I'm gonna do I'm


---------94:03----------
developing the Devin Nash treatment for


---------94:05----------
depression and then people say like okay


---------94:08----------
how are you gonna like find depressed


---------94:10----------
people I'm gonna ask him hey man are you


---------94:11----------
depressed and they're like yeah and I'm


---------94:14----------
like okay come on you're gonna spend an


---------94:16----------
hour with Devin Nash and then the end of


---------94:17----------
the hour I'm gonna ask you hey man are


---------94:19----------
you depressed and he says no and I'm


---------94:20----------
like boom done cured right so


---------94:24----------
researchers sat down and they were like


---------94:26----------
well we have to we have to figure out


---------94:27----------
like how are we gonna know whether


---------94:28----------
people get better how are we gonna know


---------94:30----------
like who to include how are we gonna


---------94:32----------
draw the line for where depression is


---------94:34----------
and that's when they came up with their


---------94:36----------
five out of nine criteria okay


---------94:39----------
then what happened is insurance


---------94:41----------
companies we're trying to figure out


---------94:43----------
okay this person says they're depressed


---------94:45----------
how do we know whether like we can't


---------94:48----------
blood test them so how do we know


---------94:49----------
whether we want to pay for their


---------94:50----------
treatment we're gonna see if they meet


---------94:54----------
DSM criteria because someone has a


---------94:56----------
criteria somewhere and we're an


---------94:58----------
insurance company and we want to see if


---------95:00----------
we pay for treatment whether it's gonna


---------95:01----------
get better or not get better in the


---------95:03----------
studies on antidepressants after all our


---------95:05----------
using these criteria so we're gonna use


---------95:07----------
billing reimbursement and things like


---------95:10----------
that based on the DSM and when the


---------95:12----------
measures companies started doing it


---------95:13----------
always subjective huh the criteria


---------95:16----------
itself is totally get back to the the


---------95:18----------
whole the thing you said at the very


---------95:20----------
first part of this talk is the 2000


---------95:22----------
calorie limit absolute a bunch of people


---------95:24----------
came to consensus and said it was a


---------95:26----------
thing so it is a thing absolutely right


---------95:28----------
it's the same way that the dollar has


---------95:29----------
value because we all got together and


---------95:32----------
agreed so like the the thing to remember


---------95:36----------
about medicine which I think a lot of


---------95:38----------
people don't realize there's a lot of


---------95:39----------
medicine is


---------95:40----------
very scientific right so medicine is


---------95:42----------
like a clinical discipline so at the end


---------95:44----------
of the day you know like even after all


---------95:46----------
of this testing if you really look at


---------95:48----------
studies 90% of clinical diagnosis


---------95:50----------
doesn't matter what field of medicine


---------95:51----------
you're in like 90% of diagnosis is made


---------95:54----------
clinically a doctor comes in like a


---------95:57----------
cancer is like for the most part


---------95:59----------
diagnosed clinically no [ __ ] yeah


---------96:02----------
absolutely


---------96:02----------
how do you think that the person ends up


---------96:04----------
getting a biopsy in the first place like


---------96:06----------
why don't you like Devin are you getting


---------96:08----------
a biopsy tomorrow hopefully not yeah I


---------96:12----------
don't feel bad yeah and furthermore the


---------96:15----------
last time you saw your doctor did he


---------96:17----------
send you in for a cancer biopsy he did


---------96:19----------
not but I did do a full round of blood


---------96:21----------
tests the month ago and everything and


---------96:23----------
nothing came up weird so we do so and


---------96:25----------
that's the scientific thing right so


---------96:26----------
like we looked at all the levels of


---------96:29----------
different things in my body


---------96:30----------
triglycerides hba1c right and everything


---------96:34----------
appeared within normal ranges whatever


---------96:35----------
that is so we made a determination that


---------96:37----------
I don't need a biopsy or anything else


---------96:39----------
yeah so but but even then so it sounds


---------96:41----------
like you did some routine testing I mean


---------96:43----------
we won't go into details about that but


---------96:44----------
like the whole reason that someone


---------96:46----------
orders is like when a doctor says okay I


---------96:48----------
want to get a biopsy or I want to get a


---------96:50----------
scan it's because their clinical


---------96:52----------
suspicion no like you've been having


---------96:53----------
weight loss and you've got a lump


---------96:55----------
growing on your shoulder let's biopsy


---------96:59----------
that like it's all clinical right so


---------97:01----------
it's not actually so tests and medicine


---------97:03----------
are used to confirm diagnosis not to


---------97:07----------
find diagnosis so the first thing that


---------97:09----------
this person doesn't understand is like


---------97:11----------
video game addiction has the same


---------97:13----------
standard meets the same standard as like


---------97:16----------
depression there's no blood tests for


---------97:18----------
schizophrenia


---------97:19----------
yeah there's no brain scan for


---------97:21----------
schizophrenia


---------97:22----------
first of psychosis or anything like that


---------97:25----------
we literally


---------97:27----------
wait wait okay hold on okay cuz this is


---------97:29----------
insane yep


---------97:31----------
if you take the brain of a psychotic


---------97:33----------
patient who you who is like saying


---------97:35----------
there's a pink elephant right there that


---------97:36----------
is yelling at me then you take the brain


---------97:38----------
of a normal person there's no difference


---------97:39----------
you can't there's no reading or test we


---------97:41----------
can do that tell the difference we knows


---------97:42----------
two people nope okay


---------97:44----------
in Alzheimer's people if you I know for


---------97:46----------
a fact if you take the the brain scans


---------97:49----------
they do look different eventually see


---------97:50----------
the matter of the brain is reduced yes


---------97:53----------
so Alzheimer's is something we can


---------97:54----------
diagnose scientifically actually


---------97:56----------
technically Alzheimer's can only be


---------97:58----------
diagnosed through autopsy in biopsy but


---------98:01----------
that's besides so so this is what we see


---------98:05----------
the the brain matter is reduced yep I


---------98:08----------
mean well the reason that you can't


---------98:09----------
diagnose Alzheimer's through that is


---------98:11----------
because there are a lot of reasons why


---------98:12----------
brain matter can be reduced like what


---------98:15----------
else could produce brain matter so any


---------98:17----------
other of the dementing diseases are we


---------98:20----------
lose brain matter just over the course


---------98:22----------
of life if you have things like vascular


---------98:24----------
disease your brain matter can be smaller


---------98:26----------
like there are all kinds of reasons your


---------98:28----------
brain mass can be reduced so Alzheimer's


---------98:30----------
can really only be diagnosed by a biopsy


---------98:32----------
technically so it's a clinical diagnosis


---------98:36----------
okay but psych Coast you could take a


---------98:38----------
psychotic patient who is literally


---------98:40----------
screaming at a wall that there are bugs


---------98:42----------
coming out of it and then you can take


---------98:43----------
another person right next to them who's


---------98:45----------
like hey man how's it going and they


---------98:47----------
look exactly the same one on any kind of


---------98:49----------
technology we have to tell they don't


---------98:51----------
look exactly the same but there isn't


---------98:53----------
enough information from either scan to


---------98:57----------
differentiate like if I showed a


---------98:59----------
radiologist a picture of a psychotic


---------99:01----------
person in a picture of you


---------99:02----------
the radiologist would not be able to


---------99:04----------
tell you which one is which which


---------99:06----------
doesn't even have a say mission huh


---------99:07----------
would even have a suspicion that one is


---------99:09----------
the other probably North literally 55th


---------99:11----------
probably not although I do think that if


---------99:13----------
you take on average people who have


---------99:15----------
psychotic disease over time there are


---------99:19----------
some findings in the brain on average


---------99:21----------
but those are like research findings


---------99:23----------
that are not like they're not enough of


---------99:26----------
a smoking gun to be clinically useful


---------99:28----------
yet does that make sense kind of but is


---------99:31----------
that a technicality because isn't it


---------99:32----------
isn't the correlation to actually become


---------99:34----------
clinically you still like incredibly


---------99:35----------
high like we need we have a really high


---------99:37----------
standard for something to become


---------99:38----------
clinically correlated yes


---------99:41----------
and so is there a fair argument in


---------99:43----------
saying that at some point you would have


---------99:45----------
to dispense with that really high


---------99:46----------
standard to make any kind of progress


---------99:47----------
whatsoever


---------99:48----------
because like for example in nutrition


---------99:50----------
right there I could point you to this


---------99:52----------
something I know a lot about so you


---------99:54----------
teach this um you can't you this is the


---------99:56----------
same problem you can't really point I


---------99:58----------
can't really tell you that vegetables


---------100:00----------
are better for you because like when you


---------100:02----------
really look down into the data it


---------100:04----------
doesn't objectively show that but I can


---------100:06----------
[ __ ] tell you that vegetables are


---------100:08----------
better for you yeah you see what I mean


---------100:09----------
yeah


---------100:10----------
so and I think that's just like there's


---------100:12----------
a shortcoming of science so like we're


---------100:15----------
not willing to dispense so I mean


---------100:17----------
practically there are some cases where


---------100:19----------
if I have a psychotic patient I will


---------100:21----------
order an MRI but that's because if this


---------100:24----------
clinical diagonals story doesn't fit


---------100:27----------
with psychosis then sometimes so for


---------100:31----------
example if you like it's just like let's


---------100:33----------
say like you walked into the IDI and you


---------100:35----------
have no history of psychosis you're a


---------100:37----------
high functioning dude you're socially


---------100:39----------
capable and you're like hallucinating


---------100:41----------
I'm gonna order a blood test or you're


---------100:44----------
in rest yes


---------100:45----------
for what for like cocaine in marijuana


---------100:48----------
and LSD so yeah so like there are tests


---------100:52----------
and tests have value but usually tests


---------100:54----------
for psychosis or to rule out because


---------100:57----------
psychosis can be caused by more than


---------100:58----------
schizophrenia


---------101:00----------
right they can because psychosis can be


---------101:02----------
caused by drugs so the experience of


---------101:03----------
hallucinations can be caused by drugs


---------101:05----------
they can be caused by some illnesses hmm


---------101:08----------
so like if you have a brain tumor you


---------101:10----------
can become psychotic yeah that's nice


---------101:13----------
yeah so like like there is value in


---------101:15----------
ordering brain scans on people who have


---------101:18----------
mental illness to rule out organic


---------101:21----------
causes or like primary like their mount


---------101:23----------
mental illness is secondary to something


---------101:26----------
else that's going on in their body right


---------101:30----------
so for a good one is like some people


---------101:31----------
who are depressed that's because their


---------101:34----------
thyroid hormone is very low and if you


---------101:35----------
like because they're like thyroids shot


---------101:37----------
so if you give them thyroid hormone


---------101:38----------
their depression goes away so like


---------101:41----------
testing has a role in psychiatry but


---------101:43----------
it's just you know if this if someone


---------101:44----------
says oh like there haven't been good


---------101:46----------
studies proving video game addiction


---------101:47----------
exists well yeah but that's because like


---------101:49----------
[ __ ] Mario was developed in 1980 and


---------101:51----------
we've had depression like rolling


---------101:54----------
through our population for the last


---------101:56----------
5,000 plus years like it's depression


---------102:01----------
well there isn't there that meme that


---------102:03----------
like people got started to get depressed


---------102:04----------
like when the industrial era came about


---------102:06----------
like is that is that true is it do we


---------102:08----------
have depression like going back like


---------102:10----------
there's Romans have read up a brochure


---------102:11----------
yeah absolutely yeah but I do think that


---------102:14----------
we got more depressed one once the


---------102:16----------
industrial area came along and we're


---------102:17----------
getting even more depressed now


---------102:19----------
the suicide rate amongst adolescents has


---------102:21----------
gone up by 50% in the last seven years


---------102:23----------
in the last seven years global you're in


---------102:28----------
the United States I think us oh my god


---------102:34----------
whatsit adolescent adolescent that's


---------102:36----------
someone under the age of eight swing


---------102:37----------
like 12 and 18 12 to 18 so the rate of


---------102:44----------
suicide for adolescents has gone up 50%


---------102:47----------
in seven years people think 1218 I think


---------102:50----------
it's adolescence and not everyone but I


---------102:51----------
could be wrong there and it's also true


---------102:55----------
that middle-aged white men are the most


---------102:57----------
common suicidal or people to commit


---------103:01----------
suicide


---------103:01----------
yes so men commit if you take a hundred


---------103:04----------
people who commit suicide 80 of them are


---------103:05----------
gonna be men


---------103:09----------
I think it's a four to one ratio oh my


---------103:13----------
god white male priviledge baby Jesus


---------103:22----------
okay so okay so the whole hard studies


---------103:27----------
no heart states to diagnose depression


---------103:29----------
this almost ties back into your point


---------103:32----------
that we can't really trust external Jets


---------103:34----------
of reality they're like bit like


---------103:36----------
remember we were going back to like wow


---------103:38----------
that's that's a broad connection but


---------103:42----------
because because um your whole point I


---------103:46----------
think that's like that's trying to like


---------103:47----------
sometimes I try to like find like a


---------103:49----------
theme of a talk yeah yeah I hear ya yeah


---------103:51----------
and I feel like the theme of today was


---------103:54----------
like we really can't trust our outside


---------103:57----------
experience so so and the only way that


---------104:01----------
you as a clinician are evoking this idea


---------104:03----------
of someone being depressed is by


---------104:05----------
receiving listening to their internal


---------104:08----------
experience and then interpreted it for


---------104:10----------
them yeah right I mean I guess just


---------104:13----------
their subjective internal experience


---------104:15----------
right so I'll use like how they look


---------104:17----------
what their face displays how they sound


---------104:24----------
so I mean I need sensory data


---------104:31----------
okay so it then I am I am more lost than


---------104:36----------
I've ever been before


---------104:37----------
okay now we can get started it's because


---------104:44----------
like if you have if you have nothing all


---------104:47----------
right


---------104:48----------
let's say Devin what's your question


---------104:50----------
just just what's your question man


---------104:52----------
what's your question I have tons of


---------104:54----------
questions okay


---------104:55----------
like just ask the one that's in your


---------104:56----------
head


---------104:58----------
well that's it done I think it's done


---------104:59----------
but here we go um if you're floating in


---------105:02----------
a tank and you need something to hold on


---------105:04----------
to but by definition there are no walls


---------105:07----------
because everything is external all you


---------105:10----------
have is yourself what do you do see that


---------105:12----------
so that's why I have to think about my


---------105:13----------
questions before I ask them because I


---------105:14----------
don't make sense


---------105:15----------
so I mean because I think that that's


---------105:16----------
what the Yogi's discover right at the


---------105:18----------
end of the day


---------105:20----------
so the way to understand what your


---------105:22----------
consciousness is is to check into it in


---------105:25----------
all kinds of different moments so like


---------105:28----------
when I meditated I found this part of me


---------105:30----------
that seemed to be like calm and peaceful


---------105:32----------
and empty horribly empty terrifyingly


---------105:35----------
empty and at the same time wonderfully


---------105:37----------
comforting but just like it's kind of


---------105:39----------
like looking at the Grand Canyon it's


---------105:40----------
like it's crazy but it's also


---------105:42----------
magnificent it's like terrifying and


---------105:44----------
awe-inspiring and and that's what you


---------105:46----------
sort of feel on the inside when you have


---------105:48----------
some spiritual experiences of meditation


---------105:50----------
and then I went through my life and I


---------105:52----------
got pretty good at tapping into that so


---------105:54----------
I could basically tap into it whenever I


---------105:55----------
wanted mm-hmm and then I went through


---------105:58----------
various experiences in my life where I


---------106:00----------
was wondering whether


---------106:04----------
um like I was wondering whether I could


---------106:07----------
have an experience what that would take


---------106:08----------
that away so as I got more and more


---------106:11----------
grounded in it then like I remembered


---------106:13----------
like the you know my dad passed away and


---------106:15----------
like I was like at his funeral and and


---------106:17----------
like despite the fact that I was


---------106:18----------
grieving I still found that sort of calm


---------106:21----------
peaceful emptiness within Muniz like oh


---------106:22----------
that's kind of interesting that's still


---------106:23----------
there


---------106:24----------
and if I tapped into it I sort of felt


---------106:25----------
okay like even though I was feeling


---------106:27----------
grief and sadness there was something


---------106:29----------
inside me that felt tranquil and then a


---------106:31----------
few weeks later I got married and so


---------106:33----------
that's presumably you know a very happy


---------106:35----------
day of my life and even during that


---------106:37----------
happiness like I felt that same amount


---------106:40----------
of like emptiness and void within me and


---------106:43----------
I was like oh like that's that's the one


---------106:45----------
thing in my life that is completely


---------106:47----------
constant


---------106:49----------
so can I let me ask you like


---------106:51----------
[Music]


---------106:53----------
do you


---------106:55----------
you've done this like incredible amount


---------106:58----------
of self introspection and study and


---------107:00----------
meditation but when you appear to me as


---------107:04----------
a person who still struggles with


---------107:10----------
all the problems of being human right


---------107:12----------
you still getting depressed I assume and


---------107:13----------
you still get like anxious sometimes and


---------107:15----------
things like that


---------107:15----------
sure like so I don't know I'll give on


---------107:18----------
your off time like when you get off the


---------107:19----------
call like you're like fighting Dormammu


---------107:21----------
or something with the powers that you've


---------107:22----------
gained from like Tibetan meditation or


---------107:24----------
whatever but like like what it seems to


---------107:25----------
me is like if do you feel like you've


---------107:28----------
gone somewhere like what is the point of


---------107:31----------
all this if you're still just going to


---------107:33----------
experience suffering and an anxiety and


---------107:39----------
depression and you have all these things


---------107:41----------
like where did you end up like where are


---------107:44----------
you today that makes any difference in


---------107:46----------
the path that you've taken why should we


---------107:48----------
do it well is it because I think I


---------107:50----------
suffer less than many other people you


---------107:52----------
do yeah


---------107:56----------
why do you think that because I found


---------107:58----------
that thing within like that's my whole


---------108:00----------
point right like remember we're talking


---------108:02----------
about what Luca and so I did get better


---------108:04----------
for you yeah well so the emotional paint


---------108:07----------
so my cancer pain remains still in nine


---------108:10----------
it just doesn't know me as much alright


---------108:13----------
that's the reason you do that's worth do


---------108:16----------
you think that's worth it you know


---------108:17----------
absolutely because that's the only thing


---------108:19----------
that's worth it


---------108:21----------
that's the only thing that's worth it


---------108:23----------
yeah because like so now when I like


---------108:25----------
when when stuff goes well for me or


---------108:27----------
doesn't go well for me like I tend to be


---------108:29----------
like okay with either one


---------108:31----------
okay with what either one either one so


---------108:35----------
so Devin like the whole reason so when


---------108:37----------
we think about like when I think about


---------108:39----------
my the change in my life right from


---------108:42----------
being like failing out of college and


---------108:45----------
graduating with a 2.6 like you would


---------108:49----------
think that after applying to medical


---------108:51----------
school for two years in a row and


---------108:53----------
getting over a hundred and forty


---------108:54----------
rejections I would be bummed out yeah


---------108:58----------
and like you would think that I would


---------108:59----------
stop


---------109:02----------
but like the whole point is that sure I


---------109:04----------
felt disappointment but I also felt


---------109:05----------
tranquility and so I just kept doing it


---------109:09----------
and and like that's the value right so


---------109:13----------
what's happened is that I'm no longer I


---------109:15----------
mean I am but for the most part I think


---------109:17----------
like cuz I'm not a different person this


---------109:19----------
is like this has to be understood like


---------109:21----------
people think that I made some amazing


---------109:23----------
transformational change like 2.6 GPA


---------109:26----------
instructor in psychiatry at Harvard


---------109:28----------
Medical School like that's a big gap and


---------109:30----------
people think that you have to like


---------109:32----------
change a lot like the whole point that I


---------109:34----------
try to tell people is I'm actually not


---------109:36----------
that smart like I'm not I'm just not


---------109:38----------
that like I'm smart like I know I'm


---------109:40----------
smart but I'm not like that smart that's


---------109:43----------
probably not true so so let's say if you


---------109:46----------
looked at you if you looked at the if


---------109:48----------
you did IQ test you probably like 130


---------109:51----------
140 150 like you have to realize you


---------109:53----------
probably have an insane amount of I


---------109:56----------
think about this a lot with like what a


---------109:58----------
software engineers and people like that


---------109:59----------
like they just come in with such a high


---------110:02----------
IQ and the ability to cognate of these


---------110:05----------
things so look it's such a huge let me


---------110:07----------
rephrase yeah so when I look at other


---------110:10----------
people and I think about my trajectory


---------110:12----------
in life in their trajectory in life I


---------110:14----------
don't think that IQ is the thing that's


---------110:16----------
responsible for my success I think it is


---------110:20----------
being able to not let my negative


---------110:23----------
experiences impact my intentions


---------110:30----------
because I'm telling you like I'm not


---------110:32----------
that like you look at like people who


---------110:35----------
are addicted to video games like a lot


---------110:36----------
of them are [ __ ] brilliant


---------110:39----------
yeah like this is what I'm telling you


---------110:41----------
because when I when I when I play with


---------110:43----------
my friends so like I have a group of


---------110:45----------
people that I used to play dota with and


---------110:47----------
I think I'm I'm objectively far more


---------110:50----------
successful than than they are but I'm


---------110:52----------
pretty sure I'm not much smarter or


---------110:55----------
smarter at all yeah a degree I serious I


---------110:58----------
write like well there's a ton of people


---------111:00----------
that play video games they're believably


---------111:02----------
smart so yeah it's that's what I'm


---------111:03----------
saying I'm not like I'm I'm definitely


---------111:05----------
smarter than like the average person


---------111:07----------
walking down the street probably


---------111:08----------
substantially smarter than the average


---------111:09----------
person walking down the street but I


---------111:11----------
think if you look at video games video


---------111:13----------
games select for people who have very


---------111:15----------
high IQs why


---------111:19----------
yeah so very simple so let me ask you


---------111:21----------
something so I'll tell you a story that


---------111:23----------
a video of someone gamer I was working


---------111:25----------
with so video gamer is in second grade


---------111:27----------
they go into math class and teacher says


---------111:30----------
here's your math worksheet for the day


---------111:32----------
the kid looks at it fills it out in


---------111:35----------
about 10 minutes


---------111:36----------
walks up to the teacher and says here's


---------111:38----------
the worksheet can I have the next one


---------111:40----------
what do you think the teacher says


---------111:45----------
teacher says that's what we're doing


---------111:47----------
today you'll get the next one tomorrow


---------111:48----------
okay please sit down and quietly sit at


---------111:51----------
your desk and the kid goes back so then


---------111:55----------
what happens is like school moves at the


---------111:57----------
pace of the slowest kid yeah right so


---------112:02----------
that happens as this kid goes home and


---------112:04----------
then he beats level one of ninja gayden


---------112:07----------
and do you know what's waiting for him


---------112:09----------
well - absolutely yeah so if you're a


---------112:13----------
smart kid why the [ __ ] would you want to


---------112:16----------
invest in a classroom that is just 50


---------112:19----------
minutes of boring in 10 minutes of


---------112:21----------
interesting versus


---------112:24----------
a intellectual challenge that is


---------112:27----------
literally paced exactly to you because


---------112:31----------
you know what if he's not ready for


---------112:33----------
level two you know what he has trouble


---------112:34----------
doing


---------112:36----------
you can't beat chess how about level 1


---------112:38----------
absolutely


---------112:39----------
yeah yeah so video games for smart kids


---------112:43----------
video games give them the intellectual


---------112:45----------
challenge that they don't find in the


---------112:47----------
rest of their life


---------112:51----------
mm yeah it's not complicated it's not


---------112:55----------
like some deep scientist it's just like


---------112:57----------
it says yeah hmm so like one of the


---------113:01----------
reasons that video games are addictive


---------113:03----------
is because they're perfectly paced to


---------113:04----------
you know job is perfectly paced to you


---------113:07----------
know class is perfectly paced to you


---------113:10----------
right like no wonder people like playing


---------113:12----------
video games yeah they're gonna there


---------113:14----------
it's like video games are like a


---------113:17----------
spiritual like an enlightened spiritual


---------113:19----------
guru who meets you exactly where you are


---------113:21----------
and knows the next step you need to take


---------113:22----------
accept in a weird way you're not getting


---------113:24----------
any benefit from playing them you're not


---------113:26----------
getting any benefit why is that well you


---------113:29----------
know so why is it well what I'm saying


---------113:31----------
it's like if you accomplish a hard task


---------113:33----------
in real life it has like a reverberation


---------113:37----------
to it that like results in like positive


---------113:40----------
outcomes for you but if you do that in a


---------113:42----------
video game it's ephemeral it's not quite


---------113:44----------
there why is that well I think that's


---------113:46----------
because generally speaking we think


---------113:48----------
about hard tasks is having real-world


---------113:50----------
value so our society tends to value


---------113:54----------
things that are harder to do ie back to


---------113:57----------
our burrito for you know eating burritos


---------113:58----------
for a million dollars we tend to pay


---------114:01----------
people more based on the difficulty of


---------114:03----------
what they do not the difficulty of what


---------114:05----------
they do but how rare it is for someone


---------114:08----------
to be able to do it yeah yeah


---------114:11----------
but but uh what I'm saying is on the


---------114:13----------
same token so what say that you complete


---------114:15----------
like a really hard like Ninja Gaiden


---------114:17----------
it's actually funny bringing up that's a


---------114:19----------
very hard game yeah especially the


---------114:22----------
original ones are some of the hardest


---------114:23----------
games like out there so let's say you


---------114:24----------
actually do beat Ninja Gaiden and you go


---------114:27----------
all the way through that sense of


---------114:29----------
accomplishment that you get as a result


---------114:31----------
of completing that is ephemeral it just


---------114:34----------
kind of floats away but in real life


---------114:36----------
when you do something that is really


---------114:39----------
difficult like you build a house or you


---------114:43----------
or you know what that is probably a big


---------114:46----------
stream thing some equivalent thing of


---------114:47----------
value like you create something or


---------114:49----------
something it seems to have more staying


---------114:51----------
power do you know what I mean yeah I


---------114:52----------
don't have a good way to describe this


---------114:53----------
like what I'm trying to ask is like why


---------114:57----------
is it that the accomplishments that come


---------114:59----------
from video games just sort of float away


---------115:00----------
from us they escape us it's like they're


---------115:02----------
not even real to begin with I know they


---------115:04----------
aren't but there's a lot of


---------115:05----------
accomplishments in real life that we can


---------115:06----------
do like get a girlfriend for example


---------115:09----------
well because like no I understand your


---------115:13----------
question so it's like it's like I'm


---------115:16----------
gonna I'm gonna read into your question


---------115:17----------
a little bit the first premise that I


---------115:19----------
think you're making is that for a few


---------115:21----------
moments the accomplishment that you get


---------115:23----------
in the video game feels the same as a


---------115:26----------
real life exactly but it lasts right so


---------115:30----------
like that's the first thing to recognize


---------115:31----------
and this is where once again your brain


---------115:33----------
doesn't know the difference like your


---------115:35----------
brain is actually and in some way


---------115:36----------
relatively smart and also incredibly


---------115:38----------
stupid your brain doesn't understand the


---------115:40----------
all the brain understand so you have


---------115:42----------
this thing that there's a actually xx I


---------115:43----------
have a youtube video all about this


---------115:45----------
about something that I call the triumph


---------115:46----------
circuit and the brain doesn't understand


---------115:49----------
so you get like a dopamine reward upon


---------115:53----------
completing a task that is proportional


---------115:55----------
to the difficulty of the task okay and


---------115:58----------
if you think about it like if you use


---------115:59----------
like a god mode cheat code in a video


---------116:02----------
game does the video game become more or


---------116:05----------
less fun oh it sucks yeah yeah so our


---------116:10----------
brain is wired to get more of a dopamine


---------116:14----------
response when there's difficulty


---------116:15----------
involved and so like why do people love


---------116:18----------
dark souls because it's hard absolutely


---------116:21----------
yeah and you really really have to


---------116:23----------
figure out the exact


---------116:25----------
and how does it feel when you when you


---------116:27----------
do well in Dark Souls right yeah so this


---------116:31----------
is where someone made a fascinating


---------116:32----------
discovery back in 2014 that videogames


---------116:35----------
are addictive not because of the reward


---------116:37----------
but because of the denial of the Lord


---------116:39----------
that separates them from all other like


---------116:42----------
drug addictions when when I shoot up


---------116:45----------
heroin there's no chance that I'm not


---------116:48----------
gonna get high like that's the whole


---------116:49----------
thing right


---------116:50----------
every time I smoke pot it's gonna be


---------116:52----------
good every time i snort coke it's gonna


---------116:54----------
be good


---------116:54----------
every time I get smashed it's gonna be


---------116:56----------
good I mean there are problems but


---------116:57----------
biologically like I'm gonna get the


---------116:59----------
reward from the alcohol


---------117:00----------
what makes videogames so damn addictive


---------117:02----------
is that you get the rewards sometimes


---------117:04----------
like why do you think so many people


---------117:06----------
play law in Fortnight it's because you


---------117:08----------
don't win very often and this also goes


---------117:10----------
back to the loot box problem right I'm


---------117:12----------
like why do people continuously invest


---------117:14----------
tens of thousands of dollars in blue


---------117:15----------
plus cuz you're not sure you're going to


---------117:17----------
get the epic skin that you want and and


---------117:20----------
they're there at a governmental level


---------117:22----------
like the UK is looking at this like holy


---------117:23----------
[ __ ] like this is so addictive that we


---------117:25----------
might have to ban this across our


---------117:27----------
country because this is so bad because


---------117:30----------
those are the those that's the way that


---------117:31----------
it interacts with us yeah yeah that


---------117:34----------
makes perfect sense so now going back to


---------117:37----------
your original question why is it


---------117:38----------
ephemeral it's because the video games


---------117:40----------
tickle one part of your mind but don't


---------117:42----------
tickle other parts of your mind so when


---------117:45----------
we think about triumph in the real world


---------117:47----------
there are other things that go with it


---------117:49----------
so when I for example when I graduated


---------117:50----------
with a medical degree that was a hard


---------117:53----------
road and I actually felt neutral when I


---------117:55----------
graduated


---------117:56----------
it's a side result of meditation but


---------117:59----------
there's also a lot of other things that


---------118:02----------
are tied into that right so like that


---------118:05----------
means that like when I meet someone


---------118:06----------
they're going to greet me in a


---------118:08----------
particular way which reinforces that hi


---------118:10----------
that means that when I you know when I


---------118:13----------
get pulled over like like I have a


---------118:15----------
disaster pass so a couple years ago


---------118:17----------
there was a hurricane and like I get to


---------118:19----------
go places that other people don't get to


---------118:21----------
go because I have an MD after my name


---------118:23----------
that's awesome yeah I never even thought


---------118:25----------
of that but that actually makes perfect


---------118:26----------
sense like people would send you into a


---------118:28----------
relief zone because I go it's a [ __ ]


---------118:29----------
doctor so like it like like if there's


---------118:31----------
like if there's a hurricane and there's


---------118:32----------
like a barrier with cop cars I Drive up


---------118:34----------
to the cop car I show my badge and they


---------118:36----------
waved me through that's it's saying


---------118:38----------
right


---------118:39----------
so like there are other things in


---------118:40----------
society that reinforced that


---------118:42----------
accomplishment whereas like when you


---------118:43----------
play with and play ninja gayden like


---------118:45----------
what happens after yeah you beat it and


---------118:48----------
then like you can make a forum post on


---------118:50----------
reddit about it so that's very important


---------118:53----------
so if you make the forum post and it


---------118:55----------
gets uploaded what happens to your hai


---------118:57----------
from beating the game right continues


---------118:59----------
absolutely right yeah and then you end


---------119:01----------
up is a streamer and now suddenly and


---------119:05----------
now suddenly you have subs and you have


---------119:10----------
people and people watch you and now


---------119:13----------
you're not so different from an MD with


---------119:15----------
a disaster pass right because you're


---------119:17----------
going to twitchcon


---------119:19----------
and then then muricans I don't think so


---------119:24----------
yeah but they didn't get into all the


---------119:26----------
stress and all that crap well but this


---------119:29----------
this [ __ ] stress of being a doctor I


---------119:31----------
mean you like like for sure so it


---------119:33----------
becomes this you're saying it becomes


---------119:34----------
the same as some level like because yeah


---------119:37----------
I'm sure like Shroud is the best FPS


---------119:39----------
player in existence right I mean he's a


---------119:40----------
literal god of FPS and he definitely has


---------119:43----------
the societal clout to back that up and


---------119:45----------
in tons of opportunities at the same


---------119:47----------
time there's a lot of stress I mean for


---------119:48----------
you um did you do practicing like did


---------119:51----------
you you've um you've been in a hot I'm


---------119:55----------
sorry I don't know what about this but


---------119:57----------
you've like been in a hospital and


---------119:58----------
people come to you and be like doctor


---------120:00----------
I've got this problem yeah right okay so


---------120:03----------
you actually and that's long hours and


---------120:05----------
like really hard and stuff so like


---------120:07----------
there's a lot of stress like the stress


---------120:09----------
of being a doctor's like some of the


---------120:10----------
highest stress there is right so I don't


---------120:12----------
think that that's stressful so it's hard


---------120:15----------
work but I don't think it's stressful I


---------120:16----------
so like for example the you know once


---------120:18----------
again this is kind of weird I enjoyed


---------120:19----------
being on call so like I actually found


---------120:22----------
rather than going to the office from


---------120:23----------
9:00 to 5:00 I love the feeling of being


---------120:26----------
like I sort of got a lot of


---------120:29----------
gratification out of like being the guy


---------120:32----------
being the guy yeah so like you know when


---------120:34----------
when something so when I take call it or


---------120:36----------
when I used to take call at Mass General


---------120:37----------
there are two psychiatrists who are


---------120:39----------
working overnight one of them is a


---------120:41----------
senior and one of them is a junior and


---------120:43----------
the junior works are exclusively in the


---------120:45----------
emergency room and the senior works in


---------120:47----------
the emergency room and covers anything


---------120:49----------
else that happens in the 960 beds in the


---------120:52----------
hospital okay and so like if someone has


---------120:54----------
a psychiatric problem overnight like I


---------120:56----------
get paged and I go there and like I


---------120:57----------
really enjoyed that like I sort of like


---------120:59----------
working intensely for long periods of


---------121:01----------
time and then like relaxing for long


---------121:04----------
periods of time like the 9 to 5 grind


---------121:06----------
just hasn't worked for me because of my


---------121:08----------
automatic dough shot which we can talk


---------121:09----------
about one day but well what does that


---------121:11----------
mean that as a practice of it's a really


---------121:19----------
old practice of medicine yeah so it's


---------121:21----------
traditional Indian medicine and the big


---------121:22----------
thing that I read that says that Western


---------121:25----------
medicine doesn't say is that people are


---------121:26----------
fundamentally different so there are


---------121:28----------
different kinds of cognitive


---------121:29----------
fingerprints so just as an example


---------121:33----------
I have a particular kind of memory where


---------121:35----------
I seem very intelligent because I learn


---------121:38----------
things very quickly and I'm very dynamic


---------121:40----------
but I also lose things very quickly like


---------121:43----------
I wanted to go I had a medical student


---------121:45----------
rotating with me and I forgot the five


---------121:48----------
out of nine criteria for depression and


---------121:52----------
it's just because I don't you like I'm


---------121:53----------
gonna lose it like it so my memory I


---------121:55----------
pick things up fast and I lose things


---------121:57----------
fast and she said I have the same way I


---------121:59----------
never thought about myself that way


---------122:00----------
though yeah yes and so a lot of people


---------122:02----------
like think that they're not as smart or


---------122:04----------
but but it's just their minds are


---------122:06----------
different and you have to understand


---------122:07----------
like what your mind is good at and what


---------122:09----------
your mind is bad at and it's not just


---------122:11----------
raw IQ there are different kinds of


---------122:13----------
memory there are different kinds of like


---------122:14----------
so I'm someone who so my mind is very


---------122:18----------
dynamic so I get bored very easily but I


---------122:20----------
can work intensely for short periods of


---------122:22----------
time and other people are like slow and


---------122:25----------
steady wins the race like some people


---------122:26----------
are like you know for example I try to


---------122:28----------
write from time to time and people are


---------122:30----------
like the way that you write is you have


---------122:31----------
to just do like you have to sit down you


---------122:33----------
today what one page a day and I'm not


---------122:35----------
like that what I'll do is write the


---------122:37----------
Horta Cole and they need to take yeah


---------122:38----------
yeah so I woke up yesterday morning and


---------122:41----------
I was like I figured out anxiety I know


---------122:43----------
everything about anxiety and it just


---------122:45----------
came to me like a flash of brilliance i


---------122:47----------
sat down put a lot of it out and it was


---------122:49----------
done it's not done yet but like I got


---------122:52----------
like 70% of yeah yeah yeah I'm exactly


---------122:56----------
the same as actually create and so the


---------122:58----------
crazy thing is that people don't


---------122:59----------
recognize that your personality and your


---------123:02----------
cognitive fingerprint is not optimized


---------123:04----------
to certain jobs or careers and if you


---------123:06----------
want to be successful you have to figure


---------123:08----------
out okay what kind of memory do I have


---------123:10----------
what kind of when people have started to


---------123:12----------
understand this in terms of like


---------123:13----------
introversion and extraversion like some


---------123:15----------
people recognize oh I'm just not a


---------123:16----------
people person


---------123:17----------
so if I want to do really well like I


---------123:19----------
need time to be alone and like not have


---------123:21----------
other people bother their me to be


---------123:23----------
productive and so the more you


---------123:24----------
understand these kinds of things you


---------123:26----------
know the more productive you're going to


---------123:28----------
be the more successful we're gonna be in


---------123:29----------
an aria vedic tradition has there's


---------123:32----------
there's there's types of bodies right


---------123:35----------
and they're related to elements fire yes


---------123:37----------
water yes I don't one of them is a peat


---------123:40----------
Pitta yeah you have you have some yet


---------123:43----------
you're like bit devatta yeah yeah yeah I


---------123:46----------
think so yeah


---------123:47----------
that's-that's-that's soap it PETA is


---------123:48----------
fire yep and Vaughn says water vatta's


---------123:52----------
air and ether each one has two elements


---------123:55----------
okay so I'm so the one way to think


---------123:58----------
about bath has a little like the wind so


---------124:00----------
the wind blows really hard in one


---------124:01----------
direction and then stops and then blows


---------124:04----------
really hard in the other direction and


---------124:05----------
then stops and you used another word


---------124:08----------
called dosha what is that


---------124:10----------
so Vata Pitta and kapha dosha that's


---------124:13----------
like the class that's the class of thing


---------124:15----------
okay yeah so so so because of your yeah


---------124:18----------
I'm totally on page okay because I know


---------124:19----------
I know a little bit about this yeah yeah


---------124:21----------
so I think like a lot of people don't


---------124:22----------
recognize that if you're so I'm like the


---------124:25----------
wind so part of the reason that and I


---------124:27----------
think you are too so you do more than


---------124:28----------
one thing because you just get really


---------124:30----------
bored if you just had a job or you just


---------124:32----------
did twitch streaming you have to be


---------124:34----------
doing a lot of different things so one


---------124:36----------
of the best pieces of advice that I got


---------124:38----------
was from an Ayurvedic doctor who has


---------124:40----------
studying with and he said in order for


---------124:42----------
you to be successful you have to juggle


---------124:44----------
as many balls as you can without


---------124:45----------
dropping a single one


---------124:48----------
in order for you to be successful yet to


---------124:50----------
drop as you have to juggle what they


---------124:52----------
mean by that so that I should handle


---------124:54----------
like so part of my problem he was


---------124:56----------
basically telling me I should do as many


---------124:58----------
different things as I can and still do


---------125:00----------
them well I shouldn't focus on just one


---------125:02----------
thing because he knew that if you


---------125:04----------
focused on one thing you become bored


---------125:07----------
and you would yes yeah mm-hmm so now


---------125:09----------
like I mean I'd this a whole healthy


---------125:11----------
gamer stuff I have a private practice I


---------125:13----------
was at a conference today talking about


---------125:15----------
technology and health I like you know I


---------125:19----------
play video games I work with eSports


---------125:21----------
professionals yeah


---------125:24----------
I run retreats like if I'm just doing


---------125:26----------
the same thing every week I'm just gonna


---------125:27----------
get bored and I'm gonna suck at all of


---------125:29----------
it yeah I totally understand I'm exactly


---------125:32----------
the same way that's right but just by


---------125:34----------
curiosity do you have a similar read out


---------125:38----------
in terms of are you betta called OSHA do


---------125:40----------
you have the same tendency that you


---------125:42----------
sense to me I think yours is either more


---------125:45----------
applying more Vata and you're more bitte


---------125:47----------
you also have some gafas more than I do


---------125:50----------
I'm very extreme in terms of vaca and


---------125:52----------
have a fair amount of pizza whereas I


---------125:54----------
think you have some Vata I'd say a fair


---------125:58----------
amount of pizza do you get angry easily


---------125:59----------
I used to okay and then now I almost I


---------126:03----------
don't I used to have a huge problem with


---------126:05----------
yeah so I think your your bit the


---------126:07----------
predominant with some amount of vodka


---------126:09----------
and Gotha as well like also your your


---------126:11----------
hair pattern is consistent with a bit


---------126:13----------
though yeah mmm okay it's very cool wow


---------126:16----------
that's super interesting


---------126:18----------
okay um real quick sorry Jade just


---------126:22----------
hosted us I don't know of any way of you


---------126:23----------
saw it Jade thank you very much that for


---------126:27----------
everybody's just joining I was like 900


---------126:29----------
people so this real quick it's um


---------126:30----------
we are meeting with dr. I actually


---------126:34----------
produce your I actually got your name


---------126:36----------
here so that I could produce because I


---------126:37----------
realized I've been pronounced as you


---------126:38----------
introduced yourself before allo Canoga


---------126:42----------
no it's all Lok I look Devon it's easy


---------126:48----------
buddy


---------126:48----------
it's not all maple it's all oak all oak


---------126:52----------
perfect just like the original Sun


---------126:55----------
script kenosha yeah yes a report though


---------126:59----------
yeah okay


---------127:00----------
all oak is a Harvard psychiatrist and


---------127:03----------
he's talking to us today about gaming


---------127:07----------
and in concerns to mental health and


---------127:09----------
we're going into some really deep


---------127:10----------
subjects ultimately to try to we're kind


---------127:14----------
of like building a profile and


---------127:15----------
foundation of how to be what would you


---------127:20----------
say be better mentally through through


---------127:22----------
under but through itself understand kind


---------127:24----------
of like integrating gaming in a way


---------127:27----------
that's like healthy and and yeah I mean


---------127:29----------
I I think yeah Devon so what I tried to


---------127:32----------
do like so you know we have classes for


---------127:34----------
things right we have classes for like


---------127:36----------
mathematics in history yeah and we're


---------127:38----------
formerly taught how these things work


---------127:40----------
like you go to school and you learn


---------127:42----------
computer science and then you like learn


---------127:44----------
how to program we're never taught how we


---------127:46----------
work


---------127:49----------
think about that for subtly yeah no IIIi


---------127:52----------
have like the same way that we're not


---------127:54----------
we're not taught how to do a lot of


---------127:56----------
things that really used to like bounce a


---------127:57----------
checkbook or things like that like so we


---------127:59----------
don't know we're never taught where do


---------128:00----------
our desires come from how does my memory


---------128:02----------
work what are the things that I'm good


---------128:03----------
at what are the things that I'm bad at


---------128:07----------
right we're not taught how we function


---------128:09----------
as human beings and so at the end of the


---------128:11----------
day like you can learn as much as you


---------128:13----------
want to about medicine or screaming or


---------128:14----------
whatever but unless you understand


---------128:16----------
yourself you may still do a good job but


---------128:18----------
you're gonna suffer doing it right so


---------128:21----------
like at some point Devin you and I need


---------128:22----------
to talk about why streaming is so


---------128:24----------
painful for you like I get the truth you


---------128:27----------
have the strength to do it


---------128:28----------
but because it's gonna get into impostor


---------128:31----------
syndrome which is like a huge aspect of


---------128:33----------
my life yes so we're talking about


---------128:35----------
impostor syndrome oh yeah of course


---------128:37----------
okay yes you know the first thing that


---------128:40----------
you we messaged about I thought we were


---------128:41----------
gonna talk about impostor syndrome on


---------128:43----------
day one and now we've gone two days


---------128:45----------
without talking about it sure but I have


---------128:48----------
you know I have some thousand people


---------128:51----------
here right that I think could benefit


---------128:53----------
more from these conversations we're


---------128:56----------
having so far and setting this like


---------128:57----------
foundation of like how we can help


---------128:59----------
people over the average even though I


---------129:02----------
know you don't like averages that much


---------129:03----------
like and and through that I think we can


---------129:06----------
do greater good than talk about my


---------129:08----------
individual issues and I don't think most


---------129:09----------
people here have that issue of imposters


---------129:10----------
and they're probably but some people


---------129:12----------
probably you would be surprised you


---------129:14----------
think so and I think you have to be a


---------129:16----------
little bit careful because I wonder how


---------129:18----------
much your mind is hiding behind the


---------129:21----------
greater good as a reason to not confront


---------129:23----------
your imposter syndrome a lot yeah yeah


---------129:26----------
yeah but what I'm saying it's like I've


---------129:27----------
in an effort to not make it more of a I


---------129:31----------
always try to make shows less personal


---------129:36----------
if I think that they're going to be for


---------129:38----------
the greater good but if it's if I think


---------129:40----------
that my personal application can


---------129:42----------
actually you want to good then I will


---------129:44----------
talk about it it's good if you could get


---------129:46----------
well I think that you're smarter than me


---------129:47----------
so we'll talk about that I thought we


---------129:49----------
talked about like you why do you mm-hmm


---------129:52----------
we talked about IQ I'm not smarter than


---------129:54----------
you


---------129:55----------
more aware of this subject matter sure


---------129:59----------
I'll take more experienced any day of


---------130:01----------
the week sure because I think because I


---------130:03----------
think if we really delve deep what


---------130:07----------
people are most interested in is this


---------130:09----------
thing you said I think it is not letting


---------130:13----------
my negative experiences impact my


---------130:14----------
intention I feel like if there is one


---------130:18----------
problem that gamers have and you


---------130:21----------
identify this as well and this is what


---------130:23----------
if we're if we're gonna go in next week


---------130:24----------
and really delve deep into something it


---------130:26----------
can be the imposters everything if you


---------130:27----------
want I'm up for that but I think like


---------130:29----------
really trying to understand


---------130:33----------
how to bridge the chasm between God I


---------130:37----------
want this thing I want to do this so bad


---------130:40----------
I want to be successful I want to


---------130:43----------
actualize this in my life and then day


---------130:45----------
after day goes by and you can't do that


---------130:47----------
that's also a problem that's personal to


---------130:49----------
me by the way to this day every day I


---------130:50----------
have that problem I like one of the


---------130:53----------
things that yeah dear listen to me if


---------130:56----------
you're saying that you have this problem


---------130:57----------
in your personal life and you're saying


---------130:59----------
that what I want to show people on my


---------131:01----------
stream is how their negative experiences


---------131:05----------
don't interfere with their intentions so


---------131:07----------
that they can accomplish what they want


---------131:08----------
to you know saying you struggle with


---------131:10----------
that problem you're saying they struggle


---------131:12----------
with that problem


---------131:13----------
what is the way in which you struggle


---------131:14----------
with that problem well I think that's


---------131:17----------
what we're supposed to talk about next


---------131:18----------
right absolutely and you don't think


---------131:20----------
that's going to be helpful to them


---------131:23----------
okay so you're saying you view the


---------131:26----------
imposter system thing as a negative


---------131:27----------
experience of mine so that we get if we


---------131:31----------
understand that negative experience and


---------131:32----------
how it impacts my intention then we can


---------131:34----------
full circle maybe to apply to other


---------131:37----------
people as well yeah okay you see that's


---------131:40----------
his escape code says that yeah okay yeah


---------131:44----------
Devin is hiding behind his nobility it's


---------131:47----------
one of the most it's the one of the the


---------131:48----------
most difficult it's one of the easiest


---------131:51----------
places to hide he is behind a noble


---------131:54----------
cause yeah it's really good I'm super


---------131:57----------
good at doing this yep yeah I can tell I


---------131:59----------
probably do like ten more of these and


---------132:02----------
we would never even talk about it no no


---------132:04----------
it would be fine yeah but Devin I'm not


---------132:08----------
gonna let you my friend I mean I forget


---------132:11----------
about it next week and then yeah that's


---------132:16----------
usually how I get people yeah are you


---------132:20----------
feeling uncomfortable


---------132:22----------
um no I'm good obviously like like it I


---------132:27----------
I really when I when it comes to like I


---------132:28----------
really am an open book


---------132:29----------
I'm so good about anything yeah and well


---------132:32----------
I won't regret it


---------132:33----------
um I don't think that all the stuff that


---------132:38----------
people actually like make fun of me over


---------132:41----------
on the Internet is not the stuff that


---------132:44----------
actually gets to me because the number


---------132:45----------
one criticism of me is like lol you're


---------132:47----------
you're just to pretend you're not really


---------132:49----------
successful


---------132:49----------
I actually know I'm successful so that


---------132:51----------
doesn't do anything to me so like not


---------132:53----------
worried about that um yeah I like I'm


---------132:56----------
totally fine and going forward in this


---------132:57----------
conversation or yeah so I mean I think


---------132:59----------
we should do that next time do you have


---------133:00----------
other kind of thoughts or questions or


---------133:03----------
anything before we kind of I got to


---------133:05----------
probably get going soon okay um yes so


---------133:10----------
so I think one of the really important


---------133:13----------
things to establish base them just like


---------133:14----------
the subject matter of the talk that


---------133:16----------
we've had was


---------133:19----------
uh sort of what I like to have is like a


---------133:22----------
kind of like


---------133:26----------
objective take away so what we discussed


---------133:28----------
today had a lot to do with how relying


---------133:33----------
on these sort of external markers of


---------133:36----------
what mental health is or what comparison


---------133:41----------
right like like this person is so much


---------133:44----------
healthier than me or this person could


---------133:46----------
accomplish so much more than me or these


---------133:47----------
studies say I can do this or I can't do


---------133:49----------
this


---------133:50----------
that is really an unreliable barometer


---------133:53----------
and that a more reliable methodology is


---------133:57----------
looking to yourself for answers so for


---------133:59----------
everyone listening to this how can what


---------134:04----------
what is something we can do between this


---------134:05----------
week and next week where we can start to


---------134:08----------
look into ourselves for those answers


---------134:11----------
and stop at what what practice can we


---------134:14----------
utilize to stop paying attention to


---------134:17----------
those external barometers and start


---------134:20----------
focusing internally more what could we


---------134:22----------
do what's it what's it what's an


---------134:24----------
objective take away we could do


---------134:25----------
absolutely so let me just rephrase for a


---------134:28----------
second so I think that external stuff is


---------134:31----------
good for hypothesis generation right


---------134:34----------
it's not good on stuff is good okay so


---------134:36----------
like like I think it's important to like


---------134:38----------
learn about neuro neuroscience and then


---------134:40----------
use that is is like a guide for to for


---------134:45----------
you to explore your own experience


---------134:48----------
select to use like theories of cognitive


---------134:51----------
behavioral theory or neuroscience or


---------134:53----------
reading about spirituality but then test


---------134:56----------
it yourself because to the fact that it


---------134:58----------
worked for anyone else doesn't mean it's


---------135:00----------
it's gonna work for you so you have to


---------135:01----------
test it for yourself what so you're


---------135:04----------
saying what is that yeah right like what


---------135:07----------
is that will you say you have to test it


---------135:09----------
for yourself what I'm saying is I what


---------135:12----------
let's say that we just perfectly


---------135:13----------
accomplished today


---------135:16----------
and and the takeaway now that hopefully


---------135:18----------
a lot of people have is like man I


---------135:20----------
should really think more about my own


---------135:21----------
internal experience of things


---------135:25----------
what are they what's that you've just


---------135:27----------
given them a clay mold and now I'm


---------135:30----------
asking you to help them turn it into


---------135:33----------
something what over the next week can we


---------135:35----------
do two actually


---------135:38----------
cauterize this process okay so well I


---------135:40----------
don't know about external stuff because


---------135:44----------
I think that's even a little bit I feel


---------135:47----------
like that's step two so I think step one


---------135:50----------
is think about something that you want


---------135:53----------
to do


---------135:55----------
and then like right down


---------135:58----------
what's getting in the way of you doing


---------136:00----------
it


---------136:01----------
and more specifically what I'm looking


---------136:03----------
for yeah more specifically if you need a


---------136:05----------
little bit more guidance on that so I


---------136:07----------
think you should write down and then


---------136:09----------
there's a second part to the exercise


---------136:10----------
chances are your first answer will be


---------136:12----------
cognitive it'll be something like I


---------136:15----------
don't have enough time or someone does


---------136:16----------
this or some someone does that when you


---------136:19----------
actually think about doing it do you


---------136:22----------
feel any emotions or even physical


---------136:25----------
sensations that come up as you bring


---------136:27----------
yourself to do it so try to get as close


---------136:30----------
as you can to doing it and as you do it


---------136:34----------
or as you prepare to do it like what


---------136:36----------
comes up for you physically or


---------136:37----------
emotionally either one is fine so just


---------136:42----------
as an example like let's say that you


---------136:43----------
need to get a job so when you think


---------136:46----------
about getting a job like like I want you


---------136:48----------
to actually go and apply for something


---------136:50----------
anything and as you think about going


---------136:53----------
and applying for something what are the


---------136:55----------
kinds of like resistances that keep you


---------136:57----------
in place


---------137:02----------
does that make sense the last part I'm a


---------137:05----------
little bit lost


---------137:06----------
so like something is gonna get in the


---------137:07----------
way like if I say like okay I need a job


---------137:09----------
and then let's say that like I tell


---------137:11----------
myself that I needed a job but and if I


---------137:15----------
say like okay so like what is a job I


---------137:16----------
can apply for I can apply for a job at


---------137:19----------
McDonald's and I think about like I'm


---------137:21----------
not actually gonna apply for a job at


---------137:22----------
McDonald's like that's ridiculous like a


---------137:24----------
job at McDonald's is like like I'm


---------137:27----------
better than that and so as you think


---------137:30----------
about applying for a job at McDonald's


---------137:32----------
what do you actually feel comes up right


---------137:35----------
like why do you resist doing the thing


---------137:38----------
that you want to do


---------137:42----------
why do you


---------137:44----------
okay yeah this makes sense and that


---------137:47----------
resistance has to be in the form of a


---------137:49----------
physical or emotional response no so I'd


---------137:52----------
start by being open-ended so you can


---------137:54----------
write down while you're not doing it


---------137:56----------
yeah chances are though that's gonna be


---------137:58----------
a cognitive answer so I want people to


---------138:01----------
dig a little bit deeper so give that a


---------138:03----------
shot like open source you can try


---------138:04----------
whatever you write down whatever you


---------138:06----------
want to the second thing so after you do


---------138:10----------
that then tunnel down into like what are


---------138:11----------
the emotions that I'm feeling or what


---------138:13----------
are the physical sensations that I feel


---------138:15----------
yeah like oh I want to tell this girl


---------138:18----------
than I like her as you like pick up the


---------138:21----------
phone and you dial her number like what


---------138:23----------
happens inside your body like what do


---------138:25----------
you feel in your chest what do you feel


---------138:26----------
in your stomach and just write that down


---------138:28----------
and then we have to and then that said


---------138:31----------
all you all you need to do is be aware


---------138:33----------
of that for now for now hmm all right


---------138:37----------
okay yeah good yeah that's right okay


---------138:40----------
well Devin thanks a lot man this has


---------138:42----------
