---------00:00----------
so let's just kind of think a little bit


---------00:02----------
about so I'm gonna ask one or two out of


---------00:08----------
the other questions or read out a couple


---------00:09----------
of questions so is refocusing an


---------00:11----------
addiction onto your work a word of the


---------00:13----------
goal here what happens when your work no


---------00:15----------
longer fulfills him or he becomes


---------00:16----------
addicted to work


---------00:21----------
and then we'll get to psychology in FPS


---------00:24----------
and RTS too so the first thing is let's


---------00:27----------
just think a little bit about kind of


---------00:29----------
like addictive personalities so a lot of


---------00:30----------
people that I work with say that they


---------00:32----------
have an addictive personality and if you


---------00:35----------
think about it you know they'll say like


---------00:36----------
okay I used to be addicted to like video


---------00:38----------
games and now I'm addicted to like sex


---------00:40----------
or I mean that's not gonna happen


---------00:42----------
but you know they'll say that are


---------00:45----------
addicted to you know alcohol now they


---------00:47----------
sort of trade one addiction for another


---------00:50----------
and so like some people and so they kind


---------00:55----------
of say that


---------00:56----------
you know we have I'm I have an addictive


---------00:59----------
personality and so I think that like


---------01:01----------
some of the addictive personality has


---------01:04----------
truth to it there's some neuroscience


---------01:05----------
evidence evidence that there is


---------01:09----------
something like an addictive personality


---------01:10----------
but most of the time I think the reason


---------01:13----------
people trade one addiction for another


---------01:15----------
is because they're not dealing with the


---------01:18----------
underlying cause of addiction so there's


---------01:21----------
a great concept from Buddhist philosophy


---------01:23----------
called the realm of hungry ghosts and in


---------01:26----------
like would this like mythology or


---------01:28----------
cosmology or whatever you want to call


---------01:29----------
it they have heaven they have earth and


---------01:32----------
they have hell in between earth and hell


---------01:36----------
there's this thing called the realm of


---------01:38----------
hungry ghosts in the realm of hungry


---------01:40----------
ghosts is like full of these souls that


---------01:43----------
are always hungry and like never feel


---------01:45----------
full so no matter how much they like eat


---------01:48----------
they can eat and they can eat and they


---------01:50----------
can eat they just never feel satisfied


---------01:51----------
and when I think of an addiction I think


---------01:54----------
about the realm of hungry ghosts so


---------01:57----------
people who are addicted are usually like


---------01:59----------
looking for something right so I think


---------02:01----------
what Henri is looking for is like human


---------02:03----------
connection I think he's looking for


---------02:04----------
accomplishment I think he's looking for


---------02:06----------
like some sense of thrill like he wants


---------02:09----------
to be someone I can only imagine you


---------02:13----------
know I mean I had periods of my life


---------02:14----------
where I was in no one and what I wanted


---------02:17----------
more than anything else I tried to climb


---------02:19----------
to the top of the Warcraft three ladder


---------02:20----------
because like that felt like being


---------02:22----------
somewhere and so we have these these


---------02:25----------
basic parts of us that if we try to


---------02:27----------
fulfill them with one thing or another


---------02:29----------
thing it's like not gonna work the only


---------02:31----------
way to fill some holes is like with the


---------02:34----------
thing that that you know the hole fits


---------02:36----------
and so if what you need is like


---------02:39----------
authentic human connection so I I deal


---------02:41----------
with this a lot in terms of like sex


---------02:42----------
addiction so people who have you know


---------02:46----------
bad sex addictions what they're really


---------02:47----------
looking for is like connection with


---------02:50----------
another human being and they feel that


---------02:52----------
way and the way that other humans like


---------02:54----------
respond to them after they have sex is


---------02:57----------
like very warm and loving and they


---------02:59----------
cuddle and they cook on breakfast the


---------03:01----------
next morning and what they really want


---------03:03----------
does that day in and day out but the


---------03:05----------
only way that they know how to get that


---------03:07----------
is by like having sex


---------03:09----------
so sex-addiction its core if we look at


---------03:12----------
behavioral addictions there's like a


---------03:14----------
hungry ghost in there right there's like


---------03:16----------
some there's a part of them that feels


---------03:17----------
unfulfilled and wants to feel like loved


---------03:20----------
and valued is a person in the only way


---------03:23----------
that they know how to get that is


---------03:24----------
through sex and so they can change that


---------03:26----------
they can change the sex for something


---------03:29----------
else but until they feel like they're


---------03:32----------
like loved until they feel good about


---------03:35----------
themselves until they feel valued like


---------03:37----------
on it on a stable basis and chances are


---------03:40----------
that some evidence suggests that you


---------03:42----------
need to kind of feel that way for about


---------03:44----------
two years that 50 percent of this stuff


---------03:47----------
can just go away and be cured and that's


---------03:50----------
kind of a slightly different I'm drawing


---------03:52----------
on some science from kind of another


---------03:55----------
disease or not disease but a disorder


---------03:57----------
called borderline personality disorder I


---------03:59----------
don't know if you guys are familiar with


---------04:00----------
that or not but yeah two years so people


---------04:04----------
with borderline personality disorder who


---------04:07----------
also oftentimes have addictive behaviors


---------04:10----------
and also oftentimes have like high-risk


---------04:12----------
sexual behaviors their basic problem is


---------04:15----------
that their sense of self is like not


---------04:17----------
well-formed so what's on the inside is


---------04:21----------
like empty so what happens is like


---------04:23----------
nature abhors a vacuum and so they fill


---------04:26----------
themselves up with the way that other


---------04:28----------
people treat them and that causes them


---------04:30----------
to engage in a lot of like high-risk


---------04:33----------
behavior because the way they feel on


---------04:35----------
the inside depends on how other people


---------04:37----------
treat them yeah so I recently discovered


---------04:40----------
that like BPD is way more common maybe


---------04:42----------
we can just talk entirely about be


---------04:46----------
and so I think it's it's sort of like


---------04:49----------
this Hungry Ghost thing where in order


---------04:51----------
for someone to be cured of BPD which is


---------04:53----------
possible and people don't really realize


---------04:54----------
that if you can be in a stable


---------04:57----------
relationship where someone can put up


---------04:58----------
with your ops and downs like put up with


---------05:01----------
kind of your fear of abandonment for two


---------05:03----------
years and not abandon you 50% of people


---------05:05----------
get better and that they sort of get


---------05:08----------
cured is then they sort of start to


---------05:10----------
realize oh I actually like am kind of a


---------05:12----------
stable person I have value I've been


---------05:14----------
able to see this and it's been


---------05:15----------
reinforced enough times in a particular


---------05:18----------
way that sort of makes them feel like


---------05:19----------
calm cells


---------05:22----------
so kind of going back to the addictive


---------05:24----------
personality I think that you know you


---------05:26----------
can trade one addiction for another


---------05:31----------
uhh


---------05:32----------
so BPD and abusive behavior so we can


---------05:35----------
talk about BPD if you guys want to but


---------05:38----------
let me just finish up with addictive


---------05:39----------
personality then we can kind of dive


---------05:41----------
back into BPD so


---------05:44----------
I think that you can trade one addiction


---------05:46----------
for another and you can also throw


---------05:48----------
yourself into work tom am I supposed to


---------05:51----------
be doing something about that game just


---------05:52----------
chatting I don't know you can throw


---------05:55----------
yourself into your work but I think at


---------05:57----------
the end of the day


---------06:00----------
you know until you satisfy like whatever


---------06:03----------
is missing inside you like that thing is


---------06:05----------
always going to be there and you'll


---------06:07----------
always look for some other way to


---------06:08----------
satisfy it


---------06:10----------
and we're gamers I think a lot of


---------06:13----------
getting away from video games which is


---------06:15----------
kind of what I was trying to push Henry


---------06:16----------
on is that if we think about it like you


---------06:18----------
know when he quit Clash of Kings like he


---------06:20----------
felt alone he felt depressed he felt


---------06:22----------
like he didn't have friends anymore and


---------06:23----------
so you're not going to be able to quit


---------06:25----------
the game if your primary community is


---------06:27----------
the game


---------06:34----------
I see okay thanks so I do think you can


---------06:39----------
sort of throw yourself into your work


---------06:40----------
and that can be bad or I think it's less


---------06:43----------
bad because on the one hand you know


---------06:45----------
you're at least you're doing something


---------06:46----------
productive but I still think it's a


---------06:47----------
problem because at the end of the day


---------06:50----------
you're still not targeting like the real


---------06:52----------
thing so whether you're addicted to


---------06:53----------
games or work I guess it's better to be


---------06:56----------
addicted to games because at least


---------06:57----------
you're gonna be making money so the


---------06:59----------
spending money but at the end of the day


---------07:01----------
I think true piece comes from sort of


---------07:03----------
resolving the


---------07:08----------
the resolving sort of a core conflict
