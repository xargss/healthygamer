like so that's really interesting right


---------00:01----------
because for one person


---------00:03----------
a failure means i'm a bad person


---------00:06----------
but when you feel fail when you say it's


---------00:08----------
a lesson learned that actually makes you


---------00:10----------
a better person


---------00:12----------
and so if you want to talk about what's


---------00:14----------
op it's when failure pushes one person


---------00:18----------
down


---------00:18----------
and failure pumps you up like why the


---------00:20----------
like no that's

---------01:55----------
are today


---------01:57----------
all right i'll give the the shortest


---------01:59----------
spiel i can so


---------02:00----------
i'm one of eight my dad um has had uh


---------02:04----------
eight children with four different women


---------02:06----------
and so i've got one full sister and the


---------02:08----------
other ones are all half but we all


---------02:10----------
consider each other brothers and sisters


---------02:11----------
we've


---------02:12----------
got a really big family um i don't


---------02:14----------
really speak that much too much


---------02:16----------
but i'm very open about any questions


---------02:18----------
that people ask me so


---------02:20----------
big family and um i'm the seventh of the


---------02:23----------
eight


---------02:24----------
grew up in a place uh just in victoria


---------02:27----------
in australia


---------02:28----------
and uh a bit bit more of a country side


---------02:30----------
of things but


---------02:31----------
um you know just just a general kid like


---------02:33----------
skateboarding and all that kind of stuff


---------02:35----------
wanted to leave school to join the army


---------02:37----------
but i didn't because my mom wanted me to


---------02:38----------
finish school


---------02:39----------
so i finished school and then kind of


---------02:41----------
scored me out a little bit


---------02:43----------
school meaning high school okay year 12


---------02:46----------
completed my normal education okay i


---------02:48----------
tried university but i did not like it


---------02:50----------
three months i was out um and then


---------02:54----------
um i joined as a reservist in the


---------02:56----------
military for a uh for a period of time


---------02:58----------
uh where you do like you got to do your


---------03:00----------
basic training and then you just go back


---------03:01----------
to living your normal life and


---------03:03----------
you train once a week but i didn't enjoy


---------03:06----------
that too much and then i went


---------03:08----------
full time when i was 21 years old and


---------03:10----------
spent eight years in the military


---------03:12----------
in the infantry in the army and then


---------03:14----------
after eight years in the army i


---------03:15----------
left with no real direction and


---------03:18----------
i was going to take some time just to


---------03:20----------
reflect on life and do what i enjoy


---------03:22----------
which was fishing and computer games


---------03:24----------
and i started streaming to find friends


---------03:27----------
and


---------03:28----------
then after three or four months i


---------03:29----------
thought hey i could actually make


---------03:30----------
something of this


---------03:32----------
and three years later which is now but


---------03:34----------
just about hit the three-year mark


---------03:36----------
i would consider myself a pretty


---------03:37----------
successful content creator


---------03:39----------
wow that's awesome man


---------03:42----------
yeah quite the unorthodox story


---------03:47----------
right yeah i was a firefighter for a


---------03:48----------
little bit as well um


---------03:50----------
after the army as well yeah so can you


---------03:52----------
tell us a little bit about


---------03:54----------
um okay so kind of let's start from the


---------03:57----------
beginning what


---------03:58----------
what what was it you mentioned that


---------04:00----------
you're you had


---------04:01----------
seven siblings correct yeah


---------04:06----------
it's a little bit weird because all of


---------04:07----------
them are older except for one


---------04:09----------
um so like most of them were like adults


---------04:13----------
doing adult things like jobs and all


---------04:15----------
that stuff and i was still like a pretty


---------04:17----------
young


---------04:17----------
kid but um now that i'm a bit older it's


---------04:20----------
great like


---------04:21----------
i've got family everywhere it feels like


---------04:23----------
but yeah um


---------04:25----------
yeah um my parents separated


---------04:28----------
when i was three years old and um that


---------04:30----------
was a


---------04:32----------
i don't know i'm sure most people have


---------04:34----------
their parents split up it's never the


---------04:35----------
most easiest time


---------04:36----------
um you know separated parents but i


---------04:39----------
still got a really good relationship


---------04:40----------
with both my mum and dad


---------04:41----------
um i talk calm every week i'm living in


---------04:44----------
the netherlands at the moment


---------04:45----------
i probably should have chunked that one


---------04:46----------
in there um and so everyone's back in


---------04:48----------
australia i'm in the netherlands so


---------04:50----------
i call them every week and say hello and


---------04:52----------
yeah


---------04:53----------
how did you wind up how did you end up


---------04:55----------
in the netherlands


---------04:57----------
so in 2012 i was climbing a mountain in


---------05:00----------
australia which


---------05:00----------
they're kind of like big hills for the


---------05:02----------
rest of the world um and


---------05:04----------
i was sitting up on top of a hill or


---------05:07----------
mount with my mate and i said you know


---------05:08----------
what i'd love to do this more


---------05:10----------
and so i started building this plan


---------05:12----------
where i heard the story of a guy who


---------05:13----------
climbed the highest peak of every


---------05:14----------
country of europe


---------05:16----------
he didn't he went to do it in six months


---------05:17----------
the war broke out in kosovo and it took


---------05:19----------
him two and a half years instead


---------05:21----------
and so i said i want to do the same


---------05:23----------
thing i want to try and do it in six


---------05:24----------
months and then i started planning


---------05:26----------
around my long service leave in the army


---------05:28----------
so in australia


---------05:29----------
after you work for 10 years you get six


---------05:31----------
months off at half pay or three months


---------05:32----------
at full


---------05:33----------
and i um i was planning this trip and


---------05:36----------
then when i left the army i said i'm


---------05:37----------
still doing the trip i don't care i'm


---------05:38----------
going to europe


---------05:39----------
and then so this year because of how the


---------05:42----------
twitch stream turned out


---------05:43----------
i caught instead of doing all the


---------05:44----------
climbing mountains i was still going to


---------05:45----------
climb some but i was going to more just


---------05:47----------
see the world


---------05:48----------
and then kovid broke out and i spent


---------05:50----------
nearly the entire time


---------05:52----------
in the netherlands instead i see


---------05:54----------
interesting


---------05:58----------
can i think for a second go for it


---------06:04----------
so past you sound different and what do


---------06:07----------
i mean


---------06:09----------
so what i'm really curious about is


---------06:12----------
sometimes you know people wake up and


---------06:14----------
they say i want to do something


---------06:18----------
and then that's as far as they get


---------06:21----------
right they're like oh man it would be


---------06:23----------
cool to climb mountains in europe


---------06:26----------
and yet i'm already hearing something


---------06:28----------
very different about you because


---------06:30----------
when you think about something you


---------06:31----------
actually like


---------06:33----------
kind of go out and do it yeah


---------06:37----------
um yeah my wife kind of helds me back


---------06:39----------
sometimes with that


---------06:41----------
i have these crazy ideas right so all


---------06:43----------
like when i started streaming i was like


---------06:46----------
what if i like okay so most people won't


---------06:48----------
know but in escape from tarkov there was


---------06:50----------
used to be like at level 40 everything


---------06:52----------
would start like that would be the end


---------06:53----------
of the game


---------06:54----------
i was like what if i did that in one


---------06:56----------
sitting and my wife would sit there and


---------06:58----------
be like how are you going to do that


---------06:59----------
like i'll just not sleep i'll just keep


---------07:01----------
playing


---------07:02----------
you know and so then i when it happened


---------07:04----------
i streamed for like literally


---------07:05----------
40 hours straight and i did it you know


---------07:08----------
like most people would be like nah


---------07:09----------
that's just stupid why would you do that


---------07:10----------
but i'm like no i'll try it


---------07:12----------
like i don't like referring myself as


---------07:16----------
to like someone like david goggins but


---------07:17----------
like his kind of mentality where it's


---------07:20----------
if anyone doesn't know david goggins


---------07:21----------
he's just kind of the kind of person


---------07:23----------
that just


---------07:23----------
i can run a hundred miles i don't know


---------07:25----------
if i can physically but if i can't my


---------07:27----------
body's gonna be the one that stops me


---------07:28----------
not my mind you know like he'll push it


---------07:30----------
to the right to the end


---------07:32----------
um and for me it's kind of very similar


---------07:34----------
like i said i say i want to do something


---------07:35----------
i actually


---------07:36----------
try my best to do it and the only thing


---------07:38----------
that's going to stop me is if my body


---------07:40----------
won't let me kind of thing


---------07:41----------
i try and let my mind yeah so so how


---------07:44----------
long have you been that way


---------07:48----------
i don't know um i've always been the


---------07:50----------
kind of person where


---------07:53----------
if there was a fire people would run


---------07:54----------
from it i'd be the one to run to it


---------07:57----------
so um an example would be like


---------08:01----------
uh people watch that 10 hour iar stream


---------08:05----------
and people be like that's insane that


---------08:06----------
sounds so horrible i'm like i want


---------08:08----------
like my feeling is i wonder what it


---------08:10----------
feels like to listen to iar for 10 hours


---------08:12----------
straight


---------08:13----------
so then i go and do it i i don't know


---------08:15----------
how long it's been like that but


---------08:16----------
for a long time i've always kind of been


---------08:18----------
i guess it's curious


---------08:20----------
of what the world has to offer i i don't


---------08:23----------
know any other better ways of exploring


---------08:25----------
explaining it sorry yeah so it's


---------08:27----------
interesting so i literally just wrote


---------08:28----------
the word curiosity


---------08:30----------
and and what i'm kind of thinking about


---------08:32----------
past is that that you know so let's say


---------08:34----------
that like


---------08:36----------
you're not you right and i think this is


---------08:39----------
a


---------08:40----------
common issue which is that most of the


---------08:42----------
people on twitch are not you


---------08:44----------
and and what i'm kind of curious about


---------08:46----------
is what can we learn from you is it just


---------08:47----------
that you're wired differently do you


---------08:49----------
just i mean


---------08:50----------
did you just born you were born with the


---------08:53----------
slightly insane curiosity hard-working


---------08:57----------
trait and and therefore there's


---------09:00----------
something about your brain


---------09:02----------
or your just you were born different


---------09:04----------
which is why you


---------09:05----------
like you are where you are now and so


---------09:07----------
people who weren't born with that


---------09:10----------
will never be where you are i don't


---------09:13----------
think that's the case


---------09:14----------
i think after my after finishing school


---------09:18----------
i used to always look at my friends and


---------09:21----------
they would always want to do


---------09:23----------
what i found was just mediocre or boring


---------09:25----------
no one wanted


---------09:27----------
to explore or have fun like my version


---------09:30----------
of fun which is like let's


---------09:32----------
go and see what is over there or let's


---------09:34----------
go and do that and so


---------09:37----------
there is definitely a comfort zone that


---------09:39----------
people live in


---------09:40----------
and i always had to push myself to go


---------09:44----------
into those


---------09:45----------
discomfort areas um when i signed up to


---------09:48----------
join the military i had full intention


---------09:50----------
to join special forces


---------09:51----------
um and my mate joined the army with me


---------09:55----------
my best mate at the time and in the


---------09:59----------
lead up training to join in the army


---------10:00----------
which there was no requirement to do any


---------10:02----------
of this [ __ ] we did um


---------10:04----------
we would just find stuff to do that


---------10:06----------
would push ourselves mentally and


---------10:07----------
physically because we knew


---------10:09----------
if we were to get into the special


---------10:10----------
forces they're going to make us do the


---------10:12----------
most


---------10:12----------
craziest [ __ ] you could think of so like


---------10:15----------
we lived


---------10:15----------
near the surf beaches down in victoria


---------10:17----------
are in australia and we'd be like


---------10:18----------
alright it's a pretty choppy day let's


---------10:20----------
go swim out to the boy and back


---------10:22----------
and i wasn't even a good swimmer but i


---------10:24----------
was like i'm doing it like because


---------10:25----------
that's what we did


---------10:26----------
um and one of my mates was really good


---------10:28----------
with that i think it's more of like an


---------10:29----------
alpha male


---------10:30----------
beta male kind of thing sometimes um i


---------10:32----------
never really saw myself as an alpha male


---------10:35----------
i was always a little bit of a follower


---------10:37----------
um before the army


---------10:38----------
but i kind of took my strive once i hit


---------10:41----------
the military side and i had to take


---------10:43----------
charge because i just saw how


---------10:44----------
i don't use the word lazy but some


---------10:46----------
people are really lazy they find that


---------10:49----------
lazy people can actually be really good


---------10:50----------
because they can find the easiest way to


---------10:52----------
get [ __ ] done quick because they just


---------10:53----------
want to get it done


---------10:54----------
they don't have to spend any time the


---------10:55----------
more time they have to um or they just


---------10:57----------
don't do it at all


---------10:59----------
correct which is the most annoying time


---------11:01----------
but um


---------11:04----------
but yeah like a lot of people like to


---------11:07----------
find the easy way i try and find the


---------11:08----------
right way


---------11:12----------
yeah so how long have you been like that


---------11:14----------
where does that come from


---------11:16----------
i don't know i i don't know right so pes


---------11:20----------
i i think the challenge here and if it's


---------11:22----------
okay with you maybe we'll explore that a


---------11:24----------
little bit because i think


---------11:25----------
i'm still hearing i can i can imagine


---------11:30----------
you know who i was when i was 21 22 23


---------11:33----------
24


---------11:34----------
and listening to this conversation and


---------11:38----------
just


---------11:38----------
feeling like i wish i was like you


---------11:41----------
i'm not like you that you're lucky


---------11:45----------
that i have when everyone else runs away


---------11:47----------
from the fire i want to be the guy that


---------11:49----------
runs towards it


---------11:51----------
but unfortunately i'm like everyone else


---------11:54----------
when i think about joining the special


---------11:56----------
forces it's something that i want to do


---------11:59----------
but because i know they're going to put


---------12:00----------
me through the hardest things


---------12:02----------
possible instead of swimming out to the


---------12:05----------
buoy and back


---------12:06----------
i'm just not going to get into the water


---------12:08----------
at all


---------12:10----------
that's the guy that i am


---------12:13----------
and i look at you and i say that you're


---------12:15----------
not like me


---------12:19----------
and then what i would say is that here


---------12:20----------
is a guy who is disciplined


---------12:22----------
and i am a guy who is lazy and i would


---------12:26----------
define you in one way and i would define


---------12:28----------
myself


---------12:28----------
in a completely different way and i


---------12:30----------
would say if i was in your bucket then i


---------12:33----------
would be successful


---------12:35----------
but i'm in my bucket therefore i'm


---------12:37----------
screwed


---------12:39----------
i'll tell you a story so when i signed


---------12:42----------
up to be a reservist in the army i was


---------12:44----------
19 years old


---------12:46----------
i spent a bit of time away from home but


---------12:48----------
i was never really extremely out of my


---------12:49----------
comfort zone when i went out


---------12:51----------
out from home like you know what i mean


---------12:52----------
like when i went away it was always like


---------12:54----------
a little bit discomfort


---------12:55----------
when i did my my basic training uh it


---------12:57----------
went for about 47 days


---------12:59----------
and um i hated it i absolutely hated it


---------13:03----------
and to the point where i contacted my


---------13:06----------
my parents and said i want to go home


---------13:10----------
and i used to work for my stepfather


---------13:13----------
and i said can you write me a letter to


---------13:16----------
say that i'll need it back at work


---------13:17----------
because literally that's all you would


---------13:19----------
require to go home


---------13:20----------
like if you you know the military had to


---------13:22----------
oblige by people's contracts of business


---------13:24----------
and that


---------13:25----------
so he wrote me a letter and i got the


---------13:27----------
letter and


---------13:29----------
i walked down this the hallway and


---------13:33----------
knocked on the door of the corporals and


---------13:34----------
and i said i need to speak to you know


---------13:36----------
my corporal and he he got me in the room


---------13:38----------
and he goes what's this letter and i'm


---------13:40----------
like oh you know i need to go back home


---------13:42----------
for work


---------13:43----------
and um he said i'm just going to talk to


---------13:45----------
you like a new normal human being here


---------13:47----------
because they they would have that like


---------13:48----------
you know persona that they're always


---------13:49----------
like


---------13:50----------
big people goes i know this is full [ __ ]


---------13:53----------
i know you don't want to be here


---------13:55----------
but if you quit this right now every


---------13:57----------
time something gets difficult in life


---------13:59----------
you are going to quit and you're not


---------14:01----------
gonna you're not gonna finish it


---------14:03----------
this is the easy way out there's only


---------14:06----------
three weeks left


---------14:07----------
and even if you hate the three weeks at


---------14:08----------
least at the end of it you can hold your


---------14:10----------
head up high and say


---------14:12----------
you done it it was [ __ ] but you did it


---------14:14----------
and then when


---------14:15----------
anything gets hard in life you can


---------14:16----------
always push through and finish it


---------14:17----------
because of that


---------14:18----------
now i remember that guy's name exactly


---------14:20----------
and i remember what he looks like and he


---------14:21----------
probably


---------14:22----------
doesn't even remember who i am but he is


---------14:24----------
probably one of the most influential


---------14:25----------
people in my life


---------14:26----------
because from that point there i always


---------14:30----------
kept that mentality i finished that


---------14:31----------
training and i said this


---------14:33----------
is this is something that i need to make


---------14:36----------
sure i do because of that reason


---------14:38----------
now he might have just been talking [ __ ]


---------14:39----------
he might have been like


---------14:41----------
you know he got told to tell that thing


---------14:42----------
but it actually did have a big influence


---------14:43----------
on me


---------14:45----------
that one in particular um what was that


---------14:48----------
sorry do you remember when he said that


---------14:50----------
do you remember how you felt


---------14:55----------
probably felt a little bit embarrassed


---------14:56----------
at the time because i got called out you


---------14:59----------
know


---------14:59----------
like he called my bluff


---------15:02----------
but at the same time


---------15:06----------
i felt like there was a bit more respect


---------15:07----------
there because he knew i was going to try


---------15:09----------
and push through


---------15:09----------
so i think that worked and i think later


---------15:12----------
on in particular


---------15:13----------
um because you go through like you're


---------15:15----------
doing field training and all that stuff


---------15:18----------
there was that little bit of like almost


---------15:20----------
like mutual respect there because he


---------15:21----------
knew i was pushing through my discomfort


---------15:25----------
so


---------15:28----------
yeah it's interesting right


---------15:31----------
yep that definitely is


---------15:34----------
so i know this is going to sound kind of


---------15:37----------
weird


---------15:38----------
past i think it's a fantastic story


---------15:40----------
perfect time to tell it


---------15:41----------
because i think it says so much but what


---------15:43----------
do you think are the important points of


---------15:45----------
that story


---------15:46----------
what are the takeaways


---------15:53----------
oh for me at the time at least and and


---------15:55----------
to now it's like


---------15:57----------
um i guess in a metaphor you could


---------16:01----------
probably say


---------16:01----------
anytime life gets tough it doesn't mean


---------16:03----------
it's you can't get through it it's you


---------16:05----------
need to push


---------16:06----------
you can push through discomfort isn't


---------16:09----------
always


---------16:09----------
you know it doesn't mean it's not life


---------16:11----------
isn't meant to be easy there's going to


---------16:13----------
be times that are tough and


---------16:14----------
getting through it you know is


---------16:16----------
achievable if you


---------16:17----------
really want it yeah so you know oddly


---------16:20----------
enough i'm going to kind of disagree


---------16:22----------
with you there


---------16:24----------
because and follow me for a second okay


---------16:25----------
it's not that i disagree that you're


---------16:27----------
actually wrong but i'm going to take a


---------16:29----------
slightly different approach


---------16:31----------
disagree is not the right word so what


---------16:33----------
you're saying is that you have it within


---------16:35----------
you to push through


---------16:36----------
and then what i think about is all the


---------16:38----------
people who decided to submit the letter


---------16:41----------
and walk away and then when we hear


---------16:44----------
pests say


---------16:44----------
you have it within you to not quit


---------16:48----------
a funny thing happens which is that you


---------16:51----------
actually


---------16:52----------
that story i think is just as likely to


---------16:55----------
create


---------16:56----------
shame as it is to create inspiration


---------16:59----------
because then what everyone does is they


---------17:01----------
look at you and they say pest is the guy


---------17:03----------
who decided to push through


---------17:04----------
and i'm the guy who decided to not push


---------17:07----------
through


---------17:09----------
and you know just like you said your


---------17:10----------
corporal gave you a choice and he's like


---------17:12----------
if you quit now


---------17:13----------
you're gonna be a quitter


---------17:16----------
and i think that a lot of people end up


---------17:19----------
quitting and now they think about


---------17:21----------
themselves as quitters and when you say


---------17:23----------
if you really put your mind in to it you


---------17:26----------
have the capacity to push through


---------17:28----------
which sounds inspirational but it's also


---------17:30----------
kind of damning because that means that


---------17:31----------
like


---------17:32----------
if you didn't push through you always


---------17:34----------
could have and it's your [ __ ] fault


---------17:35----------
which i think is don't get me wrong but


---------17:38----------
i think there's one really other


---------17:39----------
important piece of the to the story


---------17:41----------
which is that


---------17:42----------
in that moment that corporal had faith


---------17:44----------
in


---------17:46----------
and what happened is someone you were a


---------17:48----------
quitter when you walked into that office


---------17:51----------
it wasn't actually like entirely you


---------17:54----------
that decided to not quit


---------17:55----------
right your quitter you got the letter


---------17:58----------
and everything


---------17:58----------
called home figured out how to do it had


---------18:01----------
the letter in your hand you were like 99


---------18:03----------
percent


---------18:03----------
quitter and then the corporal looks at


---------18:07----------
you and he has he has faith


---------18:09----------
he looks at you and he says no [ __ ]


---------18:13----------
and he says that i think you're not the


---------18:15----------
person because he could have just


---------18:17----------
accepted the letter right he could have


---------18:19----------
been like all right


---------18:22----------
fine you have the letter adios but he


---------18:24----------
looked at you and he said


---------18:26----------
you know what i don't think even though


---------18:28----------
you've come 99


---------18:30----------
you're a 99 quitter i'm not willing to


---------18:33----------
accept


---------18:34----------
that you're 100 of a quitter yet


---------18:37----------
i think that within you there's someone


---------18:38----------
who's not a quitter


---------18:41----------
and when you say you know he was one of


---------18:43----------
the most important people in your life i


---------18:44----------
think that's


---------18:45----------
why right because like in that moment


---------18:48----------
you had become a quitter or you were


---------18:51----------
just really really close


---------18:52----------
you'd set everything up to quit and then


---------18:54----------
here's one guy who says you know i just


---------18:56----------
don't think that


---------18:57----------
that's who you have to be i think you've


---------19:01----------
got a different option


---------19:03----------
what do you think about that i think


---------19:06----------
it's fair


---------19:07----------
i've never really thought of it in that


---------19:08----------
in that respect so


---------19:11----------
and again and i guess it could it could


---------19:12----------
be damaging to people to feel like


---------19:14----------
because


---------19:15----------
if i had gone home then i probably would


---------19:17----------
have reflected it as


---------19:18----------
i'm now a quitter for the rest of my


---------19:20----------
life and or i don't know if i would have


---------19:21----------
but it could have


---------19:23----------
so it could be just as damaging as it is


---------19:25----------
trying to push someone through that


---------19:27----------
it's it's hard also for me though


---------19:29----------
because


---------19:31----------
a lot of the stuff you hear in the


---------19:32----------
military post that like after i went


---------19:34----------
full time in that there's a lot of talk


---------19:35----------
like that


---------19:36----------
like you know like uh


---------19:39----------
you know like pain is weakness leaving


---------19:42----------
the body


---------19:43----------
like all those kind of sayings where


---------19:45----------
it's like


---------19:46----------
um you know they'll just try they'll


---------19:48----------
literally say anything to get you


---------19:49----------
through something


---------19:50----------
like they will literally say anything to


---------19:52----------
get you through something yep so


---------19:54----------
yeah i think that's kind of an


---------19:56----------
interesting idea too because like i


---------19:58----------
think the point is that


---------19:59----------
you know they'll say anything to get you


---------20:01----------
through but i think at the end of the


---------20:02----------
day


---------20:03----------
you're the person who gets through it


---------20:06----------
right i mean they can say pain is


---------20:08----------
weakness leaving the body but like i


---------20:09----------
mean they can say whatever they want to


---------20:11----------
and it may help you psychologically for


---------20:12----------
a time but at the end of the day


---------20:14----------
you're the one that did it they can't do


---------20:16----------
it for you they can say whatever the


---------20:17----------
[ __ ] they want to trick you


---------20:20----------
or push you but you're the one who has


---------20:22----------
to do it and you're the one who


---------20:23----------
did do it which is awesome


---------20:27----------
can you tell us a little bit more about


---------20:29----------
um


---------20:30----------
you know what what it was like being in


---------20:32----------
the military


---------20:35----------
um there was


---------20:38----------
i always i'll summarize it as there's a


---------20:40----------
lot of boring times a lot of time where


---------20:42----------
you're literally sitting around and


---------20:44----------
there is


---------20:44----------
nothing going on i want to like be 100


---------20:47----------
straight here i didn't spend any time in


---------20:48----------
the middle east i haven't seen any


---------20:50----------
combat


---------20:50----------
i spent most of my time in southeast


---------20:52----------
asia i speak indonesian


---------20:54----------
as a linguist um and


---------20:57----------
i spent most of my time in in training


---------20:59----------
and exercises in australia so


---------21:00----------
for me it was mostly very boring sitting


---------21:04----------
around


---------21:04----------
tedious times and or


---------21:07----------
very physically demanding painful times


---------21:10----------
on my body


---------21:11----------
um where either i was in charge of


---------21:13----------
people that i had to push them through


---------21:15----------
situations that were quite difficult um


---------21:18----------
i was


---------21:19----------
mostly in a leadership role for most of


---------21:21----------
my time in the military


---------21:22----------
where i was like either you know in


---------21:24----------
charge of soldiers or training people


---------21:25----------
and


---------21:27----------
um it was it was probably


---------21:31----------
i didn't like a lot of it but i did it


---------21:33----------
because i know a lot of people


---------21:35----------
were very proud of me doing it um


---------21:38----------
you know like my mum or dad when i ever


---------21:40----------
called him up and i was like you know


---------21:42----------
like i'm


---------21:42----------
you know thinking about ending in a year


---------21:44----------
or so they'll be like oh but stable job


---------21:46----------
it pays really well you get to see the


---------21:48----------
world and i'm like yeah it does but


---------21:50----------
you don't get to see you know fear of


---------21:53----------
not having a weekend


---------21:54----------
just because it's you know your time to


---------21:56----------
do guard duty that they decide


---------21:58----------
to give it to you on a friday or


---------21:59----------
something like that there's a lot of


---------22:01----------
really really stressful times in the


---------22:03----------
military and i think that's why


---------22:05----------
a lot of people come out of the military


---------22:09----------
like exhausted looking 100 years older


---------22:12----------
and then


---------22:13----------
also missing the friendships and the


---------22:15----------
camaraderie of it because


---------22:17----------
they always had their mates there


---------22:18----------
whereas when you leave it's a lot harder


---------22:21----------
so it's a very very difficult place


---------22:24----------
it's not for everyone what was it like


---------22:26----------
to leave


---------22:29----------
it was like i'd had a constant pressure


---------22:31----------
on my shoulders for a long time


---------22:33----------
and it was finally off what was that


---------22:36----------
pressure


---------22:38----------
well i would argue i i wait for a


---------22:40----------
majority of the time in the career but


---------22:42----------
like in all seriousness it was i always


---------22:44----------
felt like someone was


---------22:45----------
ready to just tell me off for something


---------22:47----------
or to send me away somewhere or


---------22:50----------
just control full control over my life i


---------22:54----------
quit the army


---------22:55----------
and um my girlfriend at the time is now


---------22:56----------
my wife um


---------22:58----------
she she knew i was literally just


---------23:00----------
quitting and i had no job lined up i was


---------23:03----------
going


---------23:03----------
to just put myself back into the society


---------23:07----------
and just forget about a lot of the


---------23:09----------
experiences that i've been through


---------23:11----------
um that are just really been hard


---------23:15----------
on me so fast let me ask you a question


---------23:18----------
you know it's so interesting because you


---------23:19----------
use the word quit i just quit the army


---------23:22----------
the interesting thing is that i can i


---------23:24----------
can almost envision


---------23:26----------
quitting is not like i think what would


---------23:28----------
have been quitting like spiritually


---------23:29----------
quitting


---------23:30----------
would have been to stay does that make


---------23:33----------
sense yeah


---------23:35----------
that sometimes quitting is like that's


---------23:38----------
the hard thing


---------23:39----------
like because at some point you know


---------23:41----------
sticking in the staying


---------23:43----------
in the life that you've become


---------23:44----------
comfortable in


---------23:46----------
a stable job good pay kind of


---------23:49----------
respectable


---------23:50----------
you know like all that kind of stuff


---------23:52----------
like walking away from that


---------23:55----------
is actually the hard thing and and i'm


---------23:58----------
also hearing kind of a common thread


---------24:00----------
here which is that like


---------24:01----------
you know in your corporal's office you


---------24:05----------
also


---------24:05----------
by staying you actually walked away from


---------24:07----------
something


---------24:09----------
you walked away from a life of comfort


---------24:12----------
right you could have peaced out could


---------24:14----------
have taken the easier road


---------24:15----------
and you walked away from the easy road


---------24:17----------
and oddly enough what i'm hearing about


---------24:19----------
even though you used the word quit is


---------24:20----------
that you actually walked away from


---------24:23----------
stability security something you had


---------24:25----------
known


---------24:26----------
without anything in place that actually


---------24:29----------
sounds like it takes


---------24:30----------
it sounds hard not easy yeah most people


---------24:34----------
thought i'd go back


---------24:35----------
and like a large amount of people


---------24:36----------
thought i'd be back in the military


---------24:39----------
and why did they think that


---------24:42----------
i'm very passionate about anything i do


---------24:44----------
so i took a lot of pride


---------24:46----------
in the work that i did in the military


---------24:48----------
um


---------24:49----------
i had lined up a position where i would


---------24:51----------
actually be a chinese translator as well


---------24:53----------
where i'd learn chinese and


---------24:55----------
i was i was trying to line up a few


---------24:57----------
things that would probably get me


---------24:58----------
into like say embassy positions later on


---------25:00----------
in my career


---------25:01----------
like i wasn't going to just be sitting


---------25:03----------
down the bottom runs like forever i


---------25:05----------
actually was pretty ambitious


---------25:06----------
um so everyone had always seen how hard


---------25:10----------
working and passionate i was about the


---------25:12----------
job


---------25:12----------
but as soon as i quit and as soon as i


---------25:15----------
resigned


---------25:16----------
and i went into a new path and i could


---------25:17----------
put my passion into something else well


---------25:20----------
i think the evidence is clear how when i


---------25:22----------
really am passionate about something how


---------25:23----------
far i can take it so


---------25:26----------
i think the military if anything was


---------25:28----------
actually holding me back


---------25:29----------
on my potential more than anything and


---------25:32----------
how did you come to decide to leave


---------25:36----------
um i had an


---------25:39----------
argument with the ceo


---------25:42----------
which was pretty much the deciding


---------25:44----------
factor um i


---------25:46----------
was meant to be studying chinese in


---------25:47----------
melbourne um


---------25:49----------
that year and due to controls from like


---------25:55----------
career management they stuffed up and i


---------25:57----------
was got pushed back one year


---------25:59----------
and so then i had to resubmit the form


---------26:00----------
the following year then i did it as soon


---------26:02----------
as i started the year and then


---------26:03----------
the ceo didn't approve it and i said why


---------26:07----------
didn't you approve it and he says you


---------26:08----------
were in an infantry hat badge or an


---------26:09----------
infantry


---------26:10----------
soldier for life and i'm like i'm not


---------26:12----------
going to be treated like that anymore


---------26:13----------
i'd i'd been putting up with that kind


---------26:15----------
of


---------26:16----------
bs for a long time and i was like i


---------26:19----------
i'm going to do anything else and then


---------26:20----------
as soon as i resigned and put my


---------26:22----------
discharge paperwork in


---------26:23----------
two months later i had a posting order


---------26:25----------
saying that i'm going to melbourne to do


---------26:26----------
chinese studies and i said nope i've


---------26:29----------
made my decision i'm going


---------26:31----------
so


---------26:37----------
can i process that for a second yep


---------26:47----------
pass i i when you tell these stories i


---------26:50----------
think about moments from my own life


---------26:55----------
and it's interesting i think you know


---------26:57----------
some people talk about


---------26:59----------
success as taking advantage of good


---------27:01----------
opportunities


---------27:04----------
my experience has been that success is


---------27:06----------
walking away from good opportunities


---------27:09----------
you know when when they give you


---------27:10----------
everything that you want to


---------27:13----------
being able to say you know what no thank


---------27:16----------
you


---------27:17----------
i'm gonna do it my own way um


---------27:21----------
it's interesting i have a story very


---------27:23----------
much like your corporal story too


---------27:26----------
um but wow that's that's impressive man


---------27:29----------
so can


---------27:30----------
what would you when you when they gave


---------27:31----------
you that paperwork or gave you the


---------27:33----------
option to go study chinese in melbourne


---------27:37----------
do you remember how you felt


---------27:41----------
um i expected it i i i expected it


---------27:46----------
they they they called me into the


---------27:48----------
battalion hq and they were they said


---------27:50----------
uh we've got your posting order here and


---------27:51----------
we've got your discharge paper


---------27:53----------
do you want to throw your discharge


---------27:55----------
paper out now that we've got your


---------27:56----------
posting order and


---------27:57----------
i said no but it wasn't the big bosses


---------27:59----------
that were telling me that that was the


---------28:00----------
clerks


---------28:01----------
but i walked straight out and i was just


---------28:03----------
like that's so typical like i knew that


---------28:05----------
was gonna happen


---------28:06----------
because what's typical about that uh


---------28:09----------
so the military will what they do is


---------28:11----------
they


---------28:13----------
it's a numbers game it's all about they


---------28:15----------
need to kick all their quotas all their


---------28:17----------
boxes for promotions and and their


---------28:19----------
their career progressions so for the ceo


---------28:22----------
it's for him it's about


---------28:24----------
the first thing he needs to do is get so


---------28:26----------
many people through all their


---------28:28----------
you know all the officers need to get


---------28:29----------
all their quotas done for the year et


---------28:31----------
cetera et cetera and it goes


---------28:32----------
it trickles down right and then the


---------28:35----------
worst thing they can have is


---------28:36----------
low retention rate so first thing they


---------28:38----------
want to do is they want to kick all


---------28:39----------
their boxes so they need as many


---------28:40----------
soldiers to do that


---------28:42----------
but then the worst thing after that is


---------28:43----------
to you know lose their corporals because


---------28:45----------
it's hard to get good corporals i i


---------28:48----------
consider myself a good corporal when i


---------28:49----------
was one or so


---------28:50----------
um and so then me


---------28:54----------
leaving the military after eight years


---------28:55----------
and uh due for promotion and stuff


---------28:58----------
it's just you know it's just so easy for


---------29:00----------
them to go oh we'll just you know now


---------29:02----------
that


---------29:03----------
you know he's called our bluff we'll


---------29:04----------
just do that


---------29:06----------
so i i didn't fully expect it but i said


---------29:09----------
there's a i thought there was a pretty


---------29:10----------
high chance


---------29:11----------
that it was actually going to happen and


---------29:13----------
and why didn't you take the posting


---------29:16----------
um i'm kind of the person that when they


---------29:19----------
make their decision to do something and


---------29:21----------
start a new thing i'm going to go for


---------29:23----------
the new thing a new exciting route of


---------29:25----------
fishing and computer games


---------29:29----------
can you help me understand what decision


---------29:31----------
you made when


---------29:33----------
your ceo denied your application


---------29:37----------
um i called up my girlfriend and said


---------29:41----------
um the ceo didn't approve it and


---------29:45----------
in the past when they've done that they


---------29:48----------
um


---------29:49----------
generally don't uh they don't


---------29:52----------
they don't post you once the ceo says no


---------29:55----------
so i said to her


---------29:56----------
i said i'm not going to stay in the


---------29:57----------
infantry any longer my shoulders are


---------30:00----------
cooked


---------30:00----------
like legitimately my shoulders are just


---------30:01----------
destroyed and i'm not going to break my


---------30:04----------
back


---------30:04----------
for you know in the infantry if i do for


---------30:06----------
a core transfer that could take


---------30:09----------
a year and that's if it even happens i'm


---------30:11----------
not gonna i don't i didn't want to stick


---------30:13----------
around with that anymore i wanted to


---------30:14----------
move into intelligence something using


---------30:15----------
my head instead of my body


---------30:17----------
and so i said that i'll try something


---------30:20----------
new


---------30:20----------
and we just started a plan which at the


---------30:22----------
moment at that point she didn't even


---------30:24----------
have a job


---------30:25----------
um or she was working part-time and i


---------30:27----------
was like all right well i'm gonna


---------30:28----------
quit so we need to like start applying


---------30:30----------
for jobs together


---------30:32----------
and uh she got a really good job and uh


---------30:35----------
yeah we just went with it


---------30:38----------
sounds like you were like you said the


---------30:40----------
weight on your back it sounds like


---------30:42----------
control like it sounds like you


---------30:44----------
were tired of not having control over


---------30:46----------
where your life went


---------30:48----------
correct yeah 100 and so what was it like


---------30:51----------
after you left


---------30:54----------
it was it was a little bit


---------30:59----------
i i would always want to work like i'm


---------31:02----------
i'm not the kind of person that can just


---------31:04----------
lay on the couch for a couple of days


---------31:06----------
like maybe one or two days but the third


---------31:08----------
day i'm like i need to do something so


---------31:10----------
i was like trying to find little odd


---------31:13----------
jobs to do to help people out if anyone


---------31:15----------
needed a hand with anything i went


---------31:16----------
um back to victoria just for a week to


---------31:19----------
build a retaining wall for my mum


---------31:21----------
like i just whatever i could do i would


---------31:23----------
just do but in the in the


---------31:24----------
other times i'd either be playing


---------31:26----------
computer games to you know find friends


---------31:27----------
or


---------31:28----------
i went fishing tell me about fishing


---------31:33----------
um it's really good i don't i


---------31:37----------
for me it's i'm not very good fisherman


---------31:39----------
i want to be really clear right now i'm


---------31:41----------
not a good fisherman at all i just like


---------31:42----------
the idea that


---------31:43----------
i'm out in the water on a boat i can


---------31:46----------
just relax


---------31:47----------
it's like freedom like there's nothing


---------31:50----------
around


---------31:51----------
and i can who knows what's going to come


---------31:53----------
up i could get


---------31:55----------
you know like some massive tuna or i


---------31:58----------
could get like a little kind of


---------32:00----------
shitty you know bait fish kind of thing


---------32:01----------
it doesn't really matter to me it's just


---------32:03----------
about


---------32:03----------
the adventure and fun of being out there


---------32:11----------
you know pasta once again noticing i'm


---------32:13----------
hearing you say a lot of things that


---------32:14----------
make me think that


---------32:15----------
we're fundamentally different people so


---------32:18----------
when you say


---------32:19----------
you know after two or three days of


---------32:20----------
laying around on the couch i need to get


---------32:22----------
up and do something


---------32:24----------
whereas in my experience two or three


---------32:27----------
days is just getting started


---------32:31----------
forced relaxation is hard for me like


---------32:33----------
it's my mind is always ticking


---------32:36----------
yeah i have a kind of random question


---------32:38----------
have you ever


---------32:39----------
wondered whether you have like 80d


---------32:43----------
um no not really


---------32:48----------
yeah interesting um so it sounds like


---------32:51----------
you kind of get restless and bored


---------32:52----------
easily


---------32:54----------
yeah i'd say that okay


---------32:59----------
i feel like i have a lot of ideas in my


---------33:01----------
head and i


---------33:02----------
i i've gotten better at writing them


---------33:04----------
down uh i used to want to start a stream


---------33:06----------
i used to have a notebook and pen right


---------33:07----------
next to me


---------33:08----------
and i used to write everything


---------33:09----------
physically down but now i use a a


---------33:10----------
program instead


---------33:12----------
um but


---------33:15----------
i'm the kind of person like i i just


---------33:18----------
like my most creative


---------33:19----------
periods are like when i'm laying in bed


---------33:22----------
in the shower


---------33:23----------
just doing those really mundane me like


---------33:26----------
i'm i've got a an exercise bike behind


---------33:29----------
me like when i'm on on the bike


---------33:31----------
like when i'm just zoned out that's when


---------33:34----------
my head's just gone crazy with all these


---------33:36----------
random ideas


---------33:38----------
and then when i'm in work mode it's just


---------33:39----------
like go go go


---------33:41----------
so yeah i'm


---------33:44----------
trying to figure out how to pull


---------33:48----------
certain i think there are a couple of


---------33:49----------
important principles here


---------33:51----------
about you know idleness of the mind


---------33:54----------
spending time in nature um


---------33:58----------
how to go go so like here's just one


---------34:02----------
tidbit for example so i think a lot of


---------34:04----------
people once again what i'm envisioning


---------34:06----------
uh pest is that as people hear this


---------34:08----------
conversation they


---------34:09----------
i find themselves thinking more and more


---------34:12----------
i find myself thinking if i were them


---------34:14----------
thinking that oh this guy's like i'm


---------34:15----------
just different from him


---------34:17----------
i'm not someone that can go go my


---------34:19----------
problem is that i can't go go go


---------34:21----------
my problem is that i go and then the


---------34:23----------
other three goes don't happen


---------34:25----------
i stop it's not go go it's a go stop


---------34:27----------
stop


---------34:29----------
and and so i'm and the more that you


---------34:32----------
kind of speak about the way that your


---------34:34----------
mind functions


---------34:34----------
i'm thinking that like your solutions


---------34:37----------
are not going to work for them because


---------34:38----------
you're just a different kind of person


---------34:40----------
you know they can get behind some things


---------34:42----------
like they're bored easily too


---------34:44----------
they also get curious i think they also


---------34:46----------
have a lot of thoughts in their head


---------34:48----------
but all it ever stays is thoughts in the


---------34:50----------
head


---------34:51----------
so how do you get from being


---------34:53----------
disorganized and having a bunch of


---------34:55----------
thoughts


---------34:56----------
to going going going do you have a sense


---------34:58----------
of that


---------35:03----------
i i i know exactly everything you're


---------35:05----------
saying


---------35:06----------
is the question how do i make these


---------35:09----------
thoughts go into action


---------35:10----------
yes


---------35:15----------
i i bounce a lot of ideas off my my wife


---------35:18----------
but


---------35:18----------
in before her i would always just


---------35:24----------
i would just think about the process of


---------35:26----------
how that would actually happen


---------35:27----------
so for example climbing mountains across


---------35:30----------
europe


---------35:31----------
i would think of all right what are they


---------35:33----------
what are the ways i could


---------35:35----------
hire a buy a car i could sleep in the


---------35:37----------
car i could backpack


---------35:38----------
i could and i would just go think about


---------35:41----------
all those options and then i would just


---------35:43----------
slowly just broaden my ideas on


---------35:46----------
other people's experiences or what


---------35:48----------
things that could actually work there's


---------35:49----------
a guy who


---------35:51----------
he traveled from somewhere in europe i


---------35:54----------
can't remember exactly


---------35:55----------
around the world and it cost him like


---------35:56----------
two thousand dollars and he just


---------35:58----------
backpacked and you know hitchhiked and


---------36:01----------
worked on people's boats to get from


---------36:03----------
country to country he just did whatever


---------36:05----------
he had to do


---------36:07----------
like almost like a nomad kind of person


---------36:08----------
like


---------36:10----------
there is a wealth of information out


---------36:12----------
there if you're willing to just go to


---------36:13----------
the effort of researching it and then


---------36:16----------
i don't know i just try and figure out


---------36:18----------
ways to make it happen


---------36:19----------
and i suppose taking the first step is


---------36:21----------
probably the hardest point and then once


---------36:22----------
you take the first step then you kind of


---------36:25----------
if you go into it by the mindset of you


---------36:26----------
when you start something you're going to


---------36:27----------
finish it


---------36:28----------
well now you've got no choice you've got


---------36:29----------
to keep going so i don't think the first


---------36:31----------
step is the hardest step


---------36:33----------
i mean so sorry i i agree that taking


---------36:35----------
the first step is the hardest step i


---------36:37----------
think the problem is that


---------36:39----------
taking the first step is not one step


---------36:41----------
it's a thousand steps


---------36:44----------
there's a thousand steps between step


---------36:47----------
zero


---------36:47----------
and step one and if we listen to you


---------36:50----------
that's what we hear


---------36:52----------
right you have an idea and then you


---------36:54----------
think about the how


---------36:55----------
you externalize the idea you discuss the


---------36:58----------
idea you call it broadening your


---------37:00----------
experience


---------37:01----------
can i draw you a diagram


---------37:04----------
yep and apologies i'm curious i'm going


---------37:07----------
to try to hypothesize something


---------37:09----------
and i'm curious whether you think that


---------37:11----------
this is accurate or not


---------37:13----------
because the basic issue is you


---------37:15----------
beautifully put it is how does an


---------37:16----------
idea become an action and i think pestly


---------37:19----------
when we look at you


---------37:21----------
what we see is a guy for whom idea and


---------37:24----------
action are very close together


---------37:27----------
and when i look at most of the the


---------37:28----------
people that like are my people or people


---------37:30----------
like me


---------37:32----------
what i see is that there's a big gap


---------37:33----------
between idea and action


---------37:35----------
so the issue is how does an idea become


---------37:37----------
an action


---------37:38----------
how does an idea become a reality


---------37:41----------
and i want to i want to toss something


---------37:43----------
out and see if you would agree


---------37:45----------
okay i am i could use heaps of the


---------37:49----------
examples where most people would look at


---------37:51----------
me and go


---------37:52----------
that's crazy like i already decided i


---------37:56----------
was going to raise a million dollars for


---------37:57----------
starlight before my channel took off


---------38:00----------
like a starlight also it's a children's


---------38:03----------
charity in australia


---------38:04----------
so um last year in december i


---------38:08----------
sat down my wife and i said i want to do


---------38:09----------
something good with this channel i want


---------38:10----------
to give back


---------38:12----------
and i said next year let's raise a


---------38:13----------
million dollars for starlight children's


---------38:14----------
foundation australia


---------38:16----------
and then the end of the year i had a


---------38:18----------
massive um


---------38:21----------
i've had a drops event on on on my game


---------38:23----------
and and my channel blew up


---------38:25----------
even more than it already was and so


---------38:27----------
then i spent this whole year


---------38:28----------
just devising different ways on how we


---------38:30----------
could raise money and we hit


---------38:32----------
a million dollars in seven months


---------38:33----------
instead of taking the whole year


---------38:35----------
like i don't know like stuff like that


---------38:37----------
where i just think of it and i go how


---------38:38----------
would i


---------38:39----------
could i do this is it feasible like is


---------38:42----------
it possible


---------38:43----------
and once i know it's possible then i


---------38:45----------
just go all right what are the steps we


---------38:46----------
need to take and i go for it


---------38:48----------
like right so so i think i think there's


---------38:50----------
a subtle so


---------38:52----------
so this is the problem pest is that a


---------38:53----------
lot of people think about the steps that


---------38:56----------
they take


---------38:57----------
and then you go for it and we don't


---------39:01----------
it's too much too many steps


---------39:05----------
so i think you're cognitively doing


---------39:07----------
something very interesting


---------39:08----------
okay so let's say you have an idea and


---------39:10----------
you apology you can see this right


---------39:12----------
yep okay so generally speaking here's


---------39:15----------
what happens when we have an idea


---------39:17----------
we get bored of it just like you do okay


---------39:20----------
we're not disagreeing that you don't get


---------39:22----------
bored


---------39:22----------
we'd get bored you get bored this idea


---------39:26----------
turns into other ideas so idea number


---------39:29----------
two


---------39:31----------
idea number three idea number four


---------39:34----------
right and then we think about this for a


---------39:35----------
little while and this is idea number ten


---------39:39----------
idea number six idea number 12.


---------39:44----------
and then tomorrow comes and nothing


---------39:45----------
happens you with me


---------39:49----------
does that make sense yeah it does okay


---------39:52----------
so let's think about so that's us here's


---------39:54----------
you


---------39:56----------
so you get bored of idea as well i know


---------39:59----------
it sounds weird


---------40:00----------
and then what happens is you actually


---------40:01----------
have a second idea


---------40:03----------
but


---------40:07----------
but your idea is how


---------40:10----------
does idea number one work


---------40:13----------
and then what you do is you talk to


---------40:15----------
people


---------40:16----------
about idea number one and then you


---------40:20----------
also


---------40:23----------
externalize idea number one


---------40:29----------
i i don't know if this makes sense but


---------40:30----------
do you see how talking to people


---------40:32----------
about traveling is not the same as


---------40:35----------
thinking about traveling


---------40:36----------
when you get it makes it real it makes


---------40:39----------
it actually an


---------40:40----------
action actually thing instead of just a


---------40:42----------
thing inside the mind


---------40:44----------
it's now in i want to use the word


---------40:46----------
universe but it's actually


---------40:48----------
people have now been involved in it as


---------40:50----------
well


---------40:51----------
sure so i think that also is especially


---------40:53----------
true for for this one over here which is


---------40:55----------
about externalizing


---------40:56----------
but what i what i want you to notice is


---------40:58----------
that like if you think about the


---------41:00----------
cognitive action or the cognitive


---------41:03----------
interest about thinking about something


---------41:06----------
and talking to someone about it


---------41:08----------
those are like fundamentally things you


---------41:10----------
can get bored of thinking about


---------41:11----------
something


---------41:12----------
and you can go to talk to someone about


---------41:14----------
it and it'll be interesting if you talk


---------41:15----------
to them


---------41:17----------
does that make sense correct yep


---------41:20----------
the interesting thing is at the end of


---------41:21----------
all of these


---------41:25----------
you come back to idea number one


---------41:29----------
does that make sense yeah so whereas


---------41:32----------
this person ends up with like you know


---------41:35----------
spending


---------41:36----------
a little bit of their time on ideas two


---------41:38----------
three four five six seven eight nine ten


---------41:39----------
eleven twelve


---------41:41----------
you still have a different cognitive


---------41:44----------
action here


---------41:47----------
you don't get bored if you're thinking


---------41:49----------
about if you're doing research on the


---------41:50----------
internet


---------41:51----------
and then you talk to someone and then


---------41:53----------
you jot things down on a piece of paper


---------41:56----------
cognitively it's not the same as just


---------41:58----------
thinking about it


---------41:59----------
so it's cognitively i think fresh enough


---------42:01----------
to where you get curious about it


---------42:04----------
you get curious here and then you


---------42:06----------
maintain your curiosity by actually


---------42:09----------
changing up


---------42:10----------
the cognitive action in the second step


---------42:13----------
and the cool thing is that


---------42:14----------
each of these actually goes and


---------42:16----------
reinforces the same idea


---------42:19----------
and so now for your second iteration


---------42:21----------
idea number one


---------42:22----------
is like twice as strong and then you do


---------42:25----------
you


---------42:25----------
externalize some more you like take


---------42:27----------
notes about it


---------42:30----------
and then you talk to person number two


---------42:33----------
about idea number one


---------42:35----------
and then you do some more research


---------42:39----------
and so what happens is that at the end


---------42:41----------
of the day


---------42:43----------
you're still reinforcing the same idea


---------42:46----------
whereas this person


---------42:47----------
keeps branching off idea number 86


---------42:51----------
idea number 100 and there's no way to


---------42:54----------
reinforce


---------42:56----------
on your original idea does that make


---------42:57----------
sense yep it does


---------43:00----------
and so i think that when we think about


---------43:02----------
you know if you get bored of things


---------43:04----------
easily you're doing something very very


---------43:06----------
cool


---------43:07----------
which is that you're i would call this


---------43:09----------
process in sanskrit this is something


---------43:11----------
called sangha


---------43:13----------
sangha actually means community and what


---------43:16----------
people discover when it comes to


---------43:18----------
meditation


---------43:19----------
is if you try to meditate by yourself


---------43:23----------
it'll fizzle out in like three days


---------43:26----------
that's how much energy you have


---------43:28----------
and then it's over the interesting thing


---------43:32----------
is that if you meditate


---------43:35----------
and then you're part of a community then


---------43:37----------
you talk to someone


---------43:39----------
about meditation you're like oh like how


---------43:40----------
do you meditate this is the way that i


---------43:42----------
meditate


---------43:43----------
you join a group and you guys all


---------43:46----------
meditate together


---------43:48----------
and then you read about meditation or


---------43:51----------
you go to a lecture


---------43:54----------
what this does is at the end of the day


---------43:56----------
this


---------43:57----------
reinforces meditation


---------44:01----------
even though you're going to get bored of


---------44:03----------
this activity


---------44:04----------
a conversation can be okay you're going


---------44:06----------
to hang out with other people and you're


---------44:07----------
going to read about it


---------44:08----------
and it reinforces the same activity and


---------44:11----------
so essentially what sangha lets you do


---------44:13----------
is maintain what we would call focus


---------44:17----------
but the interesting thing is if you get


---------44:18----------
distracted easily how do you focus


---------44:22----------
and i want you guys to really pay


---------44:23----------
attention to what pastel is doing


---------44:25----------
because pest gets bored easily of things


---------44:28----------
too


---------44:29----------
the only difference is that when he gets


---------44:31----------
bored easily


---------44:32----------
he does things that naturally get him


---------44:35----------
excited about stuff


---------44:38----------
okay and now i'm going to give you guys


---------44:41----------
one last example


---------44:42----------
so let's say you play what what games do


---------44:45----------
you play


---------44:46----------
uh escape from targov is the main one


---------44:48----------
it's a first person shooter


---------44:50----------
so let's say you're playing escape from


---------44:52----------
tarkov you get bored of eft


---------44:54----------
right but then what happens if you


---------44:57----------
watch a stream


---------45:01----------
you read a strategy so one of the one of


---------45:04----------
the questions i always get is how do i


---------45:06----------
not get bored of tarkov


---------45:08----------
i get it all the time but the thing is


---------45:11----------
i don't get bored because i always just


---------45:13----------
do different stuff


---------45:15----------
absolutely so you took took it right


---------45:18----------
took


---------45:19----------
got the punch line right yeah yeah


---------45:22----------
it's not everyone thinks it's just this


---------45:24----------
but i want you guys to pay attention to


---------45:25----------
what pesta is doing


---------45:27----------
because pest isn't just doing eft he's


---------45:30----------
doing eft


---------45:31----------
and then like side activity one


---------45:36----------
right let's do a 40 hour stream that's


---------45:39----------
actually a different idea


---------45:41----------
and then let's do let's write a guide


---------45:43----------
about it


---------45:46----------
no you're 100 right because i do guides


---------45:48----------
and then i do like


---------45:49----------
i don't know i'll do a challenge on


---------45:51----------
myself or i'll play the game with only


---------45:53----------
using one gun


---------45:54----------
or whatever like i just do random stuff


---------45:56----------
all the time


---------45:57----------
right i never get bored of talk of no


---------46:01----------
but see here's the thing right so when


---------46:02----------
they look at you and they say how do you


---------46:03----------
not get bored of tarkov


---------46:05----------
you do get bored of tarkov and then you


---------46:07----------
do different things


---------46:09----------
that maintain your focus in one


---------46:11----------
direction


---------46:13----------
so i think past the reason that you're


---------46:14----------
successful


---------46:16----------
is because your mind maintains focus in


---------46:19----------
a single direction


---------46:20----------
the reason you're successful is because


---------46:22----------
instead of building


---------46:26----------
10 wells that are one foot deep


---------46:29----------
you actually build one well that is 100


---------46:32----------
feet deep


---------46:34----------
but the tricky thing cognitively is like


---------46:36----------
how do you do that if you get bored


---------46:38----------
easily


---------46:39----------
you just i i don't know the well analogy


---------46:43----------
kind of falls apart but it's like sort


---------46:44----------
of like you use different tools to dig


---------46:46----------
the same well


---------46:47----------
it's like today i'm going to use a spade


---------46:49----------
and now i'm going to use a shovel


---------46:50----------
and now i'm going to use it because it's


---------46:51----------
so it's actually different activities


---------46:53----------
but all of those activities are aligned


---------46:56----------
in the same direction


---------46:59----------
so what do you think about that does


---------47:02----------
that make


---------47:03----------
would you agree disagree yeah no i


---------47:05----------
totally agree


---------47:06----------
okay so once again this is what i


---------47:08----------
discovered about my life so i'm going to


---------47:09----------
give you guys just an example


---------47:12----------
so first i was a monk or not not really


---------47:15----------
a monk


---------47:16----------
but i wanted to become a monk right so i


---------47:17----------
studied yoga and i was like oh like i


---------47:20----------
want to understand


---------47:21----------
okay here's here was my here's here's


---------47:22----------
how i started out


---------47:24----------
so i was like this is


---------47:28----------
and let me know if i'm boring you okay


---------47:31----------
fast no i'm good okay so this is where i


---------47:35----------
started


---------47:36----------
i suck at life because that's what it


---------47:38----------
was i sucked at life


---------47:40----------
like life is hard i'm a bad player life


---------47:42----------
i was like okay how does that work


---------47:45----------
okay gotta do something so i went to the


---------47:47----------
ashram


---------47:50----------
and i was like oh interesting this


---------47:53----------
is how people


---------47:57----------
work okay that's what i discovered


---------48:02----------
and then it was sort of like but i still


---------48:05----------
went back to okay


---------48:07----------
oh this is


---------48:10----------
how i suck at life


---------48:13----------
following me i sort of figured out like


---------48:16----------
how i suck at life i was like oh


---------48:18----------
interesting


---------48:19----------
so it's actually the same thing


---------48:22----------
but now i have a how and then i was like


---------48:23----------
okay well let's figure out how the


---------48:24----------
neuroscience of this works


---------48:26----------
so i started doing like eeg research


---------48:31----------
what's aug electro encephalogram


---------48:34----------
measuring brainwave patterns


---------48:36----------
okay on meditation


---------48:40----------
right and i was like okay so like that's


---------48:43----------
the how


---------48:44----------
and then went to med school


---------48:48----------
okay and then i was like okay like


---------48:50----------
instead of saving lives


---------48:52----------
i decided to like become a psychiatrist


---------48:56----------
because you know i wanted to know how i


---------48:58----------
suck at life


---------49:00----------
and now so now it's like okay this


---------49:04----------
is how other


---------49:08----------
people suck


---------49:11----------
at life sometimes it's illness that's


---------49:16----------
what my psychiatric training taught me


---------49:18----------
sometimes it's lack of direction


---------49:23----------
sometimes it's lack of dharma so this is


---------49:26----------
what india taught me


---------49:27----------
but at the end of the day do you do you


---------49:29----------
see how it's like it's all the same


---------49:31----------
thread


---------49:32----------
it's all the same thing it's like how


---------49:34----------
does life work


---------49:36----------
but i get distracted really easily


---------49:39----------
right that's how you keep your focus


---------49:41----------
absolutely


---------49:43----------
i keep my because i don't actually keep


---------49:45----------
my focus


---------49:47----------
it's bizarre i how does


---------49:50----------
life work okay so this is where i sort


---------49:52----------
of end up


---------49:54----------
and this question was born because i


---------49:56----------
sucked i was like how does this


---------49:57----------
how this stuff work i don't understand i


---------49:59----------
don't understand how


---------50:00----------
what's the deal with life and now like


---------50:02----------
even today so now what do i do because i


---------50:04----------
get bored easily


---------50:06----------
so i stream on twitch i do clinical


---------50:10----------
medicine


---------50:12----------
this is my favorite part now i get to do


---------50:13----------
the teaser


---------50:20----------
and then oh hold on no no there we go


---------50:23----------
so this is what i do in my free time


---------50:26----------
right so like this is my understanding


---------50:28----------
of depression


---------50:30----------
ignore this stuff over here but then i


---------50:32----------
sit down and i map out like okay how


---------50:33----------
does depression work there's clinical i


---------50:35----------
don't know i guess you guys can't see


---------50:36----------
that


---------50:37----------
but anyway so this is what i do so like


---------50:40----------
this is what i do in my free time


---------50:41----------
i write about depression i think about


---------50:43----------
depression i dictate about depression


---------50:45----------
and then i work with people and i stream


---------50:50----------
and we do all these different things


---------50:51----------
because i get bored easily


---------50:54----------
so it's like if i see patients for 30


---------50:56----------
hours a week i get bored


---------50:58----------
if i stream for like 10 hours a week i


---------50:59----------
get bored


---------51:02----------
and i'm hearing you do the same thing


---------51:05----------
and so i think the big takeaway for


---------51:06----------
people and i know i'm supposed to be


---------51:08----------
asking you questions but i think


---------51:09----------
past you're too good of an example of


---------51:11----------
this principle


---------51:13----------
that you're not i mean i do think you're


---------51:15----------
different in some ways don't get me


---------51:16----------
wrong


---------51:17----------
which i think is awesome but i think


---------51:19----------
that people can still learn that


---------51:21----------
what i want you guys to see is that like


---------51:23----------
sure pest


---------51:24----------
when he rises when a challenge faces him


---------51:27----------
he doesn't back down which is awesome


---------51:29----------
don't get me wrong and we'll talk a


---------51:32----------
little bit about that but one thing that


---------51:33----------
i want you guys to notice


---------51:34----------
is that i think there's a reason why


---------51:36----------
pest knocks it out of the park


---------51:38----------
in multiple parts of his life


---------51:42----------
right because that's what we're hearing


---------51:43----------
you're a dude who climbs mountains it


---------51:44----------
sounds like you


---------51:45----------
kind of were climbing in the military


---------51:47----------
and you could have continued to climb


---------51:48----------
you've become a successful


---------51:50----------
twitch streamer and what i really think


---------51:54----------
it is and i don't know how else to


---------51:55----------
explain this but it is what you do with


---------51:57----------
your mind


---------51:58----------
because i don't know if you guys get


---------51:59----------
this but most of success or failure in


---------52:01----------
life has nothing to do with your


---------52:02----------
physical body


---------52:03----------
most of it has to do with your mind


---------52:06----------
right call it studying call it your job


---------52:08----------
call it relationships


---------52:11----------
i know some people think that they're


---------52:12----------
physically unattractive and sure that


---------52:14----------
can get in the way


---------52:15----------
but it's like what you do with your mind


---------52:17----------
that's the most important


---------52:20----------
and what i hear is that pest has


---------52:21----------
discovered


---------52:23----------
a way to align his mind


---------52:26----------
towards a common goal despite deviating


---------52:29----------
this way in that


---------52:32----------
and what he does i don't know how to put


---------52:34----------
say this but he like


---------52:36----------
soaks his mind in


---------52:39----------
exposures that move him in the direction


---------52:42----------
towards a common goal


---------52:45----------
he goes and he talks to this guy and


---------52:47----------
then he reads about this thing


---------52:49----------
he immerses himself which we


---------52:52----------
think means that he he's like his mind


---------52:54----------
is super focused but it's not


---------52:56----------
it's just when his mind wanders he lets


---------52:58----------
it wander


---------53:00----------
but he lets it wander in a general


---------53:02----------
direction


---------53:04----------
and i think an example would be yeah um


---------53:07----------
like when i started my twitch stream


---------53:09----------
and i started like to figure out how the


---------53:11----------
twitch universe worked and how to become


---------53:13----------
successful


---------53:14----------
i was like oh you know um twitch doesn't


---------53:17----------
have the greatest discoverability so


---------53:19----------
what i need to do is i need to start a


---------53:21----------
youtube channel oh how do i start a


---------53:22----------
youtube channel and then i was like oh


---------53:24----------
i'll


---------53:24----------
you know start creating videos and so i


---------53:27----------
literally just


---------53:28----------
threw myself at adobe for like three


---------53:29----------
days straight and in three days i pretty


---------53:31----------
much taught


---------53:32----------
myself how to make youtube videos so i


---------53:33----------
started making youtube videos and i just


---------53:35----------
kind of like just


---------53:36----------
i and what i like to do a lot of is i i


---------53:39----------
try something


---------53:40----------
test it and if it fails i don't stress


---------53:42----------
too much about it because it's either a


---------53:43----------
lesson learnt


---------53:44----------
or maybe i just implemented it wrong or


---------53:47----------
in a poor way and i could just


---------53:49----------
use it in a different way at a different


---------53:50----------
time or maybe it was it was too big of


---------53:52----------
an idea


---------53:53----------
too early in the career or something


---------53:55----------
like that like i


---------53:57----------
i try and treat everything like a bit of


---------53:58----------
a lesson learnt or how maybe


---------54:00----------
i'm not afraid to fail as well that's i


---------54:03----------
look like an idiot half the time on


---------54:05----------
stream anyway with some of the stuff i


---------54:06----------
do like i dressed up as a therapist from


---------54:08----------
the game


---------54:09----------
you know like and i just i don't care if


---------54:11----------
people like it's been on seven news in


---------54:13----------
australia


---------54:14----------
like that stream and it's just like i


---------54:17----------
just have fun with it i just try and


---------54:18----------
enjoy it


---------54:19----------
so why don't you mind failure how long


---------54:22----------
have you


---------54:23----------
not cared about failure um


---------54:28----------
as long as i'm confident that i did the


---------54:29----------
best i can do


---------54:31----------
within realistic like measures then i


---------54:35----------
it doesn't affect me as much as i


---------54:38----------
probably


---------54:38----------
i might affect most people i don't know


---------54:41----------
why it's the case but


---------54:43----------
how long have you been that way


---------54:48----------
um i'd say a fair while


---------54:54----------
i were you that at least before okay


---------54:57----------
before you joined the military


---------55:01----------
it probably was in the lead-up to the


---------55:02----------
military i


---------55:05----------
i remember a period before the military


---------55:07----------
where


---------55:09----------
i was very self-conscious a lot of


---------55:10----------
things i did and i was like


---------55:13----------
i wanted to become a better person i


---------55:14----------
remember for a fact i wanted to become a


---------55:16----------
better person because i was just like


---------55:18----------
you know people would do cool stuff and


---------55:20----------
i was like why can't i do it


---------55:21----------
i was very like self-conscious of that


---------55:23----------
stuff


---------55:24----------
um i kind of remember what i used to


---------55:27----------
listen to in that


---------55:28----------
but it was just like i used to watch


---------55:30----------
like


---------55:31----------
um i think it might have been just


---------55:33----------
before youtube because there was other


---------55:35----------
websites but


---------55:36----------
it used to be like videos that you could


---------55:38----------
watch you know as people just talking


---------55:39----------
about how to become the best person they


---------55:40----------
can be and


---------55:41----------
and part of it was that there's like the


---------55:43----------
physical you know


---------55:44----------
physically fit part of your body and


---------55:46----------
also the mental so you strengthen your


---------55:48----------
mind and your body so i used to work out


---------55:49----------
a lot


---------55:50----------
i used to like bodybuild not for a


---------55:52----------
competitive side


---------55:53----------
but more of just like i just wanted to


---------55:54----------
be the fittest strongest person i could


---------55:56----------
be


---------55:56----------
and i used to be really strong and fit


---------55:58----------
like i still got a lot of muscle mass


---------55:59----------
but


---------56:00----------
like i still look after myself but then


---------56:03----------
it was the same with the mental side and


---------56:04----------
the mental part was the hardest part to


---------56:06----------
train


---------56:07----------
than the body the body was easy you just


---------56:08----------
go to gym five days a week you got two


---------56:10----------
rest days it's all good


---------56:11----------
whereas you've got a measurable well


---------56:14----------
you've got a measurable weight it's like


---------56:16----------
you go to the gym


---------56:17----------
and you can do it where the mind is it's


---------56:19----------
it you can get lost in the mind really


---------56:21----------
like um and it's a lot easier just to be


---------56:25----------
like oh i won't worry about that today


---------56:26----------
or


---------56:27----------
i don't know i found that's how i found


---------56:29----------
it


---------56:31----------
there was definitely a period between


---------56:33----------
like 18 and 21 when i went full time in


---------56:35----------
the military before when i went


---------56:36----------
full time in the military i was very


---------56:40----------
i felt like i was older than the


---------56:41----------
majority of people around me


---------56:44----------
because i felt like i'd developed my


---------56:45----------
mind more


---------56:47----------
as in in a maturity level than a lot of


---------56:50----------
the other people


---------56:51----------
um about a year before i joined i lost


---------56:55----------
my life license i know it was about


---------56:56----------
a little bit less than a year a little


---------56:58----------
bit less than a year before i joined


---------57:00----------
i lost my license to drink driving and


---------57:02----------
um


---------57:04----------
it wasn't like i wasn't like heaps over


---------57:06----------
i think i was 0.08 so in america i think


---------57:08----------
that's legal


---------57:09----------
um but i had a little bit of shame


---------57:11----------
behind it but after that i


---------57:12----------
didn't drink for a long time like three


---------57:14----------
years i didn't really drink


---------57:16----------
and i saw all my mates getting really


---------57:17----------
drunk in that and i'm like i'm gonna go


---------57:19----------
to the gym and i'm gonna skateboard and


---------57:21----------
you know do all the things that i enjoy


---------57:24----------
and a lot of people are pushing


---------57:25----------
like they were all always about the


---------57:27----------
partying side and i was more about let's


---------57:28----------
go explore and have fun and adventure


---------57:30----------
kind of side so i don't know


---------57:34----------
that's a bit of a tangent sorry no no i


---------57:36----------
appreciate it i


---------57:37----------
i'm i'm glad you're sharing this because


---------57:39----------
i think it once again tells us that


---------57:43----------
just go to the gym five days a week has


---------57:45----------
been damn near an impossibility for me


---------57:47----------
my entire life


---------57:49----------
um is is i'll put a question to you


---------57:53----------
if is is it because it's not a priority


---------57:56----------
like okay let me put it in this


---------57:58----------
perspective like if


---------58:01----------
like you don't a lot of people say they


---------58:03----------
don't have time to do something


---------58:05----------
right but if you got home and you're


---------58:07----------
like i don't have time to go to the gym


---------58:08----------
but


---------58:08----------
what if like you got home and your


---------58:11----------
dishwasher or


---------58:12----------
your toilet was leaking all over the


---------58:13----------
floor well now you have time to call a


---------58:15----------
plumber


---------58:16----------
to fix the toilet right yeah whereas


---------58:19----------
beforehand you had no time to go to the


---------58:21----------
gym well it's i don't


---------58:23----------
see it not having enough time ever as an


---------58:25----------
excuse


---------58:26----------
i see it as it's not a priority i agree


---------58:28----------
completely


---------58:29----------
i didn't say i don't have enough time to


---------58:30----------
go to the gym i said i'll just use


---------58:32----------
an example of yeah a lot of people use


---------58:35----------
that i don't have time thing and i'm


---------58:37----------
like


---------58:37----------
but it's just not a priority yeah so in


---------58:40----------
my experience


---------58:42----------
i'm someone who would much rather


---------58:45----------
have gone to the gym than go to the gym


---------58:50----------
yep and you know i


---------58:54----------
sort of take care of myself i could take


---------58:56----------
care of myself better


---------58:57----------
but i agree with you that in my case


---------58:59----------
it's an issue of priority


---------59:03----------
but i i think you know it's interesting


---------59:05----------
past because i think there are some


---------59:06----------
things we can learn from you


---------59:08----------
and there are some things that you say


---------59:09----------
that make me think that like some of


---------59:11----------
this may be a little bit more intrinsic


---------59:14----------
i think there are a couple of really


---------59:15----------
really important anyway so let me ask


---------59:17----------
you a couple other


---------59:18----------
questions that okay yeah and then i'll


---------59:20----------
try to


---------59:21----------
try to sort of summarize a little bit in


---------59:22----------
a second but there are a few minutes


---------59:24----------
so can you tell us so it sounds like it


---------59:26----------
was sort of a rough transition from


---------59:28----------
leaving the military and like sort of


---------59:30----------
starting to stream on twitch can you


---------59:31----------
tell us about that


---------59:34----------
it was more of a rush rough transition


---------59:37----------
because i didn't know what i wanted to


---------59:38----------
do


---------59:40----------
um i knew what i enjoyed but


---------59:44----------
i didn't like the pressure i put on my


---------59:46----------
my girlfriend


---------59:47----------
who's now my wife at the time that i


---------59:49----------
wasn't making any money and she was the


---------59:51----------
only person making money paying all the


---------59:52----------
bills


---------59:53----------
i did have a little bit of money saved


---------59:54----------
it wasn't like i didn't contribute


---------59:56----------
anything


---------59:58----------
um and


---------60:01----------
also not having a lot of friends um a


---------60:03----------
lot of my friends either in the military


---------60:05----------
had moved


---------60:05----------
back home to where they were from or


---------60:07----------
been posted different states


---------60:09----------
and a lot of the friends that i grew up


---------60:12----------
with live back in a different state


---------60:14----------
so we were living in south australia


---------60:16----------
which


---------60:17----------
we moved to the middle of nowhere like


---------60:18----------
it was three hours or two hours from the


---------60:20----------
city


---------60:21----------
um so i needed to


---------60:25----------
re i had to push myself back into


---------60:28----------
society in ways and i joined the lawn


---------60:30----------
bowls


---------60:31----------
team lorne bowles is like botchy but on


---------60:33----------
grass


---------60:34----------
for anyone who doesn't know what it is


---------60:36----------
um where everyone plays when they're


---------60:37----------
retired no one's under the age of like


---------60:40----------
60. so like but the coolest thing is


---------60:43----------
they're the people that know all the


---------60:44----------
fishing tips and tricks and spots so


---------60:47----------
kind of worked out well with that but um


---------60:51----------
so yeah that was i started streaming to


---------60:53----------
literally make friends and i made a heap


---------60:55----------
of friends


---------60:56----------
pretty quick most of them moderators now


---------60:58----------
or they might have moved on to different


---------61:00----------
things but


---------61:01----------
it's been nice so were you feeling


---------61:04----------
lonely


---------61:08----------
um


---------61:11----------
maybe a little bit maybe a little bit


---------61:15----------
not a lot like i wasn't like i need to


---------61:19----------
go find friends


---------61:20----------
right now but i definitely why so help


---------61:23----------
me understand why


---------61:24----------
because you make it sound like the


---------61:25----------
primary reason to stream was to make


---------61:27----------
friends


---------61:28----------
so why did you feel like it because a


---------61:31----------
lot of times loneliness


---------61:33----------
and maybe there's a lesson to be learned


---------61:34----------
here when i think about people who are


---------61:36----------
hungry for friends i sort of assume for


---------61:39----------
a moment that they're lonely


---------61:40----------
but what i'm hearing from you is not


---------61:42----------
necessarily that you were lonely but you


---------61:44----------
were still very


---------61:45----------
intentional about making friends so


---------61:50----------
i love playing computer games i really


---------61:52----------
enjoy playing computer games


---------61:54----------
i can't play a computer game for more


---------61:56----------
than probably an hour before i'm bored


---------61:59----------
if i'm not playing with friends so when


---------62:02----------
i've got a


---------62:03----------
chat i can play all day there's no issue


---------62:05----------
with that


---------62:06----------
when i started streaming like literally


---------62:08----------
all my friends were married with kids


---------62:10----------
didn't play computer games anymore


---------62:12----------
they'd all moved on from the gaming


---------62:13----------
scene like nearly no one i played


---------62:15----------
computer games with when i was younger


---------62:17----------
still plays computer games


---------62:19----------
so i wanted people that enjoyed the same


---------62:22----------
games as me to just find to play games


---------62:24----------
and


---------62:25----------
and have good chats and play till three


---------62:27----------
in the morning four in the morning and


---------62:29----------
all that kind of stuff but um i still


---------62:32----------
had


---------62:32----------
friends but not ones that i could either


---------62:35----------
hang out with or play computer games


---------62:37----------
with


---------62:39----------
so you started streaming just sort of to


---------62:41----------
try to find people to game with


---------62:44----------
and to talk to during the day yeah


---------62:47----------
and then when did you start to think


---------62:48----------
about this as a career


---------62:52----------
um so that was in october i started


---------62:54----------
doing that in january


---------62:56----------
i went on a big drive along the east


---------62:59----------
coast of australia with my wife


---------63:00----------
and we um


---------63:04----------
i don't know i maybe had like 15 20 subs


---------63:06----------
and something like that


---------63:08----------
and i was like i actually feel like i


---------63:10----------
understand how the platform works


---------63:12----------
um i've done by that stage i've done a


---------63:14----------
bit of research and stuff and i didn't


---------63:16----------
really


---------63:16----------
stream that whole month and i said i


---------63:18----------
want to


---------63:19----------
give it a give it a solid crack i want


---------63:21----------
to give it like a year or two years


---------63:24----------
um and i'll just go really hard i'll


---------63:26----------
throw everything i can at it and i'll


---------63:27----------
just want to see


---------63:28----------
where it goes and it sounds weird but


---------63:32----------
i said if i could get maybe 2 000


---------63:34----------
followers because by the way i was like


---------63:36----------
i'm going to sell my house


---------63:37----------
to go to europe like i was legitimately


---------63:39----------
happy to sell my house to move to


---------63:41----------
travel europe i said if i can get 2 000


---------63:43----------
followers that might be interested in my


---------63:45----------
travels through europe


---------63:46----------
and i can like maybe fund it some way


---------63:48----------
through that


---------63:49----------
then you know it could be all worth it


---------63:52----------
and so


---------63:54----------
yeah i started streaming in hope to get


---------63:56----------
2 000 followers before i got to europe


---------64:00----------
how did you decide to go to you so you


---------64:01----------
decided that you were gonna go to europe


---------64:03----------
and climb


---------64:04----------
in 2012 and when did you start streaming


---------64:08----------
on twitch


---------64:10----------
2017


---------64:13----------
so what were you doing when were you in


---------64:15----------
the military


---------64:16----------
from 2009 to 2017.


---------64:20----------
i see okay so you started streaming on


---------64:23----------
twitch in 2017.


---------64:25----------
and when did it become really like a


---------64:29----------
career for you or a job


---------64:31----------
2018 and what happened around that time


---------64:36----------
um that's when i went on that drive with


---------64:38----------
my wife and we decided i'm going to give


---------64:40----------
it a go and then that's why i


---------64:41----------
started taking it more serious i just


---------64:43----------
started working as a part-time paid fire


---------64:44----------
fighter so i had


---------64:46----------
some sort of income as well so it wasn't


---------64:48----------
just my wife making all the money but


---------64:51----------
um it really took off pretty quick to be


---------64:53----------
honest


---------64:55----------
what's your understanding of that within


---------64:58----------
two months i was partnered


---------65:00----------
i think two to three months and then the


---------65:03----------
graph


---------65:03----------
is hasn't really slowed down


---------65:07----------
what's your understanding of why that


---------65:08----------
happened


---------65:13----------
i feel like i'm a friendly person i


---------65:14----------
think my whole


---------65:16----------
my whole basis is the fact that we're


---------65:18----------
just a bunch of like-minded people that


---------65:20----------
just enjoy computer games and i'm not


---------65:22----------
the best at the game but


---------65:23----------
i just want to invite anyone who wants


---------65:25----------
to have


---------65:27----------
friends or make friends the people that


---------65:29----------
like we've got a common interest escape


---------65:31----------
from tarkov


---------65:32----------
like i play a lot of other games now at


---------65:33----------
the moment but


---------65:35----------
everyone that pretty much jumps into my


---------65:36----------
channel likes escape from tarkov


---------65:38----------
you're not judged on anything but what


---------65:40----------
you say in chat and your name


---------65:41----------
that's pretty much all they can judge


---------65:43----------
you on and you know where you're from in


---------65:45----------
the world doesn't matter you can just


---------65:46----------
we can hang out we can talk and we're


---------65:48----------
just a big community


---------65:50----------
and i've been big on just a community


---------65:52----------
aspect like


---------65:53----------
i promote streams in the tarkov category


---------65:55----------
i know like a lot of most


---------65:57----------
most streamers and categories on twitch


---------65:59----------
they don't promote other channels like


---------66:01----------
not very often


---------66:02----------
i'll literally be talking about another


---------66:04----------
streamer and be shouting them out during


---------66:05----------
the stream all the time or


---------66:07----------
i used to do it a lot more than now but


---------66:09----------
um


---------66:11----------
i i'm more than happy for everyone to be


---------66:13----------
successful i feel like if the category's


---------66:16----------
a really healthy category then it just


---------66:18----------
promotes all channels and grows all


---------66:19----------
channels anyway so


---------66:22----------
why not have a good community across


---------66:24----------
twitch a cool thing i've been doing of


---------66:26----------
more recent


---------66:26----------
is when i do a big event like a


---------66:28----------
starlight charity event i actually have


---------66:30----------
intermission periods so say the stream


---------66:32----------
goes for 12 hours at the four and eight


---------66:34----------
hour mark i'll get


---------66:35----------
um a streamer from the music section a


---------66:38----------
professional musician


---------66:39----------
and i'll play on my stream for 10


---------66:40----------
minutes and it advertises their stream


---------66:42----------
but gives 10 minutes of music


---------66:44----------
entertainment to my to to my community


---------66:46----------
so it's it's gives me a break i get 10


---------66:48----------
minutes to just drink some water and sit


---------66:50----------
back


---------66:50----------
listen to cool music i love it i think


---------66:53----------
twitch is an amazing platform and we


---------66:55----------
should all try and push everyone


---------66:56----------
together to grow


---------66:57----------
as well yeah i can see why you've been


---------67:00----------
rising


---------67:02----------
and growing i think it's really awesome


---------67:05----------
pes to the way that you


---------67:06----------
talk about your experience on twitch the


---------67:08----------
way that you know people use this word


---------67:10----------
wholesome a lot


---------67:11----------
but i i think you know you're there


---------67:13----------
because you love the game and you love


---------67:14----------
the community


---------67:16----------
um and it sounds fantastic man


---------67:21----------
so you mentioned that you had a


---------67:23----------
girlfriend and now your wife


---------67:25----------
so it sounds like you guys have been


---------67:26----------
together for a little while


---------67:28----------
um just about five years now can you


---------67:31----------
tell do you mind if i ask a few


---------67:33----------
questions about her


---------67:34----------
yeah within reason like i i sure


---------67:38----------
i'll save it yeah just let me know um


---------67:41----------
because i you know i like we when we


---------67:43----------
kind of think about the corporal


---------67:45----------
for example and just sort of how him


---------67:48----------
being authentic with you and sort of


---------67:50----------
like how you guys kind of had that


---------67:53----------
mutual respect as you put it i'm


---------67:55----------
noticing that


---------67:56----------
in your life you're not playing single


---------67:58----------
player


---------67:59----------
right you partied up and and the


---------68:02----------
questions that i have about your


---------68:03----------
girlfriend or wife aren't really so much


---------68:05----------
about like you know her but more about


---------68:07----------
her influence on you is that


---------68:10----------
fair you think that's okay yep okay yeah


---------68:12----------
so can you tell us just a little bit


---------68:14----------
about


---------68:15----------
um how you all met oh we met on tinder


---------68:18----------
actually


---------68:19----------
which is like most people don't find


---------68:21----------
relationships on tinder but i did um


---------68:25----------
yeah the actual meeting story is pretty


---------68:27----------
funny but um


---------68:29----------
yeah we just we she actually i messaged


---------68:31----------
her and she said i'm really busy right


---------68:32----------
now can you talk


---------68:33----------
to me in two weeks and said sure i said


---------68:36----------
sure and i waited two weeks to the day


---------68:37----------
and messaged


---------68:38----------
her and she was surprised so um it kind


---------68:40----------
of went from there


---------68:41----------
but um yeah we dated for


---------68:44----------
three or four months and then we became


---------68:46----------
official and


---------68:48----------
i don't know we've just had a really


---------68:49----------
open dialogue for majority of our


---------68:52----------
or for our whole relationship really can


---------68:54----------
you tell us a little bit about


---------68:55----------
how the relationship has intertwined


---------68:59----------
with


---------69:00----------
your life


---------69:03----------
um sorry it's a bad question


---------69:08----------
um i was just kind of thinking so i i


---------69:09----------
get the sense that she's actually like


---------69:11----------
very supportive of you


---------69:13----------
and 100 i would not be anywhere near


---------69:15----------
this successful without her


---------69:17----------
yeah so tell can you help us understand


---------69:19----------
that for a second


---------69:21----------
um well she was willing to put up the


---------69:22----------
crazy idea that i wanted to share my


---------69:23----------
twitch


---------69:24----------
uh full time that that was um pretty


---------69:27----------
full on i actually tried to push her out


---------69:28----------
of her job


---------69:29----------
to help me once it started getting


---------69:31----------
bigger and she wanted to


---------69:33----------
finish um her contract and she decided


---------69:37----------
that


---------69:37----------
just i needed more help so she actually


---------69:40----------
finished up a little bit early to help


---------69:41----------
me


---------69:42----------
um just because there was that much


---------69:43----------
going on but pretty much anything that's


---------69:45----------
ever happened with my stream


---------69:47----------
she's known about it at the same time


---------69:49----------
i've thought about it because i'd be


---------69:50----------
like hey


---------69:51----------
i've got this idea can we do this and


---------69:52----------
she'd be like how are you going to make


---------69:53----------
it work and i'm like


---------69:55----------
you know and she's like maybe like don't


---------69:58----------
do that bit but everything else will


---------69:59----------
work


---------70:00----------
all right cool you know and it's been


---------70:02----------
very much like that from the very start


---------70:04----------
and


---------70:05----------
i'd have an idea because pestilence


---------70:07----------
based off the word pestilence


---------70:08----------
um and so you know like the plague


---------70:10----------
doctor for example so like i played the


---------70:12----------
long game you know with the coronavirus


---------70:14----------
i started planning this whole plague


---------70:16----------
mass thing


---------70:16----------
two years in advance so um she helped


---------70:19----------
made all the logo and all that and she's


---------70:21----------
got a she's a really creative


---------70:22----------
like as in artist creative person which


---------70:25----------
is really cool


---------70:26----------
um and so yeah like all those kind of


---------70:29----------
ideas


---------70:30----------
would go to her at some point


---------70:33----------
and then yeah i had to develop onto the


---------70:36----------
stream


---------70:38----------
she's been amazingly supportive i don't


---------70:40----------
know what you want what exactly you want


---------70:41----------
me to say


---------70:42----------
oh


---------70:46----------
because it's i think we see that right


---------70:49----------
so we we see that she


---------70:50----------
you know she's kind of behind the scenes


---------70:52----------
i sort of have detected that


---------70:54----------
in a lot of the different stories that


---------70:57----------
you've told


---------70:58----------
um and so i i just wanted to help us uh


---------71:01----------
help everyone who's kind of thinking a


---------71:02----------
little bit about your story like what


---------71:04----------
role she plays in it


---------71:05----------
sounds like she's incredibly supportive


---------71:07----------
um 100


---------71:09----------
and not just in an emotional sense but


---------71:12----------
in uh


---------71:13----------
you know you know like very practical


---------71:15----------
like she sounds like she designed some


---------71:16----------
of your art


---------71:17----------
um yeah she's she's my manager now so


---------71:20----------
she runs the actual business


---------71:22----------
yeah there's same same with me too


---------71:24----------
actually so


---------71:25----------
that's there are a lot of coincidences


---------71:27----------
so i i have basically stories to match


---------71:29----------
each and every one of yours


---------71:31----------
and and my wife is now my boss yep


---------71:38----------
um so yeah it's interesting i i think


---------71:41----------
you know i've had a lot of interesting


---------71:43----------
experiences about working with your


---------71:45----------
significant other um and


---------71:48----------
it's been fun but it's i imagine much


---------71:51----------
like yourself so i think we were


---------71:52----------
relatively small channel until she took


---------71:54----------
over


---------71:56----------
and then she helped us become big


---------72:00----------
um and so


---------72:03----------
yeah i mean i think just kind of getting


---------72:05----------
a quick perspective on on


---------72:07----------
you know so it sounds like she's pretty


---------72:08----------
involved and also supports you in terms


---------72:10----------
of like taking


---------72:11----------
risks in terms of figuring out you know


---------72:15----------
if you have


---------72:16----------
uh and now i may be projecting a little


---------72:18----------
bit from my own relationship but


---------72:21----------
you know it sounds like if you have an


---------72:23----------
idea she tries to help you make it work


---------72:26----------
instead of it just being a crazy idea


---------72:29----------
she would never shut me down


---------72:30----------
she would at least listen through the


---------72:31----------
idea first


---------72:33----------
and like sort of make it figure out how


---------72:35----------
to make it feasible


---------72:36----------
and ideally it can't be feasible i've


---------72:39----------
never said something and she's just gone


---------72:40----------
no


---------72:40----------
like that that's something she would


---------72:42----------
never do because she knows that


---------72:44----------
i might say something that's a little


---------72:45----------
bit out there but i actually have


---------72:48----------
already thought of a bit of a process to


---------72:50----------
get there


---------72:51----------
so she'd want to actually hear it out


---------72:53----------
first


---------72:54----------
um like like even the fact like we've


---------72:56----------
been stuck in europe to try and get back


---------72:58----------
to australia like i was like what if we


---------72:59----------
just


---------73:00----------
bought a yacht like i know it sounds


---------73:02----------
crazy but like


---------73:04----------
i love fishing and sailing and all that


---------73:06----------
kind of stuff like what if we bought a


---------73:07----------
yacht


---------73:08----------
and then we just hired a crew and we


---------73:11----------
just like but


---------73:12----------
like we had to go down the path of we


---------73:14----------
don't know what to look at


---------73:15----------
in a yacht like what kind of like it


---------73:18----------
could we could buy a lemon and we'd be


---------73:19----------
halfway across the pacific and sail to


---------73:21----------
the bottom of the ocean you know like we


---------73:22----------
have no idea what we're doing


---------73:24----------
so like you listen to the idea but


---------73:27----------
you know obviously that one didn't go


---------73:28----------
ahead but it's she won't just go nowhere


---------73:32----------
so past you know what's really fun is to


---------73:34----------
watch your face when you talk about her


---------73:37----------
yeah do you know what you do when you


---------73:40----------
start talking small


---------73:41----------
absolutely right lights up your entire


---------73:44----------
face


---------73:46----------
do you feel when you talk about her i'm


---------73:49----------
i'm i'm happily married i think it's


---------73:51----------
clear


---------73:53----------
i'm gonna do that i'm gonna do the


---------73:54----------
political response


---------73:57----------
i think that's the beauty right is that


---------73:59----------
it's like it's not it's clear to us


---------74:01----------
i think or clear to me anyway that it's


---------74:02----------
not political i mean i


---------74:05----------
i think in all seriousness to do a job


---------74:07----------
particularly like what i do


---------74:09----------
um there is a lot of hours to go into it


---------74:11----------
and i have to make sure i allocate time


---------74:13----------
to spend with my wife and she does


---------74:15----------
she kind of draws like says hey you know


---------74:17----------
we haven't had a time


---------74:18----------
to ourselves for a while let's like next


---------74:21----------
week we're going to see a castle in the


---------74:22----------
netherlands because


---------74:23----------
i've worked every day for the last like


---------74:26----------
i don't know two weeks


---------74:27----------
so it's like hey we need a she she keeps


---------74:30----------
me leveled


---------74:31----------
yeah so pes is there something in


---------74:34----------
particular


---------74:35----------
um first of all thank you so much for


---------74:37----------
sharing everything is there anything


---------74:38----------
else


---------74:38----------
anything in particular that you want to


---------74:40----------
talk about that we haven't discussed or


---------74:42----------
anything you wanted to share


---------74:45----------
not really um


---------74:48----------
i don't see myself as like better than


---------74:51----------
anyone or anything like that i hope that


---------74:53----------
i haven't come across like that at all i


---------74:54----------
i just i definitely do feel like i


---------74:56----------
i see things differently to a lot of


---------74:58----------
people a lot of people will see an idea


---------75:01----------
and think oh that's really hard


---------75:02----------
and i don't i i kind of like i just get


---------75:06----------
excited by the options of like what if


---------75:08----------
that was possible


---------75:09----------
or something like that like i don't know


---------75:12----------
i


---------75:13----------
a little bit of fear of like i might


---------75:14----------
come across as really arrogant in this


---------75:16----------
talk or something because


---------75:17----------
you know how my thought processes go


---------75:19----------
across but


---------75:21----------
um yeah pasta i'm gonna say something


---------75:25----------
i think you are better than average well


---------75:28----------
thank you


---------75:30----------
i mean i i think you are better than


---------75:31----------
most people


---------75:33----------
and i think part of and and i i know


---------75:36----------
it's sort of like we


---------75:37----------
i don't think that any human being is


---------75:40----------
that like has more inherent


---------75:41----------
value than another human being and at


---------75:44----------
the same time


---------75:46----------
i think when a lot of people look at you


---------75:48----------
i know when i listen to you i think


---------75:49----------
about the ways in which you are better


---------75:51----------
than i am


---------75:53----------
and this is the crazy thing is i don't


---------75:54----------
think that that's bad


---------75:57----------
i think that you are different and you


---------76:00----------
are exceptional


---------76:01----------
you've done a couple of things that are


---------76:03----------
i think many people would be envious of


---------76:06----------
and it doesn't mean that i think you


---------76:09----------
accurately representing those things


---------76:11----------
i can imagine people would perceive as


---------76:14----------
arrogance but i don't think so i think


---------76:15----------
the whole reason that you're here


---------76:17----------
is so that we can learn how to be better


---------76:22----------
right and and i'm not saying that like


---------76:24----------
in a sense i think that's true of


---------76:26----------
everyone that comes on the stream


---------76:27----------
we're here to learn from you and in your


---------76:30----------
case i think you have


---------76:31----------
objectively done things that are like


---------76:33----------
difficult to do


---------76:35----------
you objectively the way that your mind


---------76:37----------
works and the way that you live your


---------76:38----------
life


---------76:39----------
seems to be like pretty enviable like


---------76:42----------
let's be honest


---------76:43----------
and i think that's okay it doesn't make


---------76:45----------
you arrogant it just means


---------76:47----------
you suck less at life and so i think the


---------76:50----------
important thing


---------76:51----------
the reason i'm really glad you came on


---------76:52----------
and that you've been so open is because


---------76:54----------
i think we can learn from you


---------76:57----------
and the whole goal of this channel is


---------76:59----------
that like we can learn what everyone has


---------77:01----------
to offer


---------77:02----------
and we can become better at life by like


---------77:05----------
learning a little bit of your playbook


---------77:06----------
what works what doesn't


---------77:08----------
i think i mean some of the stuff that


---------77:09----------
you're talking about i can get behind


---------77:11----------
some of it i can try to


---------77:12----------
deconstruct and duplicate and some of it


---------77:14----------
i'm just gonna have to figure out my own


---------77:16----------
way


---------77:17----------
because at the end of the day going to


---------77:18----------
the gym five days a week is just as you


---------77:20----------
put it not enough of a priority for me


---------77:23----------
you know and so we we're gonna have


---------77:25----------
something important awake anymore just


---------77:27----------
to be clear


---------77:28----------
like but like i think there's definitely


---------77:33----------
um people


---------77:37----------
don't prioritize what's important to


---------77:38----------
them sometimes and and and i'm the same


---------77:41----------
like i go i really want to look after my


---------77:43----------
health but then i don't go to the gym


---------77:45----------
so like why yeah no go ahead i was


---------77:49----------
i was going to say why don't people


---------77:50----------
prioritize what's important to them


---------77:56----------
i don't want to say the words lazy


---------77:57----------
because i don't think people are always


---------77:58----------
lazy it's just a matter of


---------78:00----------
like they get distracted easy like


---------78:03----------
there's


---------78:03----------
like like so many bright lights around


---------78:06----------
us these days


---------78:07----------
where and and things that just distract


---------78:09----------
us so it's like oh another episode of


---------78:10----------
you know i was gonna say game of thrones


---------78:12----------
but no one wants to talk about game of


---------78:13----------
thrones anymore but


---------78:14----------
another episode of a tv show comes out


---------78:15----------
oh i'll just watch that


---------78:17----------
you know like it's just it's they have


---------78:19----------
full intention to go to the gym they


---------78:20----------
were probably


---------78:21----------
already going to their gym clothes and


---------78:22----------
that but it's just you know


---------78:25----------
something's shiny and it just distracts


---------78:27----------
them


---------78:28----------
yeah so it's it's hard it's and there's


---------78:31----------
so much we all want to do


---------78:33----------
and we've only got so much time the most


---------78:34----------
valuable thing we all have is time and


---------78:37----------
i don't like the idea of wasting it


---------78:41----------
yeah i i don't think many people do


---------78:44----------
which is why it can be so frustrating


---------78:45----------
when they find themselves wasting it


---------78:49----------
so pes let me ask you so i i think it's


---------78:52----------
i really appreciated all the questions


---------78:53----------
you've


---------78:54----------
answered and your openness is there


---------78:56----------
anything in particular that um


---------78:58----------
i can help you with or anything that you


---------79:00----------
want to work on


---------79:02----------
um not really when you when you message


---------79:06----------
asking for a talk


---------79:07----------
i i i actually sat and


---------79:10----------
i didn't reply straight away because i


---------79:11----------
thought you know what could we talk


---------79:12----------
about


---------79:13----------
and i like i go through the same like i


---------79:16----------
had like yesterday for example


---------79:18----------
i woke up and i just did not want to


---------79:20----------
talk to people


---------79:21----------
i had no one i did not want to talk to


---------79:23----------
people so instead i


---------79:26----------
instead of streaming i worked on youtube


---------79:27----------
content you know i i just did something


---------79:30----------
else


---------79:30----------
like i i go through the same mentalities


---------79:34----------
and issues i'm sure other streamers


---------79:35----------
would go through and other content


---------79:36----------
creators and


---------79:37----------
and that way you just or people just in


---------79:39----------
general not wanting to go to work for


---------79:41----------
the day but i just try and make the most


---------79:42----------
of the


---------79:43----------
like the day i can and then i think i


---------79:45----------
watched


---------79:46----------
maybe four episodes of carnival row on


---------79:48----------
the couch


---------79:50----------
but you know i got to rest as well


---------79:52----------
that's how i say it


---------79:54----------
yeah that was the risk so let's just


---------79:57----------
talk about that for a second i think


---------79:58----------
that there's a really important


---------80:00----------
shift that you make in your mind


---------80:04----------
which is i think a lot of times people


---------80:06----------
focus on what they can't do


---------80:09----------
and what they try to do is overcome the


---------80:12----------
can't


---------80:13----------
like how can you turn the cant into a


---------80:15----------
can


---------80:17----------
right like i just can't talk to people


---------80:19----------
today


---------80:20----------
and they look at their lives and they


---------80:21----------
say like okay like what i need to do to


---------80:23----------
move forward is like you know how do i


---------80:25----------
go to the gym


---------80:26----------
like how do i just how do i just muscle


---------80:28----------
through and do that


---------80:30----------
how can i grow and become disciplined


---------80:32----------
and not be lazy


---------80:33----------
whereas i think you figured out a pretty


---------80:35----------
interesting solution which is you just


---------80:37----------
don't try to overcome it it's not about


---------80:40----------
what you can't do and overcoming what


---------80:42----------
you can't do


---------80:43----------
it's about what can you do


---------80:46----------
and that's something that i found in my


---------80:49----------
own life which is like i can't


---------80:50----------
go to the gym five days a week but like


---------80:52----------
what can i do


---------80:54----------
and i find that the less time that i


---------80:57----------
spend trying to overcome my weaknesses


---------81:00----------
and the more time that i spend sort of


---------81:02----------
like giving in to myself


---------81:04----------
but at least extracting a little bit of


---------81:06----------
the direction i want to go in


---------81:07----------
the better off i am can i at least do


---------81:10----------
five minutes of yoga


---------81:11----------
can i do 10 push-ups can i just can i


---------81:13----------
just do something like what can i do


---------81:15----------
okay fine you want to be lazy [ __ ]


---------81:16----------
today


---------81:17----------
no big deal we're going to be lazy today


---------81:21----------
but what can we do do we have to be lazy


---------81:23----------
for 14 hours of the day


---------81:26----------
can we just be lazy for 13 and a half


---------81:28----------
and at least for 30 minutes like


---------81:30----------
clean the kitchen and what i would


---------81:34----------
encourage everyone to do is just pay


---------81:35----------
attention to what pest said


---------81:37----------
and sure so you're like you're like i


---------81:39----------
can't talk to people today i just can't


---------81:41----------
stream okay but i can work on youtube


---------81:43----------
content right


---------81:45----------
and that too is sort of this idea that


---------81:46----------
like you have this central idea and like


---------81:48----------
okay you can't stream but


---------81:50----------
you're willing to go over here to


---------81:51----------
youtube which is still like moving you


---------81:53----------
it's still digging your well one foot


---------81:54----------
deeper it's just using a different tool


---------81:56----------
for the day


---------81:58----------
100 and for the people


---------82:01----------
like really i encourage all of you guys


---------82:02----------
to think about exercise or


---------82:04----------
you know finding a job it's like i can't


---------82:07----------
find a job and like


---------82:08----------
think about what pest has been telling


---------82:09----------
us okay what's the process what can you


---------82:12----------
do


---------82:12----------
make a resume okay i don't even like


---------82:14----------
know how to make a resume can you


---------82:15----------
download a template


---------82:17----------
can you download a template and just


---------82:20----------
change the name and the address at the


---------82:21----------
top


---------82:23----------
because then you're one step closer to


---------82:24----------
where you want to be


---------82:26----------
can you at least look at other people's


---------82:28----------
resumes


---------82:31----------
with anything really yeah


---------82:34----------
what can you do and i think too much of


---------82:37----------
our or


---------82:37----------
too much of myself and us we spend so


---------82:40----------
much time and this is like the problem


---------82:42----------
because i think a lot of like the


---------82:44----------
self-help kind of stuff like david


---------82:46----------
goggins is a good example


---------82:48----------
if he's all about overcoming can't


---------82:51----------
right he's like and i'm not saying


---------82:54----------
that's bad i'm just saying that there's


---------82:56----------
like


---------82:56----------
there's a different way overcoming can't


---------82:58----------
is half the battle


---------82:59----------
and sometimes the other half is giving


---------83:01----------
in to camp and focusing on what you can


---------83:03----------
do


---------83:05----------
a lot of david goggins stuff is also


---------83:08----------
saying stop giving a [ __ ] what other


---------83:10----------
people think though


---------83:12----------
um which i i kind of agree with that


---------83:13----------
stuff stop caring about what other


---------83:15----------
people think


---------83:16----------
do what you want to do if you want to do


---------83:18----------
this be the best of that you can be


---------83:20----------
you know like it's not always overcoming


---------83:24----------
issues but the negative forces of


---------83:27----------
people's


---------83:28----------
ideas and that coming towards you as


---------83:30----------
well like


---------83:31----------
yeah i don't know like that that for me


---------83:34----------
that's more where i


---------83:35----------
i just block out other people's you know


---------83:38----------
negativity with that as well


---------83:40----------
because if i'm like i wanna i wanna do


---------83:41----------
this like


---------83:43----------
i've wanted to walk 100 kilometers


---------83:44----------
before and i've done it you know like


---------83:46----------
just to see if i could do it but


---------83:47----------
there's so many people to be out there


---------83:48----------
like you couldn't do that don't do it


---------83:50----------
like that's stupid or you should go to


---------83:51----------
bed because you've been up too long stop


---------83:53----------
you should stop you look tired well i'm


---------83:55----------
not tired i know that i can


---------83:57----------
stay awake for three days straight i've


---------83:59----------
done it three times in the military


---------84:01----------
like you can say i can't do this but i'm


---------84:03----------
doing it so


---------84:05----------
you're wasting your time typing that


---------84:07----------
that's how i see it i don't


---------84:09----------
look at someone's message of me like


---------84:11----------
you're silly like i don't know


---------84:13----------
yeah past i think you have a strong


---------84:15----------
sense of who you are


---------84:16----------
as a person and you come across as very


---------84:19----------
confident which makes it easy to


---------84:21----------
discount what other people say i think


---------84:24----------
the challenge is that


---------84:26----------
when someone says something about you


---------84:29----------
you have an intrinsic sense when they


---------84:31----------
say


---------84:31----------
you shouldn't do that that's dumb and


---------84:34----------
inside you there's something that rises


---------84:36----------
up and fights against that it's like you


---------84:38----------
don't know who i am i know who i am


---------84:41----------
you shouldn't stay up for well i've done


---------84:42----------
it before so you should


---------84:44----------
sit [ __ ] out i think the challenge is


---------84:46----------
a lot of people don't have that


---------84:49----------
right and and so if it's okay with you


---------84:52----------
past can i try to highlight a couple of


---------84:54----------
things that i've heard you say that i


---------84:56----------
think


---------84:57----------
maybe can get people moving sort of a


---------85:00----------
little bit in the direction that you


---------85:01----------
found yourself in


---------85:03----------
yeah official 100 okay so it starts with


---------85:05----------
curiosity


---------85:08----------
right so if we really listen to you past


---------85:09----------
what we hear is that like


---------85:11----------
when you're curious about something you


---------85:14----------
actually


---------85:15----------
invest the time and energy to try to


---------85:17----------
pursue it


---------85:18----------
and i think this is huge because i think


---------85:20----------
a lot of people are very curious


---------85:22----------
but the curiosity ends with like a


---------85:24----------
wikipedia search


---------85:26----------
and there's something about you know the


---------85:28----------
way that you cultivate ideas and like


---------85:30----------
devote yourself to like you know the


---------85:31----------
same thing over and over and over again


---------85:33----------
but


---------85:33----------
you're curious and you're bored easily


---------85:35----------
which i think that's not something that


---------85:37----------
is unique to you i think that's for most


---------85:39----------
people


---------85:40----------
gamers in particular i think twitch this


---------85:43----------
entire generation tends to be like


---------85:45----------
curious and bored easily and so i think


---------85:48----------
that's instrumental to getting you to


---------85:50----------
where you've gone the only difference is


---------85:51----------
that i think you've actually


---------85:54----------
fed your curiosity in a really healthy


---------85:56----------
way


---------85:57----------
and as far as the board easily like the


---------85:59----------
way that you kind of still focus your


---------86:01----------
thoughts in one general direction


---------86:03----------
although you let yourself get bored


---------86:06----------
but when you get bored you're kind of


---------86:08----------
like okay what can i do with my boredom


---------86:09----------
that's almost in the direction that i


---------86:11----------
want to go


---------86:13----------
the second thing is that i i want you


---------86:15----------
guys to really pay attention to this


---------86:16----------
because i think pest didn't do it alone


---------86:19----------
right and i think if we really listen to


---------86:21----------
your story we hear that


---------86:23----------
it starts with like when you're on the


---------86:25----------
brink of quitting one person having


---------86:27----------
faith in you


---------86:28----------
and one person looking at you and saying


---------86:30----------
i don't think you


---------86:32----------
are the person that you think you are


---------86:35----------
you've come so close to quitting and


---------86:37----------
ultimately they didn't like


---------86:38----------
they didn't give you a huge speech but


---------86:40----------
they saw within you


---------86:41----------
something that has value and they saw


---------86:44----------
within you that


---------86:45----------
underneath all of the layers of a


---------86:48----------
quitter


---------86:48----------
is someone who doesn't quit


---------86:52----------
and that i think is is huge we also see


---------86:55----------
that even now


---------86:57----------
it's not a single player game right like


---------87:00----------
in when you kind of talk about your wife


---------87:01----------
we see the way the way your face lights


---------87:03----------
up


---------87:04----------
we see like how she's been helpful and


---------87:06----------
supportive and stuff like that how she


---------87:07----------
kind of keeps you in check


---------87:09----------
but also gives you wings


---------87:12----------
um


---------87:17----------
so one time i was working with someone


---------87:19----------
so


---------87:20----------
in some of these hospitals that i work


---------87:21----------
in there are these like older people who


---------87:24----------
are just super wise


---------87:26----------
usually not doctors but they're like


---------87:28----------
nurses and just like people who just


---------87:29----------
have really


---------87:31----------
and and you know when i had kids i went


---------87:33----------
to this one person who i respected a lot


---------87:35----------
and they've got a couple of kids and i


---------87:37----------
assumed their kids are


---------87:38----------
healthy and happy so i asked him like


---------87:39----------
hey do you have any like advice for like


---------87:41----------
raising children


---------87:43----------
and he said yeah give him wings and give


---------87:46----------
him a place to fly back to


---------87:48----------
and it was like one of those just


---------87:50----------
amazingly


---------87:51----------
succinct like give him wings


---------87:55----------
and let him fly and then have a place to


---------87:56----------
come back to and when i hear about your


---------87:59----------
relationship with


---------88:00----------
your wife that's kind of what i get is


---------88:03----------
that she does


---------88:04----------
you know support you she always listens


---------88:06----------
and then every now and then she's like


---------88:08----------
hey you've been working for two weeks


---------88:10----------
let's be normal human beings and take a


---------88:13----------
little bit of a break


---------88:14----------
right so she gives you those wings and


---------88:16----------
then she gives you a place to come back


---------88:18----------
to


---------88:19----------
so the second thing is that you know


---------88:21----------
it's important to have people in your


---------88:23----------
life and then if you don't then how do


---------88:24----------
you get those as a whole other question


---------88:27----------
um so i think that faith


---------88:30----------
has been transformative for you and


---------88:32----------
support has been transformative for you


---------88:35----------
that ultimately i think a lot of your


---------88:38----------
growth has come from


---------88:40----------
you exercising control and taking


---------88:42----------
control of your life


---------88:44----------
which i know is hard to duplicate but


---------88:46----------
you know you sort of tried it for a


---------88:47----------
while and you kind of played this game


---------88:49----------
and then people were like


---------88:51----------
they weren't willing so at some point


---------88:53----------
you developed that faith and confidence


---------88:55----------
in yourself


---------88:56----------
and your ceo refused to see it


---------89:00----------
and so there was one time in your life


---------89:02----------
where all you saw within yourself was a


---------89:04----------
quitter


---------89:04----------
and someone refused to see it there's


---------89:06----------
another time in your life where


---------89:09----------
what they saw was a quitter and you


---------89:11----------
refused to see that


---------89:13----------
you're like you know what [ __ ] you guys


---------89:15----------
i'm done


---------89:17----------
um and so i think it's really amazing


---------89:19----------
how you've


---------89:20----------
you know taken risks and you don't know


---------89:22----------
how things are going to go


---------89:24----------
and another thing that i would say is


---------89:25----------
that like this kind of comes back to


---------89:26----------
what you were saying about you don't


---------89:28----------
fear


---------89:28----------
failure i think that's one of the


---------89:30----------
biggest problems is because the fear of


---------89:32----------
failure


---------89:32----------
tends to paralyze a lot of people


---------89:36----------
the other subtle thing that we can hear


---------89:38----------
from your words is that when you


---------89:40----------
fail i don't hear it say anything about


---------89:44----------
you as a person like a lot of people


---------89:47----------
feel like when they


---------89:48----------
fail they are a failure like the person


---------89:52----------
and the failure are the same thing does


---------89:55----------
that make sense


---------89:56----------
yeah yeah so i don't see the failure


---------90:00----------
as being something that is the


---------90:03----------
it's i see as a lesson learned that more


---------90:05----------
than just being like


---------90:07----------
unable to do something yeah so i want


---------90:10----------
you like so that's really interesting


---------90:11----------
right because for one person


---------90:13----------
a failure means i'm a bad person


---------90:16----------
but when you feel fail when you say it's


---------90:19----------
a lesson learned that actually makes you


---------90:21----------
a better person


---------90:23----------
and so if you want to talk about what's


---------90:25----------
op it's when failure pushes one person


---------90:28----------
down


---------90:28----------
and failure pumps you up like why the


---------90:31----------
like no that's


---------90:32----------
that's op every failure you have


---------90:35----------
actually makes you


---------90:36----------
stronger and better and gives you a


---------90:39----------
sense of like confidence that you're


---------90:41----------
you're better than the person you used


---------90:42----------
to be before


---------90:44----------
and then there's like a whole crowd of


---------90:45----------
people out there who are like when they


---------90:47----------
fail they feel like less of a human


---------90:48----------
being


---------90:49----------
and it's like you know i wanna i wanna i


---------90:52----------
want your strategy


---------90:54----------
and that's what i've seen a lot in


---------90:56----------
clinical medicine too


---------90:58----------
is that like sometimes when you have a


---------90:59----------
bad outcome with a patient you can feel


---------91:01----------
like a bad doctor


---------91:04----------
and then like the other way to think


---------91:06----------
about it is like


---------91:08----------
now that you've had that bad outcome


---------91:11----------
i'll be damned if i ever let that happen


---------91:13----------
again


---------91:14----------
and what you've actually done in that


---------91:16----------
moment is improved the lives of


---------91:18----------
every patient that you're gonna see


---------91:20----------
afterward if you learn from it


---------91:23----------
if you throw yourself a pity party and


---------91:25----------
you feel like a bad person


---------91:26----------
you're actually doing a disservice to


---------91:28----------
all the patients that come next so i


---------91:30----------
think that's really fascinating which i


---------91:31----------
hear you kind of talk about like you


---------91:33----------
know failure isn't about your value as a


---------91:35----------
person it's about


---------91:36----------
learning and then the last thing that i


---------91:39----------
want to highlight is that


---------91:40----------
you know a lot of people think that you


---------91:41----------
need like discipline and stuff and when


---------91:43----------
we look at past and we think like oh my


---------91:45----------
god this guy's so disciplined


---------91:47----------
but i think it's really cool that you


---------91:48----------
learned adobe in three days


---------91:51----------
and i think that there's absolutely a


---------91:52----------
road of six towards success where you


---------91:54----------
dive really deep into something for a


---------91:57----------
few days


---------91:58----------
and then you don't have to devote your


---------91:59----------
entire life to like making youtube


---------92:01----------
videos


---------92:02----------
that you can actually have your mind


---------92:04----------
wander between different things


---------92:05----------
get super excited about something learn


---------92:07----------
it really well but as long as it's in


---------92:09----------
the same


---------92:10----------
general direction i think you're going


---------92:11----------
to end up kind of like where you did


---------92:15----------
what do you think yeah


---------92:18----------
i think you don't need to be the master


---------92:19----------
of everything there's no way you need to


---------92:21----------
devote all your time and effort into


---------92:23----------
mastering one trade


---------92:25----------
um like yeah the adobe is a good example


---------92:28----------
where i just i learned enough to make


---------92:29----------
youtube videos and then i started making


---------92:31----------
youtube videos


---------92:32----------
i i thought it'd be really cool to be


---------92:35----------
able to make really cool


---------92:36----------
transitions and everything but i soon


---------92:38----------
realized like that would be so time


---------92:40----------
consuming


---------92:41----------
in hindsight i would actually hire an


---------92:43----------
editor like early on in my career


---------92:45----------
i made my first 500 youtube videos in


---------92:47----------
the first two years and that was a lot


---------92:48----------
of life that it took


---------92:50----------
from me but um the


---------92:54----------
i do that with a lot of things though


---------92:55----------
i'll try try something out for a little


---------92:57----------
bit see if i like it


---------92:58----------
put some time into learning it and then


---------93:00----------
but just enough to get the understanding


---------93:02----------
of it not to


---------93:03----------
to master it i think i think there's a


---------93:05----------
lot people can do with that where you


---------93:08----------
don't have to feel like you have to


---------93:09----------
master


---------93:09----------
the craft of something to be


---------93:13----------
it's like there's a guy that said in 10


---------93:15----------
hours you can learn something i was like


---------93:17----------
ted talk or something


---------93:18----------
and he played the guitar after 10 hours


---------93:20----------
and he learned a song or something or


---------93:21----------
ukulele actually it was


---------93:22----------
it was a really cool ted talk in 10


---------93:25----------
hours you can actually learn a language


---------93:26----------
for example you can


---------93:27----------
learn the basic rapport building of a


---------93:29----------
language or something


---------93:30----------
um so yeah i think there's some


---------93:33----------
definite premise behind that piece


---------93:36----------
anything that you think i kind of left


---------93:38----------
out


---------93:39----------
those are i think the key things like


---------93:41----------
sort of curiosity


---------93:42----------
it's okay to get bored easily having


---------93:45----------
people have faith in you


---------93:47----------
being able to quit walking away from


---------93:49----------
good things


---------93:51----------
um acknowledging that failure is not


---------93:54----------
about


---------93:55----------
you it's a failure actually makes you


---------93:57----------
stronger not weaker


---------93:59----------
um and kind of diving in this kind of


---------94:02----------
goes to the board easily thing but sort


---------94:03----------
of diving into one thing for like a few


---------94:05----------
days at a time and then


---------94:06----------
that's good enough i think um


---------94:14----------
a lot of a lot of that can be summarized


---------94:16----------
up in just always trying to improve


---------94:17----------
myself as a person


---------94:19----------
really um i always


---------94:22----------
try and be the best person i can be and


---------94:24----------
not just in like


---------94:26----------
a what do you call it like a a practical


---------94:29----------
sense like being able to have these


---------94:30----------
skills to make a video but


---------94:32----------
also like i try to reply to every single


---------94:34----------
discord dm there is i get a lot these


---------94:35----------
days but like i still try to reply to


---------94:37----------
them all like


---------94:38----------
just try and be the best person you can


---------94:39----------
be and one of the things i'm big with my


---------94:42----------
community is paying it forward


---------94:43----------
like i'll do something for you and then


---------94:45----------
you do it for someone something for


---------94:46----------
someone else it doesn't have to be


---------94:47----------
directly back to me


---------94:49----------
um and with that premise we can just


---------94:52----------
make a better society and a better


---------94:53----------
community


---------94:54----------
um i'm i'm guessing you're trying to


---------94:56----------
start to head towards wrapping it up but


---------94:58----------
i actually really just uh um i just like


---------95:01----------
the fact that people


---------95:02----------
aren't so community focused these days


---------95:04----------
like when i was a child i everyone knew


---------95:05----------
their neighbors


---------95:06----------
so when i bought a house the first thing


---------95:08----------
i did well not literally the first but


---------95:09----------
like


---------95:10----------
within the 24 hours of moving into my


---------95:11----------
house i went and said hello to all my


---------95:12----------
neighbours i've knocked on every single


---------95:14----------
one of their doors and said hello hi


---------95:15----------
my name's paul um you know i live next


---------95:17----------
door i'm in the army if you ever need


---------95:18----------
anything just


---------95:20----------
you know knock on the door i'm i don't


---------95:22----------
care how big or small


---------95:23----------
and and from that point onwards they


---------95:25----------
were the best neighbors ever because


---------95:27----------
like someone parked in my driveway once


---------95:28----------
and they gave me a call and said hey


---------95:30----------
there's some random car in your driveway


---------95:31----------
like they didn't have to do that but if


---------95:34----------
i'd never introduced myself


---------95:35----------
they never would have done that you know


---------95:37----------
and that community aspect


---------95:39----------
isn't just like a twitch thing for me


---------95:41----------
it's it's a life thing


---------95:42----------
you know just be good to everyone and


---------95:44----------
hopefully it all


---------95:46----------
makes the world a better place yeah man


---------95:49----------
i am i'm sort of leaning towards


---------95:51----------
wrapping up is there something that you


---------95:52----------
want to


---------95:53----------
discuss otherwise or anything else you i


---------95:55----------
think it's a great great sentiment about


---------95:57----------
community i think that's actually one of


---------95:58----------
the really interesting things is


---------96:00----------
twitch is a place where or just the


---------96:03----------
internet is a place that in a lot of


---------96:04----------
ways fractures and isolates us


---------96:07----------
but i think conversely is the very


---------96:09----------
antidote


---------96:10----------
to the poison that it kind of creates


---------96:13----------
and we sort of


---------96:14----------
sort of get the sense of fomo and like


---------96:16----------
you know


---------96:18----------
thinking less about the ourselves and


---------96:20----------
seeing what other people are doing in it


---------96:22----------
at the same time it's the very tool that


---------96:24----------
we can use to bring ourselves together


---------96:27----------
yeah and i think twitch is a really


---------96:29----------
great platform for community


---------96:32----------
i really i as a marketing side i really


---------96:34----------
wish they pushed it more


---------96:36----------
is it marketing what side like the


---------96:39----------
twitch twitch management should be


---------96:40----------
actually focusing more on the community


---------96:42----------
aspect than anything


---------96:44----------
on the platform yeah and how they can


---------96:47----------
enhance the community because i think


---------96:49----------
it's just i think it's great i think


---------96:51----------
there's so much they could do so much


---------96:52----------
more they could do


---------96:54----------
what would you like to see even like


---------96:58----------
like among us is a perfect example of


---------97:00----------
how anyone playing any game can play the


---------97:01----------
one game and enjoy it


---------97:03----------
me bringing musicians across to play on


---------97:05----------
my stream


---------97:06----------
like all those kind of things where we


---------97:08----------
could


---------97:09----------
bring communities like from different


---------97:11----------
streams across together to


---------97:13----------
to cross-pollinate i guess would be the


---------97:14----------
word but also


---------97:18----------
um


---------97:20----------
like i i before kobe kicked in i did


---------97:22----------
meet ups in


---------97:23----------
in france portugal and the netherlands


---------97:26----------
and i went to pax east um but like


---------97:30----------
you know conventions are great like all


---------97:33----------
that kind of stuff


---------97:34----------
where people can go and hang out and


---------97:36----------
talk


---------97:37----------
meet each other and have fun or if they


---------97:39----------
don't want to go to those conventions


---------97:40----------
they can still play games together and


---------97:42----------
just anything that enhances the


---------97:44----------
community aspect of twitter i'm


---------97:45----------
all for and stuff like this this is


---------97:48----------
actually like


---------97:48----------
bringing people together to talk about


---------97:50----------
stuff so thank you so much for what you


---------97:51----------
do


---------97:52----------
as well yeah likewise man i think it's


---------97:54----------
thank you so much for coming i think


---------97:56----------
too often i do we focus on sort of the


---------97:59----------
downsides of life like we focus a lot on


---------98:03----------
how people mess up and what i really


---------98:06----------
appreciated about you pest is that


---------98:08----------
i think you gave us an opportunity for


---------98:10----------
like


---------98:12----------
you know what is what does success look


---------98:14----------
like


---------98:15----------
and i don't mean to make you know i'm


---------98:16----------
not trying to kiss your ass or anything


---------98:17----------
or flatter you but i think that


---------98:19----------
you know when you look at it you play a


---------98:21----------
game and some games you win in some


---------98:22----------
games you lose


---------98:23----------
it's just as important to look at the


---------98:25----------
replays that you win so that you can


---------98:27----------
figure out what did you do right


---------98:30----------
and equally important to look at the


---------98:31----------
replays that you lost to figure out what


---------98:32----------
you did wrong


---------98:34----------
and living life is about like


---------98:35----------
understanding both of those sides it's


---------98:36----------
not just about all your mistakes in fact


---------98:38----------
i'd argue that


---------98:39----------
a lot of what holds people back is that


---------98:41----------
they focus too much on their mistakes


---------98:43----------
going back to this idea of like how do i


---------98:45----------
overcome what i can't do well like


---------98:47----------
just set that aside for a second man


---------98:49----------
let's look at you what you can do let's


---------98:50----------
look at what you are good at


---------98:52----------
let's look at like how do people


---------98:54----------
transition


---------98:55----------
from a place of being lonely and not


---------98:56----------
having friends to like starting a twitch


---------98:58----------
stream and things like that i think


---------98:59----------
success stories are just as important


---------99:01----------
not just because it's like


---------99:02----------
success men but very practically like


---------99:04----------
you know what are the things that you


---------99:06----------
can do


---------99:08----------
um so i really appreciate that so thank


---------99:11----------
you very much


---------99:13----------
um do you want do you do you are you


---------99:16----------
interested in learning how to meditate


---------99:17----------
do you meditate


---------99:19----------
um i used to have an app called


---------99:21----------
headspace and


---------99:23----------
it used to like the issue i used to


---------99:25----------
always have with it was


---------99:28----------
um once as soon as my brain starts to


---------99:31----------
stop thinking i fall asleep because i


---------99:33----------
don't sleep a lot


---------99:34----------
i get like seven hours at the moment in


---------99:36----------
the past it used to be five hours


---------99:38----------
um i guess seven hours sleep at night


---------99:40----------
and now i'm not i'm really happy i get


---------99:42----------
that much now


---------99:43----------
but anytime i meditate i usually just


---------99:45----------
fall asleep


---------99:46----------
so um i know you're pretty big on it and


---------99:50----------
and i've definitely tried it in the past


---------99:52----------
but generally for me a lot of the time


---------99:54----------
i just fall asleep okay it's okay


---------99:58----------
okay i'll ask you this question then is


---------100:00----------
there a way to instead of meditating to


---------100:02----------
calm the mind is there a way to like


---------100:04----------
keep the mind active but still


---------100:06----------
stop me from sleeping then sure i've got


---------100:09----------
a meditation for you


---------100:12----------
okay you ready for it yep so if i asked


---------100:15----------
you to close your eyes and meditate now


---------100:17----------
do you think you'd fall asleep here on


---------100:18----------
stream


---------100:19----------
no why not


---------100:22----------
um it depends on how long it went for


---------100:27----------
okay so so i've got a great meditation


---------100:30----------
for you it's perfect you're suited for


---------100:31----------
it


---------100:32----------
it's gonna be so easy for you it's gonna


---------100:33----------
be hard for other people but i think


---------100:35----------
it'll be easy for you so i don't know


---------100:36----------
how much it'll help other people to


---------100:37----------
learn


---------100:37----------
meditation okay you ready for it


---------100:41----------
i want you to catch the moment of sleep


---------100:45----------
and what i mean by that is that


---------100:48----------
close your eyes paul so you're awake


---------100:52----------
right


---------100:56----------
and so like being awake has a certain


---------100:58----------
consciousness


---------101:00----------
you can notice your thoughts you may be


---------101:02----------
aware of sensations you can hear my


---------101:04----------
words


---------101:05----------
and sleep is different right


---------101:10----------
so what i want you to do


---------101:14----------
this is going to sound silly because i


---------101:16----------
know you said you


---------101:17----------
you were not gonna fall asleep but i


---------101:19----------
want you to


---------101:20----------
try to fall asleep and as


---------101:23----------
because don't remember it's not about


---------101:26----------
going back to what we just said like


---------101:28----------
don't focus on what you can't do like if


---------101:30----------
you always fall asleep during meditation


---------101:32----------
fine


---------101:34----------
that's not a problem that's our solution


---------101:36----------
let's run with it


---------101:37----------
so what i want you to do is catch the


---------101:40----------
moment of sleep


---------101:42----------
so there's going to be a transition


---------101:44----------
where on one side of the transition


---------101:46----------
you're awake and on the other side of


---------101:47----------
this transition you're asleep


---------101:51----------
and just catch that moment of sleep


---------101:56----------
it's like you're fishing there's nothing


---------101:59----------
on the


---------102:00----------
line and now there's a fish on the line


---------102:04----------
catch that moment


---------102:09----------
between empty hook and fish on the hook


---------102:18----------
let yourself fall asleep


---------102:30----------
we'll try for about five minutes


---------102:44----------
can i be silent or do you want me to


---------102:46----------
coach you through the process


---------102:49----------
um it's up to you i'm i'm


---------102:52----------
i don't know what are you doing right


---------102:54----------
now tell me


---------102:56----------
i'm just focusing on my breathing


---------103:00----------
okay and waiting for yourself to fall


---------103:03----------
asleep


---------103:04----------
pretty much good


---------103:31----------
so i want you to be like a tiger


---------103:33----------
crouching


---------103:37----------
ready to catch that sleep


---------103:46----------
wait for it wait for it


---------103:54----------
notice what your mind is doing


---------104:01----------
and now i'll be silent for about three


---------104:04----------
minutes


---------105:55----------
are you asleep yet not yet


---------106:00----------
what are you doing just focusing on


---------106:04----------
breathing


---------106:06----------
okay so i'm going to ask you a couple of


---------106:10----------
questions is that okay


---------106:13----------
yep so like focusing on your breathing


---------106:17----------
is meditating right


---------106:20----------
what happens when you meditate


---------106:24----------
um you relax no no what happens when you


---------106:27----------
meditate


---------106:28----------
oh um


---------106:33----------
i know my body just feels more heavy


---------106:36----------
yep and then you fall asleep yeah


---------106:41----------
what have you been doing for the last


---------106:42----------
five minutes meditating


---------106:45----------
why haven't you fallen asleep


---------106:50----------
i think probably anxiousness if anything


---------106:52----------
that would have sleep in front of uh


---------106:54----------
in you like this are you thinking lots


---------106:57----------
of thoughts


---------106:58----------
yeah too many okay


---------107:02----------
so here's the crazy thing so i think


---------107:05----------
you're doing a good job


---------107:08----------
and maybe it's because you're on stream


---------107:11----------
although i'm going to assume for a


---------107:12----------
moment that it's not


---------107:16----------
so maybe the reason you didn't fall


---------107:17----------
asleep is because you're on stream fair


---------107:19----------
enough


---------107:20----------
but i want you to try to do is to catch


---------107:22----------
the moment of sleep


---------107:25----------
offstring and see what happens


---------107:31----------
and i suspect that something silly may


---------107:33----------
happen


---------107:35----------
which is that if you try to meditate


---------107:37----------
you'll fall asleep


---------107:38----------
and if you try to catch sleep you'll


---------107:40----------
meditate


---------107:45----------
does that make sense yeah it is


---------107:48----------
you can come back to us


---------107:52----------
how do you feel relaxed


---------107:57----------
so catch it if it wants to come let it


---------107:59----------
come catch it


---------108:04----------
and maybe you won't fall asleep maybe


---------108:06----------
you will win


---------108:07----------
win either way if you do fall asleep


---------108:10----------
next time


---------108:12----------
you felt you know you fell asleep you


---------108:14----------
missed it you missed your prey


---------108:16----------
so next time you can practice and do a


---------108:18----------
little bit better


---------108:20----------
questions does that make sense


---------108:23----------
yeah it does cool man


---------108:27----------
well thank you very much oh my pleasure


---------108:30----------
that was really good it was really good


---------108:33----------

---------108:34----------

---------108:35----------

---------108:36----------
