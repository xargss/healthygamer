---------00:00----------
if you're not going anywhere in life


---------00:02----------
people just automatically assume that


---------00:05----------
the way to move forward is to like work


---------00:07----------
harder or be more bitna but the reason


---------00:10----------
that you're not going anywhere life may


---------00:12----------
not be a lack of ambition it may be


---------00:13----------
because you're spreading yourself too


---------00:15----------
thin


---------00:21----------
okay let's talk about solo queue so much


---------00:28----------
more toxic okay so let's do let's do


---------00:43----------
something about habits what's my opinion


---------00:47----------
on the 16 personality test what is the


---------00:49----------
16 personality test I don't know what it


---------00:54----------
is


---------00:56----------
myers-briggs so myers-briggs is is I


---------01:02----------
think a useful descriptive personality


---------01:08----------
assessment that is not that is not like


---------01:14----------
independently validated so I think it's


---------01:16----------
like a useful lens to understand


---------01:18----------
behavior but I don't think it is a good


---------01:22----------
way to like make predictions so it's


---------01:27----------
funny actually I just saw this in reddit


---------01:36----------
so the first thing to understand about


---------01:38----------
myers-briggs this it's not like


---------01:39----------
independently validated so there's a


---------01:41----------
myers-briggs Research Institute which


---------01:43----------
publishes a lot of research but it's a


---------01:46----------
proprietary model and like there really


---------01:49----------
haven't been independent studies on


---------01:51----------
myers-briggs that show that it it is


---------01:54----------
valid I think the virus Briggs can be


---------01:57----------
very useful so why are it is actually


---------02:00----------
based I think on Ayurveda because


---------02:03----------
myers-briggs is based on the work of


---------02:05----------
Carl Jung and Carl Jung's ideas were


---------02:07----------
heavily informed by our Venna


---------02:10----------
so I think it can be a useful way to


---------02:12----------
understand yourself kind of like and I


---------02:14----------
like this top end so that someone says


---------02:16----------
that it can be like a useful way to like


---------02:18----------
look at your own behavior and understand


---------02:20----------
it much like a horoscope like you know I


---------02:23----------
mean a horoscope is probably I think


---------02:24----------
myers-briggs is a little better than a


---------02:25----------
horoscope but when I talk about Lavazza


---------02:28----------
pit then gufa those are all useful ways


---------02:30----------
to understand those are useful ways to


---------02:35----------
understand like how you are as a person


---------02:38----------
and understand your strengths and


---------02:40----------
weaknesses and structure a life in your


---------02:41----------
interactions to play to your strengths


---------02:43----------
and weaknesses so a couple of other


---------02:50----------
questions are there any personality


---------02:52----------
frameworks independently a validated


---------02:54----------
absolutely so the big five I think is


---------02:56----------
the best the five factor personality


---------02:58----------
assessment is the the best validated


---------03:03----------
like system of personality and the big


---------03:10----------
five so we can talk a little bit about


---------03:11----------
the big five so the big the five factors


---------03:13----------
so what the big five says is that most


---------03:16----------
people can be sort of put on on five


---------03:20----------
different axes so the axes are


---------03:22----------
introversion versus extraversion which


---------03:24----------
is exactly what it is in myers-briggs by


---------03:27----------
the word by the way extrovert and


---------03:29----------
introvert were words that Carl Jung I


---------03:31----------
believe invented or coined the next is


---------03:35----------
agreeableness so agreeable this is like


---------03:38----------
how willing you are to go along with


---------03:39----------
people


---------03:40----------
the third is openness so how open you


---------03:43----------
are to new experiences versus how shut


---------03:46----------
off you are Democrats in the u.s or


---------03:49----------
liberals score higher on the openness


---------03:52----------
straight and then conservatives score


---------03:54----------
lower on the openness straight


---------03:57----------
agreeableness then the next one is


---------04:03----------
neuroticism so neuroticism is your


---------04:06----------
tendency for internal worry so how much


---------04:09----------
you get like bothered by things and


---------04:11----------
people may think that like being highly


---------04:13----------
neurotic is bad or is worse than being


---------04:16----------
like having low neuroticism whereas like


---------04:19----------
if you think about someone who's super


---------04:20----------
low on the the low neuroticism scale


---------04:22----------
there the traditional pothead


---------04:24----------
so they don't care about anything


---------04:25----------
they're just gonna chill and relax they


---------04:27----------
have no ambition that's low neuroticism


---------04:29----------
is that nothing bothers them they're


---------04:31----------
happy to just chill out and hang and


---------04:33----------
then high neuroticism is like people who


---------04:36----------
are super anxious the interesting thing


---------04:37----------
is if you look at medical students they


---------04:40----------
score very highly on the neuroticism


---------04:42----------
scale and then the the fifth factor is


---------04:46----------
conscientiousness which is how driven


---------04:49----------
you are towards a particular goal like


---------04:51----------
how conscientious you are how much you


---------04:52----------
take things seriously


---------04:54----------
so medical suit are actually median


---------04:56----------
income so if you want to be rich the two


---------04:59----------
best traits are high neuroticism and


---------05:01----------
high conscientiousness you have to be


---------05:03----------
very goal-oriented and driven towards


---------05:05----------
success and have follow through and be


---------05:08----------
internally very worried about things you


---------05:10----------
have to be scared or like you have to be


---------05:12----------
anxious about skip failing the task so


---------05:13----------
you study extra hard and then you have


---------05:17----------
to be like you have to study for the


---------05:18----------
test can people change I think so so you


---------05:23----------
can also like learn different ways you


---------05:25----------
have an intrinsic personality but then


---------05:27----------
you can like adopt different things you


---------05:29----------
can be naturally tended towards


---------05:30----------
introversion but as we were talking


---------05:32----------
about you can learn how to fill a room


---------05:34----------
you can be highly neurotic and then


---------05:37----------
through meditation and psychotherapy


---------05:38----------
learn to be nothing less neurotic you


---------05:40----------
could have low conscientiousness and


---------05:42----------
through some amount of emotional


---------05:44----------
processing and reflecting and growth you


---------05:47----------
can become more conscientious you can


---------05:49----------
become more open to new experiences you


---------05:51----------
can become more agreeable you can learn


---------05:53----------
how to get along with others better yeah


---------05:59----------
so Alex Croft has it right so the


---------06:01----------
traditional pot head is low


---------06:03----------
conscientiousness low neuroticism so


---------06:06----------
people are asking about okay so when


---------06:07----------
should someone change their personality


---------06:09----------
traits when they interfere with your


---------06:10----------
quality of life yeah so I want you guys


---------06:13----------
to understand this so your personality


---------06:18----------
can be what it is I think the most


---------06:20----------
important thing is that you play to your


---------06:22----------
strengths so for those of you who


---------06:25----------
understand poker like I think the


---------06:27----------
problem is that is a society and


---------06:29----------
generally speaking gamers are very


---------06:31----------
guilty of this they think that certain


---------06:33----------
things are objectively better than other


---------06:36----------
things


---------06:36----------
like they say that like in poker and ace


---------06:39----------
is better than @n like that's just true


---------06:41----------
and yes in theory it's true but if


---------06:44----------
you're playing poker and you've got the


---------06:46----------
option for a flush draw like you don't


---------06:49----------
want an ace right you want like whatever


---------06:52----------
suit if you've got like if you paint


---------06:55----------
playing Hold'em and you've got like four


---------06:57----------
ten of hearts like your strategy to win


---------07:01----------
that game like you can beat someone


---------07:02----------
who's got an ace or even pocket aces you


---------07:06----------
can still win even though the other


---------07:07----------
person objectively has a way better hand


---------07:10----------
than you do the problem is that when we


---------07:14----------
when when people rank things in a linear


---------07:17----------
scale which is what Western thinking


---------07:19----------
does we think about better and we think


---------07:21----------
about worse right we think about like


---------07:24----------
this person earlier was saying that like


---------07:25----------
the workplace is structured to


---------07:27----------
extroverts that could be true but it


---------07:29----------
sort of doesn't [ __ ] matter because


---------07:31----------
you should just understand like where


---------07:33----------
what your personality strengths and


---------07:34----------
weaknesses are and then play to those


---------07:36----------
strengths and weaknesses if you've got a


---------07:39----------
flush draw go for a flush like just


---------07:42----------
because the dude next to you has pocket


---------07:44----------
aces and can get like four of a kind


---------07:46----------
with aces doesn't mean you should even


---------07:49----------
try because it may be impossible for you


---------07:50----------
but you can still win if you just oh


---------07:53----------
sorry my mic isn't exploding [ __ ] okay


---------07:57----------
so so so I think this is the biggest


---------08:06----------
problem that people make is like you


---------08:07----------
guys are talking about personality I'd


---------08:09----------
say don't worry about having the right


---------08:11----------
personality or the wrong personality


---------08:13----------
understand what your personality is and


---------08:15----------
how you're gonna be good at it so if you


---------08:18----------
have low conscientiousness and low


---------08:20----------
neuroticism you may think like okay that


---------08:22----------
my chances of being promoted are gonna


---------08:24----------
be lower than the person who's like


---------08:25----------
worried about promotion all the time and


---------08:27----------
the person who's hard-working well


---------08:29----------
that's true and if you have higher


---------08:32----------
openness and higher agreeableness


---------08:35----------
chances are your path through promotion


---------08:38----------
is through like social standing so


---------08:40----------
people are gonna like you way more than


---------08:42----------
the person who's highly conscientious


---------08:44----------
and highly neurotic


---------08:45----------
so your path through promotion is gonna


---------08:47----------
be through charisma and once you


---------08:50----------
understand that then you have to


---------08:51----------
understand like okay like how much


---------08:52----------
conscientiousness do I need to exert and


---------08:55----------
how much neuroticism do I need to exert


---------08:59----------
and then how can I play to my strengths


---------09:03----------
then smeag ale 96 asks if it's possible


---------09:09----------
to alter our door shut somewhat


---------09:11----------
shouldn't we try to maximise our fitness


---------09:13----------
if we want to be successful yes so if


---------09:15----------
you're fit does low so remember that


---------09:17----------
problems in Ayurveda arise when your


---------09:19----------
levels are too high or too low so if you


---------09:22----------
feel like you're not ambitious or not


---------09:24----------
moving anywhere in life I do think it


---------09:26----------
will help you to increase your pipa


---------09:30----------
and more importantly like you have to


---------09:32----------
increase your Rajas but if you're


---------09:35----------
thinking about like why you're stuck in


---------09:37----------
life it may not be that your bit does


---------09:38----------
too low it could be that your vato is


---------09:40----------
too high and this is this is the other


---------09:42----------
problem so I just think about this for a


---------09:43----------
second guys if you're not going anywhere


---------09:46----------
in life people just automatically assume


---------09:49----------
that the way to move forward is to like


---------09:51----------
work harder or be more bitna but the


---------09:54----------
reason that you're not going anywhere


---------09:56----------
life may not be a lack of ambition it


---------09:58----------
may be because you're spreading yourself


---------09:59----------
too thin so this is a classic Vata


---------10:01----------
problem where vodkas get stuck because


---------10:04----------
they think they need to be more


---------10:05----------
disciplined it's not that they need to


---------10:07----------
be more disciplined it's that they spend


---------10:08----------
their energy in too many different


---------10:10----------
places so if you're the solution isn't


---------10:13----------
isn't necessarily to increase your bit


---------10:15----------
though it's to reduce your vodka and


---------10:18----------
this is exactly what I'm saying is that


---------10:20----------
depending on your individual personality


---------10:22----------
makeup there isn't a way to be


---------10:25----------
successful you just need to think about


---------10:27----------
okay what isn't what is getting in the


---------10:29----------
way of my success do I need to be more


---------10:32----------
conscientious do I need to be more


---------10:35----------
social is the problem that I'm having


---------10:37----------
that like I don't get opportunities that


---------10:40----------
other people get because I'm not social


---------10:41----------
enough


---------10:44----------
can I answer questions on suicide sure I


---------10:46----------
mean I can't dispense medical advice


---------10:49----------
I may have to advise you to go to the


---------10:51----------
emergency room but I can answer


---------10:52----------
questions on suicide like I'm here to


---------10:53----------
answer serious questions yeah so if your


---------11:03----------
cough is too high then you should lower


---------11:04----------
your cuff up right you can increase your


---------11:07----------
fit though but you can also lower your


---------11:08----------
cuff up is viewing spreading oneself


---------11:15----------
thin as a successful poor mindset I


---------11:17----------
don't know what that means


---------11:26----------
oh [ __ ] my bad okay should I switch to


---------11:30----------
the other let me just switch to the


---------11:31----------
other I don't know how to lower anything


---------11:35----------
I'm gonna just switched to my Yeti so


---------11:40----------
okay let me just think okay so the first


---------11:46----------
thing is what is Ayurveda so I last


---------11:48----------
Sunday we talked about Ayurveda which I


---------11:50----------
think a lot of people found very


---------11:51----------
interesting but thanks for linking DANC


---------11:56----------
so no No thank you guys for letting me


---------11:58----------
know we just we're trying a new mic


---------12:00----------
setup so it's important to you know find


---------12:02----------
a good mic setup so this is what you


---------12:04----------
what Ayurvedic


---------12:06----------
is all about so our Veda believes that


---------12:09----------
human beings are fundamentally different


---------12:10----------
and that there are three types of human


---------12:12----------
or three sort of qualities of human


---------12:14----------
beings and the best analogy that I can


---------12:17----------
use that's kind of very accessible is


---------12:19----------
that like there are some people that we


---------12:21----------
say have fast metabolisms these people


---------12:24----------
tend to be thin and like even if they


---------12:26----------
eat whatever they want to they can do


---------12:27----------
like fried chicken every day and they're


---------12:28----------
not gonna put on like that much weight


---------12:30----------
it doesn't mean if they're gonna be


---------12:31----------
healthy but that that like they just


---------12:33----------
don't balloon up whereas other people


---------12:35----------
are big-boned and even if they eat


---------12:38----------
salads every day they can still be


---------12:39----------
overweight and so


---------12:44----------
um Ayurveda sort of says that like


---------12:46----------
unlike Western science which kind of


---------12:48----------
says that everyone should eat a 2,000


---------12:49----------
calorie diet that these are like


---------12:51----------
everyone should have five servings of


---------12:53----------
fruits and vegetables and the kinds of


---------12:54----------
fruits and vegetables don't matter that


---------12:56----------
you should have X amount of protein it's


---------12:58----------
or Western medicine has a common


---------13:01----------
prescription for all people it assumes


---------13:03----------
fundamentally that people are the same


---------13:05----------
if you have pneumonia you need a


---------13:07----------
particular antibiotic to treat the


---------13:08----------
pneumonia who you are or how tall you


---------13:11----------
are or what your body type is or how


---------13:12----------
your stool is or how your skin is


---------13:14----------
doesn't matter at all Western medicine


---------13:16----------
treats disease with medicine the person


---------13:19----------
doesn't enter it's just a disease


---------13:21----------
medicine relationship Iyer VII that


---------13:23----------
starts off by saying that people are


---------13:25----------
different and that the the right


---------13:27----------
medicine for one person may be different


---------13:29----------
for the medicine from the medicine and


---------13:31----------
for a different person depending on what


---------13:32----------
kind of people they are and there are


---------13:34----------
three general kinds of people or the


---------13:36----------
three forces in our body which are Vata


---------13:38----------
Pitta and kapha and that depending on


---------13:41----------
the levels of your Vata Pitta and kapha


---------13:42----------
it's they're gonna manifest in different


---------13:44----------
traits personality aspects mental


---------13:48----------
aspects psychological aspects physical


---------13:51----------
aspects all of these things relate to


---------13:52----------
Vata Pitta and kapha sovath --is learn


---------13:56----------
things very easily but also get


---------13:58----------
distracted very easily they have kind of


---------14:00----------
like an ADHD mind whereas guffaws like


---------14:04----------
learn things very slowly but also forget


---------14:06----------
very slowly


---------14:10----------
and so if you understand what your door


---------14:12----------
Shai is then you can sort of adjust your


---------14:14----------
door shots first of all if some are to


---------14:16----------
hire or some are too low the other thing


---------14:18----------
is that if you understand your door shy


---------14:19----------
you should play to your strengths so


---------14:22----------
people think that


---------14:25----------
um you know like if you're not driven


---------14:29----------
and focused and ambitious that you're


---------14:30----------
not gonna be successful in life and like


---------14:33----------
I look at my colleagues who are like


---------14:35----------
researchers and stuff like that and like


---------14:38----------
I'm amazed by how much they can like go


---------14:40----------
to work every day and just do the same


---------14:41----------
damn thing and then they get grants


---------14:44----------
because they write these like 50 page


---------14:45----------
grant proposals that are just the most


---------14:47----------
mind-numbing ly boring documents in the


---------14:49----------
world and then since they get grants and


---------14:51----------
they do research they apply for


---------14:52----------
different like fellowships and


---------14:54----------
promotions and things like that and they


---------14:56----------
get them because that's what's valued in


---------14:57----------
academia and so I look at them and I say


---------15:01----------
like oh man like it's so hard for me to


---------15:02----------
do research it's so hard for me to write


---------15:04----------
a grant proposal and so I think a little


---------15:06----------
bit about like oh my god you know I I'm


---------15:10----------
not as good as they are but my strengths


---------15:12----------
are simply different I'm Ivana so I'm


---------15:14----------
Way more dynamic so if I want to be


---------15:16----------
successful I need to do like a few


---------15:18----------
different things like I suck at just


---------15:20----------
doing one thing but I do really well if


---------15:21----------
I'm doing different things if I see a


---------15:24----------
few patients today and then like I


---------15:26----------
scream in the evening and then I spent


---------15:30----------
some time writing and then you know I


---------15:33----------
spend some time filming then that's like


---------15:36----------
a great day for me like today is a good


---------15:37----------
example so I took it easy in the morning


---------15:40----------
did some writing I we work together the


---------15:44----------
recovery coaches and I met for a little


---------15:47----------
over an hour and a half and so I taught


---------15:50----------
for a couple of hours and then I


---------15:52----------
streamed for a couple of hours and I


---------15:54----------
like wrote like a manual like a chapter


---------15:56----------
for the recovery coach manual and that's


---------16:00----------
what really


---------16:02----------
works


---------16:05----------
right like that's what works for me like


---------16:07----------
I can't do the same thing every day


---------16:08----------
but I'll do a better job if I'm doing


---------16:10----------
two or three different things so I think


---------16:13----------
the main thing to understand about


---------16:14----------
personality is like when you when you


---------16:16----------
look at your personality doesn't matter


---------16:17----------
whether using five factor or


---------16:18----------
myers-briggs or IRA


---------16:22----------
and


---------16:26----------
what it really doesn't matter the main


---------16:28----------
thing is that you understand like for


---------16:30----------
this


---------16:31----------
system whatever system you're using to


---------16:35----------
to understand yourself like just


---------16:36----------
understand what the system says about


---------16:38----------
you and then develop a strategy based on


---------16:40----------
what the system recommends play to your


---------16:43----------
strengths okay
