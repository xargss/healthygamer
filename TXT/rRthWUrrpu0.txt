---------01:06----------
black desert and I was like I don't know

what to name this pet the stupid little


---------01:09----------
bird thing so I was like I don't know

---------01:16----------

---------01:17----------
like it okay so bulliest helped me


---------01:19----------
understand a little bit about because


---------01:20----------
it's been a while and I have a short


---------01:22----------
memory and so I do remember that we


---------01:24----------
talked about Dark Souls I remember that


---------01:26----------
we talked about you being a slow-rolling


---------01:28----------
deprived and that you know that's no way


---------01:31----------
to go through life I don't know what the


---------01:33----------
[ __ ] that means anymore


---------01:34----------
so you do you why don't you why don't


---------01:36----------
you fill us in about what we talked


---------01:38----------
about and yes so like tell me like like


---------01:42----------
what was your recollection of the last


---------01:45----------
time we talked and my memory isn't the


---------01:49----------
best either


---------01:51----------
maybe but whenever you ask me that it


---------01:56----------
comes up blank so okay so tell us a


---------01:58----------
little bit about why you came on stream


---------02:00----------
in the first place um I feel like I have


---------02:06----------
a lot of like personal issues that


---------02:09----------
people can probably relate to or that


---------02:11----------
can be solved by somebody who knows what


---------02:14----------
they're doing such as yourself so yeah


---------02:16----------
so what do you think your your personal


---------02:18----------
issues are um I've been thinking about


---------02:21----------
it recently for this dream and I think


---------02:23----------
to me things are like me being very


---------02:26----------
avoidant okay what happened no I'm sorry


---------02:29----------
but I was saying you were thinking about


---------02:30----------
it before stream which is why I said oh


---------02:33----------
okay yeah being very avoidant and also


---------02:37----------
like


---------02:40----------
was the other thing I can't remember


---------02:42----------
okay so I think avoidance is good enough


---------02:45----------
so let's talk about avoidance so why do


---------02:48----------
you think you're avoiding um because I


---------02:54----------
do things that are very avoidant like


---------02:55----------
I'll put things off or like


---------02:57----------
procrastinate or like just if out of


---------03:01----------
fear of conflict I won't like do certain


---------03:03----------
things


---------03:04----------
okay so procrastination fear of conflict


---------03:09----------
avoidance so why do you think so fear of


---------03:13----------
conflict sounds awfully psychological so


---------03:15----------
help me understand what you mean by like


---------03:17----------
give me an example of how you're a boy


---------03:18----------
de


---------03:23----------
like


---------03:27----------
like for example like cleaning my room


---------03:30----------
or like doing okay your room is a


---------03:31----------
[ __ ] mess I thought we talked about


---------03:33----------
that last time yeah I know I it's been


---------03:37----------
it's it's a reflection of my soul I


---------03:40----------
guess it absolutely is


---------03:41----------
you jest about that can I tell you a


---------03:43----------
story sure okay so I don't think I tell


---------03:47----------
stories often on on on Twitch on Twitch


---------03:49----------
but I do it a lot in my private practice


---------03:51----------
so when I was at the monastery of this


---------03:52----------
place called an ashram there was this


---------03:55----------
place called the quiet zone where there


---------03:57----------
was like a monk or like a Swami who


---------03:59----------
lived there and then after a couple like


---------04:03----------
so it's kind of this part of the ashram


---------04:06----------
that you're not allowed to go but after


---------04:08----------
being there for a couple of months I was


---------04:09----------
kind of invited to join a class like


---------04:12----------
they said like oh you can go and like


---------04:13----------
learn from the stood who's like you know


---------04:15----------
he's like the real deal and so I would


---------04:18----------
go out in the morning and and go to his


---------04:20----------
play his little Hut and then I noticed


---------04:22----------
that like outside of his Hut like next


---------04:25----------
to his door there was like a plate a


---------04:27----------
bowl a cup in a spoon that was leaning


---------04:30----------
against the wall and just like drying in


---------04:33----------
the Sun and so every time I went out


---------04:36----------
there there was just this like plate


---------04:37----------
outside his Hut and I was really


---------04:39----------
confused by that and so finally one day


---------04:41----------
I you know stopped being avoidant and I


---------04:44----------
asked him I was like so I have a


---------04:46----------
question it may be out of line why is


---------04:48----------
there a plate a bowl a cup in a spoon


---------04:50----------
sitting outside your door and so that he


---------04:53----------
said that yeah you know despite all of


---------04:57----------
my training unless I do my own dishes I


---------05:00----------
can't do anything that day I have to


---------05:02----------
clean my dishes and he gets like people


---------05:04----------
who bring brings him food from the


---------05:05----------
kitchen and stuff like that so he gets


---------05:06----------
all his meals prepared and delivered and


---------05:08----------
I guess he like writes and reads and


---------05:10----------
meditates all day long so he's kind of


---------05:13----------
like he's got like servants and stuff


---------05:14----------
but at the end of the day he just can't


---------05:16----------
do [ __ ] unless he like does the dishes


---------05:18----------
and I think boolie it's like if you if


---------05:21----------
you want to really get your [ __ ]


---------05:22----------
together you've got it cleans so at the


---------05:24----------
end of our conversation we're gonna do


---------05:27----------
cleaning stream you're gonna stream


---------05:28----------
you're self cleaning okay okay we're


---------05:31----------
gonna do stream cleaning stream


---------05:34----------
sounds good okay and everyone at home is


---------05:37----------
gonna do cleaning stream too and it's


---------05:39----------
gonna be the highest value content on


---------05:41----------
Twitch can I can we do that so that's


---------05:46----------
good okay and there's a very simple


---------05:49----------
principle and in yogic thinking that


---------05:51----------
like cleaning stuff cleans your mind and


---------05:55----------
thats something about like the intention


---------05:58----------
out like how focused you have to be to


---------06:00----------
clean is like you have to think but you


---------06:01----------
can't fully think like you're not fully


---------06:04----------
absorbed in it but it requires enough


---------06:06----------
mental attention to where you your


---------06:07----------
thought your mind can't spiral into


---------06:10----------
negativity when you're cleaning you just


---------06:11----------
can't do it right I feel like yeah


---------06:14----------
that's what happened last time yeah so


---------06:16----------
what happened last time tell us like I


---------06:20----------
felt really kind of peaceful yeah I was


---------06:23----------
like thinking it was definitely just


---------06:24----------
those making music while I was cleaning


---------06:25----------
yeah so we're gonna actually you know so


---------06:27----------
at the end when we do our meditation


---------06:29----------
we're gonna do two rounds of meditation


---------06:32----------
the first round of meditation is gonna


---------06:33----------
be five to seven minutes of cleaning and


---------06:34----------
I'm gonna do that too so I have a okay


---------06:40----------
so we're gonna do this so I want to show


---------06:42----------
you guys something so this is my


---------06:43----------
bookshelf and you see this you see that


---------06:46----------
pile of [ __ ] that's my [ __ ] pile I have


---------06:48----------
one two so I'm gonna clean two at the


---------06:52----------
end of stream and I'm gonna clean my


---------06:53----------
[ __ ] pile so we're all gonna do it


---------06:56----------
together okay now my camera's tilted I


---------07:00----------
should really stop doing that okay but


---------07:02----------
tell us about being avoidant what do you


---------07:07----------
mean by this is really embarrassing


---------07:09----------
but I'm gonna I'm gonna give you an


---------07:10----------
example so like recently basically I


---------07:18----------
I was kind of being avoidant in finding


---------07:21----------
a job and also because I couldn't pay my


---------07:24----------
rent and I was kind of avoiding my


---------07:25----------
landlord yeah and also asking for help


---------07:27----------
from my parents because it's


---------07:28----------
embarrassing and like I feel pretty


---------07:31----------
crappy about it yeah I was like just


---------07:32----------
happened just yesterday and it's like I


---------07:34----------
feel like I can't control myself to a


---------07:36----------
point where I can stop being avoidant


---------07:38----------
and like not let things blow up in my


---------07:39----------
face and then do something about it yeah


---------07:41----------
so first of all that does sound


---------07:44----------
embarrassing I could imagine that you


---------07:48----------
know you feel ashamed about your


---------07:50----------
situation and so thank you for sharing


---------07:52----------
and we're gonna try to help you through


---------07:54----------
that okay so let's start with so you


---------07:59----------
said you're avoiding your landlord I got


---------08:03----------
it I got it paid now but yeah I was at


---------08:05----------
the time okay and and why were you


---------08:08----------
avoiding your landlord cuz I didn't have


---------08:13----------
the money to pay for rent and I was


---------08:14----------
afraid of like him being mad and also


---------08:18----------
like if I told my parents about the


---------08:19----------
situation they could probably help me


---------08:21----------
but they would get mad right so so that


---------08:24----------
your parents would get mad yeah or like


---------08:26----------
just like kind of be they give me like a


---------08:32----------
reaction that I wouldn't be happy with


---------08:34----------
okay and what kind of reaction would


---------08:36----------
they give you like oh you need to get


---------08:40----------
your [ __ ] together you need to do this


---------08:41----------
you need to do that blah blah blah but


---------08:43----------
like I don't know that they she with


---------08:45----------
like how they seem to react is it's not


---------08:46----------
like it's always negative it doesn't


---------08:49----------
really doesn't feel constructive it's


---------08:51----------
like it's just telling me stuff that I


---------08:52----------
already know very good bullies now


---------08:58----------
you're you're starting to become


---------08:59----------
unencumbered so this is this is how we


---------09:02----------
got to slow rolling deprived so I want


---------09:03----------
all of you guys to understand that like


---------09:05----------
when you carry this emotional weight


---------09:08----------
you kind of carry it but like it


---------09:10----------
actually doesn't help you do anything


---------09:13----------
right like knowing your conflict


---------09:16----------
avoidant having conversations with


---------09:17----------
people when you carry that weight it


---------09:20----------
actually like weighs you down and like


---------09:22----------
paralyzes you further does that make


---------09:23----------
sense so we're gonna talk and try to


---------09:25----------
understand that a little bit okay


---------09:27----------
so when your parents when you have a


---------09:30----------
conversation with your parents they say


---------09:32----------
stuff like oh you need to get your [ __ ]


---------09:34----------
together right how does it make you feel


---------09:39----------
just bad it doesn't make me it doesn't


---------09:41----------
motivate me to do anything it just makes


---------09:43----------
me feel bad why do you think that is


---------09:46----------
because I know it's true and because


---------09:48----------
like it doesn't really doesn't feel


---------09:51----------
helpful yeah what what does it feel like


---------09:55----------
just like I'm being insulted all in a


---------09:58----------
way yeah and how I don't know how to say


---------10:04----------
this what would you like them to say


---------10:06----------
let's start there my mom wasn't too bad


---------10:11----------
about it yesterday but my cept I was


---------10:13----------
worse than she was just kind of more


---------10:14----------
understanding and what did she saying


---------10:21----------
well like I'm saying it was sorry and


---------10:23----------
she told me to stop saying I was sorry


---------10:25----------
and like I don't remember exactly what


---------10:28----------
she said but she wasn't really as like


---------10:30----------
mean about it


---------10:31----------
and what about your stepdad she was


---------10:34----------
pretty much just like just get like get


---------10:35----------
your [ __ ] together like saying he's like


---------10:37----------
angry with me and stuff he said he was


---------10:39----------
angry with you or he sounded angry with


---------10:41----------
you


---------10:41----------
police sounded he said he was like


---------10:44----------
frustrated or something I don't remember


---------10:46----------
the exact words okay and did he say what


---------10:49----------
was frustrating for him no I don't think


---------10:53----------
so how did you feel about yourself


---------10:57----------
like ashamed and unhappy what about


---------11:00----------
frustrated yeah yeah I'd say very


---------11:04----------
frustrated with myself too well what's


---------11:06----------
frustrating about your life right now


---------11:09----------
like I feel like I have no control and


---------11:12----------
that I'm generally pretty unhappy and


---------11:14----------
it's hard to like be able to do a lot of


---------11:17----------
things yeah I can imagine that maybe


---------11:21----------
you're frustrated with yourself because


---------11:23----------
you're not helping yourself out and you


---------11:27----------
don't know how to help yourself out of


---------11:28----------
it yeah right that's what's really hard


---------11:31----------
is like you kind of know what you should


---------11:34----------
do and it doesn't really help to hear


---------11:37----------
what you already know what you need to


---------11:39----------
hear from them is what you don't know


---------11:41----------
you don't need them to tell you that


---------11:43----------
you're not you know it's it's kind of


---------11:45----------
like unfortunate that you're not able to


---------11:46----------
pay rent like you know that you know you


---------11:49----------
need to get a job you just don't know


---------11:50----------
how to do it so it's kind of like


---------11:52----------
imagine if I went to the hospital and I


---------11:54----------
said I've been throwing up for five days


---------11:57----------
and then the doctor said well you're


---------11:59----------
throwing up for five days and then I'm


---------12:04----------
like yeah I know that already


---------12:06----------
and they're like well you got to stop


---------12:07----------
throwing up you're like well like I


---------12:10----------
can't that's why I'm here because I


---------12:12----------
can't stop throwing up they're like well


---------12:14----------
you got to stop like other people aren't


---------12:18----------
throwing up why why are you throwing up


---------12:23----------
like you look around like the people


---------12:25----------
like like you know so-and-so's kid he's


---------12:27----------
not throwing up you're like yeah I know


---------12:30----------
that they're like I don't understand why


---------12:34----------
you don't stop throwing up like that's


---------12:35----------
not that's [ __ ] not productive so I


---------12:39----------
think it's very important to understand


---------12:41----------
first of all bully is that


---------12:43----------
so you think conflict avoidance is a bad


---------12:44----------
thing


---------12:48----------
or like you think avoidance is a bad


---------12:49----------
thing right generally I'd say yeah I


---------12:54----------
mean sometimes it probably has like its


---------12:56----------
its merits but what are its merits I


---------12:59----------
mean like if some dudes like at a bar


---------13:01----------
and he's trying to like get in a fight


---------13:02----------
with you and you're probably gonna like


---------13:04----------
try and shank you or something it's


---------13:05----------
really good together absolutely so what


---------13:08----------
is your avoidance do for you


---------13:10----------
who's the guy who's the guy with the


---------13:12----------
shank what a beautiful analogy bulliest


---------13:14----------
who's shaking you right now me I guess


---------13:19----------
no I don't think so


---------13:23----------
what does it feel like when you talk to


---------13:25----------
your stepdad not good yeah it feels like


---------13:29----------
you're getting [ __ ] right I mean isn't


---------13:34----------
that what it feels like I think that's


---------13:36----------
actually a great you're getting


---------13:38----------
backstabbed yeah


---------13:40----------
with a guy who's using a dagger in Dark


---------13:42----------
Souls like it's like it's got good


---------13:44----------
backstab damage you shaken you and this


---------13:48----------
is a thing like you don't want to get


---------13:49----------
shaped like it [ __ ] sucks


---------13:54----------
so I think this is really important to


---------13:56----------
understand like you say you're avoidant


---------13:57----------
and you make that sound like it's a


---------13:59----------
problem right like do you think being


---------14:03----------
avoidant is a problem not always but I


---------14:07----------
think for me yeah why is it a problem


---------14:10----------
for you because it causes me to avoid


---------14:14----------
things that I probably shouldn't be


---------14:15----------
avoiding okay so that makes sense but


---------14:18----------
what does avoidance to do for you so if


---------14:22----------
there's something that you should do I


---------14:23----------
want everybody to understand this that


---------14:25----------
the reason that our mind does things is


---------14:28----------
not because it's shitty for us like


---------14:30----------
that's not why that's not how our mind


---------14:32----------
works our mind does stupid things


---------14:35----------
because it actually helps us


---------14:37----------
select having this conversation with


---------14:39----------
your stepdad how does that help you


---------14:43----------
it doesn't absolutely


---------14:46----------
so that's important to understand right


---------14:48----------
like we have this we don't actually stop


---------14:51----------
and think about what we're avoiding and


---------14:53----------
why we're avoiding it like you were you


---------14:56----------
kind of you're avoidant you need to have


---------14:57----------
a conversation with your parents and I


---------15:00----------
guess presumably like the main reason is


---------15:02----------
because you need to come up with money


---------15:04----------
for rent yeah and but at the end of the


---------15:07----------
day like the reason that you're avoidant


---------15:09----------
is because when you have conversations


---------15:11----------
they actually don't really help you they


---------15:13----------
like they're painful so it's like you


---------15:16----------
know if I'm if I'm cooking and I put


---------15:21----------
like my hand on my cast-iron skillet and


---------15:24----------
I get burned and then I don't do that


---------15:27----------
again like we don't call that avoidant


---------15:28----------
we just call that smart right and so


---------15:32----------
when you're like avoiding conversation


---------15:33----------
with your stepdad because he [ __ ]


---------15:35----------
shanks you when you talk to him like


---------15:39----------
sure that's a voice but it's also


---------15:41----------
protective so this is this is the other


---------15:44----------
word that I want us to start thinking a


---------15:46----------
little bit about is that avoidances is


---------15:50----------
being protective like there's a part of


---------15:52----------
you that's actually trying to protect


---------15:54----------
yourself from like getting shanked so


---------15:57----------
then the question becomes like bully us


---------15:59----------
how do we like if we want to stop being


---------16:02----------
avoidant what that means is that I just


---------16:06----------
run with me okay this is gonna be kind


---------16:07----------
of weird cuz I'm gonna like do a hop


---------16:09----------
skip and a jump what that means is that


---------16:10----------
I want to stop being protective


---------16:13----------
okay okay does that make sense you with


---------16:15----------
me so far so how do you think it is and


---------16:18----------
this is super abstract and weird how do


---------16:20----------
you think it is that you stop being


---------16:21----------
protective


---------16:23----------
you make yourself more vulnerable yeah


---------16:27----------
well okay so I'm gonna use another


---------16:30----------
analogy okay so when you're in Dark


---------16:33----------
Souls when do you have your shield up


---------16:37----------
when I mean I usually don't use the


---------16:40----------
shield but okay so your your when


---------16:43----------
somebody's shooting an arrow at you then


---------16:44----------
yeah right so like when you're in a


---------16:46----------
dangerous place so like the key to


---------16:48----------
becoming like to letting letting your


---------16:50----------
protections down is like actually not


---------16:52----------
being in danger like you don't need to


---------16:55----------
be protective if there's no danger


---------16:58----------
right and so then the question becomes


---------17:00----------
like why do you like where does the


---------17:02----------
danger come from because if we can


---------17:03----------
understand why you feel the danger and


---------17:05----------
we can help you feel safe then you don't


---------17:09----------
need to be protective anymore


---------17:11----------
right it's kind of like you know like


---------17:13----------
like when you're out in the world and


---------17:15----------
you're like armed and stuff but like


---------17:17----------
when you enter town like you put your


---------17:19----------
sword away and you put your shield away


---------17:20----------
and you're like talking to people and


---------17:21----------
buying and selling stuff and it's like


---------17:23----------
it's not a dangerous place right there's


---------17:25----------
like town and there's the real world and


---------17:26----------
so if we can understand what it is that


---------17:29----------
makes you feel unsafe and we can


---------17:32----------
actually quiet that part of you if we


---------17:34----------
can quiet you're avoiding the experience


---------17:37----------
of some kind of negative emotion right


---------17:38----------
but if we can address that negative


---------17:41----------
emotion then you no longer need to be


---------17:43----------
avoided so I don't think that the


---------17:45----------
solution to avoidance and this is what a


---------17:47----------
lot of people think is like you just try


---------17:49----------
to willpower your way through it


---------17:50----------
you're like oh [ __ ] like I have to have


---------17:52----------
this conversation why don't I just


---------17:54----------
[ __ ] have this conversation has to


---------17:55----------
happen sometime why don't I just do it


---------17:57----------
now work it doesn't work


---------17:58----------
absolutely


---------18:02----------
right


---------18:04----------
some things we have to we have to take


---------18:06----------
away the thing which makes you be


---------18:07----------
avoidant and then you won't be avoided


---------18:10----------
overcoming avoidance is a completely


---------18:12----------
different thing which we can talk about


---------18:13----------
like in terms of brute force different


---------18:16----------
part of your brain what I'm talking


---------18:17----------
about is sort of like emotionally


---------18:18----------
processing the reason that you're being


---------18:20----------
avoided in the first place so why are


---------18:23----------
you of being avoided in the first place


---------18:26----------
like of my parents yeah cuz I feel like


---------18:30----------
they're they can be pretty negative in


---------18:34----------
like ways or like hurt me through like


---------18:36----------
words they're just making me feel like


---------18:38----------
garbage yeah and why do you feel like


---------18:40----------
garbage like because the things they say


---------18:47----------
to me yeah and what do they say


---------18:51----------
like they just criticize me a lot okay I


---------18:55----------
don't know like specific examples okay


---------19:01----------
can you help me understand what kind of


---------19:03----------
criticisms like I need to like grow up


---------19:13----------
or I guess that's one or that start to


---------19:20----------
think of like what exactly they say I


---------19:22----------
think I tried not to take like mental


---------19:24----------
note of it yeah try to block it out


---------19:27----------
right so you're holding your shield up


---------19:31----------
and then you can't see it's protective


---------19:34----------
it's like you're going into like turtle


---------19:36----------
mode and why do you think what they say


---------19:43----------
is so hurtful like what hurts about what


---------19:44----------
they say like cuz they're like my family


---------19:50----------
okay and like I care about what they


---------19:53----------
think


---------19:54----------
because I'm assuming like there's some


---------19:56----------
truth to it I think do you think there's


---------19:58----------
truth to it somewhat I mean I'm not


---------20:02----------
really sure but I think possibly what do


---------20:06----------
you think is I don't go ahead sorry like


---------20:10----------
I don't think I'm super happy with like


---------20:11----------
myself and like I don't think I'm


---------20:13----------
perfect all the time so I think there's


---------20:15----------
like gasps some truth to it yeah do you


---------20:19----------
think that what do you think hurts more


---------20:22----------
the stuff that they're they're right


---------20:24----------
about that or the stuff that they're


---------20:25----------
wrong about I'd say for me probably the


---------20:35----------
stuff that they're wrong about so I feel


---------20:37----------
like they don't understand me what don't


---------20:40----------
they understand about you like I feel


---------20:44----------
like their perception of me is that I


---------20:45----------
just don't care about like all my issues


---------20:47----------
or anything and I'm not trying to do


---------20:48----------
anything to make it any better but like


---------20:50----------
I am like everyday so it's just it


---------20:53----------
bothers me that they like think I just I


---------20:55----------
just don't care when I do when they do a


---------20:57----------
lot it sounds like you're you're


---------21:01----------
actually working really hard to change


---------21:03----------
your situation and that they're not even


---------21:07----------
I don't know if I really am like I don't


---------21:10----------
know if I can give myself enough credit


---------21:11----------
to say that I am but I write ooh hmm


---------21:17----------
what do you think you deserve credit for


---------21:21----------
at least trying are you trying I'd say


---------21:28----------
so I mean I don't want to feel like crap


---------21:31----------
every day yeah so what are you doing


---------21:33----------
what is trying to look like


---------21:39----------
like going to therapy and like I got a


---------21:45----------
job the other day and stuff so I guess


---------21:48----------
that's like some progress yeah I've been


---------21:53----------
getting a job to me sounds like a lot of


---------21:54----------
progress yeah how do you feel about the


---------21:58----------
job well I feel pretty good I was pretty


---------22:01----------
happy about it when I got it so how do


---------22:03----------
you feel now I feel okay I mean I'm kind


---------22:10----------
of anxious about the job because I


---------22:11----------
haven't started yet so I'm like I don't


---------22:13----------
know how it's gonna go but yeah it'll be


---------22:16----------
it'll be good so I'll try it out


---------22:20----------
so I bully us I think it can be really


---------22:23----------
hard when you turn to someone for help


---------22:26----------
and they don't how can I say this they


---------22:33----------
kind of just address you like a symptom


---------22:35----------
right so they kind of look at you and


---------22:37----------
they say like oh you got to grow up


---------22:38----------
because you don't you're not doing X Y &


---------22:40----------
Z and they don't really understand like


---------22:41----------
the root of it yeah you know um does


---------22:47----------
that make sense to you yeah what did you


---------22:51----------
understand from what I said like there's


---------22:56----------
more to like they see just the problem


---------22:59----------
they don't see like the cause of the


---------23:00----------
problem yeah and then when they start


---------23:03----------
talking so I think the challenge here is


---------23:05----------
that like when someone just sees the


---------23:08----------
problem and not the cause of the problem


---------23:10----------
the way in which they talk to you


---------23:12----------
doesn't connect right because they're


---------23:15----------
just talking they're not really like


---------23:17----------
talking about like what your experience


---------23:19----------
is like they're not talking about the


---------23:21----------
whole picture they're just talking about


---------23:22----------
one piece right and and so they're


---------23:26----------
they're sort of like turning you into


---------23:28----------
just like one version like they're


---------23:31----------
turning you into a caricature of who you


---------23:33----------
are


---------23:34----------
right yeah so what do you think your


---------23:36----------
what do you think it is that they're not


---------23:38----------
seeing like that that I that I'm trying


---------23:43----------
or that like it's it's really hard for


---------23:45----------
me like I feel like their their


---------23:47----------
mentality towards it it's like so just


---------23:49----------
wholly different from mine and what are


---------23:52----------
they doing sir stand like you can't it's


---------23:57----------
it's it's it's like a lot more too


---------23:59----------
complicated than like just grow up 4head


---------24:01----------
like all that it's it's more complicated


---------24:06----------
than they make it seem yeah


---------24:08----------
so what are the complications that


---------24:09----------
they're missing like it's hard for me to


---------24:16----------
do like the things that I need to do


---------24:18----------
regardless of like all of that yeah what


---------24:24----------
makes it hard do the things that you


---------24:26----------
need to do like how I feel about myself


---------24:30----------
for like my um like just there's a lot I


---------24:36----------
mean yeah if it feels like a lot so ah


---------24:42----------
very important hold on a second so so I


---------24:46----------
asked you what makes it hard and what


---------24:48----------
didn't you say it feels like a lot it's


---------24:52----------
overwhelming yeah so you said first how


---------24:54----------
you feel about yourself right that's the


---------24:57----------
first thing you said and then you were


---------25:00----------
like trying to come up with other things


---------25:01----------
and then you said it feels like a lot so


---------25:06----------
I think we have to be very clear to


---------25:08----------
understand that there's a difference


---------25:11----------
between a lot of things getting in the


---------25:13----------
way and one really big thing getting in


---------25:16----------
the way because I think that gives us a


---------25:19----------
way forward so sometimes bulliest


---------25:23----------
despite your best efforts your mind


---------25:25----------
actually tells you what's going on


---------25:28----------
and what it's telling me is that the the


---------25:30----------
root of this is is the way that you feel


---------25:33----------
about yourself and that like when it's


---------25:38----------
conversations that there there are


---------25:40----------
things that you fear about who you are


---------25:43----------
and when you go to your landlord and you


---------25:47----------
say I don't have rent for the month the


---------25:49----------
things that you fear about yourself to


---------25:51----------
become true when you talk to your mom


---------25:55----------
and you keep apologizing you're


---------25:58----------
apologizing because there's a part of


---------26:00----------
you that is becoming true the part of


---------26:02----------
you that you're terrified of and the


---------26:05----------
reason you hate talking to your stepdad


---------26:06----------
is because he takes that part of you


---------26:09----------
that you're that you don't like about


---------26:10----------
yourself and he sticks your nose in it


---------26:12----------
and that feels like a shank


---------26:17----------
and as long as that thing is there


---------26:19----------
you're gonna need your shield up


---------26:22----------
you're gonna need to be avoided because


---------26:25----------
that [ __ ] hurts


---------26:29----------
so tell me what's that part of yourself


---------26:31----------
what is that you're who is it that you


---------26:35----------
don't want to be


---------26:37----------
like


---------26:40----------
I want to be able to be true to my word


---------26:41----------
and like be responsible okay you want to


---------26:44----------
be true to your word and you want to be


---------26:46----------
responsible yeah okay


---------26:53----------
what is being responsible mean


---------27:04----------
like doing the right thing despite it


---------27:07----------
being hard


---------27:09----------
okay I know and okay Tribeca that that's


---------27:12----------
a that's a way better answer than I


---------27:14----------
could I could didn't understand what the


---------27:15----------
[ __ ] that meant I couldn't define it but


---------27:17----------
I think that's a brilliant answer doing


---------27:19----------
the right thing when it's hard that's


---------27:21----------
from the mouth of a slow-rolling


---------27:23----------
deprived you know I always assumed that


---------27:24----------
deprives couldn't speak for some reason


---------27:26----------
like if it's in my mind like they don't


---------27:29----------
know they're not capable of speech but


---------27:30----------
anyway so I think truth we can get


---------27:32----------
behind so I think that you know bully us


---------27:37----------
we have a lot of ideas around like


---------27:39----------
psychology and we kind of have this idea


---------27:41----------
that if you're avoidant you have some


---------27:43----------
kind of emotion like my ideas I mean I


---------27:45----------
promote this kind of stuff that like you


---------27:47----------
know if you solve that emotion or you


---------27:48----------
process that emotion like life is gonna


---------27:50----------
be easier for you but I want to talk


---------27:51----------
about a different vein right now I want


---------27:53----------
to talk about truth so in ancient India


---------27:57----------
the path to enlightenment began with to


---------28:01----------
two steps the first was personal


---------28:03----------
observances in the second was societal


---------28:05----------
observances so societal observances are


---------28:08----------
things like cleanliness


---------28:09----------
and personal observances or things like


---------28:12----------
satya or truth and i think that there is


---------28:15----------
what they believed that there is power


---------28:17----------
in truth and that's not something that I


---------28:20----------
like really understood like I don't know


---------28:21----------
even know what that means kind of like


---------28:23----------
do you know what that means like do you


---------28:24----------
think there's power and truth I think so


---------28:28----------
what is that even since you're good with


---------28:30----------
words what is it what the [ __ ] does that


---------28:32----------
even mean


---------28:33----------
you


---------28:36----------
I think there's like power in being


---------28:37----------
genuine and like being yourself and it


---------28:39----------
makes you feel a lot better and like


---------28:42----------
also it kind of


---------28:44----------
validates you in a way okay and I feel


---------28:46----------
like if you're a lot more honest about


---------28:47----------
things and people can't really like I


---------28:50----------
don't think there's anybody in the world


---------28:51----------
that has like really terrible intentions


---------28:53----------
really and if you're honest about things


---------28:55----------
in it kind of validates you in a way


---------28:57----------
okay so weird per spec it is it so then


---------29:01----------
help me understand if that's true why is


---------29:04----------
it hard to have a conversation with your


---------29:05----------
landlord


---------29:09----------
because it makes me admit things that I


---------29:11----------
don't like or that I embarrass it okay


---------29:14----------
so but how does that weigh against this


---------29:18----------
power of truth that you're talking about


---------29:22----------
[Music]


---------29:24----------
I guess I don't want to experience like


---------29:26----------
negative emotion but what is truth have


---------29:29----------
to do with that


---------29:37----------
not sure fantastic nor should you be


---------29:39----------
right because I think this is a concept


---------29:41----------
that's become lost so we have this


---------29:43----------
instinctive idea and I think you're


---------29:45----------
right that truth truthfulness has power


---------29:46----------
the problem is that like we don't


---------29:48----------
understand how to fit this idea of the


---------29:51----------
the power of truthfulness in with our


---------29:55----------
daily lives like we don't know like what


---------29:58----------
that really means like everyone sort of


---------30:00----------
instinctively is like yeah that sounds


---------30:02----------
like a [ __ ] you know it sounds like


---------30:03----------
if you're a paladin like you can do some


---------30:05----------
cool [ __ ] and that depends on truth so


---------30:07----------
like yeah there's something there but we


---------30:10----------
don't really know like we don't know


---------30:12----------
right because we don't talk about this


---------30:13----------
stuff anymore we teach mathematics we


---------30:15----------
teach economics we don't teach about


---------30:16----------
truth and lying and what those do to us


---------30:19----------
like we we just talk about psychology


---------30:21----------
and emotions so I want you to think


---------30:24----------
about something beliefs what do you


---------30:26----------
think would happen like so let's say


---------30:27----------
that like I cursed you and you were


---------30:29----------
unable to lie do you think what do you


---------30:33----------
think would happen to your life probably


---------30:36----------
improve why because I I lied a lot


---------30:42----------
growing up in it kind of just


---------30:45----------
and made things worse a lot of the time


---------30:46----------
like making them better


---------30:49----------
because like you kind of lose your sense


---------30:52----------
of self and you're like flies become


---------30:54----------
truth in a weird way and also like


---------31:03----------
it just it feels a lot better to tell


---------31:05----------
the truth okay now I'm a little bit


---------31:09----------
confused because earlier you were saying


---------31:10----------
that like it hurts to tell people the


---------31:12----------
truth you're avoiding it and you were


---------31:14----------
also saying that when you lie you become


---------31:18----------
you said something about like that's


---------31:19----------
like you become like the lie becomes the


---------31:21----------
truth


---------31:23----------
yeah like it it's hard to explain you're


---------31:27----------
doing a good job but I agree so I'm


---------31:30----------
gonna toss something out there I think


---------31:34----------
the part of yourself that you're afraid


---------31:36----------
of grows every time you lie and it


---------31:40----------
becomes more and more true every time


---------31:42----------
you give in to that avoidance


---------31:47----------
right that there's a part of yourself


---------31:49----------
that you think is shitty


---------31:50----------
you're afraid that you're shitty but


---------31:54----------
that every time you lie and every time


---------31:56----------
you're avoidant you make that more true


---------32:00----------
what do you think about that suits


---------32:01----------
accurate I'd say that's accurate yeah


---------32:07----------
so what do we do bullies


---------32:14----------
okay we'll see if twitch chat has any


---------32:17----------
ideas but I I think it starts with


---------32:19----------
truthfulness so I think you can get an


---------32:23----------
immense amount of power over Sofia and


---------32:26----------
so I have an exercise for you bully us


---------32:29----------
and everyone at home I want you to see


---------32:31----------
how long you can go without telling a


---------32:34----------
lie okay how long do you think you can


---------32:38----------
go at least a day okay I don't know


---------32:46----------
because there's like subtle subtle lies


---------32:49----------
like half-truths I don't know they can


---------32:51----------
be very complicated absolutely


---------32:53----------
good good so this exercise is gonna be


---------33:00----------
very important for you bullies because


---------33:03----------
what you're already recognizing is that


---------33:05----------
there there's a certain machinery to


---------33:09----------
your actions and words that I don't


---------33:12----------
think you're aware of but if you start


---------33:15----------
looking at the lens of lying and truth


---------33:17----------
you'll begin to see these little things


---------33:20----------
they're like little beetles like


---------33:22----------
crawling around and shaping what you say


---------33:24----------
in what you do and you're not even aware


---------33:25----------
of what they're doing they're they're


---------33:27----------
subtle eyes they're half-truths there's


---------33:30----------
like not just lying to your landlord but


---------33:32----------
like leaving the house when you're not


---------33:34----------
gonna see them there's pretending to not


---------33:37----------
be at home and all these other like


---------33:38----------
little things


---------33:39----------
now pretend that all of that was off the


---------33:41----------
table what would happen in your life I


---------33:47----------
think I'd probably be less stressed


---------33:49----------
about like like worried about stuff like


---------33:53----------
that how the [ __ ] does that work like I


---------33:59----------
thought the whole point of lying is to


---------34:01----------
protect you right yeah so this is the


---------34:05----------
other important thing to understand


---------34:06----------
lying is about control why do you lie


---------34:10----------
like what do you control like the other


---------34:15----------
person's perception absolutely


---------34:18----------
this needs to be understood very very


---------34:20----------
deeply when you lie it is to control


---------34:22----------
another human being right yeah how does


---------34:30----------
that work I mean how well does that work


---------34:34----------
let me put it that way


---------34:36----------
it depends mm-hmm good answer has it


---------34:42----------
worked out for you so far absolutely


---------34:47----------
right so we think and in some cases


---------34:51----------
lying does work really well but for the


---------34:55----------
most part it [ __ ] us like you have to


---------34:58----------
understand that like lying is your


---------35:00----------
attempt to control another human being


---------35:02----------
that's exactly what it is nothing more


---------35:03----------
nothing less


---------35:04----------
and so your problem Bulli is is that you


---------35:08----------
are living trying to control your


---------35:10----------
environment you're like trying to


---------35:11----------
control when the Sun rises and when the


---------35:13----------
moon rises instead of controlling like


---------35:15----------
what you do your life is based on what


---------35:19----------
is avoidance avoidance is all about the


---------35:21----------
other person it's all about preventing


---------35:24----------
someone from like saying or doing


---------35:26----------
something to you the reason you're stuck


---------35:30----------
is because your locus of control like


---------35:33----------
what you're trying to do is like you're


---------35:34----------
you're hitting like the what was on your


---------35:37----------
keyboard and you're trying to control an


---------35:39----------
NPC you're like when I hit spacebar why


---------35:45----------
doesn't the fire keeper roll like this


---------35:50----------
is something that really needs to be


---------35:52----------
understood so much of your effort is


---------35:54----------
spent on controlling and external human


---------35:57----------
being and it's [ __ ] inefficient it's


---------36:00----------
just inefficient it feels good sure


---------36:03----------
there are emotions but you just got to


---------36:04----------
understand you're expending so much


---------36:06----------
effort the reason your stock is because


---------36:08----------
your brain you're a smart guy I can tell


---------36:09----------
you're a smart guy I think like


---------36:11----------
sometimes when the stars align you can


---------36:14----------
do amazing things I already know that


---------36:15----------
and the difference is with this when the


---------36:18----------
stars align you stop focusing on others


---------36:20----------
and you start focusing on yourself


---------36:23----------
like cleaning your room is not about


---------36:25----------
other people who's it about me


---------36:28----------
absolutely and when you start doing


---------36:31----------
things for yourself then like your life


---------36:35----------
is gonna start changing in Sathya is


---------36:39----------
about this Sathya is about the real


---------36:41----------
power of sathya comes when I stop lying


---------36:43----------
I stop trying to control other people's


---------36:46----------
actions so when I stop trying to control


---------36:49----------
other people's actions do I surrender or


---------36:53----------
do I gain freedom


---------36:54----------
bleus what do you think freedom how do I


---------36:59----------
not surrender I mean you surrender like


---------37:04----------
your control I guess yes and that gives


---------37:08----------
you freedom we think about freedom and


---------37:11----------
surrender is opposite ends of the


---------37:13----------
spectrum they're actually the same thing


---------37:14----------
that when you surrender your ability to


---------37:18----------
control another human being you gain


---------37:20----------
freedom give you guys a classic example


---------37:23----------
I like a girl I want to ask girl out


---------37:26----------
I'm afraid girl doesn't like me let me


---------37:29----------
do things to control the way that she


---------37:31----------
thinks about me let me lie about my


---------37:33----------
income let me lie about my past and let


---------37:36----------
me lie about my job and if I do these


---------37:39----------
things


---------37:40----------
girl will say yes when I ask her out and


---------37:43----------
every time you say one of those lies


---------37:46----------
like do you think that person how do you


---------37:48----------
think that person feels when they


---------37:50----------
construct this story to impress said


---------37:53----------
girl like Jenny


---------37:56----------
yeah they feel trapped


---------38:00----------
that's what lies do to you they trap you


---------38:03----------
like when you're avoiding your your


---------38:06----------
parents and you're avoiding your


---------38:07----------
landlord you're [ __ ] trapped you feel


---------38:09----------
powerless and that's a prison that you


---------38:12----------
make yourself with your words mm-hmm


---------38:16----------
so it starts there's an immense amount


---------38:19----------
of power if you want to transform your


---------38:20----------
life speak truthfulness


---------38:23----------
because a funny thing happens if you


---------38:24----------
commit to being true your actions must


---------38:29----------
change right so if you take lying off


---------38:32----------
the table like what happens to your


---------38:33----------
actions become like in the open yeah and


---------38:38----------
like how do you think they change like


---------38:43----------
you probably care more or it's like you


---------38:45----------
probably if you're honest about it then


---------38:47----------
it probably is like more like prevalent


---------38:51----------
you're like okay this is probably


---------38:52----------
changed absolutely right so what's an


---------38:55----------
example of that this needs to change cuz


---------38:58----------
I can't lie about it anymore


---------39:00----------
like what's an example of that like what


---------39:07----------
did you have for lunch a salad or a


---------39:09----------
hamburger it's that simple if I can't


---------39:14----------
lie if I commit to not lying about what


---------39:15----------
I had for lunch I'm gonna start eating


---------39:17----------
healthy is all those times that you're


---------39:19----------
embarrassed about what you ate you


---------39:21----------
[ __ ] lie about it like why do you lie


---------39:22----------
about it because you don't want other


---------39:24----------
people to think that you're a [ __ ]


---------39:25----------
fatty right and if you stop lying about


---------39:30----------
it then you just start eating healthy I


---------39:31----------
know it sounds absolutely insane it


---------39:35----------
sounds absolutely insane is is fixing


---------39:39----------
your diet as simple as not lying and so


---------39:42----------
I challenge you to try it see how long


---------39:45----------
you can go see how long you can go and


---------39:50----------
then what happens bulliest is when you


---------39:53----------
see how long you can go you see how your


---------39:55----------
life changes you see like so like you


---------39:59----------
want to go a day without lying okay fine


---------40:01----------
let's see it can you go two days like


---------40:04----------
why can't you go two days I'm just I'm


---------40:07----------
not sure I know you're not sure but what


---------40:10----------
why do why are you gonna lie what do you


---------40:12----------
need a lie about well I don't know what


---------40:15----------
I'm good right so when you say you need


---------40:19----------
to lie what do you what is it what are


---------40:21----------
the kinds of things that you're going to


---------40:22----------
need to lie about why would you lie


---------40:26----------
well I don't know I don't know it I


---------40:28----------
don't think I would live it it's just


---------40:30----------
yeah you're gonna lie and you're gonna


---------40:32----------
lie when you need someone to think


---------40:33----------
something about you right right that's


---------40:37----------
when you're gonna lie and when you need


---------40:40----------
someone to think something about you


---------40:42----------
that's when you that's when the [ __ ]


---------40:44----------
starts that's when you're screwed


---------40:48----------
because then you are letting that


---------40:50----------
person's perceptions of you control the


---------40:52----------
person that you are in the way that you


---------40:54----------
feel about yourself


---------40:55----------
so Satya is where it begins truthfulness


---------40:59----------
when we talk about psychology continue


---------41:02----------
seeing your therapist fantastic go get


---------41:05----------
some real mental health treatment and in


---------41:07----------
the meantime like try truthfulness


---------41:10----------
okay questions thoughts


---------41:13----------
[Music]


---------41:17----------
Oh me yeah I don't have any virgin


---------41:22----------
things okay what do you think about what


---------41:26----------
we're talking about how do you feel


---------41:27----------
about it pretty good about it


---------41:30----------
so always been trying to be more genuine


---------41:32----------
so it's like


---------41:35----------
makes sense seems like actually a reason


---------41:38----------
- yes a reason to be genuine yeah so


---------41:42----------
this is like this is the hard thing


---------41:43----------
beliefs to be honest like this is tricky


---------41:44----------
because you know we have all these


---------41:46----------
platitudes of like yeah you should be


---------41:47----------
truthful but no like you should


---------41:49----------
understand understand the benefits of


---------41:52----------
truthfulness and understand the benefits


---------41:53----------
of line


---------41:55----------
and then you pick you try them both out


---------41:57----------
in your life like you take a you take a


---------41:59----------
bite of vanilla and you take a bite of


---------42:01----------
chocolate like when you're trying out


---------42:03----------
your ice cream what you taste both and


---------42:05----------
then you decide for yourself which one


---------42:07----------
you want I think right now the biggest


---------42:09----------
problem is that you're operating on


---------42:10----------
reflex and I think you've you've said a


---------42:12----------
lot of really important and profound


---------42:13----------
things today


---------42:15----------
III think you've you've said that you


---------42:18----------
know the one of the best things that I


---------42:19----------
like about what you said which I'm gonna


---------42:21----------
you know steal and use on stream is


---------42:23----------
gonna be this whole thing about when you


---------42:25----------
lie to other people if there's like a


---------42:27----------
part of that lie that becomes the truth


---------42:30----------
that I think is really powerful and


---------42:32----------
every time you lie you like propagate


---------42:34----------
this idea of like who you are mm-hmm and


---------42:39----------
and I think this avoidance and stuff


---------42:41----------
just start telling the truth and then if


---------42:43----------
you really commit to that and you see


---------42:45----------
how long you can go and I'm not saying


---------42:47----------
you can't ever lie again


---------42:48----------
like a commitment really doesn't work


---------42:50----------
but you just see how long you can go and


---------42:53----------
then for the if you can lie if you can


---------42:55----------
stop lying for one day that's gonna be a


---------42:58----------
good day


---------43:01----------
questions yeah thoughts feelings


---------43:04----------
[Music]


---------43:09----------
I'm like I'm like thinking a weird like


---------43:12----------
is joking like lying in a way good what


---------43:16----------
do you think kind of yes and no


---------43:25----------
so weird half-baked thought no it's not


---------43:27----------
a half-baked dot I think what you're


---------43:28----------
trying to do is figure out what kind of


---------43:30----------
Lies you're allowed to tell because I


---------43:32----------
think you're a very good liar


---------43:35----------
unfortunately yeah


---------43:37----------
right so so even now you see what's


---------43:40----------
happening in your mind is you're trying


---------43:42----------
to figure out how you can protect


---------43:43----------
yourself and still fulfill the criteria


---------43:45----------
of the thing that's what's happened well


---------43:49----------
it's more like I don't I don't want to


---------43:50----------
mess it up so I don't want to like do


---------43:51----------
the wrong thing


---------43:52----------
yes so the wrong thing is to lie right


---------43:59----------
yeah yeah and so you know what that is


---------44:01----------
it's not that complicated you know what


---------44:04----------
I mean and you're looking for a


---------44:06----------
workaround because that's how addicted


---------44:08----------
you are to like lying and hiding and


---------44:10----------
being avoided like what I'm doing is I'm


---------44:13----------
taking your I'm D equipping your armor


---------44:15----------
and your shield and then you're like


---------44:18----------
well can I wear a loincloth like can I


---------44:21----------
at least get a little bit of armor like


---------44:22----------
nope no alone clock not allowed to wear


---------44:26----------
anything that's what you're doing like


---------44:28----------
Oh what about a joke what about like an


---------44:30----------
emotion what about a half-truth I mean


---------44:34----------
sure you can can call whatever we want


---------44:36----------
you want to but if you find a good way a


---------44:38----------
clever way to lie without lying and I


---------44:41----------
think we can talk about that one day cuz


---------44:42----------
I think that actually has its its


---------44:43----------
purpose you guys want to do story time


---------44:46----------
I'll tell you guys a story about that um


---------44:49----------
but I think I mean that I think you know


---------44:54----------
right and like you don't hear this story


---------44:57----------
huh I want to hear this story though


---------45:00----------
okay so my mom once told me something


---------45:04----------
very profound which is so there are two


---------45:08----------
incarnations of this guy named Vishnu so


---------45:10----------
Vishnu is one of the Hindu gods and


---------45:12----------
Vishnu is sort of like the God that


---------45:14----------
helps out humanity and so when evil is


---------45:18----------
like very powerful in the world he


---------45:20----------
incarnate s' and then tries to deal with


---------45:23----------
the evil and so in one of his are


---------45:27----------
incarnations is this guy named Krishna


---------45:29----------
and Krishna is kind of a shady [ __ ] so


---------45:32----------
I'll give you guys just an example of a


---------45:34----------
story that that Krishna did so there's a


---------45:39----------
civil war going on in India between two


---------45:41----------
sets of cousins and the story of the


---------45:44----------
Civil War is something called the


---------45:45----------
Mahabharata but one set of cousins is


---------45:47----------
called the Pandavas they're the good


---------45:48----------
guys another set of cousins is called


---------45:51----------
the goat OVAs and they're the bad guys


---------45:53----------
so Krishna one day they're there let me


---------45:58----------
just think about which story to tell you


---------46:00----------
so one day they're Christian who knows


---------46:03----------
that there's going to be an eclipse and


---------46:05----------
there's a code of war that people follow


---------46:07----------
so they fight from dawn till dusk and


---------46:09----------
like between dusk and dawn they're not


---------46:12----------
allowed to fight so what Krishna does is


---------46:14----------
he goes to his the bond of Oz which are


---------46:16----------
supposedly the good guys of the story


---------46:17----------
and he says that okay like around 3 or 4


---------46:20----------
p.m. like you guys aren't gonna they


---------46:22----------
didn't have watches and stuff back then


---------46:23----------
but it's gonna look like the Sun is


---------46:25----------
going down and dusk is gonna happen


---------46:26----------
sooner than you think it is so what I


---------46:29----------
want you guys to do is stop fighting for


---------46:34----------
like 5 or 10 minutes


---------46:35----------
and then like the Kauravas your enemies


---------46:38----------
will stop fighting - because everyone is


---------46:39----------
gonna think it's dusk and then once they


---------46:41----------
put their weapons away and the ones that


---------46:43----------
are retreating off the field of battle I


---------46:44----------
want you guys to pull out your weapons


---------46:46----------
and attack


---------46:47----------
and so the the bond of us are like but


---------46:51----------
isn't i'm confused like aren't we


---------46:53----------
supposed to like stop attacking after


---------46:54----------
dusk and the Christian is like no no man


---------46:57----------
and like it's okay trust me like you're


---------46:58----------
not gonna be breaking any rules it's


---------46:59----------
gonna seem like you're breaking rules


---------47:00----------
but you're not gonna break any rules so


---------47:03----------
the bond of us say okay so they go onto


---------47:05----------
the field of battle and sure enough the


---------47:08----------
Eclipse happens and so like everyone


---------47:12----------
thinks it's getting dark and so people


---------47:14----------
put their weapons away and they stop


---------47:15----------
fighting and then the Kauravas kind of


---------47:17----------
turned around and they start to leave


---------47:18----------
the field of battle and what do you


---------47:20----------
think the bond of Oz do they do the same


---------47:24----------
thing leave the field of battle I hope


---------47:27----------
so yeah they do the opposite they listen


---------47:30----------
to Krishna


---------47:31----------
they pull out their weapons and they


---------47:33----------
Massacre people who are leaving the


---------47:35----------
field of battle and unarmed mm sounds


---------47:39----------
immoral right like is that a lie is that


---------47:43----------
truth what do you think yeah right feels


---------47:52----------
immoral so I'm gonna tell you another


---------47:54----------
story so a couple thousand years and


---------47:56----------
maybe a thousand years before Krishna


---------47:58----------
vishnu decided to incarnated like before


---------48:00----------
that and he came down as a guy named ROM


---------48:02----------
and ROM is sort of like this kind of


---------48:05----------
like ideal human and so ROM story is


---------48:08----------
kind of interesting so he gets married


---------48:10----------
to this this princess named Sita and


---------48:12----------
there's an evil king who is like lustful


---------48:15----------
towards even he like really wants her


---------48:16----------
and is disappointed that she chooses to


---------48:19----------
marry rom and so what what this evil


---------48:22----------
king his name is Robin you've fallen me


---------48:24----------
so far yeah okay so what Robin does is


---------48:27----------
he abducts her he kidnaps her and he


---------48:29----------
takes her to his his palace which is on


---------48:31----------
an island called Lanka if you guys know


---------48:33----------
where Sri Lanka is it's like a little


---------48:35----------
island south of India so he abduct Sita


---------48:38----------
and he takes her down there and then ROM


---------48:40----------
says okay I'm gonna you know I'm gonna


---------48:42----------
have to get her back so he raises an


---------48:43----------
army and over the course of a year or


---------48:45----------
two he fights against Robin kills Robin


---------48:48----------
rescue Sita brings her back to his


---------48:51----------
brings her back to his court and is kind


---------48:54----------
of frustrated because like his court


---------48:56----------
sort of doesn't accept her anymore


---------48:58----------
they're like yeah


---------49:00----------
like yeah I know she was kidnapped but


---------49:01----------
she was like in his house for like over


---------49:03----------
a year and like how do you know she was


---------49:05----------
faithful and like we don't she's kind of


---------49:07----------
tainted they're sort of very puritanical


---------49:09----------
back then and so what do you think ROM


---------49:12----------
does I don't know okay let's see if it's


---------49:24----------
twitch at things what do you guys think


---------49:26----------
he does


---------49:29----------
okay so kills the cork pops okay so ROM


---------49:38----------
actually decides to divorce her and he


---------49:40----------
says that my first duty is to the


---------49:41----------
kingdom and if the court won't accept


---------49:45----------
her as like a queen and like they think


---------49:47----------
that she's tainted then my first duty is


---------49:50----------
not to my own happiness but is to the


---------49:53----------
kingdom and and so he divorces her and


---------49:58----------
he's upset and and you know people sort


---------50:01----------
of say that that's like kind of the


---------50:02----------
ideal wonderful thing to do but my mom


---------50:05----------
once told me something very very wise


---------50:06----------
and she said that if you want to live


---------50:08----------
like what do you think about that


---------50:09----------
let's start there I mean it's kind of


---------50:15----------
stupid yeah so my mom once told me


---------50:17----------
something very profound which she


---------50:19----------
doesn't remember to this day which is


---------50:20----------
that if you want to live a good life


---------50:21----------
live like ROM if you want to live a


---------50:24----------
happy life live like Krishna I don't


---------50:35----------
know if I agree with that okay say


---------50:38----------
something tell me what don't you agree


---------50:40----------
with what wouldn't like the guilt weigh


---------50:43----------
you down if you look like Chris


---------50:45----------
I don't know man how are you gonna find


---------50:48----------
out I mean I kind of have already so I'm


---------50:53----------
like I don't know if that's a good idea


---------50:56----------
yeah so what are you saying about your


---------50:59----------
life bullies what is it so earlier you


---------51:04----------
asked me you said yeah it feels like a


---------51:07----------
lot it feels heavy it's overwhelming


---------51:09----------
what's overwhelming what's heavy my


---------51:17----------
feelings towards myself yeah and what


---------51:20----------
are some of those feelings wouldn't the


---------51:24----------
guilt weigh you down right gilben yeah


---------51:32----------
is that how you feel yeah I think I can


---------51:36----------
be I can be guilty over things I've done


---------51:37----------
yeah right guilt for not doing more


---------51:41----------
guilt for becoming the person that you


---------51:43----------
are guilt for creating the life that


---------51:45----------
you've created so I'll accept it you


---------51:51----------
don't think that so people say my mom


---------51:53----------
says that you should be cunning and cold


---------51:55----------
and that the ends justifies the mean and


---------51:59----------
that's that's Krishna's path and if you


---------52:02----------
don't agree with that that's fine so


---------52:04----------
live the other way and then get back to


---------52:06----------
me okay


---------52:08----------
right but that means stopping to live


---------52:10----------
the way that you are and what does that


---------52:11----------
start with bullying yes truthfulness


---------52:16----------
sathya so you're gonna go a day at least


---------52:22----------
today at least a day pay attention okay


---------52:28----------
okay so we're gonna see I guess let me


---------52:35----------
just see if people do other people have


---------52:36----------
questions I think our featured chat


---------52:38----------
thing is not working it looks like right


---------52:40----------
[Music]


---------52:42----------
let me just see real quick for something


---------52:46----------
so I want to know like yeah so so oh it


---------52:51----------
is working so why don't I see anything


---------52:53----------
in it could I explain Christian how do i


---------52:59----------
oh here we go okay okay okay okay okay


---------53:08----------
okay okay a lot of people are asking


---------53:22----------
technical questions about lying it's the


---------53:24----------
first thing that I want to know is


---------53:25----------
twitch at how long are you guys gonna


---------53:27----------
not lie for like what do you guys want


---------53:29----------
to do what do you think okay so I'm


---------53:45----------
seeing everything from like a few


---------53:46----------
minutes to like never again so I really


---------53:49----------
want you guys to try this at home and I


---------53:51----------
want y'all to do exactly what bulliest


---------53:52----------
is doing I want you to see when you


---------53:55----------
start when you stop lying what happens


---------54:00----------
to your life like does it get harder


---------54:03----------
does it get easier does it get harder


---------54:05----------
for a time and then easier one week okay


---------54:09----------
I think that's a great idea


---------54:12----------
so let's just start again this being


---------54:14----------
under this 18 hours yeah so so I mean so


---------54:19----------
this is the thing like I don't care


---------54:20----------
about hypotheticals right we can talk


---------54:23----------
about hypotheticals but ultimately


---------54:24----------
change happens through experience when


---------54:27----------
you actually start doing things


---------54:28----------
differently like that's when you're


---------54:29----------
gonna learn so Bulli is's been living a


---------54:31----------
life like krishna he's been living a


---------54:33----------
life of like sneakiness and subterfuge


---------54:35----------
and you don't like the way it makes you


---------54:37----------
feel fine so start living a different


---------54:39----------
way so I'm gonna start answering


---------54:42----------
questions but I'm gonna encourage


---------54:44----------
bulliest to start cleaning or actually


---------54:47----------
hold on do we want to clean is like a


---------54:48----------
meditation together and check-in about


---------54:50----------
how people feel or do we want


---------54:55----------
let's do QA and then we'll do cleaning


---------54:58----------
stream how does that sound


---------55:00----------
sure okay let's do questions okay so one


---------55:06----------
question is how do you avoid being


---------55:07----------
emotionally burned out from your


---------55:09----------
interactions with your clients because


---------55:13----------
so this is what I want you guys to


---------55:15----------
understand like why do you guys think


---------55:16----------
bully is's life wiliest why do you think


---------55:19----------
living your life is so [ __ ]


---------55:20----------
exhausting like why aren't you like do


---------55:23----------
you feel burned out emotionally


---------55:27----------
yeah yeah right so why


---------55:32----------
I feel like I'm doing it wrong okay and


---------55:34----------
you know why you're doing it wrong


---------55:39----------
because you're being inauthentic


---------55:42----------
right so burnout comes from like living


---------55:46----------
a life that's fake like living a life of


---------55:49----------
Lies is mentally and emotionally


---------55:51----------
exhausting I don't get burned out from


---------55:54----------
my clients because I'm I'm like this so


---------55:57----------
like I want to be me like I'm a bad


---------55:59----------
therapist for some people because I like


---------56:01----------
to talk and I ask people like difficult


---------56:04----------
questions and in the sense I don't spare


---------56:06----------
their feelings like if I have to sit


---------56:08----------
back and restrain myself if I don't get


---------56:10----------
to tell random ass stories then I get


---------56:13----------
bored and it's hard for me but I find


---------56:16----------
clients or I think the people that I'm


---------56:18----------
able to help are the ones that are like


---------56:20----------
open like if someone is like pissing


---------56:22----------
around and like not answering questions


---------56:24----------
and stuff that I find tiring but


---------56:27----------
generally speaking I don't get tired


---------56:28----------
as long as I'm being authentic and I


---------56:31----------
think like one of the most exhausting


---------56:32----------
it's just so hard I mean like I don't


---------56:36----------
know how else to put this but you know


---------56:39----------
when you're living an inauthentic life


---------56:40----------
it's like you're you're like a mage


---------56:43----------
who's like running around with a


---------56:44----------
two-hander like it's just gonna be


---------56:46----------
shitty it's just it's just you're gonna


---------56:49----------
suck at it and it doesn't it's just


---------56:51----------
exhausting whereas if you live a life


---------56:54----------
that is kind of like honest and


---------56:56----------
authentic then it's actually you get a


---------56:58----------
lot of energy and you just do better so


---------57:01----------
it's not that exhausting okay so next


---------57:04----------
question is bully us about chores like


---------57:07----------
cleaning etc I think once you start


---------57:08----------
doing them more often you'll get into


---------57:10----------
the habit of doing it automatically when


---------57:12----------
there's less chores left it'll feel less


---------57:14----------
overwhelming what do you think about


---------57:15----------
that


---------57:17----------
I mean the hardest part is starting


---------57:20----------
and also I don't know part part of it


---------57:22----------
for me is it's like it feels like it's


---------57:24----------
never-ending


---------57:25----------
because there's always many more to do


---------57:26----------
so I think those are really important


---------57:30----------
points right so hard I agree that's


---------57:32----------
starting is the hardest and what's wrong


---------57:36----------
with it being never-ending


---------57:44----------
I mean it just it's


---------57:47----------
taxing I guess cuz you're like I don't


---------57:48----------
wanna have to do this but I have to keep


---------57:51----------
having to do it yeah so I think I think


---------57:54----------
this is this is gonna be important


---------57:58----------
booyah so one day we're gonna have a


---------57:59----------
conversation about how completion is not


---------58:02----------
the goal


---------58:05----------
right right so your focus is on getting


---------58:08----------
things completed you want to just get


---------58:11----------
that rent paid and you want to have that


---------58:12----------
conversation be over and as long as you


---------58:15----------
want that conversation with your stepdad


---------58:17----------
to be over it's gonna be really hard to


---------58:19----------
do but oddly enough if you can free


---------58:23----------
yourself from wanting to be done the


---------58:26----------
doing becomes really easy


---------58:29----------
that's hard though does that make sense


---------58:32----------
yeah okay next question


---------58:37----------
what about lies that you yourself


---------58:41----------
believe what are the effects of them


---------58:45----------
that's an interesting question I don't


---------58:47----------
know how do you know what you believe is


---------58:50----------
how can you tell the difference between


---------58:52----------
what you believe being true or a lie


---------58:54----------
look I'm kind of curious about that


---------58:58----------
probably feeling what do you mean like


---------59:01----------
you can kind of sense it I think if it's


---------59:04----------
a lie


---------59:06----------
how can you sense it


---------59:10----------
like when you say something that's a lie


---------59:12----------
you can kind of feel that it's like


---------59:13----------
incorrect and what are you in a way what


---------59:16----------
do you think the effects are of the lies


---------59:17----------
that you tell yourself


---------59:23----------
I think they're more than negative than


---------59:25----------
anything generally I mean so I think


---------59:29----------
that the main thing to understand once


---------59:31----------
again is that lying is about control


---------59:33----------
right so if you're lying about yourself


---------59:37----------
like if you let yourself believe a lie


---------59:39----------
like you have to understand that that


---------59:41----------
lie is serving a purpose for you and you


---------59:44----------
have to understand like what is the


---------59:45----------
purpose of lying to yourself what is it


---------59:47----------
about myself that I'm unwilling to face


---------59:50----------
or accept about who I am or what I've


---------59:53----------
done


---------59:55----------
and ultimately I think if you want to


---------59:56----------
move forward you have to accept who you


---------59:58----------
are case in point and we just talked


---------60:00----------
about you know being a mage and wielding


---------60:01----------
a two-hander and sure you can you can be


---------60:03----------
Gandalf no but Gandalf is the exception


---------60:06----------
not the rule


---------60:06----------
right like most of us are not running


---------60:07----------
around as Gandalf and also Gandalf


---------60:12----------
really didn't use magic so he's


---------60:13----------
basically a fighter let's remember that


---------60:16----------
too


---------60:17----------
but you know I think when it comes to


---------60:20----------
lying to yourself just understand that


---------60:24----------
like lying to yourself is is gonna be


---------60:26----------
hard because you're you're making


---------60:29----------
yourself become something that you're


---------60:31----------
not and when you start playing a


---------60:34----------
character that you actually aren't like


---------60:36----------
when you start you know like not being


---------60:39----------
yourself


---------60:40----------
life is just gonna get way harder so I


---------60:42----------
think it can be hard because a lot of


---------60:43----------
times we do lie to ourselves and that


---------60:45----------
line to our self is a protective


---------60:47----------
mechanism and what we're trying to


---------60:48----------
control is like we're trying to control


---------60:50----------
ourselves right we're trying to we're


---------60:55----------
trying to control the like sort of the


---------60:57----------
way that we view ourselves and I


---------60:59----------
generally think that that isn't hat that


---------61:00----------
isn't healthy but it can be hard to


---------61:02----------
overcome right okay


---------61:08----------
next question is let's talk about being


---------61:11----------
too honest I don't see what question


---------61:13----------
that is okay so let's talk about being


---------61:16----------
too honest fine so I don't want you guys


---------61:19----------
to take so this happens sometimes where


---------61:22----------
someone is like I am like a fan of


---------61:24----------
radical honesty and they say that like


---------61:26----------
I'm committed to truth and I'm going to


---------61:28----------
speak the truth wherever I go so I don't


---------61:33----------
think that that's a good idea like so I


---------61:34----------
think sometimes people confuse satya


---------61:36----------
with a license to be an [ __ ] that's


---------61:39----------
not what's up yes


---------61:40----------
Sathya doesn't mean like you you go to


---------61:42----------
lunch with your friends and you call


---------61:45----------
like your buddy's girlfriend out for


---------61:47----------
like gaining 15 pounds because that's


---------61:49----------
your truth you're gonna speak your truth


---------61:51----------
don't let set there become an [ __ ]


---------61:53----------
like so being honest so this is the


---------61:56----------
other thing like being honest is not


---------61:58----------
really about this is gonna sound weird


---------62:00----------
it's not about like what you portray to


---------62:03----------
other people right ultimately honesty is


---------62:05----------
about like you being honest with


---------62:07----------
yourself


---------62:08----------
and you know you should be honest with


---------62:10----------
others when it's relevant but it's not


---------62:12----------
like you're gonna be like radical


---------62:15----------
honesty and like I'm gonna say tell


---------62:17----------
everything like I'm gonna tell people


---------62:18----------
what I think about them I'm gonna tell


---------62:20----------
them that I think they're an [ __ ] and


---------62:21----------
like I think there's value to honesty


---------62:23----------
but don't confuse being honest in sathya


---------62:27----------
with being an [ __ ] which sometimes


---------62:29----------
people do and it's a really easy mistake


---------62:30----------
to make and and so you should be honest


---------62:35----------
but you know don't be too like don't let


---------62:38----------
me put it this way just because you're


---------62:40----------
honest doesn't mean you have to open


---------62:41----------
your [ __ ] mouth so when it's


---------62:43----------
important and when it's relevant to the


---------62:45----------
conversation you open your mouth and you


---------62:46----------
don't lie but it doesn't give you a


---------62:48----------
license to just share your your stupid


---------62:51----------
opinion with everyone about everything


---------62:52----------
that you think that's not what honesty


---------62:54----------
is about what about lying to save others


---------63:02----------
from harm what do you think what do you


---------63:05----------
guys think is it okay to lie to save


---------63:07----------
others from harm so everyone's saying it


---------63:23----------
depends on the harm what do you think


---------63:25----------
bilious you're on the hot seat


---------63:26----------
is it okay to lie to protect others from


---------63:28----------
from harm I mean I think the safe answer


---------63:39----------
is it depends but I think the genuine


---------63:42----------
answer is not really okay so I'd start


---------63:45----------
by by not accepting the premise of the


---------63:47----------
question which is that I don't know that


---------63:49----------
lying necessarily protects people from


---------63:51----------
harm I don't I don't start with that


---------63:53----------
premise so I have been shocked by how


---------63:59----------
much I think about lying protecting


---------64:01----------
people from harm and I'll give you guys


---------64:03----------
just an example


---------64:05----------
so I was working with someone I was


---------64:08----------
working for a while on the cancer


---------64:10----------
psychiatry like consultation service so


---------64:14----------
for like a month or two months or


---------64:15----------
something like that I was basically a


---------64:16----------
psychiatrist that worked with people


---------64:17----------
with cancer and one of the simplest


---------64:19----------
things that people do is they lie to


---------64:21----------
their kids especially if they're young


---------64:23----------
kids about people having cancer and


---------64:26----------
that's a very that's kind of like a safe


---------64:30----------
bet like you think like if you're lying


---------64:32----------
to someone like let me lie to my


---------64:34----------
nine-year-old about like me having


---------64:36----------
cancer so the parents will get together


---------64:38----------
and they'll lie to their nine-year-old


---------64:40----------
and they'll say like oh yeah


---------64:41----------
like dad is gonna be fine he's sick and


---------64:46----------
he's in the hospital now right like


---------64:50----------
that's a pretty safe lie like you're


---------64:52----------
trying to protect your kid what do you


---------64:54----------
think how do you think about what do you


---------64:56----------
think about that beliefs I don't think


---------64:58----------
it's a safe lie cause it's gonna blow up


---------65:00----------
in your face regardless and it's


---------65:01----------
probably gonna make it worse because in


---------65:02----------
there they feel like they were lied to


---------65:04----------
so that's I think an example of one of


---------65:07----------
the most compassionate lies irrespective


---------65:10----------
of whether it's right or wrong or stupid


---------65:12----------
I think that is the most that is the


---------65:14----------
case that I can think of that is the


---------65:16----------
most compassionate and well intentioned


---------65:18----------
lie I've ever encountered which is that


---------65:21----------
I don't want my child to realize that


---------65:24----------
like they're gonna lose their parent and


---------65:25----------
I want to protect them from that I don't


---------65:28----------
know protect them from that but you you


---------65:31----------
can't right so I don't know that lying


---------65:34----------
really saves other people from harm like


---------65:36----------
I just don't accept that premise I mean


---------65:38----------
I'm not saying it isn't theoretically


---------65:40----------
possible but in my experience many of


---------65:43----------
the cases that people think that lying


---------65:47----------
is gonna protect someone from harm and


---------65:49----------
boy the kind of [ __ ] that people keep


---------65:51----------
come up with yeah you know like I'm not


---------65:55----------
gonna let my spouse know that I had an


---------65:57----------
affair because it's over now and the


---------65:58----------
only thing it would do would hurt her


---------66:00----------
feelings right true on some level maybe


---------66:04----------
I don't know but


---------66:12----------
anyway I think the thing about like that


---------66:14----------
specific lie is that like what if the


---------66:16----------
parents not fine then what happens which


---------66:20----------
which parent like let's say like that oh


---------66:23----------
I don't have just gonna be in the


---------66:25----------
hospital be fine and then they like they


---------66:27----------
pass away or something then like what's


---------66:28----------
the kids supposed to think yeah I


---------66:30----------
completely agree so someone is someone


---------66:32----------
in chat is asking I'm just gonna ask a


---------66:34----------
follow-up question let's say you saw


---------66:35----------
someone in danger the only way to say


---------66:37----------
save him is lying would you not lie so


---------66:39----------
my question is what is a scenario in


---------66:41----------
which the only way to save that person


---------66:43----------
is lying right so like what I'm saying


---------66:45----------
is that generally speaking like in my


---------66:49----------
experience people come up with these


---------66:52----------
hypothetical scenarios but we're not


---------66:54----------
talking about hypothetical scenario


---------66:56----------
we're talking about


---------66:56----------
oh yeah Jews in the Attic I think you


---------66:59----------
should absolutely lie about Jesus in the


---------67:00----------
Attic absolutely oh that's a good one


---------67:03----------
that's different yeah no I mean I'm like


---------67:07----------
I said I'm not saying it's a hundred


---------67:08----------
percent true I think you should lie


---------67:09----------
about Jews in the attic sure that's a


---------67:12----------
good one right yeah so I'm glad for


---------67:17----------
someone mentioning that because I think


---------67:19----------
that's I hadn't really thought about


---------67:21----------
that I've never been faced in a


---------67:22----------
situation where I've Jews in the Attic


---------67:23----------
so yeah but that's why I love chat I


---------67:26----------
mean like let me be the first to say


---------67:28----------
that you know I don't have all the


---------67:30----------
answers and if you guys come up with a


---------67:31----------
good examples that's good in my life and


---------67:34----------
clinical experience the number of times


---------67:37----------
we're lying actually protects people


---------67:39----------
from harm is is I haven't encountered


---------67:42----------
that really and the number of times that


---------67:45----------
I've told people to be truthful and


---------67:47----------
counseled them to be truthful has been


---------67:49----------
like really really important like it's


---------67:50----------
been overwhelming ly+ okay does not


---------67:58----------
giving an answer to something constitute


---------68:00----------
a lie if you know the answer but choose


---------68:02----------
not to provide one is that a lie what do


---------68:04----------
you think so you cut out a second so


---------68:07----------
someone's asking if you if you don't if


---------68:09----------
you don't provide an answer is that the


---------68:11----------
same as line


---------68:14----------
no no not really because it's like you


---------68:22----------
can choose not to answer something it's


---------68:23----------
not I mean it can kind of depend but


---------68:37----------
like if you said I don't know to


---------68:39----------
something you can kind of consider that


---------68:41----------
as like a lie like if you knew what


---------68:44----------
happened but it's like yeah so I mean I


---------68:48----------
think this is exactly why we do this


---------68:49----------
exercise right because I think we can


---------68:51----------
talk about hypotheticals as much as we


---------68:53----------
want to but I've known very few people


---------68:56----------
I'm tempted to say none but I mean it's


---------68:58----------
got to have happened whose life has been


---------69:00----------
changed by a hypothetical so like these


---------69:03----------
questions quickly become philosophical


---------69:06----------
they quickly become hypothetical and


---------69:07----------
they quickly become academic you guys


---------69:09----------
see what's happening like people are


---------69:10----------
asking but like what about this like


---------69:12----------
what about the OJ Simpson and what about


---------69:13----------
being a defense attorney like we're not


---------69:15----------
[ __ ] talking about that like sure


---------69:18----------
like someone said like Jews in the Attic


---------69:20----------
I will concede that when it comes to


---------69:23----------
Sofia I think the right thing to do is


---------69:25----------
to lie about Jews in the Attic so that


---------69:26----------
they don't get like killed I agree right


---------69:31----------
you know I'll be the first to say that I


---------69:34----------
don't think that that's a relevant


---------69:36----------
example for your life and if it is


---------69:37----------
please do the right thing but at the end


---------69:41----------
of the day like you guys have to be


---------69:43----------
careful because watch what's happening


---------69:44----------
as you come up with a hypothetical


---------69:47----------
question and you answer it in a


---------69:50----------
hypothetical way you feel like you


---------69:52----------
learned something this is really


---------69:54----------
important to understand you guys feel


---------69:55----------
like you figure it out and the more you


---------69:58----------
feel like you figure it out the less


---------69:59----------
likely you are to do the exercise


---------70:02----------
and this is why people [ __ ] stay


---------70:04----------
stuck is because they live a life of


---------70:06----------
like a philosopher where they just think


---------70:08----------
about things and then think about


---------70:09----------
hypotheticals and they wake up the next


---------70:11----------
day and like all of the energy of Satya


---------70:14----------
is gone because you sorted it out like


---------70:17----------
just see how addictive this


---------70:19----------
philosophical thinking is because now


---------70:21----------
it's like oh but we like came up with


---------70:23----------
something what about this dr. K what


---------70:25----------
about this and yeah okay fine you guys


---------70:28----------
figured out you guys figure it out like


---------70:29----------
where's Satya falls apart fantastic good


---------70:31----------
job now what are you gonna wake up the


---------70:34----------
next day and and try to not tell the


---------70:36----------
truth like this is this is so dangerous


---------70:40----------
because gamers especially are like they


---------70:45----------
get so ensconced in like analytical


---------70:48----------
reasoning and hypotheticals and


---------70:50----------
philosophy like you guys are all


---------70:52----------
brilliant [ __ ] philosophers the


---------70:55----------
challenge is that being a philosopher is


---------70:56----------
not gonna change your life


---------70:57----------
in theory we think about philosophers as


---------71:01----------
people who have transformed lives and I


---------71:03----------
do think that you know like Marcus


---------71:05----------
Aurelius and stoicism I think are like


---------71:07----------
brilliant philosophies and if you


---------71:08----------
implement it that's one thing but


---------71:11----------
philosophically talking about Marcus


---------71:13----------
Aurelius is not gonna do [ __ ] you


---------71:15----------
actually have to go out and answer this


---------71:17----------
question for yourself does not giving an


---------71:20----------
answer constitute a lie we can say


---------71:22----------
whatever we want to and you can be


---------71:24----------
logically right or logically incorrect


---------71:25----------
my question to you is when you wake up


---------71:28----------
the next morning and someone asks you


---------71:30----------
did you take out the trash like what are


---------71:34----------
you gonna say are you gonna say would


---------71:36----------
you like some orange juice this morning


---------71:38----------
like are you gonna do that and how do


---------71:40----------
you feel like what is that like that's


---------71:44----------
the question right like you got to start


---------71:46----------
living it and then you come up with the


---------71:48----------
answer this is the other thing is


---------71:49----------
somewhere along the way you guys got the


---------71:51----------
impression that I have answers somewhere


---------71:54----------
along the way you guys got the


---------71:56----------
impression that I know what I'm talking


---------71:58----------
about


---------71:58----------
I want everyone to understand this very


---------72:00----------
clearly I don't have a [ __ ] clue I


---------72:02----------
know about my life but I don't know [ __ ]


---------72:04----------
about yours everything that I say should


---------72:06----------
be put through the crucible of your own


---------72:08----------
experience I'm not giving you guys a


---------72:11----------
road map I'm giving you guys like


---------72:15----------
a protocol to run an experiment that's


---------72:17----------
what the stream is about is fine you


---------72:21----------
guys think I'm saying what I'm saying is


---------72:23----------
correct try it prove me wrong


---------72:26----------
figure it out for yourself that's the


---------72:30----------
most important thing okay what


---------72:34----------
techniques can someone do to distinguish


---------72:35----------
between the lies and truths you tell


---------72:37----------
yourself okay this is a fantastic


---------72:38----------
question how do you tell if you're lying


---------72:40----------
and how do you tell if you're you're


---------72:43----------
being truthful


---------72:44----------
boolie is how do you feel when you tell


---------72:46----------
a lie


---------72:48----------
you feel like you're being dishonest how


---------72:51----------
does that feel like wrong like it feels


---------72:54----------
wrong okay feels not good so how does it


---------72:56----------
feel like so there's some dark and nasty


---------72:57----------
[ __ ] going on in your life and they're


---------72:59----------
dark and nasty corners of your


---------73:01----------
psychology and self right yeah and when


---------73:05----------
you lie about yourself like how do you


---------73:06----------
feel not good okay when you come on


---------73:10----------
stream and there are I can't see I'm a


---------73:16----------
Boomer 1.5 K when there are a thousand


---------73:19----------
15 of 500 people listening to you


---------73:22----------
talking about the shittiest parts of


---------73:24----------
your psychology how do you feel fine


---------73:29----------
there it is how the [ __ ] does that work


---------73:31----------
this is the stuff that you strive to


---------73:34----------
hide


---------73:35----------
this is the stuff that you keep tucked


---------73:37----------
away this is what's behind the shield


---------73:40----------
and armor right this is like what's


---------73:43----------
inside the turtle shell like how the


---------73:45----------
[ __ ] does that work you work so hard to


---------73:47----------
hide it and when you successfully hide


---------73:49----------
it how do you feel how do you feel


---------73:52----------
police when you hide him not the


---------73:54----------
greatest and then when you air it out


---------73:56----------
like your dirty ass laundry like your


---------73:58----------
sexual proclivities how do you feel


---------74:03----------
right


---------74:04----------
generally pretty good since sometimes


---------74:07----------
people will like showing you yeah so


---------74:11----------
when you're lying to yourself I think


---------74:15----------
the biggest thing to check into is what


---------74:18----------
is like what is your emotional response


---------74:20----------
right when someone walks down the street


---------74:22----------
if I'm walking down the street and


---------74:23----------
someone calls me a [ __ ] and then I'm


---------74:26----------
like okay man what are you if you say so


---------74:31----------
and then if someone calls me [ __ ] I'm


---------74:34----------
like no you're the [ __ ] [ __ ]


---------74:36----------
like that emotional response tells me


---------74:38----------
what how I feel about myself if I'm


---------74:40----------
truly confident like you suck at life


---------74:42----------
man you're like a [ __ ] poser I'm


---------74:44----------
gonna be like okay you think I'm a poser


---------74:47----------
fine it's your emotional response


---------74:55----------
that is


---------74:57----------
the important thing right if someone


---------74:59----------
says calls you something nasty


---------75:03----------
and I apologize if apparent I mean I


---------75:05----------
know return can be offensive so I'm


---------75:07----------
sorry for using that word but like I


---------75:10----------
think like if someone is calling you


---------75:12----------
something nasty


---------75:14----------
the way that you respond to it tells you


---------75:16----------
how you feel about yourself and when


---------75:19----------
you're telling yourself truth or lying


---------75:22----------
like if you're telling yourself


---------75:24----------
something that's true like you're gonna


---------75:26----------
feel okay with it it can hurt but it can


---------75:31----------
still feel like liberating it can feel


---------75:33----------
free and lying feels protective it like


---------75:36----------
protects you from that negative emotion


---------75:37----------
but you feel like [ __ ] so I think that


---------75:41----------
like that's a really important thing so


---------75:43----------
like how do you feel when you speak


---------75:45----------
something right does it feel like you're


---------75:48----------
you're getting through something and you


---------75:50----------
feel like lighter at the end of it or do


---------75:52----------
you feel heavier at the end of it and


---------75:55----------
that's I think the biggest way you can


---------75:57----------
tell okay so madam Faye is asking oh god


---------76:05----------
there's so many questions okay we're


---------76:06----------
gonna do like a few more questions now


---------76:07----------
we're gonna do meditation


---------76:18----------
okay so Matt twitch user says what would


---------76:21----------
you say if you're lying to someone in a


---------76:22----------
position of power over over you who has


---------76:25----------
something against you so this is in


---------76:28----------
general like I'm not I guess I'm about


---------76:30----------
to promote Hinduism but it's not I don't


---------76:32----------
really I don't think it's promoting


---------76:34----------
Hinduism one of the reasons I like


---------76:35----------
Hinduism like the reason I've gained a


---------76:37----------
lot of value out of it does not even in


---------76:39----------
Hinduism really but one of the reasons I


---------76:41----------
like stories like the Mahabharata is


---------76:43----------
because there is this dichotomy between


---------76:44----------
Rama and Krishna that at the end of the


---------76:47----------
day like Christian is a shady


---------76:48----------
[ __ ] and sometimes I think the


---------76:50----------
lesson that I learned from my mom and


---------76:53----------
sort of reading some of these things


---------76:54----------
from Hinduism these are in all religions


---------76:57----------
and also had like secular stuff right


---------76:58----------
like there's wisdom all over the place


---------77:00----------
is that there isn't like one system of


---------77:03----------
morality so what I like about Eastern


---------77:05----------
religions is that they don't sort of


---------77:06----------
start with this idea that there's an


---------77:08----------
objective right and there's an objective


---------77:09----------
wrong in the east there's karma


---------77:12----------
there's just cause and effect and so if


---------77:14----------
I throw something up in the air it's


---------77:15----------
gonna come down and we're the ones who


---------77:17----------
place a value judgement about what we


---------77:19----------
like and what we don't like


---------77:20----------
but I think what I like about like this


---------77:22----------
ROM versus Christian a dichotomy and I


---------77:24----------
talk about this a lot with my patients


---------77:26----------
like who are in investment banking and


---------77:28----------
executives and they're like power


---------77:29----------
struggles and things like that is that I


---------77:33----------
don't think that there is like a stock


---------77:36----------
answer to things and I think that there


---------77:38----------
are like the whole point behind like


---------77:40----------
Krishna also being called God is that he


---------77:43----------
did things that are super shady and I


---------77:45----------
think that like what the lesson that I


---------77:47----------
take away from that is that sometimes


---------77:49----------
you have to do things that are shady if


---------77:50----------
you want to move forward in life if you


---------77:52----------
want to be happy in life sometimes you


---------77:54----------
have to do things that are shady and


---------77:56----------
that if you're you're kind of like an


---------77:58----------
open-ended like honest like naive kind


---------78:01----------
of guy you're gonna get screwed that's I


---------78:05----------
think one of the lessons that I learned


---------78:06----------
from the Mahabharat okay our Hindu tales


---------78:15----------
not hypothetical though they're


---------78:16----------
absolutely hypothetical that's the whole


---------78:18----------
point right I mean maybe they're


---------78:19----------
historically accurate I don't know


---------78:21----------
there's some people sort of claim that


---------78:22----------
this stuff is real or not real I mean I


---------78:24----------
think the main question is not whether


---------78:25----------
they're real or hypothetical the main


---------78:27----------
question is what you know what do we


---------78:29----------
take away from them like what can you


---------78:31----------
learn from like reading stories and


---------78:33----------
listening to stories and things like


---------78:34----------
that how can you apply some of these


---------78:36----------
principles and test them in their own in


---------78:37----------
your own life okay okay so too many


---------78:43----------
questions alright so Bulli as' well I'm


---------78:46----------
gonna ask you guys we're gonna we're


---------78:47----------

---------87:47----------
you


---------87:52----------
hold the finger there no contact with


---------87:55----------
the skin


---------87:56----------
just focus on the sensation


---------88:03----------
you


---------88:26----------
now relax your hand


---------88:28----------
let it come down continue to concentrate


---------88:34----------
on that point of your forehead


---------88:41----------
towards it


---------89:57----------
and now take a deep breath in and exhale


---------90:03----------
slowly deep breath in exhale for five


---------90:14----------

---------90:46----------

---------90:50----------
friction the heat and cup them over your


---------90:53----------
eyes slowly open your eyes let your


---------91:01----------
palms come down


---------91:13----------
how do you feel feel all right I kind of


---------91:22----------
switched to the ADHD one where you focus


---------91:25----------
on other noises and stuff because I was


---------91:26----------
just like that's a good focused on I


---------91:32----------
really don't understand dog giving me


---------91:35----------
please okay sorry huh


---------91:37----------
my buddy kept damning me and I'm like


---------91:39----------
stop damning you about just sending


---------91:43----------
thing dumb stuff to me anyways what were


---------91:46----------
you saying yeah I'm just trying to keep


---------91:48----------
up with twitch at I'm so some people


---------91:53----------
yeah so this is important right so miss


---------91:56----------
gifs gummy dealer says I feel like a


---------91:58----------
horn is gonna burst out of my forehead


---------91:59----------
so this is what I want you guys to


---------92:03----------
understand okay meditation is not about


---------92:08----------
like inner peace like sure you feel I


---------92:12----------
know that you guys like feel calmer and


---------92:15----------
stuff and like that's important but the


---------92:18----------
reason I like to meditate is because I


---------92:20----------
really enjoy spiritual experiences I


---------92:23----------
like I enjoy experiencing strange


---------92:24----------
sensations I enjoy understanding and


---------92:26----------
having experiences of like the self that


---------92:30----------
are beyond like what happens in my mind


---------92:33----------
and if you guys can't concentrate that's


---------92:38----------
okay we're gonna teach you a lot of


---------92:39----------
different meditation techniques but what


---------92:41----------
I want y'all to understand is that like


---------92:42----------
if you feel like strange sensations and


---------92:45----------
meditation as long as you're not scary


---------92:46----------
or painful or things like that continue


---------92:49----------
doing that practice because those


---------92:51----------
feelings are a sign that the meditation


---------92:53----------
is working properly if you don't feel


---------92:55----------
that that's okay too this meditation


---------92:57----------
isn't for everyone


---------92:58----------
so bulliest defaulted to something else


---------93:00----------
which is fine so we're gonna teach a lot


---------93:02----------
of different meditation techniques the


---------93:03----------
goal of teaching meditation on the


---------93:05----------
stream so you guys need to understand


---------93:07----------
this minds are different not everyone's


---------93:09----------
mind is the same and the reason that


---------93:11----------
there are dozens or 112 different kinds


---------93:15----------
of meditation techniques is that for


---------93:19----------
different minds a different technique is


---------93:21----------
going to attain


---------93:22----------
help you attain like that peaceful state


---------93:25----------
of mind or give you give you a sense of


---------93:27----------
your true self for all kinds of other


---------93:28----------
like random you know Lululemon yoga


---------93:31----------
hippy kind of stuff and so try the


---------93:34----------
different techniques see what works for


---------93:35----------
you see what doesn't and you'll know


---------93:37----------
when it works you'll start to have


---------93:42----------
you'll start to have different


---------93:44----------
experiences as you do different


---------93:46----------
techniques and do what works and a


---------93:47----------
bulliest yes so this is important right


---------93:50----------
I want you guys to see what did bully us


---------93:52----------
just do what did you do Bert


---------93:56----------
nope before that I don't know it's like


---------94:01----------
focused on the tree noises outside yeah


---------94:04----------
he opened his window right he pulled his


---------94:06----------
shades back why'd you do that cuz I was


---------94:09----------
getting warm and cuz I kind of liked the


---------94:11----------
noise yeah good like your room looks but


---------94:14----------
better like like like your face looks


---------94:16----------
better how do you feel like a little


---------94:20----------
better yeah so I think when you first


---------94:22----------
came on you were smiling too but it was


---------94:23----------
an embarrassed kind of smile it was like


---------94:27----------
kind of a shot like see you just did it


---------94:29----------
again that was an embarrass my you're


---------94:32----------
there it is so that's the embarrassed


---------94:33----------
smile right self-conscious yeah yeah so


---------94:36----------
but but that's not how you felt before


---------94:38----------
right so can you go back to that is it


---------94:46----------
working or hard


---------94:48----------
well if I'm thinking about it it's hard


---------94:50----------
good trying so stop thinking about it


---------94:53----------
and do right so listen to the noises


---------94:55----------
close your eyes feel the wind


---------95:07----------
feel that feeling of embarrassment and


---------95:10----------
then return to the wind return to the


---------95:13----------
sounds that you hear the sound of my


---------95:17----------
voice to other sounds that you hear and


---------95:25----------
notice that that embarrassment is


---------95:27----------
holding on just a tiny bit which is okay


---------95:29----------
let it be there let the feeling be there


---------95:33----------
right and with it parallel to it also


---------95:39----------
within you notice that peacefulness


---------95:46----------
understand that that embarrassment is


---------95:48----------
gonna be there that's okay how do you


---------95:52----------
feel about being embarrassed like fun


---------95:55----------
yeah that's the [ __ ] point right so


---------96:00----------
your embarrassment in your emotions keep


---------96:03----------
you from doing the things that you need


---------96:05----------
to do so what you need to learn is how


---------96:07----------
to be fine with it


---------96:10----------
embarrassment restricts who you are it


---------96:13----------
restricts what you're able to do in life


---------96:14----------
and when you meditate you can learn to


---------96:17----------
sit with that feeling and be fine with


---------96:20----------
it that's what we want right it's not to


---------96:22----------
stop feeling it's to let your life not


---------96:27----------
be controlled by what you feel and now


---------96:29----------
that's not the smile of embarrassment


---------96:31----------
this is different this is a different


---------96:33----------
smile can you guys see that it's a


---------96:37----------
different one the embarrassment smile is


---------96:39----------
gone and there it is it's coming back


---------96:41----------
again now it's back you see this is what


---------96:44----------
we do we turn it on and we turn it off


---------96:47----------
this is how you learn you learn how to


---------96:49----------
control your ability to step in and out


---------96:51----------
of emotion and now bully a step out of


---------96:55----------
it do you can you do it or do you need


---------96:56----------
my help


---------96:58----------
a little bit I mean


---------97:05----------
good keep your eyes closed game yeah


---------97:07----------
you're doing it right you feel the


---------97:09----------
embarrassment is still there we're not


---------97:11----------
making it go away this is really


---------97:13----------
important because people think that you


---------97:14----------
want to make the emotion go away so it


---------97:16----------
doesn't control you anymore that's what


---------97:17----------
I'm like bulliest thinks that as long as


---------97:20----------
the shame is there his behavior is going


---------97:23----------
to be controlled he wants the shame to


---------97:24----------
go away no no no that's not the goal the


---------97:27----------
goal is to air it out let it be there


---------97:32----------
and now the genuine smile starts to


---------97:34----------
return again can you guys see like can


---------97:36----------
y'all tell or is this like am i


---------97:38----------
hallucinating or can twitch @ tell can


---------97:40----------
you guys tell the difference like can


---------97:44----------
you guys see the two smiles that he has


---------97:48----------
the smile and in the embarrassment


---------97:53----------
can you get embarrassed again there it


---------97:57----------
is there it is right and now with the


---------98:01----------
coolest thing bulliest says you're


---------98:02----------
starting to be like okay with it right


---------98:04----------
like you could play with it are you


---------98:05----------
playing with it Yeah right and that's


---------98:09----------
what I want you guys to do is to


---------98:11----------
understand that your emotions deserve a


---------98:12----------
seat at the table but they don't get to


---------98:14----------
run the show that you can be fun and


---------98:17----------
playful with the things that hold you


---------98:20----------
back right like and like even shave like


---------98:22----------
you can sit with that you can learn to


---------98:24----------
like be at the table with your shame and


---------98:26----------
not let it control you not let it


---------98:27----------
dominate


---------98:30----------
and that's how you do it good job today


---------98:33----------
