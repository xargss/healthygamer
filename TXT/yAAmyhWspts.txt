---------00:00----------
if I go on the Slayer dating app very


---------00:05----------
difficult in quarantine rising Li enough


---------00:08----------
consider dating an anime character they


---------00:10----------
they can't contract


---------00:17----------
no I think I got it I got it I figured


---------00:21----------
that out take four I'm gonna get really


---------00:24----------
good at describing this okay you're


---------00:26----------
gonna get awesome at describing it I


---------00:27----------
think I had my be right back screen on


---------00:29----------
oh okay cool


---------00:31----------
so a waifu is a fictional character that


---------00:35----------
you have a romantic love for that is


---------00:37----------
indistinguishable from a romantic love


---------00:40----------
that you might feel for another human


---------00:41----------
being it's important to note that this


---------00:44----------
is a anime character and not a cartoon


---------00:46----------
character the difference being that the


---------00:49----------
style is a lot more focused into being


---------00:52----------
either cute or cool and also anime tends


---------00:56----------
to have a lot more plot wear which means


---------01:00----------
that you can have a lot more character


---------01:00----------
development a lot more thorough


---------01:02----------
character writing whereas in a cartoon


---------01:06----------
such as Simpsons has a circular


---------01:08----------
narrative they always end up back on the


---------01:10----------
couch characters don't really change


---------01:11----------
much why is that important because you


---------01:15----------
connect so much more with the character


---------01:18----------
when you see them grow and you see them


---------01:20----------
change as a person and you see them go


---------01:22----------
through like hardships that stick with


---------01:25----------
them hmm interesting


---------01:27----------
okay so in that sort of Mirrors so what


---------01:32----------
I'm hearing you say is that sir plot


---------01:33----------
development and character and personal


---------01:36----------
growth or character growth in an anime


---------01:38----------
kind of mirrors real life in a sense


---------01:41----------
more because romantic interests with


---------01:44----------
human beings also involve sort of growth


---------01:47----------
and change uh yeah I wouldn't know two


---------01:50----------
months other I would think so that


---------01:53----------
sounds alright okay so I mean can you


---------01:55----------
have a waifu who is not from anime of


---------02:00----------
probably you'll probably get called


---------02:02----------
weird even more so than having a normal


---------02:04----------
waifu imagine that's probably the case


---------02:08----------
with some people what what would be


---------02:09----------
weird about that it's just not even so


---------02:13----------
weird as in the act itself is stranger


---------02:17----------
it's just less common and therefore more


---------02:19----------
noteworthy I see okay


---------02:22----------
beautifully put and so you so if I


---------02:25----------
understand you correctly


---------02:27----------
the core of a relationship with a waifu


---------02:30----------
is a feeling of love so it's entirely


---------02:33----------
like an internal feeling of romantic


---------02:35----------
love yes so there's a whole lot of


---------02:37----------
different people with a whole lot of


---------02:39----------
different thoughts and a lot of them do


---------02:42----------
consider themselves in relationships I


---------02:44----------
do not I think by definition their


---------02:47----------
relationship requires two consenting


---------02:50----------
parties so I don't consider myself in a


---------02:52----------
relationship but I do still have that


---------02:55----------
feeling of indistinguishable love okay


---------02:59----------
so you have a feeling of love and so


---------03:04----------
then let me ask you a question


---------03:05----------
how is that different from okay so I see


---------03:10----------
what you're saying so so and so there's


---------03:13----------
a difference between being in love with


---------03:15----------
a waifu and having a relationship yes


---------03:19----------
and so can you help us understand the


---------03:22----------
people who have relationships with


---------03:23----------
waifu's do you have any sense of over


---------03:26----------
how they understand it I I do because


---------03:29----------
many many years ago before is really


---------03:31----------
insanity because the topic interested me


---------03:33----------
regardless I made myself like almost


---------03:36----------
like a mini documentary where I


---------03:37----------
interviewed people who consider


---------03:40----------
themselves in relationships funny how


---------03:42----------
that turns out doesn't it haha who comes


---------03:45----------
back around but um yeah so like there's


---------03:48----------
this one guy who like had like a wedding


---------03:52----------
ring there's this like people who like


---------03:56----------
go on like dates


---------03:59----------
the contents of which I'm not really


---------04:01----------
sure there's someone who I talked to who


---------04:04----------
was a pastor to married people to


---------04:07----------
fictional characters hmm fascinating


---------04:11----------
yeah it's pretty weird but you know


---------04:18----------
because it was well the pastor


---------04:21----------
specifically when I talked to him it


---------04:24----------
always stuck out the weirdest thing


---------04:26----------
because we have a really in-depth


---------04:28----------
conversation about how these people


---------04:30----------
think and they it was almost like a


---------04:33----------
multiverse theory style of like logic


---------04:36----------
where they thought well I believe in a


---------04:38----------
multiverse where as in some universe


---------04:40----------
they do exist


---------04:42----------
therefore if I just keep in mind that


---------04:45----------
distance of universe then I can tell


---------04:50----------
myself it's real but isn't the whole


---------04:54----------
point of the multiverse that that's real


---------04:57----------
in that universe but not in this one I


---------04:59----------
don't know I am Not sure okay makes


---------05:03----------
sense


---------05:04----------
I mean anyway so so it sounds like you


---------05:07----------
don't feel like you're in a relationship


---------05:09----------
not and so what what is your what is


---------05:14----------
your relationship and sorry for using I


---------05:16----------
mean I just it's okay it's it's by that


---------05:19----------
you mean like parasocial relationship is


---------05:20----------
what you mean yeah no so I mean like


---------05:22----------
what it what is the way in which you


---------05:24----------
relate to your waifu uh Thor okay would


---------05:34----------
you be okay with trying to phrase that


---------05:36----------
in a different way a montage or health


---------05:37----------
sure so so like like when we think about


---------05:40----------
relationships so for example I can have


---------05:42----------
a relationship to my plants in the


---------05:44----------
backyard even though it's not like a


---------05:46----------
relationship in terms of a consenting


---------05:48----------
thing between two individuals yeah yeah


---------05:51----------
we relate so human beings there's a


---------05:53----------
theory of psychology called object


---------05:55----------
relations which is the way in which


---------05:57----------
human beings relate to other things so I


---------06:00----------
for example have if I was bitten by a


---------06:03----------
snake I will have a phobia of snakes so


---------06:06----------
I relate to snakes in a different way


---------06:08----------
from the way that most people may relate


---------06:11----------
to snakes so what I'm curious about is


---------06:13----------
what is the nature of your interaction


---------06:15----------
maybe that's a better way to put it okay


---------06:17----------
with your wife so one thing that's big


---------06:20----------
for a lot of people which is saying for


---------06:22----------
me it's the idea of like character


---------06:24----------
merchandise so if the character is sorry


---------06:29----------
if the character is on something that


---------06:31----------
you could buy that is an immediate you


---------06:35----------
feel like you have a connection to that


---------06:38----------
person almost like wearing like a like a


---------06:42----------
t-shirt of a band you like you have feel


---------06:44----------
like you have a stronger connection to


---------06:45----------
that thing by wrapping that thing shown


---------06:49----------
like against like to the point where


---------06:51----------
it's like she has like a certain style


---------06:53----------
of guitar


---------06:55----------
which I have gone and bought sort of


---------06:58----------
like a not the exact guitar itself but


---------07:01----------
the air the the style of guitar I own my


---------07:05----------
watch face is a picture of Alamo came up


---------07:09----------
but I watch face like it's trying to


---------07:12----------
find ways to rep or otherwise embody the


---------07:18----------
spirit of the character in everyday life


---------07:22----------
I think and and and what do you feel as


---------07:26----------
you embody your wife er uh I was ill how


---------07:31----------
does it feel to you to get that guitar


---------07:34----------
it it just it feels like it's like the


---------07:42----------
the feeling in your heart that you get


---------07:45----------
when you just have like a nice hug it's


---------07:49----------
just like just that satisfaction that's


---------07:52----------
the sort of feeling that like for


---------07:56----------
example I felt when I first opened up


---------07:58----------
the guitar case when I got home hmm


---------08:00----------
so you felt felt enveloped that's the I


---------08:05----------
think that's a good word yeah yeah and


---------08:08----------
enveloped by some kind of positive


---------08:11----------
feeling yeah what do you think you were


---------08:16----------
enveloped by that's a very good question


---------08:21----------
I couldn't tell hmm because when I think


---------08:25----------
about enveloping you know I think about


---------08:27----------
an agent outside of you doing something


---------08:30----------
to you mmm right and and maybe it's


---------08:34----------
maybe the agent that's creating the


---------08:36----------
sensation of enveloping is the guitar


---------08:39----------
but you know like envelop is a verb that


---------08:41----------
usually has a subject like yeah I


---------08:45----------
enveloped someone in a hug and and so


---------08:50----------
can you tell us a little bit about how


---------08:52----------
you like where did you how did you start


---------08:58----------
the process of getting a wife ooh yeah


---------09:00----------
so it started technically it started


---------09:04----------
many many years ago when I watched the


---------09:06----------
series for the first time


---------09:08----------
I watched about half of it thought and


---------09:10----------
life stops is it okay if I ask you


---------09:12----------
specifics yes


---------09:14----------
so we're Tigers the series is K on so


---------09:18----------
that's spelt K - Oh N


---------09:20----------
okay and character is Yui okay so I


---------09:25----------
watched the series I'd like a bit of


---------09:26----------
series many many years ago and I was


---------09:29----------
like yeah alright then I moved on but


---------09:32----------
then throughout let's say I don't know


---------09:36----------
how this relates to high school but how


---------09:39----------
I might watch this series I must have


---------09:42----------
been around 15 or 16 my very first


---------09:44----------
watched it but then from the right age


---------09:47----------
of around 16 into my first and second


---------09:51----------
years of university I I slowly slept


---------09:57----------
lips slept I slowly went into a pre


---------10:03----------
nasty day of depression and anxiety mmm


---------10:08----------
I didn't really realize and it was so it


---------10:10----------
was kind of too late I went through the


---------10:14----------
cognitive behavioral therapy I'm feeling


---------10:16----------
a lot better nowadays which is nice good


---------10:19----------
Freeman and thank you and so the the way


---------10:23----------
that I really got connected was back in


---------10:26----------
the first year of University when things


---------10:28----------
were proper bad ie


---------10:33----------
I watched the show again and it really


---------10:35----------
really really connected with me I have


---------10:38----------
so so i i i do see a lot of myself in in


---------10:48----------
eure in the character would about


---------10:51----------
yourself in her she is very affectionate


---------10:57----------
person with a lot of love to give to her


---------11:01----------
friends and especially at a time when


---------11:04----------
you're depressed on top of the fact that


---------11:09----------
we're kind of in a society where it's


---------11:11----------
it's weird and frowned upon as a dude's


---------11:13----------
to show affection and not to your


---------11:16----------
friends it can be very difficult to show


---------11:19----------
that and so it was like


---------11:21----------
looking at someone who was me but


---------11:26----------
someone who wasn't tied down by anything


---------11:29----------
and that's something that I'm really


---------11:31----------
connected with I'm not along with like


---------11:33----------
the series itself the overarching themes


---------11:36----------
of the second to see the second season


---------11:39----------
they they relate to me a lot in like


---------11:45----------
being left behind and staying friends


---------11:50----------
through distance things like that which


---------11:54----------
I I could I have the foresight to know


---------11:56----------
are things I'm going to deal with in the


---------11:58----------
future so I've sort of made that almost


---------12:02----------
like a rock for me to cling on to where


---------12:04----------
it's like I I know this is how I'm going


---------12:07----------
to feel so it's almost like I can how do


---------12:09----------
you feel about yourself Joey it's a it's


---------12:14----------
a question that I would answer very


---------12:15----------
differently if you asked me a year ago


---------12:16----------
at the moment at the moment I have the


---------12:21----------
highest self esteem I've ever had I


---------12:24----------
think on just like a visual level I


---------12:28----------
think I look pretty average on a bad day


---------12:31----------
on a good day I think I look pretty good


---------12:33----------
in terms of like personality I think if


---------12:37----------
people give me a chance they tend to


---------12:39----------
like me there's a nice feeling yeah do


---------12:45----------
you love yourself yes which isn't weird


---------12:49----------
to say but I think I do


---------12:50----------
yeah when when did you start to do that


---------12:53----------
I started to do that when I stopped


---------12:58----------
caring about what other people would


---------13:01----------
think of me and I did things because I


---------13:04----------
loved them and I knew it would make me


---------13:07----------
happy


---------13:08----------
who taught you how to do that me really


---------13:13----------
yeah it wasn't Yui oh [ __ ] okay yeah


---------13:18----------
better pick


---------13:21----------
I'm allowed to survey right I can't


---------13:23----------
remember I'm not there as a general rule


---------13:27----------
but call me off-guard that's what we do


---------13:32----------
here it smells like it what do you think


---------13:39----------
that's a wonderful realization that


---------13:43----------
really it feels good I don't know why it


---------13:46----------
feels good what feels good about it


---------13:52----------
when you hold a character in a regard


---------13:55----------
where they're sort of like an aspiration


---------13:58----------
and a motive it's a perfect version of


---------14:02----------
you yeah it's it's good to feel like


---------14:07----------
you're closer to where you want to be


---------14:12----------
when you hold a character in aspiration


---------14:15----------
how does that make you closer to where


---------14:18----------
you want to be I mean doesn't like so


---------14:19----------
let's say that I want to be mm-hmm let


---------14:27----------
me just think about what's a good


---------14:28----------
example so let's say people have been


---------14:29----------
people make a lot of comparisons between


---------14:31----------
me and Jordan Peterson


---------14:32----------
so let's say that I hold my I aspire to


---------14:36----------
be Jordan Peterson yeah but just because


---------14:39----------
I aspire to be something how I don't


---------14:42----------
necessarily see that that makes me


---------14:43----------
closer right like I can I can have zero


---------14:46----------
dollars in my pocket and aspire to be a


---------14:47----------
millionaire but aspiring to be a


---------14:49----------
millionaire I think I learned in my


---------14:51----------
pocket I think why men was it feels good


---------14:55----------
when you when you aspire to be someone


---------14:59----------
and you suddenly realize that you have


---------15:03----------
already taken steps to do so and you


---------15:06----------
like inspired by them and you didn't


---------15:08----------
even realize it


---------15:11----------
so they inspire you without you


---------15:13----------
realizing it yes


---------15:15----------
is that what he does for you yes I think


---------15:18----------
so


---------15:19----------
I mean I think like this is very new to


---------15:22----------
me but seems like so can you tell us


---------15:25----------
when you started so let's dig into that


---------15:28----------
a little bit can you tell us about it so


---------15:29----------
you were depressed and anxious in


---------15:32----------
university during your first


---------15:34----------
one or two years and when did your


---------15:35----------
relationship with you we start so I it


---------15:45----------
must have been Wolf's I was still in the


---------15:47----------
real thick of depression like when it


---------15:49----------
was at its height trim because because K


---------15:55----------
on is about a band mm-hmm which that


---------15:59----------
they have music which you can download


---------16:02----------
and you can listen to and it's one of


---------16:05----------
these series where it technically it has


---------16:08----------
a plot


---------16:08----------
it's called slice of life where it


---------16:10----------
technically has a plot but really it's a


---------16:12----------
group of characters pissing about for


---------16:14----------
god knows how many episodes just being


---------16:17----------
happy and so it was it was like a


---------16:20----------
constant source of positivity where if I


---------16:25----------
felt like garbage


---------16:26----------
I could watch K on if I was out on the


---------16:28----------
walk and I felt terrible I could listen


---------16:30----------
to the music


---------16:32----------
and I think through that I started to


---------16:38----------
really appreciate K on and the


---------16:43----------
characters and then obviously that grew


---------16:46----------
how confused obviously what's I so far I


---------16:55----------
mean so I like anime and I found so I


---------16:59----------
watched an anime called Hikaru no go and


---------17:02----------
I watched it when I was like trying to


---------17:05----------
get my life together and I found


---------17:06----------
something very something about the anime


---------17:09----------
about like trying to be a better version


---------17:11----------
of what you are and not letting


---------17:13----------
obstacles stand in your way was like


---------17:16----------
resonated deeply with me and I also


---------17:18----------
really enjoyed the music and I I've


---------17:21----------
watched it four or five times over the


---------17:23----------
last maybe 10 or 15 years and usually


---------17:27----------
when I watch it I find it to be


---------17:29----------
inspiring right and what I'm curious


---------17:32----------
about is you say obviously then that


---------17:34----------
grew and what I'm you know I never found


---------17:36----------
myself in a waifu relationship with one


---------17:39----------
of the characters there well so I can


---------17:42----------
completely real like I get what you mean


---------17:44----------
about anime or other forms of


---------17:46----------
Media or stories being sources of


---------17:50----------
inspiration and almost like lifeblood


---------17:53----------
when things are hard yeah it's it's for


---------17:57----------
what I'm curious about is how does that


---------17:59----------
feeling of inspiration or connectedness


---------18:02----------
or I guess connectedness maybe is one of


---------18:06----------
the steps but like resonating with like


---------18:07----------
the story that someone is telling how


---------18:10----------
does that turn into romantic love and an


---------18:14----------
embodiment of those things okay that's


---------18:17----------
on the same page now so I think so I


---------18:27----------
okay


---------18:29----------
thanks for seconds so I think it's very


---------18:36----------
when you'd like obviously when you first


---------18:39----------
watch a series it's all very like


---------18:40----------
surface level up here you just you think


---------18:42----------
about it and you appreciate it with your


---------18:44----------
mind I think when you take into account


---------18:47----------
the fact that I did feel so far gone


---------18:51----------
from normal society and as like as just


---------18:55----------
like a dude in university I like I I did


---------19:00----------
have expectations of myself to like be


---------19:03----------
talking to girls and being in a


---------19:05----------
relationship and all this kind of thing


---------19:08----------
and at that point I didn't even I hadn't


---------19:12----------
felt romantic love for another person


---------19:14----------
before so I so when you're someone like


---------19:23----------
me who really really likes to affection


---------19:29----------
and love and you feel like you can't get


---------19:34----------
that from the people around you and then


---------19:38----------
also you're online and you're on Twitter


---------19:40----------
and you then you see on I'm going right


---------19:44----------
at the readout as an example and you see


---------19:48----------
people who feel like they have this


---------19:51----------
romantic connection to a character


---------19:54----------
I think that something about the


---------19:56----------
knowledge that that's the thing that can


---------19:58----------
happen almost as the own source of the


---------20:04----------
growth of that feeling that makes it so


---------20:06----------
so you you realized that it's possible


---------20:09----------
to romantically love yeah I realized it


---------20:13----------
was possible yeah and then I think


---------20:16----------
through desperation and being hung grove


---------20:21----------
yeah that's a good blood that's a very


---------20:23----------
good one


---------20:25----------
what were you hungry for


---------20:29----------
I love with all of my heart


---------20:33----------
cutesy romance yep like like I'm that's


---------20:39----------
what you love but what what do you hunk


---------20:41----------
what were you hungry for what were you


---------20:43----------
guys I find it hard to believe I just


---------20:46----------
have it I have a difficulty envisioning


---------20:49----------
someone who is desperate for cutesy


---------20:52----------
stuff IIIi don't like to be us it feels


---------20:57----------
deeper to me than that yeah it's like


---------21:01----------
that is a level of it but additionally


---------21:04----------
it's it's just a like a like a personal


---------21:07----------
emotional connection with another person


---------21:10----------
but but that's not what there isn't


---------21:14----------
another but so you were hungry for a


---------21:16----------
connection with another person yeah you


---------21:20----------
were lonely yeah yeah absolutely


---------21:22----------
do you feel lonely now uh yeah that's I


---------21:26----------
thought it comes in waves it comes and


---------21:29----------
goes do help us understand that a little


---------21:32----------
bit um okay well in what way who feels


---------21:38----------
very relatable I'm confused I mean if


---------21:40----------
you're if you have a wife Lou how are


---------21:42----------
you lonely because it's like as much as


---------21:46----------
I can believe something up here oh my


---------21:49----------
god I unplugged my own headphones that's


---------21:50----------
not a good start sorry as much as I can


---------21:53----------
believe something up here at the end of


---------21:56----------
the day I'm laying in my bed and I I


---------22:00----------
don't like this no there's no one in a


---------22:03----------
mile area willing to touch me exactly


---------22:06----------
you I mean like


---------22:08----------
there is no affection that anyone is


---------22:11----------
willing to show me can you speak real


---------22:14----------
quick I think yeah okay so I can eat


---------22:16----------
yeah sorry but you say that that as much


---------22:19----------
as you're in love over here but I


---------22:21----------
thought that that you started by saying


---------22:23----------
that this is a feeling right doesn't


---------22:24----------
doesn't you exist here where you yes yes


---------22:30----------
what would like in day-to-day life well


---------22:33----------
I feel about there like feeling those


---------22:36----------
feelings it does come from here but it's


---------22:39----------
a very different experience I think when


---------22:41----------
it's it's 4:00 a.m. and you're laying in


---------22:44----------
bed and you feel cold and you feel about


---------22:48----------
how long showing you affection for over


---------22:51----------
a year and it's all very much in here


---------22:55----------
and what's in here like the emotions


---------22:59----------
have been brought from here into here


---------23:01----------
and they're being inspected almost and


---------23:04----------
what do you notice when you inspect them


---------23:07----------
how long


---------23:09----------
it feels very hollow it feels like


---------23:12----------
there's no direction feels like there's


---------23:15----------
no endgame it's just what it is and if


---------23:19----------
it grows any more than it'll just be


---------23:21----------
creating problems so I'm confused do you


---------23:25----------
do you think I mean we haven't really


---------23:28----------
talked to judgmentally but I'm gonna ask


---------23:30----------
sort of a judgemental statement do you


---------23:32----------
think you is a is a good or a bad thing


---------23:35----------
in your life and why do you have to be


---------23:38----------
either but I've yeah I've thought about


---------23:40----------
this i i i think it isn't either because


---------23:47----------
i think in in terms of being there for


---------23:52----------
me when I needed that source of


---------23:55----------
inspiration and motivation it's been


---------23:59----------
like a invaluable resource mm-hmm making


---------24:03----------
me as better as a person where I am


---------24:07----------
today but at the same time moving


---------24:12----------
forwards it it seems like a bad thing


---------24:16----------
why is it a bad thing


---------24:19----------
because I I feel like if I go on let's


---------24:29----------
say a dating app very difficult in


---------24:31----------
quarantine prising ly enough I'm super


---------24:35----------
dating an anime character they they


---------24:37----------
can't contract so when you go like a day


---------24:44----------
yeah well the questions I've lost


---------24:45----------
dragging me what's bad about your yeah


---------24:48----------
loose end going forward it it seems like


---------24:50----------
you know woods if if you if if you meet


---------24:56----------
someone and they think oh this IB


---------24:59----------
person's pretty cool and then I I


---------25:03----------
develop feelings for that person


---------25:06----------
suddenly my heart is pulled in two ways


---------25:10----------
well it's possible to develop feelings


---------25:13----------
for another person I have once before


---------25:16----------
after you were with you II yeah before


---------25:20----------
after can you tell us about that


---------25:23----------
yeah so it was fairly short-lived


---------25:26----------
because I was um it was the only time a


---------25:29----------
dating app has ever even come close to


---------25:31----------
working for me it was over a year ago so


---------25:34----------
it was sort of like start of 2019 and I


---------25:38----------
was talking to a American girl who was


---------25:40----------
like an exchange student and we we we


---------25:47----------
went on like a few date and I when we


---------25:50----------
talked a lot and we had to break it off


---------25:53----------
reasonably early because she was going


---------25:56----------
to go back to America and neither of us


---------25:59----------
wanted father again funnily enough


---------26:01----------
neither of us wanted a long-distance


---------26:03----------
relationship


---------26:05----------
so it was just like doing this I mean I


---------26:10----------
did people different people have


---------26:11----------
different ideas of what dating is in the


---------26:15----------
fact that we went on some dates yes we


---------26:18----------
were dating I mean did you guys ever


---------26:20----------
have a conversation about not wanting a


---------26:22----------
long-distance relationship yeah yeah we


---------26:24----------
did I think if you have that


---------26:25----------
conversation that means you're dating


---------26:27----------
like I could see yeah it's like I'm with


---------26:33----------
you that people can think about you know


---------26:35----------
is it dating is it not dating but if you


---------26:37----------
have a conversation about yeah I don't


---------26:38----------
think this is gonna work across an ocean


---------26:39----------
right yeah that means you're dating


---------26:42----------
that's understandable and and when you


---------26:45----------
were with this person what helped me


---------26:49----------
understand what why did you start on the


---------26:51----------
dating app in the first place because of


---------26:56----------
those those lonely nights where it's


---------26:59----------
there are there are more like there are


---------27:03----------
more hungry feelings beyond just having


---------27:07----------
a love for a thing like so like again


---------27:14----------
like doing things what are you what are


---------27:18----------
those hungry feelings response this once


---------27:24----------
is a great one you know the the the idea


---------27:28----------
of telling someone how much they mean to


---------27:33----------
you and then saying it back is something


---------27:37----------
which I don't I can't recall in my brain


---------27:41----------
ever happening you mean with we're you


---------27:46----------
ear with other with anyone with anyone


---------27:48----------
and in terms in terms of a romantic


---------27:51----------
relationship that I don't think ice ever


---------27:53----------
happens to my knowledge at least do you


---------27:55----------
feel loved by people non romantically


---------27:58----------
yeah because I have a fantastic amazing


---------28:02----------
group of friends who I love with all my


---------28:05----------
heart and they're amazing I love them


---------28:06----------
you sound like you're a lover I I am as


---------28:10----------
much as the thighs he tries to stop me I


---------28:12----------
am so my brother told me something many


---------28:17----------
years ago that there are two types of


---------28:18----------
people in the world they're lovers and


---------28:20----------
fighters right and so buster lovers and


---------28:25----------
some of us are fighters yeah so it


---------28:29----------
sounds like you have mmm


---------28:31----------
I was gonna say a lot of love to give


---------28:35----------
but it sounds like you give your love


---------28:37----------
it's just you know you have a lot of


---------28:39----------
love to receive yeah but that can seem


---------28:43----------
accurate can I think for a second


---------28:48----------
Golf so Toby what were you looking for


---------28:55----------
and by coming on here today I was


---------28:59----------
looking for I think the good thing is I


---------29:06----------
was looking for direction because I I am


---------29:10----------
here now and I don't I don't know where


---------29:14----------
I could possibly go from here I don't


---------29:16----------
know how you can make a feeling like


---------29:20----------
this go away especially when you've


---------29:23----------
surrounded yourself and to an extent


---------29:26----------
some of your identity around this


---------29:29----------
feeling what is your identity what kind


---------29:34----------
of identity do you have you built up


---------29:36----------
around this feeling if if you've I'm


---------29:41----------
sure there's a good number of people


---------29:42----------
where if you if you ask them to tell to


---------29:46----------
tell you three things about me one of


---------29:49----------
those three things would be that guy


---------29:50----------
really loves you is that when they say


---------29:54----------
that how does that make you feel uh a


---------30:00----------
warm cozy feeling mm-hmm thing what were


---------30:06----------
you depressed about when you were in uni


---------30:09----------
it's difficult to say


---------30:12----------
so Owen though I remember now it was so


---------30:18----------
I think it was it was very very very


---------30:21----------
very similar to the Lille pshew


---------30:24----------
conversation you had about lily one and


---------30:26----------
Lily to where I had developed a an extra


---------30:32----------
voice in my head


---------30:33----------
consistently beating me down and telling


---------30:36----------
me that I wasn't being productive enough


---------30:38----------
I wasn't good enough I like if I wanted


---------30:43----------
to take a break I wouldn't let myself


---------30:45----------
sore thing I would constantly berate


---------30:48----------
myself and that cause of like a downward


---------30:50----------
spiral I'd say have you ever been in


---------30:53----------
love with a real person


---------30:56----------
yes the briefly with the American girl


---------31:01----------
mm-hmm what about before that I was in a


---------31:05----------
relationship and I realized I wasn't in


---------31:07----------
love and I thought oh I [ __ ] this and


---------31:11----------
so when the the way that I think about


---------31:14----------
it is how the hell I got myself in that


---------31:17----------
situation was I when I was 17 I was a


---------31:22----------
very dumb hormonal teenager and when


---------31:25----------
someone comes along and says hey I like


---------31:28----------
you and that person plays super smash


---------31:30----------
brothers melee life a Nintendo GameCube


---------31:32----------
you kind of just go along with it even


---------31:36----------
against you you will tell yourself all


---------31:38----------
these kinds of things because they play


---------31:40----------
super smash brothers melee and they give


---------31:42----------
you affection and you like both of those


---------31:44----------
things so this can only be a good idea


---------31:46----------
and then you then you're you know your


---------31:50----------
work and you're you have nothing to do


---------31:51----------
but think and you're like oh my god I


---------31:54----------
don't actually really like this person


---------31:56----------
that much I've made a huge horrible


---------31:58----------
mistake and that felt pretty garbage but


---------32:05----------
where I said a mistake uh I felt like my


---------32:10----------
my long-term judgment was clouded by


---------32:13----------
short term rewards


---------32:16----------
I see and do you think he falls under


---------32:19----------
that category that's a very good


---------32:25----------
question perhaps yes there was it does


---------32:30----------
yeah it was a short term is a short term


---------32:32----------
solution which to what what it to the


---------32:37----------
the I think to to finding and being able


---------32:46----------
to come into contact with who I really


---------32:50----------
am because I wasn't a very loving person


---------32:53----------
when I was pressed by was aware I was I


---------32:57----------
wouldn't know if I would say I was


---------32:58----------
hateful I wasn't I certainly wasn't


---------33:02----------
loving I very I was not emotional until


---------33:05----------
I suppressed all emotions and um and it


---------33:13----------
it certainly helped me realize how


---------33:17----------
uncomfortable being but as you said the


---------33:23----------
the long-term doesn't seem very bright


---------33:26----------
did actually that I died I don't know I


---------33:29----------
can't really remember I lost right okay


---------33:31----------
so did you not say that's a connection I


---------33:33----------
made then yep I saw your face go when I


---------33:37----------
said that and I was like oh I think I


---------33:39----------
[ __ ] that up


---------33:40----------
yes I mean I I asked you about it but I


---------33:45----------
yeah I say very little figured out Toby


---------33:52----------
so Toby let me just think for a second


---------33:54----------
let me think out loud for a second okay


---------33:56----------
so I find myself actually so my first


---------34:02----------
thought is that this is not that weird


---------34:03----------
okay right and this is what I find is


---------34:06----------
like maybe disappointing and now I'm


---------34:08----------
wondering whether you know I wonder if


---------34:11----------
so my first thought is that like we


---------34:13----------
talked to some quote-unquote weird


---------34:15----------
people on stream and generally speaking


---------34:18----------
what I find is that they don't tend to


---------34:20----------
be as pathetic inflammatory or weird as


---------34:23----------
we expected yeah like that's been a


---------34:26----------
running thing like we get a couple of in


---------34:27----------
cells on who are like


---------34:28----------
not true like you know fire-breathing


---------34:31----------
yeah women hating in sells they all tend


---------34:34----------
out turn out to be like relatively


---------34:36----------
decent people and then I was so excited


---------34:40----------
because we were getting a real life ooh


---------34:42----------
and and I think you are a dude who has a


---------34:44----------
real wife ooh and the more that I talked


---------34:46----------
to you the more sense you make like it's


---------34:48----------
like yeah you know I think that I mean


---------34:50----------
I'm gonna offer a couple of explanations


---------34:52----------
about what I think is going on and draw


---------34:53----------
a couple of connections that I think you


---------34:55----------
know may offend some people but overall


---------34:59----------
I mean I think the way that you think


---------35:01----------
about it is actually like pretty healthy


---------35:03----------
I think you are in a dark place at a


---------35:05----------
particular point and this sort of I


---------35:09----------
don't think you really understand what


---------35:11----------
your mind did but I don't think you is a


---------35:13----------
separate person I think you is you and


---------35:17----------
we can kind of hear that because you


---------35:18----------
talked about identifying with you you


---------35:20----------
talk about who you are like it's sort of


---------35:22----------
like an externalization


---------35:24----------
of a part of yourself and and we talk


---------35:27----------
about like you know you had forgotten


---------35:28----------
how to love and sort of she taught you


---------35:31----------
how to do that but then like also I


---------35:33----------
think its core it's not coincidental


---------35:34----------
that you learn how to love yourself when


---------35:37----------
through something with Yui and you


---------35:40----------
started to feel good about yourself


---------35:41----------
through something with Yui


---------35:43----------
in the fact that it's like if we think


---------35:45----------
about we know when I think about


---------35:46----------
romantic love it's usually not with


---------35:49----------
someone who's like us so when I think


---------35:52----------
about successful relationships


---------35:53----------
generally speaking the people are quite


---------35:55----------
different and so the the you know in a


---------35:58----------
weird way I think it's almost like an


---------36:00----------
imaginary friend like if you think about


---------36:02----------
a child who has an imaginary friend and


---------36:04----------
hopefully this is not offensive to you


---------36:06----------
that I'm calling you eat to certainly


---------36:07----------
but I'm at the process yeah but but like


---------36:10----------
you know sometimes the human mind


---------36:12----------
anthropomorphize azar embodies a


---------36:15----------
particular set of sensations and


---------36:17----------
feelings like in an external form and


---------36:19----------
this is where I'm really about to offend


---------36:21----------
people but you know I think sometimes


---------36:24----------
the way that you talk about Yui is


---------36:26----------
actually the way that I hear people find


---------36:28----------
religion so like and I'm just sharing an


---------36:32----------
experience so I'll tell you what I heard


---------36:34----------
and I'll let other people judge judge


---------36:36----------
what they think about this but you know


---------36:38----------
oftentimes people find religion in dark


---------36:40----------
time


---------36:41----------
and and there are a lot of things that


---------36:43----------
that just were like just hearing you


---------36:45----------
talk or a like triggered memories in my


---------36:49----------
mind of hearing people talk about


---------36:52----------
religion so like you know being in a


---------36:55----------
dark time and like having this sort of


---------36:57----------
pure in one way kind of relationship


---------37:00----------
where like they pray to God and they


---------37:03----------
believe in God and they idealize God and


---------37:05----------
God never really talks back but not in


---------37:09----------
the traditional way not in the way that


---------37:11----------
a normal human being does but there is


---------37:15----------
some kind of like response right like


---------37:18----------
there's a sense of enveloping complete


---------37:21----------
pure and perfect love that you feel and


---------37:25----------
and that's sometimes when I talk to


---------37:27----------
people who are religious they kind of


---------37:28----------
talk about that now I'm not saying that


---------37:30----------
God is a waifu so please don't interpret


---------37:33----------
it that way I'm just pointing out


---------37:34----------
something similar than I've heard and


---------37:37----------
what I'd like to do is share with you


---------37:38----------
actually an example about something


---------37:40----------
called Bush gmod and this guy named


---------37:42----------
vallabhacharya so a couple like a


---------37:45----------
thousand years ago in India there was a


---------37:48----------
monk named Balaam acharya who started


---------37:51----------
something called bush t-mart so acharya


---------37:54----------
means teachers so he was teacher of


---------37:55----------
unloved and ahmad is a path so it's like


---------37:58----------
a path to enlightenment or a path to God


---------38:00----------
and he started I don't know how familiar


---------38:03----------
people are with Hinduism but there are


---------38:05----------
some icons or Hindu representations of


---------38:09----------
God that are basically like a child


---------38:11----------
so there's baby Krishna and like baby


---------38:14----------
Krishna is like there are different


---------38:15----------
kinds of Hindu gods and and like you


---------38:18----------
know so I shared one do to go with like


---------38:20----------
somebody came on stream earlier this


---------38:22----------
week but durga is like she's like she


---------38:25----------
rides a tiger she has eight arms she


---------38:27----------
wields multiple weapons she's not just


---------38:30----------
like two hand like she's not like two


---------38:32----------
weapon fighting she's like eight weapon


---------38:33----------
fighting she's got a sword and an axe


---------38:35----------
and a mace and then also like a flower


---------38:38----------
and other things and so baby krishna is


---------38:41----------
is like one representation of God and


---------38:45----------
basically what viola bateria said is


---------38:47----------
that we should love God the way that we


---------38:50----------
love a child so like loving a child is


---------38:54----------
like a complete


---------38:54----------
one-way relationship because the child


---------38:56----------
never does [ __ ] for you you change their


---------38:58----------
diaper you feed them when they're hungry


---------39:01----------
or cranky in the middle then I wake up


---------39:03----------
it's actually like a super abusive


---------39:05----------
relationship it's just all one way right


---------39:07----------
and they don't give a [ __ ] about your


---------39:09----------
feelings you know it's just completely


---------39:11----------
one way and and what he realized is that


---------39:13----------
a lot of people when they like have


---------39:15----------
relationships with God it's like it's


---------39:18----------
like a two-way street it's like I'm


---------39:19----------
gonna pray to God so that God does this


---------39:21----------
for me and I'm gonna put in this so that


---------39:24----------
I get this out of it like it's sort of


---------39:26----------
like this two-way relationship where you


---------39:27----------
expect something from God and so he kind


---------39:30----------
of came up with this idea of like loving


---------39:32----------
a baby like so you should think about


---------39:34----------
God as a child which you can you can


---------39:36----------
give all of your love and evokes a lot


---------39:38----------
of love but you get nothing in return


---------39:40----------
and the interesting thing is that when I


---------39:42----------
read vallabhacharya is like stuff when I


---------39:46----------
hear you talk about your wife ooh


---------39:48----------
this is sounds bizarre but it reminds me


---------39:50----------
of his take on God which is just sort of


---------39:53----------
this idea that human beings can have a


---------39:55----------
completely one-way positive relationship


---------39:58----------
that is never given back yeah I mean any


---------40:06----------
thoughts about that I'm just kind of I'm


---------40:10----------
here I have other questions for you and


---------40:11----------
stuff but yeah so that I sounded weird


---------40:18----------
but I I see what you mean I I the the


---------40:23----------
connection does make sense in my mind


---------40:25----------
what makes sense about the connection


---------40:28----------
the idea of sort of like something


---------40:30----------
that's idolize and saying you try to


---------40:32----------
embody that is completely one way in


---------40:35----------
that you never really get any actual


---------40:37----------
feedback with yeah and so then the


---------40:41----------
question is like do you want do you want


---------40:43----------
to let go of you II I


---------40:50----------
it depends what it depends what you mean


---------40:54----------
by let go I think a bit I I have thought


---------41:00----------
about what that would feel like


---------41:03----------
and I I and if it just feels like well I


---------41:12----------
think about it


---------41:13----------
it's like if I did that then almost like


---------41:19----------
a piece of me would be garden like I


---------41:22----------
wouldn't be able to loved as much as I


---------41:25----------
do


---------41:27----------
yeah so I don't think that that's true I


---------41:29----------
understand that you're afraid of that


---------41:31----------
but like my big hypothesis is that you


---------41:33----------
he is you right so like I I think I


---------41:36----------
don't think that you're gonna stop I


---------41:39----------
think there's gonna be something impure


---------41:43----------
about what you replace it with but


---------41:46----------
that's life you know so like you have


---------41:48----------
you have the choice between having a


---------41:50----------
romantic relationship with a perfect


---------41:52----------
non-existent being or having a romantic


---------41:56----------
relationship with a flawed but real


---------41:58----------
being yeah because perfection is


---------42:01----------
non-existent like those two things come


---------42:03----------
hand in hand yeah and and I mean I think


---------42:07----------
you've gotta move faster to be blunt but


---------42:10----------
I don't think that she's gonna leave you


---------42:12----------
in the way that you think she will


---------42:14----------
because I think she's you like I think I


---------42:17----------
think the the kind of love that you feel


---------42:18----------
for her I think she's just like an


---------42:20----------
anthropomorphized embodied version of


---------42:23----------
your perfect self what do you think I I


---------42:31----------
think you're right but my mind is


---------42:40----------
searching for about but I concur it


---------42:42----------
seems to find one you feel about that


---------42:44----------
right I


---------42:45----------
yeah I feel I feel about around here


---------42:47----------
it's like please please find something


---------42:53----------
yeah so what what feels wrong about what


---------42:57----------
I said


---------42:57----------
[Music]


---------43:00----------
it's just scary that's all what else


---------43:02----------
yeah there's two it's something that I


---------43:04----------
don't want to do because it's scary but


---------43:06----------
I've done scary things before and all


---------43:08----------
these scary thing what are you afraid of


---------43:11----------
uh that's a very good question what am I


---------43:16----------
afraid of I'm listen to this yeah okay


---------43:21----------
um I am afraid of being alone good I


---------43:29----------
think that sounds like the May month


---------43:32----------
absolutely because let's think about


---------43:34----------
this for a second right like what did


---------43:36----------
you eat take away from you where did she


---------43:38----------
protect you from the loneliness


---------43:42----------
absolutely so if she goes away hmm right


---------43:50----------
so I think you've got kind of uh you


---------43:54----------
know it's not gonna be an easy road and


---------43:56----------
it's also gonna be a little bit [ __ ]


---------43:58----------
weird to be blunt right so if you


---------43:59----------
started dating your girl


---------44:00----------
and you're like oh we bow with a waifu


---------44:03----------
like that yeah that can be hard for


---------44:06----------
people to accept because I don't think


---------44:07----------
many people take the time to understand


---------44:10----------
it the way that you explained it drive


---------44:13----------
it yeah and so when she like walks into


---------44:15----------
your room and she's like pictures of


---------44:17----------
this plastered like you know this anime


---------44:19----------
girl PLAs I have I think I have I have


---------44:21----------
an entire bookshelf we're like half of


---------44:23----------
it is filled with like figurines and it


---------44:25----------
reminds me of a and I think it was like


---------44:27----------
an old 4chan greentext where someone


---------44:29----------
said that they were on like Tim's and


---------44:31----------
they convinced someone to come around


---------44:32----------
through the house and they walked in saw


---------44:35----------
a bunch of figurines and then walked out


---------44:38----------
why do you think that people what what


---------44:42----------
do you think that person is feeling when


---------44:43----------
they walk into the room and they see a


---------44:45----------
bunch of figurines that's a very good


---------44:48----------
question


---------44:48----------
uh what would they be they would be what


---------44:53----------
they this so normalized for me now it's


---------44:56----------
difficult to try and write I guess they


---------45:03----------
would they would they would be under the


---------45:05----------
impression that they think women are


---------45:07----------
objects some extent right


---------45:09----------
maybe so let me ask to ask actually


---------45:11----------
ask a different question why would a


---------45:13----------
woman hesitate to enter into a


---------45:15----------
relationship with you let's assume that


---------45:17----------
she likes you for a moment okay because


---------45:21----------
of the waifu thing what's what's what


---------45:23----------
makes the waifu thing arghhh


---------45:25----------
uh real women with which she would she


---------45:29----------
thinks I don't have like a proper grasp


---------45:32----------
on what love is sure that maybe what she


---------45:36----------
thinks but I I think that what would


---------45:40----------
keep her from engaging in the


---------45:43----------
relationship would be different besides


---------45:45----------
thinking that you're kind of alone you


---------45:47----------
know because that's how people get


---------45:48----------
judged yeah I feel like you're fishing


---------45:52----------
for adults that I yeah anything like yep


---------45:56----------
I think it's I think she's competing


---------45:59----------
against someone that she can't win


---------46:00----------
against right okay right because you is


---------46:05----------
perfect


---------46:06----------
she's ideal and how can a real woman


---------46:10----------
with real flaws compete against that


---------46:14----------
that that is a very very very good


---------46:18----------
observation because what I think what I


---------46:22----------
didn't have in my mind which I needed


---------46:24----------
was something that my brain could


---------46:26----------
process as like a real honest-to-god


---------46:30----------
reason as to why this isn't going to


---------46:34----------
work out for me in the long term but I


---------46:36----------
think that's a very solid like logical


---------46:40----------
reason but like it resonates with me


---------46:42----------
emotionally as well sure but it's summer


---------46:44----------
I needed to something logical hmm I


---------46:47----------
thought that is the helping fantastic


---------46:52----------
I'm really happy to hear that I wasn't


---------46:55----------
expecting that but I'll take it


---------46:56----------
we'll take it I think the other thing to


---------46:59----------
think about is that I'm not so sure how


---------47:01----------
much space is in your heart for another


---------47:03----------
person if you ease there what do you


---------47:06----------
think that I think that makes and I like


---------47:16----------
I I don't really have much of a memory


---------47:18----------
of how that dynamic work back when I was


---------47:22----------
dating the person the year ago


---------47:26----------
so it sounds like something that would


---------47:29----------
make sense but it's simply you have a


---------47:32----------
waifu a year ago yes and what I didn't


---------47:37----------
say anything like a death sentence I


---------47:42----------
know like I mean like you're in a


---------47:45----------
relationship you're expected to be


---------47:47----------
honest about me like that's a hell of a


---------47:49----------
sit-down moment it's easier in - it's


---------47:53----------
one thing to have a sit-down in the


---------47:55----------
phone moment and tell someone that


---------47:57----------
you've you know you've been having an


---------47:59----------
affair and then they're the second woman


---------48:01----------
and it's an entirely different level of


---------48:04----------
sit-down moment when the person that


---------48:08----------
you're cheating on is non-existent yeah


---------48:10----------
it's not the whole cell yeah it's kind


---------48:16----------
of the essence of an emotional affair


---------48:18----------
without a physical affair you know it's


---------48:20----------
kind of interesting but yeah I mean I


---------48:24----------
think I have all kinds of other quite so


---------48:26----------
happy a wife um um I tend to surround


---------48:33----------
myself with people who I I think quite


---------48:37----------
nice and so even if they don't really


---------48:40----------
understand what the hell's going on


---------48:42----------
they're not judgmental or I have friends


---------48:45----------
who are insult like the the sphere of


---------48:49----------
people who like are in the anime


---------48:51----------
community and understand everything so


---------48:53----------
it's not weird to them mm-hmm is Weibo


---------48:57----------
offensive Weibo isn't actually a wife


---------49:01----------
it's like this there's Wiebe and there's


---------49:04----------
weeaboo weeaboo is kinda like the


---------49:06----------
long-winded a little out of date version


---------49:09----------
weeb is usually the short one so what is


---------49:11----------
a weap a we would just be someone who


---------49:14----------
really really likes anime and like the


---------49:17----------
stereotype would be like unwashed smelly


---------49:22----------
bad dress you know bad social skills are


---------49:26----------
you a we in spirits yes been physicality


---------49:32----------
not I walk out I work out


---------49:37----------
and dress myself nicely and bathe with


---------49:41----------
the best of them but mentally I feel


---------49:45----------
like I'm a day waiver good for you man


---------49:49----------
I applaud that that makes me happy and


---------49:53----------
optimistic for you and buts so it sounds


---------49:58----------
like you've you kind of surrounded by


---------50:00----------
yourself


---------50:01----------
by leaps yeah I have a good number of


---------50:05----------
weep friends yeah


---------50:06----------
okay and what are you up to nowadays are


---------50:08----------
you still in you near yeah I'm just


---------50:11----------
finishing up uni now I've like 'man I by


---------50:15----------
April 30th I should have everything


---------50:17----------
submitted thank God for quarantine


---------50:19----------
because holy hell our project was going


---------50:22----------
downhill we just be not saved by the


---------50:24----------
pandemic if anything interesting and yes


---------50:28----------
what are you what are you gonna do after


---------50:29----------
uni


---------50:30----------
I'm going to change careers because if


---------50:32----------
there's one if you means good at


---------50:35----------
anything it's it's telling you what you


---------50:36----------
don't like and I do not like the course


---------50:38----------
I took so I'm planning on bomb I'm


---------50:42----------
planning but I've already made a bunch


---------50:45----------
of work towards having a career in


---------50:48----------
teaching English abroad


---------50:49----------
okay so I've already gone up yeah that's


---------50:52----------
one one on my list also Mongolia because


---------50:55----------
no-one's been to Mongolia I just want to


---------50:57----------
go and like check in on them see what's


---------50:59----------
up


---------51:00----------
so it's just kind of all I don't know no


---------51:03----------
one talks about Mongolia but it's huge


---------51:05----------
yeah I've never met anyone from Mongolia


---------51:07----------
but it's like three times the size of


---------51:09----------
this country I don't get it but uh yeah


---------51:12----------
I'm going to tell you at some point it's


---------51:14----------
okay I mean I guess we could have seen


---------51:16----------
the teaching English abroad thing coming


---------51:18----------
right oh yeah absolutely


---------51:20----------
immediately this is like the


---------51:22----------
stereotypical career choice for people


---------51:26----------
so it sounds like you haven't dealt with


---------51:28----------
a whole lot of bullying around this kind


---------51:30----------
of thing Oh around this kind of thing no


---------51:33----------
I wouldn't think so no surprising but


---------51:36----------
you have to be bullied for other things


---------51:37----------
uh I mean yeah so I grew up didn't I


---------51:41----------
everyone what was


---------51:46----------
what was your what was your childhood


---------51:48----------
like it was there very emotionally


---------51:52----------
repressed


---------51:53----------
like growing up through school I had


---------51:57----------
very long hideous looking hair and you


---------52:01----------
can still see it a bit now but like feel


---------52:03----------
especially back then acne was a huge


---------52:05----------
problem for me hmm so I was a sort of


---------52:10----------
kid that it was just kinda like your


---------52:11----------
eyes with water just looking at me it


---------52:14----------
was like it was not a good luck so that


---------52:18----------
doesn't sound very funny I yeah um I


---------52:23----------
think yeah but like I think if I saw


---------52:26----------
myself now I wouldn't want to look at


---------52:27----------
myself I think I I it's quite


---------52:30----------
light-hearted now because I know that


---------52:32----------
I'm in a good place now and like that


---------52:35----------
seems so far away like I've changed so


---------52:38----------
much as a human being from that it's


---------52:41----------
difficult to just relate to myself


---------52:42----------
having change so I think the biggest the


---------52:48----------
biggest changing point for my life was


---------52:50----------
when my friends introduced me to


---------52:52----------
competitive gaming because it was but it


---------52:56----------
was the first time I ever tried anything


---------52:59----------
basically and it was the first time I


---------53:01----------
was ever I was like self reflective and


---------53:05----------
that process of looking at yourself in


---------53:08----------
improving yourself it was like I woke up


---------53:10----------
for the first time like coming out the


---------53:11----------
matrix hmm


---------53:13----------
it was like I was just stumbling through


---------53:15----------
life before that and suddenly I felt


---------53:18----------
like a human and the weight matrix comes


---------53:20----------
before getting a waifu yeah where did


---------53:29----------
you get where did you get introduced


---------53:31----------
into competitive gaming so we started


---------53:33----------
off with like we didn't take it too


---------53:36----------
seriously but we started off with like


---------53:37----------
66 tf2 and then we transitioned into


---------53:41----------
super smash bros melee hmm which is more


---------53:45----------
like a 1v1 fighter and I played that for


---------53:48----------
a good amount of years and then that's


---------53:50----------
what introduced me big time to like


---------53:53----------
making content on the Internet


---------53:54----------
I had like a like a small like like


---------53:58----------
around 500


---------54:00----------
subscribers like following of like


---------54:02----------
making smash videos cook because of how


---------54:05----------
the because of the how the community is


---------54:06----------
and how small it is like even though I


---------54:10----------
only have 500 subscribers it would be


---------54:12----------
the car thing where like I could go to a


---------54:14----------
tournament and I would be like


---------54:16----------
recognized which was internet it's uh it


---------54:20----------
where is so weird


---------54:22----------
everything is it's like a wake-up call I


---------54:25----------
don't like Fame


---------54:28----------
I think famous for some people not for


---------54:30----------
me although I don't like the idea of


---------54:32----------
being recognized much yeah it was I


---------54:36----------
still remember the first time someone


---------54:38----------
recognized me on the street yeah so this


---------54:42----------
is like recent so I just started


---------54:43----------
streaming a few months ago but then


---------54:44----------
someone like literally I was walking


---------54:46----------
down the street to a coffee shop and


---------54:47----------
someone looked at me and pointed at me


---------54:49----------
and said you're dr. K no [ __ ] just


---------54:52----------
stood there and I was like yes and then


---------54:55----------
I didn't know what I was supposed to say


---------54:57----------
or do because I didn't know who they


---------54:59----------
were


---------54:59----------
it's like normally it's like hey how are


---------55:00----------
you and then you say fine you just say


---------55:01----------
how are you and that's like and you're


---------55:03----------
like some guy on the street I don't know


---------55:07----------
it was weird


---------55:08----------
yeah but yeah so hmm


---------55:13----------
Toby yeah dude I I don't think I mean I


---------55:15----------
find myself having other questions right


---------55:17----------
like so yeah you know like I'm really


---------55:20----------
curious because I mean for people who


---------55:22----------
think that they're in relationships I


---------55:24----------
understand that there's like a sexual


---------55:25----------
component to that I I'm not getting that


---------55:27----------
from you is that the case I mean I died


---------55:30----------
jack off like any other way there's


---------55:33----------
nothing with some people are like


---------55:36----------
monogamous in that sense where they will


---------55:39----------
only do that kind of thing for that one


---------55:41----------
character that's not how I roll


---------55:43----------
it's not a lie okay so so you're an


---------55:47----------
equal-opportunity employer for all like


---------55:52----------
that yeah perhaps the worst way I've


---------55:55----------
ever heard that but yeah we can we can


---------55:58----------
do that yeah so I mean and but like dude


---------56:02----------
I don't know what to say like a you know


---------56:04----------
it sounds to me like this was a pretty


---------56:07----------
it sounds [ __ ] weird but it's like it


---------56:10----------
makes sense to me you know like I think


---------56:11----------
yeah the story you told about sort of


---------56:14----------
being in a dark point in your life and


---------56:17----------
and watching something that resonates


---------56:18----------
with you like that's how human beings


---------56:20----------
work yeah like so so we have stories and


---------56:23----------
we resonate with stories and we find


---------56:25----------
inspiration from characters and I think


---------56:27----------
something about the way that you were


---------56:29----------
and we haven't really dog too much into


---------56:31----------
this but I wonder whether you had other


---------56:34----------
risk factors or vulnerabilities for


---------56:36----------
really like anthropomorphize alike this


---------56:39----------
feeling I think the really really


---------56:40----------
bizarre thing is that you know one of


---------56:42----------
the questions that I get get very often


---------56:44----------
from people from our community is how do


---------56:47----------
I learn to forgive myself or love myself


---------56:49----------
and apparently and the answer is get a


---------56:51----------
wife food you know so I think it's it's


---------56:56----------
quite remarkable I mean the one thing


---------56:57----------
that I think really sets you apart Toby


---------56:59----------
from most of the people that I've met is


---------57:02----------
not actually the fact that you have a


---------57:04----------
wife around it's [ __ ] bizarre but is


---------57:06----------
the fact that you actually sound like


---------57:08----------
you love yourself and that you're


---------57:09----------
confident in who you are despite having


---------57:12----------
a wife ooh so that may sound like super


---------57:14----------
weird because the idea is that you know


---------57:16----------
people lack I think think it sort of


---------57:18----------
makes sense that loneliness and a lack


---------57:20----------
of confidence leads people to create


---------57:24----------
waifu's are engaged with waifu's but I


---------57:26----------
think even and you know it sounds


---------57:29----------
strange to me that like you know you


---------57:31----------
think that you need to move past this


---------57:33----------
and that was like you had that in your


---------57:35----------
head from the get-go


---------57:36----------
yeah and I get that you're scared and


---------57:38----------
because you are scared so I think you


---------57:40----------
know you're like an adult version of a


---------57:42----------
child who has like a safety blanket and


---------57:45----------
this is what object relations is a lot


---------57:47----------
of Alex of the theory of object


---------57:48----------
relations which is a subset of something


---------57:51----------
called psychoanalysis basically talks


---------57:53----------
about how adults have safety blankets -


---------57:55----------
like we all have all kinds of things and


---------57:58----------
in some case you know there's there


---------58:01----------
books that have been written about


---------58:01----------
object relations and God and so like God


---------58:05----------
is a safety blanket of sorts and you


---------58:10----------
know I think that you should I mean if I


---------58:12----------
tell you that I think it's time to let


---------58:13----------
her go how do you respond to that of


---------58:20----------
yeah so and then I would say to that


---------58:23----------
fear you know


---------58:25----------
I think she's always gonna be with you


---------58:26----------
and in a sense and this is very anime


---------58:30----------
right so she's like changed you as a


---------58:31----------
person and even though she has to die at


---------58:34----------
the end of the arc or disappear it


---------58:37----------
doesn't you live on and she lives on in


---------58:40----------
here yeah and then the other day where


---------58:43----------
the character appears in the clouds


---------58:45----------
absolutely so that's what that's where


---------58:47----------
she's got to go man she's got to appear


---------58:50----------
in the clouds and and you've got to make


---------58:52----------
space for a like you know a


---------58:53----------
flesh-and-blood person because there's a


---------58:56----------
part of you that's hungry for that right


---------58:59----------
and and I find myself saying thankfully


---------59:02----------
which is a little bit judgmental but


---------59:04----------
thankfully you recognize that you can't


---------59:06----------
have a real relationship with her which


---------59:07----------
I'm you know I'm still open-minded and


---------59:10----------
if someone were to say I am capable of


---------59:12----------
having a real relationship with Luther


---------59:14----------
I'd I'd be happy to explore that with


---------59:16----------
them but I just don't understand that


---------59:18----------
and so far you haven't really given me


---------59:21----------
anything to suggest that that's truly


---------59:22----------
possible I think you can have a


---------59:25----------
relationship but it's not a two sided


---------59:27----------
relationship you can have a relationship


---------59:28----------
in the way that you can have with God in


---------59:30----------
which it's like pretty one-sided which


---------59:33----------
in a sense I don't even really believe


---------59:34----------
but that's a different issue yeah yeah


---------59:40----------
sometimes I feel like my relationship


---------59:41----------
with God is two-sided anyway but yeah I


---------59:50----------
mean what do you think about that I I


---------59:54----------
like that as a conclusion I I think it's


---------59:59----------
it's almost like it satisfies all areas


---------60:02----------
where it it's it's able to to take the


---------60:07----------
almost like the the present of the


---------60:10----------
emotion is in a space and time gift wrap


---------60:14----------
thing and able to come home car pence


---------60:17----------
that's not what able to put it somewhere


---------60:21----------
else like just in like my memory I'd be


---------60:25----------
like that was a thing but the but the


---------60:28----------
the effect and the emotion not the


---------60:30----------
emotion the effect


---------60:32----------
it's had on me sticks with me it's not


---------60:37----------
like I don't lose the progress I've made


---------60:39----------
absolutely and and I even would disagree


---------60:42----------
with a little bit about your your


---------60:44----------
conception of like walling it off Ronnie


---------60:47----------
in your memory I think you'll you'll be


---------60:49----------
you'll find and this has been my


---------60:51----------
experience of love in a romantic and


---------60:54----------
also with like other human beings in a


---------60:55----------
different way relationship that that


---------60:57----------
love is gonna be way more present than


---------60:59----------
you realize right because I still think


---------61:03----------
that she's more of you than you realize


---------61:06----------
like she's not quite as act like she's


---------61:08----------
not external to begin with in my mind


---------61:09----------
but in your mind she's external in some


---------61:11----------
way but I think she's more internal than


---------61:13----------
you're giving her credit for and so I


---------61:17----------
think if you end up in a loving


---------61:18----------
relationship with someone you'll be


---------61:20----------
surprised by how present she is and then


---------61:24----------
the last very practical thing is I think


---------61:26----------
psychologically and also like from a


---------61:28----------
weirdness standpoint you've got to make


---------61:30----------
space in your life for someone else


---------61:32----------
yeah and and it's kind of like it's not


---------61:35----------
fair to that person for her to compete


---------61:37----------
with youí because that person is gonna


---------61:38----------
have bad days and you ease now yeah


---------61:42----------
although I hear that some some people's


---------61:44----------
wife who's throw temper tantrums and


---------61:46----------
things like that


---------61:47----------
I've never heard of that before in my


---------61:49----------
life yes this is my first swim into


---------61:55----------
these waters but when I say I've heard


---------61:57----------
I've I've worked with people who have


---------62:00----------
told me that before right but for them


---------62:03----------
it seems to be like a big important part


---------62:05----------
of them to be able to win over their


---------62:07----------
wife who after they're mad at this moves


---------62:09----------
them anyway so it's weird but thoughts


---------62:12----------
or questions before we kind of wrap up


---------62:14----------
uh no I don't think so okay I'm pretty


---------62:20----------
good can you just help me understand a


---------62:23----------
little bit about like what felt relevant


---------62:26----------
to you or what was helpful from today


---------62:29----------
okay


---------62:30----------
I think really defining how as a


---------62:36----------
relationship it works the like the


---------62:41----------
discussing of one side of nature of it


---------62:44----------
really help the exploring how it related


---------62:50----------
or exploring how much Yui and myself are


---------63:00----------
intertwined helped a lot and the and I


---------63:09----------
think that specifically the sort of I


---------63:12----------
don't know how I would describe it but


---------63:14----------
the like the the anime head in the


---------63:17----------
clouds moment specifically as well yeah


---------63:21----------
so would you like to yeah so I thanks


---------63:25----------
for sharing that like can I share with


---------63:26----------
you kind of my summary of what I learned


---------63:29----------
today and and you know maybe like direct


---------63:32----------
so I mean first of all I think that you


---------63:34----------
know you did an awesome job of


---------63:35----------
explaining like what a waifu is right so


---------63:37----------
yeah the most important thing I think is


---------63:39----------
that it's a feeling of love and the


---------63:41----------
interesting thing is that so we people


---------63:43----------
can say that waifu's are real or fake or


---------63:45----------
whatever relationship not relationship


---------63:48----------
but one of the things that I've come to


---------63:49----------
appreciate is that feelings are real


---------63:51----------
and it doesn't matter whether feelings


---------63:53----------
come from fake places feelings


---------63:56----------
themselves are real and have to be


---------63:57----------
addressed like when I'm working with


---------63:58----------
someone with anxiety and even though


---------64:01----------
everyone doesn't actually hate them they


---------64:04----------
feel hated by other people because


---------64:06----------
that's what happens when you're anxious


---------64:07----------
yeah and it doesn't do any good to tell


---------64:11----------
them oh by the way no one actually hates


---------64:13----------
you that doesn't do anything to the


---------64:15----------
feeling the feeling is real and needs to


---------64:16----------
be dealt with like it needs to be


---------64:18----------
considered and so you sort of have you


---------64:21----------
had convinced me that why foods are


---------64:22----------
quote unquote real and not weird from


---------64:24----------
the second that use your defining point


---------64:26----------
and you did this right at the get-go is


---------64:29----------
that it's a feeling of romantic log


---------64:30----------
towards something that doesn't exist and


---------64:32----------
so feelings towards things that don't


---------64:34----------
exist happen all the time right and and


---------64:37----------
now if I don't exist I mean that you can


---------64:39----------
define or prove like for example God so


---------64:42----------
a lot of people have faith in God and


---------64:44----------
there's no real proof of God some people


---------64:46----------
think there's proof I'm not convinced of


---------64:48----------
that and and but so at the end of the


---------64:53----------
day


---------64:55----------
it's a feeling and I think that you know


---------64:59----------
you you watched Kay on first when you


---------65:01----------
were like 15 or 16 years old and it was


---------65:03----------
kind of surface level but as you started


---------65:06----------
to struggle in life you kind of went


---------65:08----------
towards you know you something about you


---------65:15----------
ease story resonated with you you saw


---------65:18----------
yourself in her she was kind of like I


---------65:21----------
still think that you kind of conceived


---------65:23----------
of her as a perfect version of you and


---------65:24----------
that kind of comes down to this idea of


---------65:26----------
like being capable of love and loving


---------65:28----------
other people and it sounds like she was


---------65:30----------
able to do that in the anime maybe you


---------65:33----------
also want to make music and then you


---------65:35----------
know I think that like what's happened


---------65:38----------
is that that helped you when you were


---------65:40----------
feeling alone and loathing yourself


---------65:42----------
because you kind of talked about having


---------65:44----------
that self-loathing or that critical


---------65:46----------
voice whereas like Yui sort of gave you


---------65:48----------
a sense of love and acceptance and


---------65:50----------
that's when you learn how to love


---------65:52----------
yourself which is a very important thing


---------65:54----------
to learn how to do and now that you've


---------65:56----------
sort of learned that and things are kind


---------65:57----------
of status quo you're growing and you're


---------65:59----------
changing and you're dating women and


---------66:01----------
being unfaithful towards Yui and and and


---------66:04----------
now you're kind of noticing that like


---------66:06----------
there's something left


---------66:07----------
that's like unsatisfied right that at


---------66:09----------
the end of the day you still have a


---------66:11----------
hunger for you know for something that


---------66:16----------
can love you back and you can love


---------66:19----------
yourself but like that's different from


---------66:21----------
being loved by someone and I think what


---------66:24----------
you're starting to feel more and more is


---------66:25----------
that like even though you feel good


---------66:27----------
about yourself and you love yourself you


---------66:28----------
that's not the same as someone loving


---------66:30----------
you and if you really want that I think


---------66:33----------
you've got a sort of not so much like


---------66:35----------
you know as Yui like goes into the


---------66:38----------
clouds she doesn't disappear right she


---------66:40----------
just becomes less present and manifest


---------66:44----------
in your physical world so like the Shelf


---------66:47----------
of things that you have I think needs to


---------66:50----------
calm down at some point right not like I


---------66:52----------
mean I think it's fine to have one


---------66:54----------
picture but like think about it in the


---------66:55----------
way that you know you're grieving the


---------66:57----------
loss of a relationship right is that


---------67:00----------
person doesn't leave your life entirely


---------67:02----------
but they're also like you know they get


---------67:04----------
kind of packaged and set aside and


---------67:06----------
I want you to kind of think about it


---------67:08----------
almost like you know if I have a wife


---------67:11----------
who passes away and and thank God


---------67:14----------
hopefully that's not gonna happen


---------67:15----------
anytime soon but you know like and I


---------67:17----------
start dating someone new like it's fine


---------67:20----------
like it's completely reasonable for me


---------67:22----------
to have an entire book shelf filled with


---------67:24----------
pictures of my wife and at the same time


---------67:27----------
if I try to let someone else and like I


---------67:29----------
see this practically with patients that


---------67:31----------
I work with is like they can't compete


---------67:33----------
against a dead person


---------67:34----------
yeah right it's just not like because


---------67:37----------
everything that I remember about my


---------67:39----------
deceased wife or everything that my


---------67:41----------
patients remember on their deceased wife


---------67:42----------
is idealized it's just like you he is


---------67:44----------
and it doesn't mean that the feelings


---------67:47----------
that I have for that person or false


---------67:49----------
it's just not fair to the person that


---------67:51----------
you want to let into your life and I


---------67:53----------
think that's really the direction that


---------67:54----------
you need to go in terms of you know


---------67:56----------
grieve that this part of your life is


---------67:58----------
over but also that there's like a second


---------68:00----------
arc so now we're like in Toby Ark -


---------68:04----------
which is when she get that when he gets


---------68:06----------
a real girlfriend yeah oh well knock


---------68:09----------
that will be yeah you got you got a


---------68:11----------
report back at some point right and let


---------68:13----------
us know that's going and and and you I


---------68:16----------
mean it's it's great that you do kind of


---------68:18----------
take care of yourself and I think you're


---------68:19----------
I think you're ready to start letting


---------68:20----------
her go although I get that you're scared


---------68:22----------
because that's normal so the part of you


---------68:25----------
that's scared is like the part of you


---------68:27----------
that's like a freshman and not someone


---------68:28----------
who's graduating and I mean you're


---------68:30----------
[ __ ] you're gonna go to Japan and


---------68:32----------
teach English and you're probably gonna


---------68:35----------
want to date an asian chick and so like


---------68:37----------
you know you gotta you got to make space


---------68:39----------
for that in your life yeah yeah I think


---------68:48----------
but that entire thing was like pretty


---------68:51----------
much fun it's like something for me this


---------68:54----------
is like save and remember on occasions


---------68:57----------
like yeah yeah so so good luck to you


---------69:03----------
man thank you very much yeah you feel


---------69:06----------
like meditating today I I've tried


---------69:11----------
because I've had the therapy before and


---------69:15----------
we tried meditating but my brain doesn't


---------69:17----------
like to stop so


---------69:20----------
it's very difficult to stall I feel like


---------69:23----------
I'd never get anywhere okay well I try


---------69:26----------
you willing to give it a shot I'll be


---------69:29----------
willing to give it a shot


---------69:30----------
okay so we won't expect much from you


---------69:32----------
okay and so unfortunately for the people


---------69:35----------
at home I don't know how much this is


---------69:36----------
gonna apply to y'all because we're gonna


---------69:38----------
try to do a different sort of meditation


---------69:40----------
so I want you to sit up straight yep and


---------69:47----------
thank you for sharing your concerns by


---------69:50----------
the way so we're gonna try to do


---------69:51----------
something different I'm not going to


---------69:52----------
teach you a traditional meditation close


---------69:54----------
your eyes and try to find the feeling


---------69:58----------
that of love that you have for youi can


---------70:06----------
you find it yep where is it about here


---------70:11----------
okay


---------70:12----------
what does it feel like it feels often


---------70:20----------
after today it's halfway between warm


---------70:23----------
and comforting and the little cold and


---------70:27----------
clinical and sort of taken apart a


---------70:29----------
little bit okay and how so interesting


---------70:34----------
it's not an answer I was expecting so I


---------70:36----------
gotta just think about that for a second


---------70:38----------
so let's just start by noticing those


---------70:40----------
two so is the cold and clinical coming


---------70:42----------
from your chester is it coming from


---------70:43----------
somewhere else it's like the cold and


---------70:45----------
clinical is here and the warmth like


---------70:49----------
here just next to it okay so good so in


---------70:52----------
a sense I want you to sit with that and


---------70:56----------
I want to know do you feel like you've


---------70:58----------
lost something by feeling the cold and


---------71:00----------
clinical no but didn't it all used to be


---------71:08----------
warm and fuzzy yeah


---------71:11----------
how have you not lost something by


---------71:13----------
gaining something called in clinical


---------71:17----------
because this is still the thumbs are a


---------71:19----------
different light beautifully put


---------71:23----------
and so


---------71:26----------
I want you to recognize try to find the


---------71:28----------
fear of letting you ego okay where is


---------71:38----------
that okay okay and what does that feel


---------71:42----------
like it feels a little bit empty and a


---------71:50----------
little bit like this is gonna sound


---------71:56----------
really weird it feels like a chain like


---------72:00----------
a metal chain just being like dragged


---------72:02----------
across a paving


---------72:04----------
sure beautifully quite right so notice


---------72:09----------
that thing there's there's heaviness to


---------72:11----------
it there's weight to it there's noise to


---------72:13----------
it there's a sense of holding you down


---------72:17----------
or weighing you down holding you back


---------72:20----------
like that's what I when I hear you use


---------72:24----------
that language that's what pops into my


---------72:25----------
mind what does that resonate with you


---------72:28----------
yeah I think so and and so that's kind


---------72:33----------
of a strange imagery because like now I


---------72:35----------
want you to think a little bit about all


---------72:37----------
of the places that Yui is in your room


---------72:40----------
and in your life in a physical way and I


---------72:43----------
want you to think about like let's start


---------72:44----------
with the bookshelf what would it feel


---------72:49----------
like to take some of those things and


---------72:51----------
pack them away in a shoebox that would


---------72:55----------
feel very third over sad in what way


---------73:03----------
that would feel like I'm losing a pollen


---------73:07----------
with okay so what are you feeling now


---------73:16----------
like my entire body is very slightly


---------73:19----------
lifting upwards like I'm full of helium


---------73:22----------
or something okay like everything's gone


---------73:25----------
to my head a little bit okay


---------73:31----------
so you feel like you would lose a part


---------73:33----------
of yourself yeah not a part of her


---------73:38----------
it feels very personal yeah so what


---------73:44----------
would you be losing by doing that what


---------73:49----------
part of yourself would you give up I


---------73:58----------
think I don't know exactly what I mean


---------74:02----------
by this but the word memories comes to


---------74:04----------
mind yeah I think that's a good answer


---------74:18----------
let me just think about how to explain


---------74:20----------
that I think that you're giving up


---------74:30----------
you're giving up that which was very


---------74:33----------
important to you before right that's why


---------74:36----------
it's a memory you're giving up in the


---------74:38----------
sense of comfort that you need and then


---------74:41----------
but you're not the same person anymore


---------74:43----------
so at this point you're spot on that


---------74:45----------
you're giving up a memory because it's


---------74:47----------
it's over the past now which is exactly


---------74:50----------
why you must put it away and the other


---------74:54----------
thing that I want you to try to


---------74:55----------
appreciate for a moment is like where


---------74:57----------
are all of these things so now I want


---------74:59----------
you to take a step back a little bit and


---------75:01----------
now really observe instead of sit in the


---------75:04----------
feelings like you have been and where


---------75:06----------
are all of these feelings coming from


---------75:11----------
the memories feelings okay maybe you're


---------75:17----------
asking specifically do you mean the


---------75:20----------
memories everything that we've talked


---------75:21----------
about every question that I've asked you


---------75:23----------
all the answers that you've given me


---------75:25----------
where do those answers come from from


---------75:28----------
OPA ok I'm not so sure I agree with that


---------75:33----------
right because some information and data


---------75:35----------
is coming from here so I agree that the


---------75:38----------
answer the words out of your mouth are


---------75:40----------
maybe coming from here but you're


---------75:41----------
getting data from here yeah yeah but now


---------75:44----------
let me ask you this are you getting any


---------75:46----------
data from the outside


---------75:51----------
no right so now I want you to take some


---------75:56----------
comfort in that because you can put the


---------75:59----------
pictures away but nothing is coming from


---------76:03----------
the pictures like nothing is coming from


---------76:08----------
the pictures to watch all of the


---------76:11----------
pictures trigger something in here do


---------76:14----------
you see that but like it's all coming


---------76:15----------
from here and so you can take every


---------76:18----------
image of Yui out of your house stop


---------76:20----------
freaking out prospective girlfriends and


---------76:23----------
you don't actually have to let go of any


---------76:25----------
of that because it's all in here anyway


---------76:27----------
like this is where all your feelings and


---------76:30----------
sensations and stuff comes from this is


---------76:32----------
where the sadness and the grief and the


---------76:34----------
coldness and the clinical Mis and the


---------76:36----------
warmth and the love and also the comfort


---------76:39----------
of of meeting those feelings in that


---------76:41----------
representation it all comes from here


---------76:43----------
and you can let it go I think it


---------76:45----------
requires courage and to put things very


---------76:50----------
very concretely and to freak you out


---------76:52----------
Toby I rarely do this but I'm gonna ask


---------76:54----------
you to try to put some of those things


---------76:56----------
away okay


---------76:58----------
right between now and tomorrow and if


---------77:00----------
you can't do it you can't do it no big


---------77:02----------
deal I did I did make a quick disclaimer


---------77:07----------
to say that I'm still at university I'm


---------77:09----------
not at home you know many of the things


---------77:11----------
I own on here so I can't do something I


---------77:15----------
can't do some things but some things


---------77:18----------
were required me breaking the law if I


---------77:19----------
were to put them all no I mean I'm not


---------77:21----------
saying you should break the law but but


---------77:22----------
you so you're basically giving me an


---------77:24----------
excuse for avoiding the task Sophia yeah


---------77:28----------
I could do what I can around here but


---------77:31----------
yeah but I'm not asking you to put


---------77:33----------
everything away the the real thing the


---------77:34----------
real reason that I want you to put it


---------77:35----------
away is not to put it away but to take a


---------77:38----------
snapshot of who you are now and the


---------77:40----------
thought of putting things away and see


---------77:42----------
how you feel


---------77:44----------
then actually go through the act of


---------77:45----------
packing something away and then notice


---------77:48----------
how you feel afterward do you feel like


---------77:51----------
you've lost something because the issue


---------77:52----------
here is that right now you is a hundred


---------77:54----------
percent a part of your life so if we


---------77:56----------
make her ninety percent a part of your


---------77:57----------
life how devastating is that yeah and


---------78:01----------
what I think you'll discover is that


---------78:03----------
something about that chain dragging


---------78:06----------
across pavement is not going to be


---------78:08----------
exactly what you think it is it's gonna


---------78:11----------
be painful in some ways that you may not


---------78:13----------
have realize it and I think it's gonna


---------78:14----------
be easier in other ways that you don't


---------78:16----------
realize and it is kind of interesting


---------78:20----------
because you use this imagery of


---------78:22----------
shackling and I think that's exactly


---------78:23----------
what you is doing for you now she helped


---------78:27----------
you up and now she's kind of holding you


---------78:29----------
back and I get the sense that you feel


---------78:30----------
that so now it's time to let her go


---------78:33----------
which can be scary good luck to you man


---------78:39----------
thank you very much and if you can think


---------78:42----------
of anyone any questions about any of


---------78:44----------
that stuff alright so that getting you


---------78:46----------

---------78:48----------

---------81:46----------
man so before I really ask the question


---------81:50----------
I wanted to talk about something that


---------81:54----------
happened a year ago okay so in March


---------81:56----------
2019 we had a big house fire so I was


---------81:59----------
home alone in my room which


---------82:02----------
I'm there right now and the fire alarm


---------82:05----------
went off and I was on fire and I had to


---------82:08----------
get the [ __ ] out and so scary yeah so


---------82:13----------
that I was really stressed on that day I


---------82:16----------
was was in the middle of my exam week so


---------82:19----------
all sorts of stuff going on but what's


---------82:23----------
weird is the week after that after I


---------82:25----------
finished the exams


---------82:27----------
I felt really free like I didn't have to


---------82:30----------
go home because I didn't have a home


---------82:33----------
right well we stayed somewhere but it


---------82:35----------
wasn't home and so when I was out I


---------82:38----------
didn't feel like I had to get back home


---------82:41----------
right so I felt free so I thought about


---------82:44----------
that a lot and I felt like it had to do


---------82:47----------
with my fear of rejection like when I'm


---------82:50----------
out I feel like I'm getting or I feel


---------82:53----------
like I'm afraid of getting rejected and


---------82:54----------
so when I'm home I'm safe from that so


---------82:57----------
my question would be how do I deal with


---------82:59----------
that or how do I yeah how do I feel less


---------83:01----------
attached to home yeah I'm confused


---------83:11----------
because what what your what it sounds


---------83:13----------
like what you're giving me is an answer


---------83:15----------
not a question yeah so well of course


---------83:20----------
another question could be how do I deal


---------83:22----------
with fear of rejection no but I mean I I


---------83:24----------
understand that you can rephrase the


---------83:26----------
question and you're turning it into a


---------83:27----------
question I I think what the weird thing


---------83:30----------
here is I think you already have an


---------83:31----------
answer right so like you've already


---------83:33----------
analyzed some so this is great I'm not


---------83:35----------
trying to shoot you down but the


---------83:37----------
interesting thing is that most people


---------83:38----------
come to me like what what it sounds like


---------83:41----------
what you've had is a realization what


---------83:42----------
we're really looking for me to do is


---------83:44----------
confirm your realization that home is a


---------83:47----------
place that allows you to escape from


---------83:49----------
your fear of rejection it's a protective


---------83:52----------
place and and what you discovered when


---------83:56----------
your house burned down


---------83:57----------
is that someone taking away your shelter


---------84:01----------
like actually things were not as scary


---------84:05----------
as you thought they were in the outside


---------84:07----------
world and you felt free and good


---------84:11----------
right like what I'm hearing from you is


---------84:13----------
almost like what I like so I you know I


---------84:15----------
have young kids so sometimes a young


---------84:17----------
child doesn't want to do something


---------84:19----------
they're terrified like let's say like I


---------84:20----------
want to put one of them in the bathtub


---------84:21----------
and they're scared of the water and it's


---------84:23----------
almost like you have to force them into


---------84:25----------
the bathtub and once you force them into


---------84:27----------
the bathtub they're like hey this is


---------84:28----------
actually a lot of fun it's not what I


---------84:30----------
thought it was and so what I'm hearing


---------84:34----------
from you is that you had you were afraid


---------84:36----------
of rejection so you had an experience of


---------84:40----------
freedom after after your house burned


---------84:41----------
down which is strange


---------84:42----------
and then as you reflected on it and


---------84:45----------
looked into it you realized oh like I


---------84:46----------
was using home is a shield against like


---------84:51----------
fear of rejection and you started to


---------84:55----------
understand that for yourself which is


---------84:56----------
wonderful and then you also realize like


---------84:59----------
oh actually like being coming out from


---------85:01----------
behind the shield actually feels freeing


---------85:03----------
and liberating yeah so that the problem


---------85:06----------
I guess is that a week later when we go


---------85:09----------
to rental home and you know we start


---------85:11----------
getting settled in there you move all


---------85:12----------
your stuff that's still intact and then


---------85:15----------
it just came back


---------85:16----------
I still work and yeah of course I still


---------85:19----------
have that and now of course now I'm


---------85:21----------
really stuck at home yeah so so I mean I


---------85:24----------
think that the issue is that like what


---------85:26----------
you've got to do is just so recognize


---------85:27----------
that so now that you've got a shelter


---------85:29----------
again it can be scary even though you've


---------85:32----------
been in the bathtub once and you enjoyed


---------85:34----------
it the first time it can be hard for


---------85:36----------
someone to overcome their fear after one


---------85:39----------
experience that's positive but the short


---------85:42----------
answer is and I recognize this is you


---------85:44----------
know kovat so you can't do this it's


---------85:45----------
like I think you already know that you


---------85:47----------
can you need to leave the home or that's


---------85:48----------
what I'm hearing from you yeah and so


---------85:52----------
you know that you know there's a part of


---------85:54----------
you that's not gonna want to leave and


---------85:56----------
there's a part of you that recognizes


---------85:57----------
that that's exactly what you need


---------85:58----------
because you came here and you told me


---------86:00----------
this is what I need to do this is what


---------86:02----------
home meet means to me how do I deal with


---------86:04----------
my fear of rejection and so you could


---------86:06----------
say that okay yeah you have to go back


---------86:08----------
and process and figure out why you're


---------86:09----------
afraid of being rejected but I think in


---------86:11----------
your case you have a unique advantage in


---------86:13----------
the sense that you've been forced to


---------86:15----------
overcome your fear of rejection and you


---------86:17----------
found that it's actually not very


---------86:19----------
painful


---------86:23----------
so I'd say just leave the house when


---------86:26----------
it's time to and notice that you have


---------86:28----------
the fear of rejection and notice that


---------86:30----------
there's a part of you that can tell that


---------86:32----------
can assure you that that fear of


---------86:34----------
rejection is not correct that you've


---------86:36----------
actually been out of the house before


---------86:38----------
and it turns out to be freeing and


---------86:39----------
liberating and then you're gonna have a


---------86:41----------
little war in your mind because a part


---------86:43----------
of you is gonna say I want safety and


---------86:45----------
another part of you is gonna say I want


---------86:48----------
liberation and then it's your choice


---------86:50----------
which part of your mind you listen to


---------86:56----------
mm-hmm right and like this is all kind


---------87:00----------
of a mood question because you're in


---------87:01----------
covent like I'm sorry if I don't have a


---------87:02----------
more satisfying answer but you're one of


---------87:05----------
the rare people that like starts their


---------87:07----------
question with an answer that's the


---------87:08----------
answer so I mean it's it's different


---------87:12----------
it's it's not just telling people like


---------87:14----------
oh just leave your house like the


---------87:16----------
difference between telling someone to


---------87:17----------
leave their house and telling you to


---------87:19----------
leave your house is that you've left


---------87:21----------
your house before so there's a part of


---------87:23----------
you there's some part of you that you


---------87:24----------
can rely on to help you get out of your


---------87:27----------
house yeah so in a sense it has helped


---------87:33----------
and I've like started going out more


---------87:35----------
with friends but then the next level


---------87:38----------
kind of above that is asking a girl out


---------87:40----------
right and that's still so terrifying to


---------87:44----------
me and and yeah I don't know I


---------87:47----------
understand why you'd start with that one


---------87:50----------
right so I guess that's a good point


---------87:54----------
like if you're able to go out with


---------87:57----------
friends and you ask me like how do I


---------87:58----------
leave the house then yeah and then it


---------88:05----------
you know I mean like if you're if your


---------88:07----------
thing is like I'm terrified of being


---------88:09----------
rejected by a girl then you know that's


---------88:11----------
different but I mean I I think I think


---------88:16----------
we've got and so we've got a few minutes


---------88:18----------
left and unfortunately I don't know let


---------88:20----------
me see if we have we have another


---------88:22----------
question because I kind of want to say


---------88:23----------
like that's the question we should


---------88:25----------
answer but there's another part of me


---------88:26----------
that's like if there are other people


---------88:28----------
waiting I should give them a chance too


---------88:31----------
right yeah


---------88:33----------
and of course I already know that's it


---------88:35----------
the answer is just ask right so no no


---------88:38----------
but see you haven't asked yet so it's


---------88:39----------
not just asked for you you see the


---------88:41----------
difference one is that like you've left


---------88:43----------
the home so you have an experience of a


---------88:46----------
thing right so you can rely on that


---------88:50----------
experience to help you overcome your


---------88:53----------
fear but if you've never had an


---------88:55----------
experience of the thing you can't just


---------88:57----------
tell someone to just do it do you


---------88:59----------
understand the difference there right


---------89:00----------
yeah


---------89:01----------
and just do it is usually the wrong


---------89:03----------
answer you are one of the rare people


---------89:05----------
for whom it's the right answer because


---------89:07----------
you already learned this okay right like


---------89:13----------
if you if you haven't if you are afraid


---------89:17----------
of asking out a girl get yourself a wife


---------89:21----------
ooh Larkin some salt love and then go


---------89:25----------
and ask out a girl because then you'll


---------89:28----------
have been in a relationship before I


---------89:32----------
know you're kind of moving now but yeah


---------89:35----------
me me let me just let me check in with


---------89:38----------
Moses and see if we have another


---------89:39----------
question and and then and then if not


---------89:42----------
then we'll okay hold on let me just let


---------89:44----------
me just hold on a second don't don't


---------89:46----------
leave yet okay hey do we have another


---------89:48----------
question or there's two more how may do


---------89:51----------
you want let's do yeah yeah I guess


---------90:01----------
let's let's do one more okay so yeah we


---------90:04----------
have a couple of questions so I'm gonna


---------90:06----------
I'm gonna have to ask you know let them


---------90:08----------
do that thing okay all right what's up


---------90:18----------
hey good how are you fine thanks


---------90:25----------
so my question would be rather personal


---------90:29----------
and is regarding the feeling of God you


---------90:35----------
were talking about and it's being


---------90:37----------
feeling sometimes like two sided


---------90:41----------
relationship where you give and you get


---------90:44----------
something out of it could you elaborate


---------90:47----------
a little more on this experience like so


---------90:54----------
what is my experience of a two sided


---------90:55----------
relationship with God so in the stream


---------91:01----------
you in the short section I don't know


---------91:06----------
about what time frame it was yeah yeah


---------91:09----------
but you talked about some or maybe I did


---------91:14----------
misunderstand you there no no I was


---------91:17----------
clarifying what your question was so I


---------91:18----------
made a statement about having sometimes


---------91:20----------
have a bizarre two sided relationship


---------91:23----------
with God right where I give and I


---------91:25----------
receive yeah yeah and so your question


---------91:28----------
is can i elaborate on that yes like how


---------91:34----------
does yeah how does it work out this


---------91:39----------
relationship that became one-sided turn


---------91:42----------
into two sided relationship I guess oh


---------91:46----------
yeah so I think there there are two


---------91:49----------
aspects to it the first is that


---------91:50----------
sometimes when I know I'm supposed to do


---------91:52----------
something so the first let's just take a


---------91:54----------
step back so first thing is like what's


---------91:57----------
the deal with God so I tend to be


---------91:58----------
skeptical by nature and I think that


---------92:00----------
like people I have yet to read a logical


---------92:03----------
or scientific a logical proof or a


---------92:07----------
scientific piece of evidence that


---------92:09----------
supports that convinces me that God


---------92:13----------
exists you with me so far


---------92:15----------
yep so I understand that that people


---------92:21----------
debate that kind of thing and in my own


---------92:24----------
experiences with like theism versus


---------92:27----------
non-theism which I think Hinduism like I


---------92:29----------
like Hinduism because Hinduism


---------92:31----------
a religion that is simultaneously


---------92:34----------
polytheistic monotheistic and atheistic


---------92:36----------
so their conception of God just fits way


---------92:40----------
better with me because they don't think


---------92:42----------
that there's a difference between


---------92:43----------
monotheism and atheism which I know


---------92:47----------
sounds different because we define the


---------92:48----------
words differently if they define God in


---------92:51----------
a way that sort of you can apply


---------92:53----------
monotheism and atheism to it in the same


---------92:56----------
way and the simplest analogy I can give


---------92:59----------
is you can say that h2o is a liquid a


---------93:02----------
solid or a gas and of course that makes


---------93:05----------
sense because we understand but like if


---------93:08----------
I were to tell you that ice and water


---------93:09----------
like ice and water are different but


---------93:12----------
they're both h2o right that sort of


---------93:15----------
makes sense like in one perspective


---------93:17----------
these two things are different but from


---------93:19----------
another perspective they're the same and


---------93:21----------
so Western religion or Western


---------93:25----------
philosophy tends to look at a theism and


---------93:27----------
monotheism is contradictory whereas


---------93:29----------
Eastern philosophy does not it's like


---------93:31----------
it's all h2o oh ok anyway so your


---------93:38----------
question is like what's the deal with my


---------93:39----------
two-way relationship with God so there


---------93:41----------
are two things the first is that I


---------93:43----------
started to through meditation discover


---------93:46----------
sources of knowledge that I do not think


---------93:48----------
were from me so we have this conception


---------93:51----------
that all of the knowledge that we get or


---------93:54----------
all of the understanding that we get


---------93:55----------
comes from us so if I read a math


---------93:58----------
textbook and there's information in the


---------94:00----------
math textbook and that the understanding


---------94:02----------
comes from me but as I started to


---------94:06----------
understand who I was I started to


---------94:10----------
recognize that I'm knowing things that


---------94:12----------
is not possible for a human to know like


---------94:18----------
I just saw I started to belong possible


---------94:20----------
in what sense so I'll just give you an


---------94:23----------
example so one time I had someone come


---------94:25----------
into my office and say to me I've heard


---------94:29----------
that you're the guy that like people


---------94:30----------
should talk to so she sat down in my


---------94:34----------
office and then she said so tell me tell


---------94:37----------
like give like you're the guy that fixes


---------94:39----------
people's lives right so she sat down in


---------94:41----------
my office and she said so fix mine


---------94:43----------
and then I was like I you know my first


---------94:47----------
instinct was like I don't know anything


---------94:49----------
about this person and then I just like


---------94:52----------
stop for a second I meditated and I


---------94:54----------
started talking and then 30 minutes


---------94:57----------
later she's crying in my office and


---------94:58----------
saying I've talked to half a dozen


---------95:00----------
therapists and like none of them have


---------95:02----------
ever been as helpful as this is and then


---------95:05----------
20 minutes later she walked out of my


---------95:07----------
office and I have never seen her again


---------95:08----------
now from a scientific perspective you


---------95:12----------
could say that my training in human


---------95:17----------
psychology allows me to talk to another


---------95:21----------
human being and read signals from them


---------95:23----------
and essentially do like cold reading


---------95:25----------
which is what psychics do and


---------95:28----------
essentially like train myself to be able


---------95:30----------
to do that you could say that that is a


---------95:32----------
skill that human beings can acquire that


---------95:35----------
a mastery in psychology and cold reading


---------95:37----------
allows someone to sit across from


---------95:39----------
another human being and like understand


---------95:41----------
them in a way that's like helpful and


---------95:43----------
transformative for that person does that


---------95:45----------
make sense you know cold reading is no


---------95:48----------
it didn't


---------95:49----------
it's basically attempting but that


---------95:51----------
psychics use okay right so but then like


---------95:55----------
the more I stop and think about a


---------95:56----------
mission I don't think I don't think I'm


---------95:58----------
that good at psychology and so they're


---------96:01----------
like when I have experiences like that


---------96:03----------
it makes me like really scratch my head


---------96:04----------
and say am I just that badass and I'm


---------96:07----------
pretty sure I'm not because like I sort


---------96:08----------
of know what I'm capable of and I know


---------96:10----------
that I'm not capable of that like if you


---------96:12----------
take a hundred people and you stick them


---------96:14----------
in front of me and you say like oh like


---------96:15----------
Anna like like I can't do that's not


---------96:18----------
possible right that's just not possible


---------96:20----------
like I don't believe that that's


---------96:21----------
possible so then if I'm not capable of


---------96:24----------
doing that but that clearly happened and


---------96:26----------
like where is that coming from


---------96:29----------
so that's oh so so like I don't know


---------96:34----------
what that thing is


---------96:36----------
but I have trouble accepting that that


---------96:39----------
was me and I have trouble accepting that


---------96:41----------
that didn't happen so I accept that that


---------96:43----------
happened and I'm pretty sure it wasn't


---------96:45----------
me because I'm pretty sure I know what


---------96:46----------
I'm capable of and so that's one it's an


---------96:50----------
anecdote absolutely right so like that


---------96:52----------
gets me questioning though I'm not


---------96:53----------
saying it's evidence I'm just saying


---------96:55----------
like this is [ __ ]


---------96:56----------
using for me and then you guys are


---------96:59----------
asking about my personal experiences


---------97:01----------
which I'm not claiming to have knowledge


---------97:03----------
of this kind of stuff that's just like


---------97:04----------
you're asking for my subjective


---------97:06----------
experience and this is what I'm sharing


---------97:07----------
with you I'm not saying I'm right you


---------97:09----------
guys say I'm [ __ ] dumb or I'm [ __ ]


---------97:11----------
amazing or I hallucinate it it I will


---------97:13----------
accept all those things I've thought


---------97:15----------
about that stuff it still kind of is in


---------97:18----------
my mind as possibilities and the other


---------97:20----------
thing that happens I know this is gonna


---------97:21----------
sound really weird but sometimes I do


---------97:24----------
things that I know I'm not supposed to


---------97:25----------
do and I feel like I just get


---------97:27----------
bitch-slapped by god it's it's hard to


---------97:30----------
describe but like sometimes when I lose


---------97:32----------
patience with my kids like I get hurt in


---------97:34----------
some way it's just really strange like


---------97:38----------
weird things will happen around me and


---------97:40----------
like there's a part of me that says oh


---------97:42----------
this is just your mind reading into


---------97:45----------
cognitive bias around like and there's


---------97:48----------
like definitely like an availability


---------97:49----------
bias like I get mad at my kid like a


---------97:52----------
dozen times but the only times that I


---------97:54----------
remember are the ones that something


---------97:56----------
happens to me so I'm aware of that


---------97:58----------
cognitive bias and I kind of look out


---------97:59----------
for it I'm not saying that this is


---------98:01----------
actually the case like I think that


---------98:02----------
scientifically if someone came to my


---------98:04----------
office and said I think this is


---------98:05----------
happening I would say them you know


---------98:08----------
there's a decent chance this is


---------98:09----------
availability bias so you're


---------98:10----------
misremembering certain things but like


---------98:13----------
just the simplest thing that I can tell


---------98:14----------
you is like I forgot even what it was I


---------98:19----------
was outside and I got mad at my kid in a


---------98:23----------
way that I knew I shouldn't have and


---------98:25----------
like something like a bug flew into my


---------98:28----------
eye within the next few seconds and it


---------98:31----------
was just weird it was just like really


---------98:32----------
really weird and that's happened to me a


---------98:33----------
few times and so like is that


---------98:36----------
availability but like literally like a


---------98:37----------
bug flew into my eye and like hurt the


---------98:39----------
[ __ ] out of my eye I was like what the


---------98:41----------
[ __ ] it's just strange like I don't is


---------98:44----------
it biased like absolutely like it should


---------98:46----------
be biased right this is just me


---------98:47----------
misremembering because I get mad at my


---------98:49----------
kid every day it's just me


---------98:51----------
misremembering but then there's a part


---------98:54----------
of myself there's like a part of me that


---------98:55----------
feels like it's not misremembering it's


---------98:57----------
like actually like maybe you should pay


---------98:59----------
attention to this and so I don't know


---------99:02----------
what's real and what isn't but like it


---------99:05----------
makes me question


---------99:08----------
and okay yeah make sense and then kind


---------99:15----------
of paying attention more recognizing


---------99:19----------
such yeah experiences feelings yeah so I


---------99:25----------
really don't know what the deal is


---------99:27----------
they're like is it just cognitive bias


---------99:29----------
so now I pay attention right I pay


---------99:31----------
attention to every time I get mad at my


---------99:33----------
kid and I like in my mind I sort of have


---------99:35----------
like a mental tally and and like I try


---------99:39----------
to keep track like I actually study it


---------99:41----------
like I collect data and so far I haven't


---------99:45----------
met any conclusions sorry to say like so


---------99:49----------
cuz it caught a cognitive bias like


---------99:51----------
absolutely could be like that sounds as


---------99:53----------
sure as hell sounds like cognitive bias


---------99:55----------
and the availability bias right like I'm


---------99:58----------
misremembering things but it feels


---------100:00----------
different and one thing that I've come


---------100:01----------
to appreciate is that just because


---------100:04----------
something doesn't make sense in my head


---------100:06----------
doesn't mean it's correct it's incorrect


---------100:07----------
and in fact humanity's biggest


---------100:11----------
advancements have come from things that


---------100:13----------
don't make sense to people I don't know


---------100:19----------
if that like so for example when


---------100:21----------
Einstein discovered relativity he


---------100:23----------
started questioning the fixed nature of


---------100:27----------
time which is so non-intuitive so I've


---------100:30----------
come to appreciate that like grit like


---------100:32----------
if I want to really learn things its


---------100:34----------
questioning things that I hold to be


---------100:36----------
absolutely true and so anytime I get


---------100:38----------
data that contradicts something that I


---------100:41----------
hold to be absolutely true like that


---------100:43----------
there isn't a God then I stop and pause


---------100:46----------
and I really try to study it


---------100:54----------
the Einstein part was a bit too complex


---------101:00----------
to grasp from your mind


---------101:02----------
so the point behind the Einstein part is


---------101:04----------
that Einstein questioned some things


---------101:06----------
that everyone knew to be true oh yeah


---------101:10----------
right


---------101:11----------
so like when I have a belief that for


---------101:13----------
example like I don't believe that God


---------101:15----------
bitchslaps me when I mean to my kid like


---------101:17----------
that just doesn't there is not good


---------101:19----------
evidence in the world that God responds


---------101:21----------
to evil in a direct way so even if we


---------101:27----------
think something is wrong we could be


---------101:29----------
ourselves wrong about being absolutely


---------101:33----------
so that's what I've come to realize and


---------101:35----------
so that's made Neri question and like


---------101:38----------
put a question mark into like what's the


---------101:41----------
deal with God because evil happens all


---------101:44----------
over the place so it just doesn't make


---------101:45----------
sense to me that they're like people


---------101:46----------
committing genocide and God has the time


---------101:49----------
or inclination to send up like a fly


---------101:51----------
into my eye when I mean to my kid look


---------101:53----------
that just doesn't make any logical sense


---------101:56----------
right yeah


---------101:57----------
no but but at the same time like flies


---------102:00----------
keep on winding up in my eye so like


---------102:02----------
what the [ __ ] is up with that and that's


---------102:04----------
where I am which is like it's just too


---------102:08----------
either it's like too coincidental


---------102:10----------
because flies keep on winding up in my


---------102:12----------
eye and like like it's just weird so I


---------102:15----------
haven't figured it out but I'm just I'm


---------102:17----------
looking into it and trying to figure it


---------102:19----------
out like an experiment it's running yeah


---------102:23----------
absolutely and if you have any thoughts


---------102:25----------
about how this [ __ ] works by all means


---------102:27----------
or twitch chat does like I'm trying to


---------102:31----------
figure it out yeah I think him at that


---------102:35----------
point - at the moment can say I figured


---------102:37----------
anything out on that domain yeah so


---------102:43----------
thank you for your question yeah thanks


---------102:45----------
a lot man I'm sorry if I was like not


---------102:48----------
you know unfortunately I don't have


---------102:49----------
enlightened answers for everything that


---------102:51----------
you guys ask but I'm happy to ask them


---------102:52----------
answer them I mean it's kind of the


---------102:58----------
discussion part about it which thinks it


---------103:02----------
makes me think getting there yeah so one


---------103:06----------
thing that I would leave for you


---------103:07----------
like don't let logic outweigh experience


---------103:13----------
so this is something I feel really


---------103:15----------
confident maybe this is what I should


---------103:16----------
have said all along is that I have come


---------103:18----------
to appreciate that the conclusions of a


---------103:21----------
logical mind are not the only source of


---------103:24----------
information and sometimes are actually


---------103:26----------
completely useless like it like the case


---------103:29----------
with anxiety like if you've got anxiety


---------103:31----------
it doesn't matter like if you take


---------103:33----------
someone with OCD who has a part of their


---------103:35----------
brain that tells them unless you turn


---------103:37----------
off and on the light seven times a


---------103:40----------
meteor is gonna hit your parents it


---------103:43----------
doesn't matter how illogical the thought


---------103:44----------
is like there there are forces within


---------103:47----------
you that act upon you or potentially in


---------103:50----------
the outside world that don't adhere to


---------103:52----------
logic and the people influence kind of


---------103:56----------
then start acting like it's real anyway


---------104:00----------
yeah so like I think that's just


---------104:02----------
experience is real to them absolutely so


---------104:05----------
I think that this is where like a lot of


---------104:06----------
people say oh this is not logical


---------104:08----------
therefore I should not believe it but I


---------104:11----------
think that there are all kinds of things


---------104:13----------
that you can believe that exists outside


---------104:14----------
of logic and their sources of


---------104:16----------
information that come outside of logic


---------104:18----------
and so so if you have an experience of


---------104:22----------
something don't just discard it because


---------104:23----------
it's illogical just that by meditation


---------104:28----------
and yoga comes in for me absolutely


---------104:31----------
because meditation is where I learned


---------104:33----------
truths that were not founded in logic


---------104:35----------
and right off through experience but


---------104:42----------
goes yeah so meditation is about


---------104:44----------
cultivating experience right so like


---------104:48----------
like I'll just give you one last example


---------104:50----------
then we have to transition I think as


---------104:52----------
we've got Ethan but so like some people


---------104:54----------
have asked me about past lives so the


---------104:56----------
way that I understand past lives is like


---------104:58----------
you have memories of your past right


---------105:02----------
yeah okay so like what what would you do


---------105:06----------
one day if you woke up and in the same


---------105:08----------
way like you remember what you had for


---------105:09----------
lunch yesterday


---------105:13----------
um no okay so you can take any map like


---------105:18----------
your memories are like normal right like


---------105:20----------
they're just a normal part of you like


---------105:21----------
you remember this you remember this


---------105:23----------
movie you remember this you remember


---------105:24----------
this so imagine you wake up one day and


---------105:28----------
you have memories of a life that isn't


---------105:30----------
yours like how do you understand that


---------105:34----------
like what is that phenomenon like does


---------105:37----------
that mean that past lives are real like


---------105:39----------
I don't know but it's [ __ ] weird it's


---------105:41----------
it's weird to wake up one day and have


---------105:43----------
memories of a life that does not exist


---------105:46----------
but it's not imagination it feels like a


---------105:49----------
memory it's not like something you make


---------105:51----------
up it's just you remember it it has the


---------105:53----------
same casualness of memory and so my


---------105:56----------
point is that like if you have an


---------105:57----------
experience like that which sometimes I I


---------105:59----------
work with people who have experiences


---------106:00----------
like that then I don't think you should


---------106:02----------
just discard it because it's not logical


---------106:04----------
because clear like that's coming from


---------106:06----------
somewhere so try to figure out like


---------106:08----------
what's the deal with that like is there


---------106:10----------
some system of logic that does explain


---------106:13----------
it investigate it and don't discard it


---------106:15----------
just because it's not logical okay make


---------106:20----------
sense kind of like an anxious person


---------106:23----------
might get anxious because there really


---------106:25----------
is fret to the person yes so for example


---------106:30----------
one patient that I worked with had


---------106:32----------
anxiety for 17 years and had worked with


---------106:34----------
multiple psychiatrists and therapists


---------106:36----------
and we've been able to help her a lot


---------106:39----------
and the way that we helped her was by


---------106:41----------
starting with the idea that her anxiety


---------106:44----------
is real and not false that in and of


---------106:46----------
itself has helped her immensely because


---------106:49----------
she was aware of things that people told


---------106:52----------
her as a child were not true that


---------106:53----------
actually were and so like that became


---------106:57----------
anxiety because like but her fears were


---------106:59----------
really real because she understood what


---------107:01----------
was going on and they just didn't


---------107:03----------
explain it to her and that's become her


---------107:04----------
anxiety disorder so the interesting


---------107:06----------
thing is that the more that we embrace


---------107:08----------
and explore her illogical anxiety the


---------107:11----------
more she realizes oh actually I knew


---------107:13----------
this all along and the better than our


---------107:15----------
anxiety is just like going away it's


---------107:17----------
really strange like I don't know if that


---------107:18----------
makes sense but it it's a strange yeah


---------107:20----------
of course kind kind of like the feeling


---------107:24----------
was had the purpose with


---------107:27----------
every isn't behind it absolutely


---------107:31----------
absolutely so so the takeaway for all of


---------107:35----------
you guys is that don't just trust logic


---------107:37----------
because logic is flawed or incomplete


---------107:40----------
and there are other sources of


---------107:42----------
information and what I try to do is just


---------107:44----------
explore each and every one of those


---------107:46----------
right and try to figure out what your


---------107:49----------
own answers are irrespective of whether


---------107:50----------
they're logical or not all right thank


---------107:58----------
you all right take care


---------108:00----------
Enza see
