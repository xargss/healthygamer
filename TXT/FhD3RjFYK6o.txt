---------00:00----------
I used to have a passion competitive


---------00:03----------
gaming and I can't really transition


---------00:04----------
that into anything in real life trying


---------00:06----------
to find my thermo doesn't really work


---------00:07----------
for me because I don't feel like I care


---------00:09----------
about anything else


---------00:10----------
what can I do great question okay so I'm


---------00:12----------
gonna tell you guys a story about Tyra


---------00:14----------
mine a little bit and then because


---------00:15----------
everyone's wondering how do you find


---------00:16----------
your Dharma okay so I think that the


---------00:22----------
problem is that your options to


---------00:23----------
transition and real life are


---------00:25----------
insufficient they're like to low level


---------00:27----------
so generally speaking when people are


---------00:31----------
competitive in gaming they tend to be


---------00:32----------
very skilled they're very dedicated very


---------00:35----------
intelligent and their options in the


---------00:37----------
real world don't actually like challenge


---------00:40----------
them sufficiently so I think that the


---------00:42----------
biggest thing the first thing that you


---------00:43----------
should do is try to find the hardest


---------00:45----------
thing that you can do in real life like


---------00:46----------
don't just get a job I mean if you need


---------00:48----------
to get a job bagging groceries like get


---------00:50----------
a job bagging groceries but I would say


---------00:52----------
like you know likes like there are all


---------00:54----------
kinds of certifications and stuff that


---------00:56----------
you can get now so I'd say like get


---------00:57----------
Google Analytics like certified like at


---------00:59----------
Google Analytics SEO certified or


---------01:02----------
something like that you have to decide


---------01:03----------
what it is for you but find something


---------01:05----------
that's actually difficult and actually


---------01:07----------
engaging you know like there may be like


---------01:10----------
you may be able to find like one of


---------01:11----------
these like day trading sweatshops like


---------01:13----------
go hang out there go like see what those


---------01:15----------
people are doing go challenge yourself I


---------01:17----------
don't know where you are but if there


---------01:19----------
are any startups in the area like reach


---------01:20----------
out to startups and say like hey are you


---------01:23----------
guys looking for an intern go and do


---------01:25----------
something that actually challenges you


---------01:27----------
and don't worry so much about finding


---------01:30----------
your autonomy right now like it's this


---------01:31----------
is also you know we were talking to sky


---------01:34----------
and sky sort of has this idea that like


---------01:36----------
once he loses weight then he can create


---------01:40----------
all this content so in this person's


---------01:42----------
question I used to have a passion and


---------01:44----------
competitive gaming and I can't really


---------01:45----------
transition that into anything in real


---------01:47----------
life trying to find my Dharma doesn't


---------01:49----------
really work for me because I don't feel


---------01:50----------
like I care about anything else what can


---------01:52----------
I do this person has this idea that once


---------01:55----------
they find their Dharma everything is


---------01:56----------
going to be easy it's delaying action


---------01:59----------
until the perfect set of circumstances


---------02:01----------
which is something that gamers do all


---------02:03----------
the time right I'm gonna apply to


---------02:06----------
college when I know I can get into


---------02:08----------
Harvard and until that happens I'm not


---------02:10----------
even apply


---------02:12----------
right I'm gonna go to the gym this is my


---------02:15----------
favorite I'm gonna go to the gym once


---------02:17----------
I'm in shape that's the best one that's


---------02:20----------
my favorite right I'm gonna go to the


---------02:22----------
gym once I don't feel embarrassed to be


---------02:24----------
there


---------02:26----------
brilliant right I've thought it have you


---------02:30----------
guys thought it it's [ __ ] crazy it's


---------02:32----------
stupid but we all think that way we all


---------02:35----------
think like ok my life begins once I get


---------02:38----------
to this point no your life begins today


---------02:40----------
it's just a waste shittier version than


---------02:42----------
what you're envisioning that's the


---------02:43----------
problem but that's ok so do something I


---------02:47----------
tell this person to do something and do


---------02:50----------
something challenging try to find the


---------02:51----------
most challenging thing that you can and


---------02:53----------
do that thing I think like I mean so


---------02:56----------
Google and like Microsoft and a couple


---------02:59----------
of these other companies no longer


---------03:00----------
require college degrees they just want


---------03:02----------
people who are able to do [ __ ] and cool


---------03:05----------
thing is like we live in this world I


---------03:06----------
know I'm a Boomer so this may be news to


---------03:09----------
me like apparently all you kids know


---------03:11----------
about this thing called the Internet and


---------03:12----------
you can learn all kinds of stuff on the


---------03:14----------
internet like you can learn finance you


---------03:16----------
can learn economics you can even learn a


---------03:18----------
lot of medicine you can learn a lot on


---------03:20----------
the Internet you can learn marketing you


---------03:22----------
can actually like actually do this thing


---------03:24----------
where you just make this thing called a


---------03:25----------
website and then you can learn some


---------03:28----------
skill and you can start charging people


---------03:29----------
for the skill you can just make it like


---------03:32----------
you can just learn something and create


---------03:34----------
a business there are all these kids


---------03:36----------
nowadays that are like entrepreneurs


---------03:38----------
like back in my day being an


---------03:40----------
entrepreneur involved like brick and


---------03:42----------
mortar and building something and having


---------03:45----------
trucks and workers but all these kids


---------03:47----------
nowadays they're just like making tens


---------03:51----------
of thousands or hundreds of thousands of


---------03:52----------
dollars without any professional


---------03:54----------
training like there's one guy that I


---------03:56----------
worked with like Believe It or Not who


---------03:58----------
would sell figurines on eBay after


---------04:00----------
painting them and made like 5 grand a


---------04:03----------
month just [ __ ] selling figurines he


---------04:06----------
buys them paints them and sells them


---------04:09----------
like that's crazy so start doing


---------04:12----------
something


---------04:14----------
and try to do the most challenging thing


---------04:16----------
that you can right now I'm trying to


---------04:20----------
transition it so next question right now


---------04:23----------
I'm trying to transition out of gaming


---------04:24----------
so I'm just kind of curious about this


---------04:26----------
okay


---------04:30----------
[Music]


---------04:44----------
yes so like I'm seeing I'm just looking


---------04:47----------
at I just did a search for like


---------04:49----------
Warhammer


---------04:51----------
and there's like there's three adept


---------04:53----------
disgusto DS Verta spray ders which are


---------04:56----------
selling for $80 I don't even know what


---------04:57----------
that is but the three figurines that are


---------04:59----------
selling for a hundred bucks like I'm not


---------05:02----------
saying it's like a lucrative market it


---------05:03----------
may have like you know evened out in


---------05:05----------
terms of supply and demand but like you


---------05:07----------
can make money in all kinds of ways okay


---------05:10----------
going on to question four


---------05:17----------
okay so right now I'm trying to


---------05:19----------
transition out of gaming into learning


---------05:20----------
marketing so I can actually make money


---------05:22----------
on my own perfect so this person is like


---------05:25----------
this is great whoever's cueing these


---------05:27----------
questions up because this person is one


---------05:28----------
step after the last person I've kind of


---------05:32----------
struggled with this problem my whole


---------05:33----------
life but I basically really get really


---------05:35----------
into something for a few months to a


---------05:37----------
year and then I stopped caring and


---------05:38----------
losing and lose motivation I don't


---------05:42----------
really like the idea of relying on


---------05:43----------
motivation because motivation doesn't


---------05:45----------
have to be the only factor in taking


---------05:47----------
action but I don't know why I always


---------05:49----------
have this pattern of getting good at


---------05:50----------
something but before I master it or get


---------05:53----------
super good at it I lose interest I'm not


---------05:56----------
sure if it is a fear of failure or what


---------05:58----------
but I would seriously love your thoughts


---------06:00----------
on this because it's been a problem for


---------06:01----------
me for awhile I've had this happen in


---------06:05----------
games too where I get a really high


---------06:07----------
level close to low tier Pro and then


---------06:10----------
lose interest this is a fantastic


---------06:13----------
question I'm just going to think for a


---------06:15----------
second about the answer


---------06:39----------
okay so there are two there are two


---------06:43----------
layers of answers to this question


---------06:45----------
one is why it happens right so if we are


---------06:49----------
if we start to ask the question of why


---------06:51----------
does this happen and then we can


---------06:54----------
understand the root of it and we can


---------06:55----------
sort of dissolve it as its root the


---------06:57----------
second is like how to deal with it on a


---------06:58----------
practical level


---------06:59----------
so in today's interview we talked some


---------07:02----------
about like you know weight loss and


---------07:04----------
stuff like that we ended with like


---------07:05----------
practical stuff because I think you have


---------07:06----------
to practically do something so the first


---------07:09----------
problem that this person has I think is


---------07:11----------
a problem of what I call orbit so the


---------07:14----------
problem is that his motivation he's


---------07:16----------
relying on he or she is relying on


---------07:18----------
motivation to be the primary thing that


---------07:23----------
keeps them on track and they've noticed


---------07:26----------
there it's good they're reflecting and


---------07:28----------
they've noticed that their motivation is


---------07:30----------
naturally fueled for a while and then


---------07:32----------
gets like like fizzles out so this is


---------07:38----------
very important so I think that the orbit


---------07:40----------
that you surround yourself with is very


---------07:42----------
important for sustaining motivation the


---------07:44----------
simplest way to create and sustain


---------07:46----------
motivation is by orbit so like what are


---------07:51----------
you orbiting around what are you


---------07:52----------
spinning around who's in your orbit and


---------07:54----------
whose orbit are you in what is your


---------07:56----------
community so in meditation there's a


---------08:00----------
saying that one of the crucial things


---------08:01----------
that you need to succeed in meditation


---------08:03----------
is something called Sangha si ng H a and


---------08:08----------
Sangha means community and they say that


---------08:11----------
like successes or spiritual growth


---------08:13----------
requires community which is kind of


---------08:16----------
weird because like spiritual like


---------08:17----------
meditating is like a solo practice right


---------08:19----------
it's a single-player game so why on


---------08:21----------
earth do you need a community if you're


---------08:23----------
like playing a single-player game and


---------08:25----------
the simple truth is that like if you're


---------08:28----------
meditating all by yourself over time


---------08:30----------
you're gonna fizzle out but if you go to


---------08:32----------
lectures if you go to talks if you go to


---------08:35----------
sits now that anchors you to continue


---------08:38----------
moving forward on your path because


---------08:40----------
people around you are doing it my


---------08:42----------
favorite example of this is something


---------08:44----------
called NaNoWriMo which is National Novel


---------08:46----------
Writing Month so in the month of


---------08:48----------
November there's this thing called


---------08:49----------
NaNoWriMo which is National Novel


---------08:52----------
Writing Month


---------08:53----------
we're a bunch of people who want to


---------08:55----------
write novels and never have gotten


---------08:57----------
around to it decide that they're gonna


---------08:58----------
get together and write a novel in 30


---------09:00----------
days so what these people do is they set


---------09:03----------
up like things all over the world where


---------09:05----------
like you go to your city and people in


---------09:07----------
your city who also want to write novels


---------09:09----------
get together at random places at random


---------09:11----------
times so they like build up a schedule


---------09:12----------
someone says like you guys can come over


---------09:14----------
to my house I'll be here from 5:00 p.m.


---------09:16----------
to midnight anyone who wants to come can


---------09:19----------
come and write we're gonna be at this


---------09:21----------
library we're gonna meet at this coffee


---------09:22----------
shop and then like a bunch of people who


---------09:25----------
have wanted to write novels the entire


---------09:27----------
year actually managed to write a lot


---------09:29----------
during NaNoWriMo why is that it's


---------09:31----------
because their orbit changes in terms of


---------09:34----------
my spiritual growth like I didn't start


---------09:36----------
by like meditating at home like I didn't


---------09:38----------
do that I went to an ashram where I was


---------09:40----------
surrounded by people who were there to


---------09:42----------
meditate and for 90 days every day there


---------09:45----------
were like structured meditations so it's


---------09:47----------
not habit it's not motivation it's


---------09:51----------
[ __ ] structure structure structure


---------09:53----------
structure and when you think about like


---------09:57----------
so when this person says I've been I've


---------09:58----------
been learning marketing my question


---------10:00----------
would be who are you hanging out with


---------10:02----------
because eight months into this when your


---------10:05----------
motivation fizzles if you're surrounded


---------10:08----------
by people who are still interested in it


---------10:10----------
they're gonna pull you back in


---------10:13----------
so if you think about even addictions so


---------10:16----------
what is the most successful alcohol


---------10:20----------
treatment to date is Alcoholics


---------10:22----------
Anonymous more people have quit alcohol


---------10:25----------
through Alcoholics Anonymous than


---------10:26----------
anything else


---------10:27----------
way more than doctors therapists


---------10:30----------
medication actually may be the most


---------10:33----------
successful thing is quitting it on your


---------10:36----------
own but there's not good date about that


---------10:37----------
in terms of interventions AAA is the


---------10:40----------
best thing and so a is whole thing is


---------10:42----------
about Sangha community so my first point


---------10:46----------
to this person is that it you have to


---------10:48----------
understand that motivation is going to


---------10:49----------
wane and what you need to cultivate is a


---------10:51----------
community who are you hanging out with


---------10:54----------
right I think that's the problem I would


---------10:57----------
guess that this person is not hanging


---------10:59----------
out with people who continue to push


---------11:01----------
them and inspire them to be better and


---------11:06----------
so you're thinking about like why is it


---------11:08----------
so easy to like continue to play dota


---------11:10----------
it's because all the [ __ ] people on


---------11:11----------
my friends list play dota and so when I


---------11:13----------
log on like they're playing dota and


---------11:15----------
then I feel like playing dota if no one


---------11:19----------
honor my friends let's play DotA like if


---------11:20----------
it had if I didn't have anyone to play


---------11:22----------
dota with I wouldn't play DotA like


---------11:23----------
nearly as much right think about that


---------11:26----------
for a second and I don't know if gaming


---------11:29----------
developers like did this on purpose but


---------11:31----------
they recognized at some point that


---------11:34----------
giving you a feature to create a


---------11:35----------
community online will keep you playing


---------11:38----------
the game and I don't think it's like


---------11:40----------
about addiction I think it's just about


---------11:41----------
like that's how human beings work when


---------11:43----------
we have a community that drives us to do


---------11:45----------
something we're gonna do more of it so I


---------11:48----------
think the first thing if your motivation


---------11:50----------
wanes over time is to think about how


---------11:52----------
much of your motivation is like soullow


---------11:54----------
driven are you being inspired and pushed


---------11:57----------
by the people around you and if not then


---------12:01----------
that's your problem so the simplest


---------12:03----------
thing you can do rather than getting to


---------12:05----------
the root of your problem and all this


---------12:06----------
kind of [ __ ] that I do on stream the


---------12:08----------
quick-and-dirty is like create a


---------12:09----------
community that supports you join a


---------12:11----------
community that supports you that's what


---------12:14----------
actually I mean our whole bit like model


---------12:16----------
our business model or model in healthy


---------12:19----------
gamer business is weird because we're


---------12:20----------
not really making money but is to like


---------12:22----------
create a community for gamers right it's


---------12:25----------
like we that's why we have a discord


---------12:26----------
like


---------12:27----------
I think that this helps like watching me


---------12:29----------
stream randomly once is fine but when


---------12:32----------
you guys come back and you're with other


---------12:34----------
people like think about what we're doing


---------12:35----------
and why this stream is helpful it's


---------12:38----------
because there's a community it's because


---------12:40----------
you're not going alone this is not you


---------12:42----------
reading a book on your own and just like


---------12:45----------
listening to all my thoughts it's you


---------12:50----------
guys come here and oh [ __ ] this person's


---------12:53----------
question resonates with other people who


---------12:55----------
are watching that's community and now


---------12:58----------
you guys are interested in this because


---------12:59----------
this person asked this question there's


---------13:01----------
a there's a benefit of like people


---------13:03----------
working together towards a common goal


---------13:05----------
and so build a community for yourself


---------13:09----------
think about the community that you want


---------13:11----------
to join that's the first thing orbit


---------13:15----------
Sangha so there's like a scientific


---------13:18----------
version of this which is orbit and then


---------13:20----------
there's a spiritual version of this


---------13:22----------
which is sungki so this - there have


---------13:27----------
been studies in terms of like


---------13:28----------
communities and stuff you guys wanna


---------13:29----------
know about science so researcher Andy


---------13:31----------
coming prepare yourselves there was a


---------13:34----------
study that showed like that was looking


---------13:36----------
at factors for teen age of marijuana use


---------13:38----------
and what do you guys think the most


---------13:40----------
important factor is for teenage


---------13:42----------
marijuana use right it's your friends if


---------13:52----------
your friends smoke pot you're way more


---------13:53----------
likely to smoke pot it's not even social


---------13:56----------
pressure it's not peer pressure it's not


---------13:59----------
pressure it's just [ __ ] monkey see


---------14:01----------
monkey do


---------14:02----------
like when I log on to steam and my


---------14:06----------
friends are playing dota


---------14:07----------
I don't feel pressure it's not like oh


---------14:10----------
man if I don't like play dota those guys


---------14:11----------
are gonna make fun of me it's not


---------14:12----------
pressure sometimes there's peer pressure


---------14:14----------
sometimes there's bullying but most of


---------14:16----------
it it's just like they're playing dota I


---------14:19----------
like I'll play some dota 2 like oh


---------14:20----------
you're smoking - Jon joint give me give


---------14:22----------
me a hit that's that's what it is so


---------14:24----------
create a community for yourself and


---------14:27----------
you'll be amazed at what you're capable


---------14:29----------
of so I got lucky because like I joined


---------14:32----------
this community where I peers and


---------14:34----------
colleagues who were very motivated to do


---------14:37----------
[ __ ]


---------14:38----------
and so like it helped me because then I


---------14:40----------
started doing [ __ ] they were all like


---------14:42----------
researchers and like studying like the


---------14:44----------
origins of schizophrenia and like


---------14:46----------
starting businesses and stuff like that


---------14:48----------
these are the people that I would be


---------14:49----------
on-call with then it's like well [ __ ]


---------14:51----------
like I like to play video games like I'm


---------14:56----------
a gamer and all these people they're


---------14:57----------
like MD PhDs in an institution on in the


---------15:01----------
Northeast which I shall not name and


---------15:03----------
then like I was like well [ __ ] maybe I


---------15:05----------
should do something and I was like I


---------15:07----------
don't want it so I tried doing things


---------15:09----------
their way I was like let me try doing


---------15:10----------
research students like this [ __ ]


---------15:11----------
sucks and I was like I like to play


---------15:14----------
video games maybe I can do research on


---------15:15----------
that maybe I could do something for


---------15:17----------
gamers I was like oh this is pretty cool


---------15:19----------
but if I hadn't been at that institution


---------15:22----------
I probably probably would have entered


---------15:23----------
my mind to do research or and/or start a


---------15:26----------
company that's devoted to helping a


---------15:28----------
particular problem so create your


---------15:31----------
community okay so let me think about


---------15:40----------
this so I've struggle with this problem


---------15:41----------
I basically get really into something


---------15:43----------
for a few months to here and then stop


---------15:44----------
caring and lose motivation I'm not sure


---------15:46----------
if it's feeling or failure or what I


---------15:47----------
would seriously love your thoughts yeah


---------15:50----------
so I don't think it's fear of failure I


---------15:52----------
mean it could be but I would guess that


---------15:55----------
you just get bored right today actually


---------15:57----------
use the word bored yeah so I think what


---------16:06----------
what motivates you is like learning a


---------16:09----------
new problem right it's like something


---------16:11----------
that's new and exciting and so I think


---------16:13----------
the problem is that you give up when the


---------16:15----------
end is in sight like it's sort of like


---------16:17----------
and that's not because and that's just


---------16:19----------
because you figured stuff out at that


---------16:21----------
point I would be really curious about


---------16:23----------
whether this person gives up motivation


---------16:25----------
towards the end because like they


---------16:27----------
figured it out like the fun part is the


---------16:28----------
figuring it out so it's kind of weird


---------16:31----------
but this is I was planning on becoming


---------16:32----------
an oncologist and part of the reason I


---------16:35----------
didn't become an oncologist and this


---------16:36----------
isn't to diss anyone but I just found


---------16:38----------
that like figuring out medicine was fun


---------16:41----------
like figuring out how the heart works


---------16:42----------
was fun figuring out how cancer works


---------16:44----------
was fun figuring out like how the


---------16:46----------
kidneys work was fun but once I figured


---------16:49----------
it out I started to get bored of it


---------16:50----------
I was kind of like well like now it's


---------16:53----------
just the same thing okay like if their


---------16:54----------
heart works this way then I do this it


---------16:56----------
works this way I do this that all these


---------16:57----------
protocols because we use evidence-based


---------16:59----------
medicines there of all these big trials


---------17:01----------
and it's really like figuring out okay


---------17:03----------
like which is the best treatment based


---------17:04----------
on all this available data and what I


---------17:07----------
liked about psychiatry is like I have no


---------17:08----------
[ __ ] idea what to do


---------17:10----------
there is no like protocol it's like when


---------17:13----------
sky shows up like I don't know what to


---------17:15----------
say like I've talked to him once before


---------17:16----------
like I don't know what like he's a


---------17:18----------
different person now like I don't know


---------17:19----------
what to do that's fun for me


---------17:21----------
I get bored easily too so I like I'm


---------17:25----------
like I don't know I don't know if I'm


---------17:26----------
gonna do a healthy game for 20 years


---------17:28----------
like I may just stop in a year like I


---------17:29----------
the same thing happens to me I like get


---------17:31----------
interested with stuff and I move on and


---------17:33----------
that's fine so I think that what the


---------17:37----------
second thing that I suggest is that it's


---------17:39----------
not that you're like lazy it's that you


---------17:41----------
get bored easily right I'm not gonna


---------17:43----------
leave you don't worry but


---------17:49----------
you know I'd say that this person kind


---------17:51----------
of gets bored easily and so like if


---------17:55----------
that's your problem then I would say


---------17:56----------
like try to do a couple of different


---------17:58----------
things at the same time this is gonna


---------18:00----------
sound kind of weird but if you get bored


---------18:02----------
of marketing like start a marketing


---------18:04----------
thing and then shift 80% of your focus


---------18:07----------
to something else but maintain 20% to


---------18:09----------
focus in marketing because the way that


---------18:11----------
you're gonna grow is when you get bored


---------18:13----------
let's say you want to learn piano and


---------18:14----------
you like marketing so like oh like I'm


---------18:16----------
kind of done with marketing let me go to


---------18:18----------
piano and then if you maintain the


---------18:20----------
marketing a little bit when you get


---------18:22----------
bored of piano you can come back to


---------18:23----------
marketing it'll be just as fun as it


---------18:26----------
originally was


---------18:28----------
so you can kind of juggle a couple of


---------18:30----------
different things so one one of my


---------18:32----------
teachers once told me that like your


---------18:34----------
problem is that you get bored easily and


---------18:36----------
so you should try to do multiple things


---------18:38----------
and when you get bored of one thing then


---------18:40----------
you can move to the next thing and where


---------18:42----------
you get bored of that thing you come


---------18:43----------
back to number one so now I do like two


---------18:46----------
or three things and that's just how my


---------18:48----------
day is like I can't see


---------18:49----------
I saw patients for a few hours this


---------18:51----------
morning and then I stream like part of


---------18:54----------
healthy gamers because I couldn't just


---------18:56----------
work with people in my office all day


---------18:57----------
that's [ __ ] boring it's not that I


---------18:59----------
don't like him it's just I get bored and


---------19:01----------
so I try to create a life in which I'm


---------19:04----------
like stimulated so like I do I do


---------19:06----------
streaming and then like I'm gonna like


---------19:09----------
maybe make some videos or something like


---------19:10----------
that and then I work with some patients


---------19:13----------
I like talk to researchers and I'm


---------19:15----------
thinking about like doing some research


---------19:16----------
so I try to do like a few different


---------19:18----------
things and so like I'd say don't just do


---------19:20----------
one thing but like keep it on the


---------19:22----------
backburner and do something else and


---------19:23----------
then once you have like three things


---------19:25----------
that you're kind of committed to then


---------19:26----------
you rotate between the three and you'll


---------19:28----------
be amazed at how much you can accomplish


---------19:33----------
which porn


---------19:34----------
