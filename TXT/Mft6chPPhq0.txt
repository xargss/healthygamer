---------00:00----------
yo hey how's it going


---------00:03----------
good man how are you


---------00:06----------
pretty well how are you good i'm sorry


---------00:09----------
but


---------00:10----------
i'm really enjoying connecting with the


---------00:12----------
community today so i'm i'm feeling the


---------00:14----------
hype


---------00:16----------
i guess i'll hop right in uh you can


---------00:18----------
call me


---------00:19----------
and pick or hippo for this um


---------00:22----------
hippo it is so my world view


---------00:26----------
is um you know kind of around


---------00:29----------
being empathetic kind and kind of


---------00:32----------
respecting everybody's humanity


---------00:34----------
um and i've been really


---------00:39----------
struggling lately with kind of existing


---------00:42----------
in a world that seems to


---------00:44----------
reward people for being the antithesis


---------00:47----------
of that


---------00:47----------
um and then that kind of leads into a


---------00:51----------
second part


---------00:52----------
of when i see


---------00:55----------
you know rush limbaugh die or


---------00:58----------
um you know the capitol riders rioters


---------01:02----------
get


---------01:02----------
thrown in prison or um you know even an


---------01:05----------
anti-massacre get covered


---------01:10----------
my knee-jerk reaction is kind of like


---------01:11----------
haha good


---------01:13----------
um but i don't want to be that person


---------01:16----------
especially if i'm trying to you know be


---------01:18----------
apathetic and kind um i don't


---------01:21----------
necessarily want to


---------01:22----------
extend my empathy to them but i also


---------01:24----------
don't want to revel in their pain


---------01:29----------
okay so a hippo


---------01:33----------
yeah go ahead my question is really just


---------01:34----------
like how to resist


---------01:36----------
that feeling of you know kind of


---------01:40----------
those like fuzzy feelings you get when


---------01:42----------
you see somebody get like they're just


---------01:43----------
desserts


---------01:50----------
let me think about this for a second


---------01:54----------
it's a good question


---------02:00----------
tell me a little bit about the you said


---------02:03----------
something about like


---------02:04----------
existing in a world where evil people


---------02:06----------
are rewarded


---------02:09----------
yeah i would say um so


---------02:12----------
i've kind of been struggling with i


---------02:14----------
guess what i


---------02:15----------
think to be um dysmea or


---------02:19----------
persistent or dysmia and persistent


---------02:22----------
depressive disorder for


---------02:24----------
many many years um and


---------02:28----------
you know i think that's a lot to do with


---------02:30----------
it of


---------02:32----------
just you know the root the world seems


---------02:35----------
to reward


---------02:36----------
selfish people um and that's very


---------02:39----------
disappointing to me do you feel like


---------02:43----------
the world has do you feel like you're a


---------02:45----------
good person


---------02:47----------
uh i like to think i am a good person


---------02:51----------
um do you feel like the world has


---------02:54----------
screwed you because of it oh certainly


---------02:58----------
yeah how so


---------03:01----------
uh just i've you know my kindness has


---------03:05----------
been


---------03:05----------
taken advantage of plenty of times or


---------03:08----------
not


---------03:09----------
being um


---------03:13----------
i feel like i often get run over for


---------03:16----------
i guess not being outspoken about you


---------03:19----------
know my beliefs


---------03:20----------
or you know even


---------03:24----------
people bullying me would get popular


---------03:27----------
because of it or


---------03:29----------
people would be popular because of


---------03:30----------
bullying not maybe not necessarily me


---------03:32----------
specifically


---------03:35----------
uh can you give us an example of like


---------03:36----------
how you were taken advantage of because


---------03:38----------
of your kindness


---------03:42----------
uh i guess it might not even be


---------03:46----------
kindness but not confrontationalness


---------03:48----------
like i


---------03:49----------
am an amazing musician and in my band


---------03:52----------
um you know a lot of times i guess i


---------03:56----------
don't


---------03:59----------
i'll put my feelings aside about like a


---------04:02----------
decision


---------04:03----------
um just to avoid the confrontation


---------04:08----------
uh i guess a lot of times i'm


---------04:12----------
you know in my head it's like you know


---------04:13----------
what they'll i'll let them think


---------04:15----------
whatever they want to think and then


---------04:17----------
eventually they'll just come around to


---------04:18----------
my way of thinking when i'm


---------04:19----------
proven to be right so


---------04:22----------
justice will happen in the end


---------04:26----------
yeah essentially what i'm hearing is


---------04:28----------
that you've got a pretty big justice


---------04:29----------
boner


---------04:31----------
uh sure yeah i would say that's pretty


---------04:34----------
accurate


---------04:35----------
oh yeah so hippo here's here's my take


---------04:38----------
okay so the first thing is that i think


---------04:40----------
that like


---------04:40----------
you're when you look at the world


---------04:43----------
and you feel like you know you want to


---------04:46----------
revel in


---------04:46----------
in rush limbaugh's passing


---------04:50----------
i think that that comes from like your


---------04:53----------
own


---------04:53----------
personal experience of injustice


---------04:57----------
right it's like it's like the the way in


---------04:58----------
which you look at the world and how like


---------05:00----------
evil people


---------05:01----------
are rewarded and like evil people were


---------05:04----------
rewarded by taking advantage of you


---------05:07----------
and that's sort of like why you care


---------05:08----------
about it in the world


---------05:10----------
and the reason that you revel in it is


---------05:12----------
because like you what you really wanted


---------05:14----------
is those bullies to get


---------05:16----------
you know justice served to them and so


---------05:18----------
when when there are people that you


---------05:20----------
perceive as evil who get like justice


---------05:22----------
served to them it sort of like


---------05:24----------
feels really good to you because that's


---------05:26----------
sort of like what you always wanted


---------05:28----------
right does that make sense like do you


---------05:31----------
see how your personal experiences


---------05:33----------
and the things that you choose to care


---------05:35----------
about in the world could be related


---------05:39----------
yeah um it's i guess what


---------05:42----------
i struggle with is like yeah i'll have


---------05:44----------
that warm fuzzy feeling for a second but


---------05:46----------
then i'll feel really bad about


---------05:48----------
harboring that feeling


---------05:50----------
um i want to yeah yeah go ahead


---------05:54----------
oh that's please please go ahead yeah so


---------05:57----------
so i i i didn't mean to talk over you


---------05:59----------
just then


---------06:00----------
but um so i i get that and and so i


---------06:02----------
think that like you're a good person but


---------06:04----------
what


---------06:05----------
what i'm what i'm hearing is that like


---------06:07----------
so this is my


---------06:08----------
impression of people who get like caught


---------06:10----------
up with like issues


---------06:12----------
so i think a lot of people who get


---------06:14----------
caught up with issues


---------06:16----------
have a personal like driving force


---------06:19----------
that causes them to care about that


---------06:21----------
thing now that isn't necessarily good or


---------06:23----------
bad but


---------06:24----------
i think sometimes people will try to


---------06:27----------
save the world


---------06:29----------
at the neglect to like growing as a


---------06:31----------
human being


---------06:32----------
and the worst case scenario which


---------06:34----------
unfortunately i've seen


---------06:35----------
is people who are crappy human beings


---------06:38----------
who


---------06:39----------
call the who allow for themselves to be


---------06:42----------
crappy


---------06:42----------
because they support a good cause


---------06:45----------
right and like that's like that's sort


---------06:47----------
of like the end goal


---------06:49----------
of like where we don't want to go which


---------06:52----------
is that i'm going to be like a complete


---------06:53----------
toxic person but because i support


---------06:56----------
something


---------06:56----------
that is morally correct in the macro


---------06:59----------
sense it excuses my personal behavior


---------07:02----------
and i don't need to grow as a good


---------07:04----------
person because i support black lives


---------07:06----------
matter and if i


---------07:07----------
support black lives matter then i'm a


---------07:09----------
good person and i can be mean to people


---------07:11----------
on the internet and i can


---------07:12----------
be you know i can


---------07:15----------
slash people's tires who are racist and


---------07:18----------
from texas


---------07:19----------
because black lives matter and that's


---------07:21----------
what makes me a good person


---------07:23----------
so i think you've got to be a little bit


---------07:24----------
careful here because i think


---------07:26----------
your mind is doing something very


---------07:28----------
interesting which is that


---------07:30----------
you have personal experiences


---------07:33----------
which my sense is that you're projecting


---------07:35----------
those personal experiences


---------07:37----------
and putting the focus of your mind on


---------07:39----------
the outside world


---------07:41----------
and then what happens is like your mind


---------07:42----------
is looking at all these terrible things


---------07:44----------
in the world and you can't fix


---------07:46----------
those and so then you begin to feel like


---------07:48----------
oh my god the world is like a terrible


---------07:50----------
place and like i can't do anything about


---------07:51----------
it


---------07:52----------
and how like look at all these like evil


---------07:53----------
people that are triumphing


---------07:55----------
and that's like depressing because


---------07:58----------
there's so much evil in the world and


---------08:00----------
like you can't do anything about it


---------08:02----------
and so but it's kind of weird because


---------08:04----------
it's like your mind is choosing to look


---------08:06----------
at problems that you have no


---------08:08----------
control over and i think the reason that


---------08:12----------
you care about those problems is because


---------08:14----------
they relate to you personally


---------08:16----------
it's like like there were evil people


---------08:18----------
who did things to you


---------08:20----------
and the world did not serve them justice


---------08:23----------
and so you become very very sensitive to


---------08:25----------
that i don't mean sensitive in like a


---------08:28----------
you know like a weak emotional way i


---------08:30----------
mean like sensitive in the sense that


---------08:32----------
your mind is like picks up those things


---------08:35----------
in the outside world


---------08:36----------
hyper aware of it hyper aware very good


---------08:39----------
and


---------08:40----------
and then what happens is like when those


---------08:41----------
people do get justice like


---------08:43----------
the part of you that yearn for justice


---------08:45----------
from the bullies


---------08:46----------
the part of you that yearns for justice


---------08:48----------
from your bandmates when they come


---------08:50----------
around to see that way


---------08:51----------
like that part of you gets satisfied


---------08:53----------
because that's what it's hungry for


---------08:55----------
and then you feel guilty because you


---------08:57----------
recognize there's something like


---------08:58----------
fundamentally like wrong about that


---------09:00----------
revelry


---------09:01----------
but and so this is where everything i


---------09:04----------
think comes back


---------09:05----------
to home which is like you've got to work


---------09:07----------
through like your


---------09:08----------
personal issues of being wronged


---------09:12----------
and being non-confrontational and like


---------09:15----------
being on the short end of the stick


---------09:16----------
because until like and as you start to


---------09:20----------
do that i think it's going to be weird


---------09:23----------
but like as you develop like


---------09:24----------
tranquility and security in yourself the


---------09:27----------
problems of the world don't change


---------09:30----------
it's just you feel capable of like doing


---------09:32----------
something about them


---------09:34----------
but if you want to fix the world it's


---------09:36----------
like you have to be like confident in


---------09:37----------
yourself


---------09:38----------
first and then you can go out and start


---------09:41----------
to do things in the world that will like


---------09:43----------
start to make a dent of a difference


---------09:45----------
but the problem is if you feel like you


---------09:47----------
know if you don't feel confident in


---------09:48----------
yourself


---------09:49----------
you can have a minor impact on


---------09:52----------
goodness in the world either way the


---------09:54----------
difference is that the way that you


---------09:56----------
view yourself determines how satisfied


---------10:00----------
you can be with that contribution


---------10:04----------
yeah yeah i definitely make sense i've


---------10:08----------
struggled with um kind of like a deep


---------10:11----------
feeling of being a burden for a really


---------10:14----------
long time


---------10:15----------
um and i do go to therapy almost weekly


---------10:19----------
and work on it um


---------10:20----------
yeah good so i think this is where like


---------10:22----------
like i've seen this with people who have


---------10:24----------
dysthymia


---------10:25----------
usually right so like kind of like what


---------10:27----------
you mentioned whereas they have these


---------10:29----------
big like existential


---------10:30----------
concerns and i know it sounds weird but


---------10:33----------
like in my experience with these people


---------10:35----------
you don't worry about the existential


---------10:37----------
concerns because the existential


---------10:38----------
concerns are sort of like an


---------10:39----------
externalization of internal conflicts


---------10:42----------
and what you really focus on is internal


---------10:44----------
conflict and then suddenly like if you


---------10:45----------
really make progress


---------10:47----------
there and you make progress and sort of


---------10:49----------
like yourself in your sense of


---------10:50----------
confidence


---------10:52----------
even though the world hasn't changed you


---------10:54----------
start to look at it as something that


---------10:56----------
you can like


---------10:56----------
chip away at as opposed to something


---------10:58----------
that is impossible


---------11:02----------
yeah that makes a lot of sense i've


---------11:04----------
definitely


---------11:05----------
like i have a wonderful support group


---------11:08----------
of friends and i often catch myself


---------11:12----------
waiting like waiting for them to let me


---------11:16----------
down


---------11:17----------
um yeah so that's what you need to work


---------11:20----------
on hippo like root and stem


---------11:23----------
right so it's like it's like when you


---------11:24----------
catch yourself wait it's beautiful that


---------11:26----------
you're able to do that


---------11:27----------
because like that's the way that your


---------11:28----------
mind looks at the external world too


---------11:31----------
you become hyper aware of things that


---------11:34----------
will confirm


---------11:35----------
your negative view of the world and as


---------11:37----------
long as that hyper awareness is there


---------11:40----------
your mind will filter out all of the


---------11:42----------
reasons


---------11:43----------
why the world is a terrible filter in


---------11:46----------
all of the reasons why the world is a


---------11:47----------
terrible place and why you should feel


---------11:49----------
hopeless


---------11:50----------
and as long as that filter exists you're


---------11:52----------
going to view the world as hopeless


---------11:56----------
yeah that makes a little sense right so


---------11:58----------
i think you've it's good i think you've


---------12:00----------
taken a really important step in


---------12:02----------
becoming aware of that filter


---------12:04----------
and like so like you know if you've got


---------12:06----------
the filter like that's what you've got


---------12:07----------
to remove and then the world will become


---------12:08----------
a different place


---------12:12----------
so i guess like is removing the


---------12:15----------
filter just you know a matter of like


---------12:18----------
talk therapy and


---------12:19----------
individualized treatment at that point


---------12:21----------
how long have you been in therapy


---------12:23----------
uh therapy only about uh


---------12:27----------
three four months or so okay good so i


---------12:30----------
was afraid that because some people with


---------12:32----------
this time you will have been therapy for


---------12:33----------
like decades


---------12:34----------
and and so if you've only been in


---------12:36----------
therapy for three or four months i'd say


---------12:38----------
definitely stick with it i'd give it a


---------12:40----------
minimum of a year to 18 months


---------12:43----------
if you're feeling like it's not helping


---------12:44----------
please tell your therapist hey i feel


---------12:46----------
like this isn't helping


---------12:47----------
because that could be your dysthymie


---------12:49----------
itself


---------12:51----------
does that make sense nothing is getting


---------12:53----------
better


---------12:55----------
exactly so so let your therapist work


---------12:57----------
with you on that and the reason that


---------12:58----------
you've got to tell but you also don't


---------13:00----------
want to ignore those feelings


---------13:01----------
because that could be your dysthymia or


---------13:04----------
you could have a crappy therapy


---------13:05----------
relationship


---------13:06----------
right and you're not going to be able to


---------13:08----------
tell the difference does that make sense


---------13:10----------
so you got to bring it up to your


---------13:12----------
therapist


---------13:14----------
and work through it and see if that's


---------13:15----------
helping because you may need to switch


---------13:17----------
therapists


---------13:18----------
but i'd give yourself at least like a


---------13:20----------
year to 18 months


---------13:21----------
in therapy and also like continue to do


---------13:25----------
um you know meditate if you can and


---------13:28----------
become aware of as much as you can


---------13:30----------
hippo you don't have to change anything


---------13:32----------
yet first you want to do like


---------13:34----------
reconnaissance


---------13:35----------
and and like map everything out in your


---------13:37----------
mind and the more you map things out the


---------13:40----------
easier it's going to be to start


---------13:41----------
changing stuff


---------13:43----------
okay yeah i can definitely um


---------13:47----------
yeah understand that for sure yeah good


---------13:50----------
luck to you bro


---------13:52----------
thank you appreciate the where is it i


---------13:54----------
think the fact that you're coming here


---------13:56----------
and you're asking this question


---------13:58----------
as long as you do as long as you listen


---------14:01----------
to the voice that brought you here


---------14:04----------
i think your life will change


---------14:08----------
okay i i think that's probably the big


---------14:10----------
issue is


---------14:11----------
trusting that voice yep exactly well


---------14:14----------
said


---------14:15----------
and that's what i'm saying like you just


---------14:16----------
got to learn how to trust it


---------14:18----------
because that's your that's the part of


---------14:20----------
you that wants to move forward and make


---------14:21----------
a change in your life


---------14:23----------
so your biggest challenge is in not


---------14:25----------
trusting that voice


---------14:26----------
because until you start trusting it or


---------14:28----------
you don't even have to trust it


---------14:29----------
just listen to it anyway got it


---------14:33----------
well dude thanks for all that take care


---------14:35----------
hippo good luck dude


---------14:36----------
do as well
