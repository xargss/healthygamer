---------00:00----------
when someone comes in with this like


---------00:01----------
low-grade depression like they're not


---------00:03----------
suicidal or anything but they just like


---------00:04----------
don't feel like doing anything all day


---------00:06----------
and are kind of bummed out and like


---------00:08----------
aren't really happy and like not really


---------00:10----------
motivated and they're just kind of like


---------00:12----------
meh


---------00:14----------
like a large percentage of those people


---------00:16----------
i'd say in my practice like 10 of those


---------00:18----------
people are like hypothyroid i'm getting


---------00:20----------
confused okay so here's what we're gonna


---------00:21----------
do i'm gonna give you guys a list a


---------00:23----------
constellation of symptoms


---------00:25----------
and then you guys let me know like


---------00:27----------
whether this applies to you okay


---------00:30----------
problems with motivation


---------00:33----------
problems with memory


---------00:36----------
problems with


---------00:37----------
executive function


---------00:39----------
so this is the ability to plan and


---------00:41----------
implement long-term tasks as well as


---------00:44----------
delay gratification


---------00:47----------
problems with attention


---------00:49----------
problems with verbal fluency


---------00:54----------
difficulty learning


---------00:57----------
dick uh problems with psychomotor


---------00:59----------
efficiency


---------01:02----------
so this kind of means like you could say


---------01:03----------
feeling sluggish okay


---------01:05----------
so this is part of what we're gonna do


---------01:07----------
so


---------01:08----------
next up we have fatigue


---------01:11----------
um weight gain


---------01:16----------
cold intolerance


---------01:21----------
constipation


---------01:25----------
dry skin


---------01:27----------
muscle aches


---------01:31----------
and menstrual irregularities


---------01:38----------
okay and then over here we've also got


---------01:41----------
anxiety


---------01:45----------
diarrhea


---------01:48----------
weak muscles


---------01:53----------
over here we have fatigue


---------01:55----------
and then over here we have low energy


---------02:00----------
insomnia


---------02:03----------
low mood


---------02:06----------
low motivation


---------02:10----------
low enjoyment


---------02:15----------
and then lastly we've got


---------02:18----------
let's say fatigue


---------02:21----------
quick to anger


---------02:28----------
feeling


---------02:29----------
sleepy during the day


---------02:35----------
poor quality sleep


---------02:40----------
as well as problems with


---------02:42----------
motivation


---------02:45----------
executive function


---------02:50----------
things like that okay so first question


---------02:52----------
chat


---------02:54----------
is do these things apply to y'all


---------02:58----------
okay


---------03:00----------
so like these this is a collection of


---------03:03----------
different medical conditions


---------03:06----------
and what we're gonna do is some


---------03:07----------
statistical so the first thing is like


---------03:09----------
when i said i wasn't gonna hold back


---------03:11----------
this is me not holding back so if you


---------03:12----------
guys are like hey this is a really long


---------03:14----------
list of like lots of complicated things


---------03:16----------
welcome to medical school chat this is


---------03:18----------
how you become a doctor you memorize


---------03:20----------
lists and lists and lists of clinical


---------03:22----------
presentations


---------03:23----------
and then there's also like lab testing


---------03:26----------
and figuring out what treatments are and


---------03:27----------
stuff like that but these are the things


---------03:29----------
that


---------03:30----------
these are the constellations of symptoms


---------03:32----------
okay


---------03:33----------
so the first thing is like who wants to


---------03:35----------
guess like what is category one


---------03:40----------
anyone know


---------03:43----------
what's your guess for category one okay


---------03:46----------
good so if someone's guessing adhd


---------03:49----------
depression what else we got


---------03:55----------
lack of sleep insomnia


---------03:58----------
anorexia


---------04:08----------
what a vitamin deficiency which vitamin


---------04:11----------
chat we're in med school now this is


---------04:13----------
twitch school of medicine welcome


---------04:14----------
everyone dyslexia


---------04:19----------
lupus


---------04:21----------
vitamin d deficiency vitamin b12


---------04:24----------
deficiency


---------04:27----------
right okay so cool cool chat these are


---------04:29----------
this is so good like look at all of


---------04:31----------
these things that could be


---------04:33----------
here thiamin deficiency good someone's


---------04:35----------
oh someone's like actually in medical


---------04:37----------
school


---------04:38----------
vitamin c deficiency


---------04:41----------
autism


---------04:43----------
okay guess what chat


---------04:44----------
all of these are wrong this is


---------04:47----------
type


---------04:48----------
2


---------04:49----------
diabetes


---------04:52----------
so what percentage of y'all are


---------04:54----------
overweight


---------04:56----------
this is the consequence of insulin


---------04:58----------
resistance


---------05:01----------
and high blood sugar


---------05:08----------
this is exact so this is exactly what


---------05:10----------
i'm saying so all gamers should get


---------05:12----------
their blood sugar checked


---------05:15----------
okay so next question chat


---------05:17----------
what percentage of people


---------05:20----------
have type 2 diabetes


---------05:25----------
do you guys know


---------05:32----------
ah see now now


---------05:34----------
answers are all over the place so this


---------05:36----------
is ten percent


---------05:38----------
which means that nine out of ten people


---------05:40----------
are going to be healthy and this is


---------05:41----------
going to be important this is going to


---------05:42----------
come up next okay so just because you're


---------05:45----------
overweight you may have some degree of


---------05:47----------
of insulin resistance


---------05:49----------
you may have some degree of like high


---------05:51----------
blood sugar


---------05:52----------
you may have some of these symptoms


---------05:55----------
but what we're really talking about is


---------05:57----------
10 percent of people


---------05:59----------
have type 2 diabetes okay


---------06:03----------
next up


---------06:05----------
let's try again


---------06:06----------
so fatigue weight gain cold intolerance


---------06:08----------
constipation dry skin muscle aches and


---------06:11----------
menstrual irregularities what do you all


---------06:13----------
think this is


---------06:17----------
i think it's


---------06:18----------
globally


---------06:20----------
okay someone's talking about anemia


---------06:26----------
hypothyroidism


---------06:30----------
pots oh my god


---------06:32----------
anxiety chat


---------06:37----------
depression ibs crohn's


---------06:40----------
okay so like look chat listen to me


---------06:43----------
listen to me


---------06:44----------
so a lot of these are really good


---------06:46----------
answers


---------06:47----------
pregnant


---------06:49----------
it's good


---------06:51----------
that's good i'm glad someone mentioned


---------06:52----------
pregnancy


---------06:53----------
so pregnancy so one of the key things i


---------06:56----------
learned in medical school is pregnancy


---------06:58----------
is the one diagnosis you should you can


---------07:00----------
never afford to forget about it's


---------07:03----------
something that you always have to


---------07:04----------
assuming you've got a female patient


---------07:06----------
right but like it's the one thing you


---------07:08----------
all like you can never forget about


---------07:10----------
pregnancy you always have to think to


---------07:12----------
yourself is this person pregnant because


---------07:14----------
it changes everything it changes like


---------07:16----------
you know because like medicines can be


---------07:17----------
tratagenic it can be weird borreliosis


---------07:21----------
no it's not poreless


---------07:23----------
but i like it


---------07:25----------
um food intolerance no


---------07:27----------
so the other thing chat is like do you


---------07:28----------
guys get that these are these are all


---------07:30----------
like good things that you should maybe


---------07:32----------
get evaluated for right


---------07:34----------
puberty no that's not a good one oh my


---------07:36----------
god these are great this is so much


---------07:38----------
better gout


---------07:40----------
no


---------07:41----------
so it's right so you guys figured this


---------07:42----------
one out this is hypothyroidism okay so


---------07:45----------
now this is pretty interesting so what


---------07:47----------
do y'all think


---------07:49----------
the right answer is hypothyroid


---------07:51----------
so now the question is what uh


---------07:54----------
what it was like the second answer to


---------07:56----------
um what what percentage of the


---------07:59----------
population do you think is hypothyroid


---------08:06----------
what do y'all think


---------08:11----------
okay so good i think you guys are like


---------08:13----------
doing better about this so there's


---------08:15----------
conflicting data so this is where this


---------08:16----------
is an important point that i have to


---------08:18----------
share so in my experience there's like


---------08:20----------
true hypothyroidism and then there's


---------08:22----------
subclinical hypothyroidism


---------08:24----------
so the statistics around true


---------08:25----------
hypothyroidism some of them are like one


---------08:28----------
out of 300 right so really small but


---------08:30----------
others other studies will suggest that


---------08:32----------
hypothyroidism is closer to 3.7


---------08:35----------
and this could be kind of in the


---------08:36----------
subclinical range


---------08:38----------
so


---------08:39----------
the reason that i test tsh for all of my


---------08:42----------
patients who have like fatigue and like


---------08:44----------
basically depressive symptoms and like


---------08:46----------
things like weight gain and menstrual


---------08:48----------
irregularities is they may not have


---------08:50----------
full-blown hypothyroidism


---------08:52----------
but around let's say four percent so


---------08:55----------
let's say 96 out of 100 people


---------08:58----------
are gonna be totally fine and 3.7 or


---------09:01----------
four percent of people will have may


---------09:03----------
benefit some clinically from some kind


---------09:05----------
of thyroid supplementation


---------09:08----------
okay


---------09:09----------
so uh can i explain what the thyroid is


---------09:12----------
yeah so the thyroid gland is like


---------09:14----------
situated here in your neck and releases


---------09:16----------
something called thyroid hormone and


---------09:18----------
thyroid hormone does all kinds of things


---------09:21----------
in your body so the thing to remember


---------09:24----------
about hormones is a hormone is a


---------09:26----------
chemical signal


---------09:27----------
that travels everywhere through your


---------09:29----------
body so the key thing about hormones is


---------09:32----------
that they affect all of your organ


---------09:33----------
systems because they go everywhere and


---------09:36----------
they try to they try to help your body


---------09:38----------
work in concert so another good example


---------09:40----------
is adrenaline adrenaline is a hormone so


---------09:43----------
what is adrenaline on the effect what


---------09:46----------
effect does adrenaline have on the gi


---------09:47----------
system and so this is where i'd ask you


---------09:49----------
what does the body want to do what does


---------09:51----------
the gi system want to do


---------09:53----------
when


---------09:54----------
you're in a situation where adrenaline


---------09:56----------
is released


---------09:57----------
the answer is that your body your gi


---------10:00----------
system wants to absolutely shut off


---------10:01----------
which is exactly what adrenaline does


---------10:03----------
because if you like you don't want to be


---------10:04----------
digesting food if you're like fighting


---------10:06----------
against a lion right like you don't want


---------10:07----------
to worry about like forming stool and


---------10:10----------
digesting things you want to worry about


---------10:11----------
survival so if we look at adrenaline it


---------10:13----------
does things like increase your heart


---------10:15----------
rate it does things like increase your


---------10:17----------
blood pressure in uh does things like


---------10:19----------
makes your brain think in black and


---------10:21----------
white and makes it think faster and more


---------10:23----------
catastrophically


---------10:25----------
it also does things like uh shut off


---------10:28----------
your gi system essentially


---------10:30----------
you know like all of like the slow stuff


---------10:33----------
like the rest and digest functions of


---------10:34----------
your brain like it doesn't want to mess


---------10:37----------
with any of that stuff it does things


---------10:38----------
like vaso uh vasodilate you know the the


---------10:41----------
blood vessels that go to your lungs


---------10:43----------
increases your respiratory rate so


---------10:45----------
hormones are chemical compounds that


---------10:47----------
travel throughout your body and


---------10:49----------
essentially they coordinate all of the


---------10:51----------
body's response they coordinate all of


---------10:54----------
the different organ systems to sort of


---------10:56----------
succeed at doing one thing


---------10:58----------
so thyroid hormone is kind of tricky


---------11:00----------
because it does like a lot of different


---------11:01----------
stuff but essentially like i kind of


---------11:04----------
think about the balance of thyroid


---------11:06----------
hormone is like internally like your yin


---------11:08----------
and your yang so for example people in


---------11:10----------
northern climates


---------11:13----------
have higher levels of thyroid hormone


---------11:16----------
because thyroid hormone is one of the


---------11:18----------
things that increases brown fat


---------11:20----------
production


---------11:21----------
brown fat is the is how you generate


---------11:24----------
heat within your body so if you look at


---------11:26----------
people who are like you know in northern


---------11:28----------
climates they tend to have slightly


---------11:29----------
higher levels of thyroid hormone they


---------11:31----------
tend to have more brown fat they tend to


---------11:32----------
burn more fat to maintain body


---------11:34----------
temperature which is also why it's kind


---------11:36----------
of super interesting because if you look


---------11:38----------
at obesity as it relates to different


---------11:40----------
climates


---------11:41----------
the more equatorial climates are more


---------11:44----------
prone to obesity and weight gain and as


---------11:46----------
you move north into colder climates you


---------11:49----------
tend to have people who overall tend to


---------11:51----------
be a little bit thinner


---------11:53----------
and so if you look at hypothyroidism it


---------11:55----------
causes weight gain causes cold


---------11:57----------
intolerance whereas if you look at this


---------11:59----------
one is hyperthyroidism


---------12:01----------
but this is considerably rare


---------12:04----------
and so you know hypothyroidism causes


---------12:06----------
constipation hyperthyroidism causes


---------12:08----------
diarrhea hyperthyroidism causes anxiety


---------12:13----------
and then like you know hypothyroidism


---------12:15----------
basically causes like depression


---------12:17----------
symptoms of depression and if you think


---------12:19----------
about depression and anxiety one is like


---------12:21----------
a slow mind one is an overactive mind


---------12:24----------
so thyroid hormone is really interesting


---------12:26----------
because it affects all the different


---------12:28----------
like organs in like really different


---------12:30----------
ways


---------12:32----------
yeah so we'll get to the actual blood


---------12:33----------
tests in a second okay


---------12:36----------
so next up i know it's kind of weird but


---------12:38----------
we've just got fatigue


---------12:40----------
what do you all think this is


---------12:43----------
are there medications for these yes


---------12:44----------
we're going to get let's finish let's


---------12:46----------
finish diagnosing all these then we'll


---------12:47----------
go on we'll talk about


---------12:50----------
tired ibs


---------12:55----------
yeah so you so chronic fatigue syndrome


---------12:57----------
that's a new one so we talked about b12


---------13:00----------
anemia


---------13:04----------
okay


---------13:05----------
uh vitamin d


---------13:07----------
sure


---------13:08----------
hiv sure that's on there


---------13:11----------
it's actually a good guess


---------13:13----------
insomnia


---------13:16----------
myocarditis yes


---------13:19----------
it can absolutely present his fatigue


---------13:22----------
burnout sure


---------13:25----------
there's a lot of stuff so this this one


---------13:26----------
too so this is b12 deficiency


---------13:29----------
so i like this is the other thing about


---------13:31----------
medicine so this is it isn't like


---------13:33----------
i mean i'm sort of trying to simplify


---------13:34----------
things but also give you guys some some


---------13:36----------
stuff a little bit complicated


---------13:39----------
so the key thing about b12 deficiency is


---------13:41----------
that it tends to not present


---------13:44----------
as like a bunch of different random


---------13:45----------
stuff like you're not going to see


---------13:47----------
weight gain with b12 deficiency you're


---------13:48----------
not gonna see like uh you know dry skin


---------13:51----------
or muscle atrophy or things like that


---------13:53----------
you may not see quite as much um you


---------13:55----------
know like


---------13:56----------
like the the specificity of these


---------13:59----------
deficits probably have to do with


---------14:01----------
the high level of sugar in your like uh


---------14:04----------
your vascular system and things like


---------14:05----------
that so you get like brain wide effects


---------14:09----------
in uh type 2 diabetes which you may get


---------14:12----------
fatigue and b12 deficiency but you're


---------14:13----------
not going to get quite like you're not


---------14:14----------
going to get like a verbal learning


---------14:16----------
like negative impact in b12 deficiency


---------14:20----------
so b12 deficiency let me just see what


---------14:22----------
how common it is did i forget to look


---------14:24----------
that oh yeah i didn't even look this up


---------14:26----------
so i don't even know it's rare though so


---------14:28----------
the the thing is b12 deficiency can


---------14:30----------
sometimes happen in people who are like


---------14:32----------
vegans


---------14:33----------
but generally speaking b12 deficiency is


---------14:35----------
quite rare


---------14:37----------
i don't remember the exact statistics


---------14:38----------
but it's something else to consider


---------14:40----------
super easy lab test


---------14:42----------
okay next up we have um low energy


---------14:45----------
insomnia low mood low motivation


---------14:49----------
it's one out of ten thousand


---------14:51----------
that makes sense


---------14:54----------
because a lot of b12 comes from animal


---------14:56----------
products


---------14:59----------
um


---------15:01----------
yeah so let's say well let's just say


---------15:03----------
one out of a hundred so 99 out of 100


---------15:05----------
people will be correct oh we'll be fine


---------15:07----------
okay


---------15:10----------
so low energy insomnia low mood low


---------15:12----------
motivation low enjoyment


---------15:15----------
what do y'all think


---------15:17----------
depression okay


---------15:21----------
insomnia okay


---------15:26----------
parkinson's


---------15:29----------
sometimes actually it's not alzheimer's


---------15:31----------
sure so dementia


---------15:34----------
low iron


---------15:36----------
anemia


---------15:40----------
genetic disorders nice chat


---------15:43----------
dude some real pog poggers out there


---------15:46----------
trauma fibromyalgia


---------15:48----------
yeah so this is the cool thing chat no


---------15:50----------
no


---------15:52----------
this


---------15:52----------
is vitamin d deficiency


---------15:56----------
now vitamin d deficiency numbers are


---------15:58----------
really interesting okay


---------15:59----------
because five percent of the population


---------16:02----------
is vitamin d deficient but 18 percent of


---------16:05----------
the population has sub clinical or less


---------16:08----------
than normal


---------16:10----------
so there's like with vitamin d


---------16:12----------
deficiency there's like ranges right so


---------16:13----------
it's kind of like a bell curve and so


---------16:15----------
like you know this is actually like 18


---------16:17----------
percent of the population and this is


---------16:20----------
like five percent of the population


---------16:23----------
and so there's kind of like a sub


---------16:24----------
clinical level and then there's like a


---------16:26----------
clinically deficient level and so the


---------16:28----------
people who are like super clinically


---------16:30----------
deficient which is still five percent of


---------16:31----------
the population will have severe amounts


---------16:33----------
of this and about 20 of the population


---------16:36----------
by the way


---------16:38----------
i think maybe that the 18


---------16:40----------
number has something to do with using


---------16:42----------
the internet's


---------16:44----------
and playing video games and not going


---------16:47----------
outside


---------16:48----------
you think maybe it has something to do


---------16:50----------
with what you're watching the twitch


---------16:51----------
what do you think


---------16:53----------
right


---------16:54----------
so what this means is let's say that


---------16:56----------
80 out of 100 people don't have to worry


---------16:58----------
about this okay


---------17:01----------
so this is so what i really like about


---------17:02----------
this is that you guys are picking up on


---------17:04----------
a lot of different stuff right like and


---------17:07----------
like you all could have any one of these


---------17:09----------
things


---------17:10----------
right like chat you could be pregnant


---------17:12----------
like you may have gout


---------17:14----------
it's not something i was expecting right


---------17:16----------
so anemia is another big one i actually


---------17:17----------
didn't even include indeed on this i


---------17:19----------
kind of it was on my other list but i


---------17:21----------
thought that that would be covering too


---------17:22----------
many things


---------17:24----------
right so you could have all these things


---------17:26----------
i mean or any of these things that


---------17:27----------
people are tossing out i didn't even


---------17:29----------
talk about so the other thing there's a


---------17:30----------
spoiler alert by the way i don't know if


---------17:32----------
you guys got this but none of these are


---------17:33----------
mental illnesses like you guys get this


---------17:36----------
like these are not psychiatric diagnoses


---------17:37----------
that's the whole point of this lecture


---------17:39----------
is that all of these mental effects that


---------17:41----------
we attribute to adhd anxiety depression


---------17:44----------
i have trouble sleeping the truth is


---------17:46----------
that a lot of this stuff can be caused


---------17:47----------
by physiologic things and this is why


---------17:49----------
you should go get a lab test this is why


---------17:51----------
you should go see your doctor that's the


---------17:53----------
whole point of this lecture


---------17:55----------
okay next up


---------18:00----------
oh yeah okay


---------18:02----------
so


---------18:02----------
what do y'all think about this one


---------18:06----------
hmm


---------18:08----------
what is that what do you guys think


---------18:09----------
fatigue quick to anger feeling sleepy


---------18:11----------
during the


---------18:13----------
poor quality sleep mode problems with


---------18:15----------
motivation and problems with executive


---------18:17----------
dysfunction malnutrition


---------18:23----------
apnea


---------18:25----------
bipolar


---------18:28----------
okay chlamydia is i'm not even gonna put


---------18:30----------
that gaming addiction


---------18:34----------
adhd


---------18:37----------
alcoholism


---------18:42----------
we already have apnea here so we can say


---------18:44----------
insomnia sure


---------18:48----------
protein deficiency


---------18:52----------
marijuana use


---------18:56----------
yeah so like this is the thing right so


---------18:58----------
i want you guys to really pay attention


---------19:01----------
to all of the things that you guys are


---------19:03----------
talking about that are mental so this


---------19:04----------
one is sleep apnea


---------19:06----------
someone got it


---------19:07----------
good job okay so i even i don't think i


---------19:10----------
even remembered


---------19:12----------
did i even i don't have the prevalence


---------19:13----------
of sleep apnea what's the prevalence of


---------19:15----------
sleep apnea epidemiology here we go


---------19:20----------
okay so this is interesting so 15 to 30


---------19:23----------
percent this is staggering in north


---------19:25----------
america in men


---------19:27----------
and about 10 to 15 percent in women


---------19:34----------
so this means that 80 let's just call it


---------19:36----------
80 out of 100 people will be totally


---------19:38----------
fine we didn't even get to anemia


---------19:41----------
so anemia also causes


---------19:43----------
fatigue


---------19:44----------
primarily weakness


---------19:47----------
you know you'll see like pale skin


---------19:52----------
can sometimes cause like gi problems


---------19:57----------
right and anemia is pretty common too so


---------19:59----------
let's see what the


---------20:01----------
prevalence of anemia is


---------20:08----------
uh okay what's the prevalence of anemia


---------20:10----------
can someone find out for me


---------20:13----------
let me look real quick


---------20:20----------
oh anemia affects 1.62 billion people


---------20:24----------
24.8 percent of the population that's


---------20:26----------
staggering


---------20:29----------
so we're saying that about 75 out of 100


---------20:31----------
people are fine with this okay


---------20:34----------
so


---------20:36----------
uh that's globally though i suspect i


---------20:38----------
suspect that in developed countries the


---------20:40----------
prevalence is somewhat lower


---------20:42----------
anemia also is more likely to affect


---------20:44----------
women primarily due to menstruation


---------20:47----------
okay so let's say this is globally let's


---------20:49----------
see let's see if we can find out in um


---------20:54----------
let's


---------21:01----------
in the see


---------21:07----------
um so


---------21:08----------
the overall prevalence of anemia in the


---------21:09----------
u.s is about 5.6


---------21:13----------
but i don't know if you guys know this


---------21:14----------
but not everyone


---------21:16----------
in chat is from the united states


---------21:20----------
staggering


---------21:21----------
or a developed country


---------21:23----------
okay


---------21:25----------
so


---------21:26----------
here's the big takeaway


---------21:28----------
i want you guys to pay attention to like


---------21:30----------
everyone who thought like oh this is


---------21:32----------
adhd this is anxiety


---------21:35----------
this is insomnia oh dr k how do i find


---------21:38----------
motivation how do i find this how do i


---------21:40----------
find that


---------21:42----------
you know like these are like everyone's


---------21:43----------
like oh i'm depressed i'm anxious the


---------21:46----------
truth is that there's a physiologic


---------21:48----------
likelihood of all of these things


---------21:50----------
actually happening okay


---------21:52----------
so


---------21:53----------
now what we're gonna do if somebody


---------21:55----------
wants to help me do some math


---------21:57----------
is we're going to look at so how like


---------21:59----------
what's the the


---------22:00----------
rough statistical analysis that we want


---------22:03----------
to do to see how likely is any one of


---------22:06----------
y'all


---------22:07----------
to have none of these problems


---------22:10----------
does that make sense because now like


---------22:12----------
okay sure we can say you have a 5 chance


---------22:14----------
of this 18 chance of this


---------22:17----------
and how do we kind of do this


---------22:19----------
calculation right so what we have to do


---------22:21----------
is we have to multiply


---------22:23----------
9 10 for our first condition


---------22:26----------
by


---------22:27----------
96 times


---------22:29----------
96 over 100


---------22:32----------
for our next condition


---------22:33----------
times


---------22:36----------
99 over 100


---------22:39----------
times


---------22:40----------
let's use the subclinical number because


---------22:42----------
that's what i think is actually really


---------22:43----------
important this population 80 over 100


---------22:47----------
times


---------22:49----------
was that 80 over 100 again yeah


---------22:53----------
80 over 100


---------22:55----------
times and then you guys can decide


---------22:56----------
whether we want to do 95 over 100


---------23:00----------
so who can do this for me


---------23:02----------
right so


---------23:03----------
9 times 9.6 times 9.9


---------23:08----------
times


---------23:09----------
8 or 0.8


---------23:11----------
sorry hold on 0.9 0.9 0.9


---------23:14----------
what is this it's 52


---------23:18----------
okay so i want you guys to think about


---------23:20----------
this


---------23:20----------
52


---------23:23----------
of people have none of this


---------23:25----------
which means that any given person out


---------23:27----------
there has a 48 chance


---------23:31----------
of having one of these problems do you


---------23:33----------
guys get that


---------23:35----------
so it doesn't matter right now there are


---------23:36----------
4


---------23:37----------
335 people watching the stream


---------23:40----------
we may upload it to youtube at that


---------23:42----------
point so if you're watching on youtube i


---------23:44----------
want you to look at the total number of


---------23:45----------
views that the video has


---------23:48----------
cut that number in half and that is the


---------23:50----------
number of people who watch this video


---------23:52----------
who has one of these conditions


---------23:55----------
according to a rough statistical


---------23:56----------
analysis do you guys get that like this


---------23:59----------
is huge


---------24:01----------
this is


---------24:02----------
gigantic


---------24:04----------
and so if y'all have these problems if


---------24:07----------
you have difficulty with motivation if


---------24:10----------
you have difficulty with anhedonia the


---------24:12----------
inability to experience pleasure if you


---------24:14----------
feel tired during the day


---------24:16----------
if you feel weak if you feel like you


---------24:18----------
have difficulty with your memory if you


---------24:20----------
have difficulty planning and executing


---------24:22----------
actions


---------24:23----------
following through is what executive


---------24:25----------
function basically means


---------24:27----------
if you're constipated if you have


---------24:29----------
insomnia


---------24:30----------
if you're quick to anger if you feel


---------24:32----------
weak during the day


---------24:34----------
if you're a noob when you play dota you


---------24:36----------
may have one of these conditions right


---------24:38----------
so we're talking about


---------24:40----------
type 2 diabetes which can absolutely


---------24:42----------
impair your your negative function type


---------24:44----------
2 diabetes is really fascinating so when


---------24:46----------
you have a high level of insulin


---------24:48----------
resistance


---------24:50----------
as you have a high level of insulin


---------24:52----------
resistance insulin is the hormone that


---------24:55----------
causes your your cells to take up blood


---------24:57----------
sugar right so you remove blood sugar


---------25:00----------
from the bloodstream it goes into the


---------25:02----------
cell gets either used by the stellar


---------25:04----------
cell or stored as fat


---------25:06----------
so when you're resistant to insulin it


---------25:08----------
increases the amount of blood sugar


---------25:09----------
traveling through your body


---------25:12----------
the unfortunate thing is that high


---------25:13----------
levels of blood sugar traveling in your


---------25:15----------
bloodstream is very very bad for you it


---------25:18----------
causes all kinds of vascular damage


---------25:21----------
because your blood your blood vessels


---------25:23----------
are not designed to have high levels of


---------25:26----------
sugar like floating through them for a


---------25:27----------
long time


---------25:28----------
so there are studies on type 2 diabetes


---------25:30----------
which show that after 18 years of being


---------25:32----------
a type 2 diabetic you'll have all kinds


---------25:34----------
of these like pro-dementia like you'll


---------25:36----------
lose limbs and things like that like i'm


---------25:37----------
not kidding it's not an exaggeration


---------25:40----------
but then people started to wonder okay


---------25:41----------
what about is it is it a long-term


---------25:43----------
effect or or let's look at a shorter


---------25:45----------
time span so another study looked at


---------25:47----------
four years so if i'm if i'm type 2


---------25:50----------
diabetic for four years what kind of


---------25:51----------
cognitive impact do i get turns out it's


---------25:54----------
actually quite bad


---------25:55----------
now you won't get dementia but there


---------25:56----------
will be a lot of like temporary


---------25:58----------
cognitive effects


---------25:59----------
that will happen while like your blood


---------26:02----------
sugar is high and then people even did


---------26:04----------
studies that were cross-sectional and


---------26:06----------
for those of you don't know what that


---------26:07----------
means it just looks at a single point in


---------26:09----------
time


---------26:10----------
so we take a thousand people and we


---------26:12----------
measure their blood sugar and then we


---------26:13----------
measure their cognitive capabilities and


---------26:15----------
they still found impairment no long-term


---------26:18----------
effects just one like a cross-section of


---------26:21----------
young people actually maybe some


---------26:23----------
long-term damage in there because we


---------26:24----------
don't know how long those people had


---------26:26----------
high blood sugar levels but i think the


---------26:27----------
population was like you know young


---------26:28----------
adults


---------26:30----------
so it's not even long-term effects but


---------26:31----------
even temporary effects of blood sugar


---------26:33----------
are quite bad


---------26:35----------
okay so type 2 diabetes is like super


---------26:38----------
prevalent 10 of the population


---------26:40----------
then we move on to uh you know other


---------26:43----------
things like hypothyroidism i think is a


---------26:44----------
really good example of like a super


---------26:47----------
silent problem that gets missed a lot


---------26:49----------
especially like the subclinical


---------26:51----------
hypothyroidism where they're not


---------26:54----------
blatantly hypothyroid they're not like


---------26:56----------
you know their hair isn't falling out


---------26:57----------
and things like that that's what happens


---------26:58----------
when your thyroid levels super low


---------27:00----------
but as it gets like you know as you get


---------27:02----------
to subclinical levels like not like a


---------27:05----------
you know a complete deficiency but like


---------27:07----------
low levels that's when we see this like


---------27:09----------
low-grade depression stuff is the best


---------27:11----------
way i can describe it as a psychiatrist


---------27:13----------
when someone comes in with this like


---------27:15----------
low-grade depression like they're not


---------27:16----------
suicidal or anything but they just like


---------27:18----------
don't feel like doing anything all day


---------27:20----------
and are kind of bummed out and like


---------27:22----------
aren't really happy and like not really


---------27:24----------
motivated and they're just kind of like


---------27:25----------
meh


---------27:28----------
like a large percentage of those people


---------27:30----------
i'd say in my practice like 10 of those


---------27:32----------
people are like hypothyroid and i just


---------27:34----------
start them on thyroid medication and


---------27:36----------
they're like


---------27:36----------
normal they feel amazing they're like oh


---------27:38----------
my god


---------27:40----------
i never realized that people like woke


---------27:42----------
up every day and had energy


---------27:44----------
this is completely op


---------27:47----------
okay


---------27:48----------
next up hyperthyroidism so that's quite


---------27:50----------
rare but that can be one of the causes


---------27:51----------
of anxiety so b12 deficiency is


---------27:54----------
something that is also quite rare so


---------27:55----------
like maybe one out of 100 people or even


---------27:57----------
less than that i would imagine but we


---------27:59----------
are seeing increases in b12 deficiency


---------28:01----------
especially due to


---------28:03----------
um you know changes in diet so like a


---------28:05----------
lot of our b12 comes from animal


---------28:07----------
products there are some autoimmune


---------28:09----------
conditions which can also cause b12


---------28:11----------
deficiency which i want to say i've seen


---------28:13----------
more recently i don't know if it's


---------28:14----------
actually like on the rise


---------28:16----------
it's still something that's super easy


---------28:17----------
to get checked so just get it checked


---------28:20----------
and by the way what you guys want to


---------28:21----------
check in thyroid level is tsh


---------28:25----------
um


---------28:25----------
and then we get to


---------28:27----------
apnea so this is another really common


---------28:29----------
thing


---------28:31----------
uh that oh sorry let's go to vitamin d


---------28:33----------
levels like so the next thing to check


---------28:35----------
is vitamin d so vitamin d levels are


---------28:37----------
also associated with poor outcomes


---------28:39----------
related to covid messes up your immune


---------28:41----------
system has a lot to do with calcium


---------28:43----------
metabolism and like building bones and


---------28:45----------
absorbing calcium from the gut and like


---------28:47----------
all kinds of like random stuff vitamin d


---------28:49----------
is made by sunlight so when we get


---------28:52----------
exposed to sunlight our body takes that


---------28:54----------
sunlight and constructs vitamin d out of


---------28:56----------
it


---------28:56----------
people who have darker skin color tend


---------28:59----------
to have a less efficient vitamin d


---------29:02----------
production


---------29:03----------
so if you're like living in scandinavia


---------29:05----------
and you're like pale as snow


---------29:08----------
then you don't actually need that much


---------29:09----------
sun exposure to make a lot of vitamin d


---------29:12----------
if you're from india or you know south


---------29:14----------
america or something like that at least


---------29:16----------
the you know


---------29:17----------
equatorial parts of the world or you're


---------29:19----------
from africa


---------29:21----------
you may need a higher amount of vitamin


---------29:22----------
d uh sun exposure to create vitamin d


---------29:27----------
and that's just because in those


---------29:28----------
climates there's a lot of sun so like


---------29:29----------
our machinery doesn't need to be as


---------29:31----------
efficient


---------29:33----------
next up we've got sleep apnea this is


---------29:35----------
the silent silent


---------29:37----------
real problem okay so there isn't a lab


---------29:40----------
and there's not like a blood test for


---------29:41----------
sleep apnea what you have to do is a


---------29:42----------
sleep study


---------29:44----------
but the good news is that most sleep


---------29:45----------
apnea is like you know you can kind of


---------29:47----------
get through a good to a good diagnostic


---------29:49----------
threshold through an interview


---------29:51----------
so like if you snore if you have like a


---------29:53----------
thick neck i know it sounds kind of


---------29:54----------
weird but people who are overweight


---------29:56----------
people who snore a lot people who have a


---------29:58----------
thick neck


---------29:59----------
um they can actually have sleep apnea


---------30:01----------
and in men it's like 15 to 30 percent of


---------30:04----------
men have this that like it's nuts and


---------30:06----------
sleep apnea is basically like


---------30:08----------
you know imagine playing a video game


---------30:10----------
where you never get to like


---------30:12----------
rest right play dark souls without ever


---------30:15----------
using


---------30:17----------
a bonfire


---------30:18----------
and if you play dark souls without ever


---------30:20----------
using a bonfire


---------30:22----------
that is what living life with sleep nap


---------30:24----------
apnea is like


---------30:26----------
you never get to like you never get back


---------30:28----------
to 100


---------30:31----------
and so sleep apnea is one of the most


---------30:33----------
the problem is that people can function


---------30:35----------
like people are awesome right like


---------30:37----------
you're a chad at dark souls and you're


---------30:39----------
so awesome and you're so skilled but boy


---------30:42----------
is the game like super hard like life is


---------30:45----------
just hard when you have sleep apnea you


---------30:47----------
can hold a job you can kind of study but


---------30:49----------
like it just doesn't like your brain is


---------30:51----------
like a colander and knowledge just leaks


---------30:53----------
out of it right it just doesn't store


---------30:55----------
things


---------30:56----------
you feel tired all the time you get


---------30:57----------
sleepy you're like kind of yawning all


---------30:59----------
day and like pounding like coffee and


---------31:01----------
stuff like that and then you fall asleep


---------31:03----------
at night and then like you wake up and


---------31:05----------
you don't feel rested so you can


---------31:07----------
discover a lot of this stuff in a


---------31:08----------
clinical interview that's why you guys


---------31:09----------
should go see a doctor you can do a


---------31:10----------
sleep study then if you get on a cpap


---------31:12----------
which is a continuous positive airway


---------31:15----------
pressure machine it'll prevent you from


---------31:17----------
being apnic and you'll wake up and


---------31:19----------
you'll feel rested in the morning which


---------31:20----------
is also like super op the ability to


---------31:23----------
feel rested if you all don't feel rested


---------31:25----------
in the morning you're living life on


---------31:27----------
hard mode


---------31:29----------
anemia is the next one so anemia is a


---------31:32----------
good example like you know so sometimes


---------31:34----------
we'll


---------31:35----------
women are sometimes more prone to it


---------31:36----------
because they menstruate


---------31:38----------
um you know but anyone can be anemic


---------31:40----------
generally speaking in developed


---------31:42----------
countries it tends to be like lower


---------31:44----------
because we have high consumption of like


---------31:45----------
meat intake and other sources of like


---------31:47----------
healthy iron so anemia is an iron


---------31:49----------
deficiency or a lack of red blood cells


---------31:54----------
in your body so blood cells are like


---------31:55----------
literally carry oxygen to all of your


---------31:58----------
different parts of your body so it's


---------31:59----------
basically like your fuel delivery system


---------32:02----------
and so what that means when you're


---------32:04----------
anemic is that like your body is not


---------32:05----------
getting enough fuel to function properly


---------32:07----------
so people feel super tired


---------32:09----------
they feel like weak and things like that


---------32:12----------
so everyone you know nowadays is like oh


---------32:13----------
i feel owned right like i'm just like


---------32:16----------
i'm just owned today like i don't feel


---------32:17----------
like doing anything there's a lot of


---------32:18----------
physiologic things that can contribute


---------32:20----------
to this


---------32:21----------
and this is something i've learned the


---------32:22----------
hard ways like a lot of these people in


---------32:24----------
esports like they have these problems


---------32:25----------
too so i want you guys to think about


---------32:27----------
this unless all of you think about your


---------32:29----------
favorite team and like ask yourself do


---------32:31----------
these people have a team doctor when was


---------32:32----------
the last time they saw a doctor when was


---------32:34----------
last time they had a blood test


---------32:35----------
because if the answer was like it was


---------32:37----------
five years ago there's like a 48 chance


---------32:40----------
that they have one of these problems


---------32:43----------
that is a staggering it's not a perfect


---------32:45----------
way to look at statistics because you


---------32:47----------
know you can have more than one and


---------32:49----------
things like that and some people are you


---------32:51----------
know


---------32:52----------
um


---------32:54----------
and so like


---------32:55----------
it's staggering like 48 of people will


---------32:58----------
have one of these problems so 48 of like


---------33:01----------
people in chat will potentially have one


---------33:03----------
of these problems 48 of people who watch


---------33:06----------
this video so take the number of views


---------33:09----------
cut it in half and that's how many


---------33:10----------
people have these problems


---------33:12----------
it's crazy


---------33:13----------
so there's a lot of low-hanging fruit


---------33:16----------
in terms of improving your life has


---------33:18----------
nothing to do with 99 of what dr k talks


---------33:20----------
about has nothing to do with finding


---------33:22----------
your inner whatever has nothing to do


---------33:24----------
with like stages of change has nothing


---------33:27----------
to do with insomnia has nothing to do


---------33:29----------
with depression nothing to do with


---------33:30----------
anxiety nothing to do with like some


---------33:32----------
scars nothing to do with meditation


---------33:34----------
meditation ain't gonna fix this by the


---------33:36----------
way


---------33:37----------
it has nothing to do with any of this


---------33:38----------
stuff it's physiologic


---------33:39----------
and what i want you all to appreciate is


---------33:41----------
when i show you the list of these


---------33:42----------
symptoms everyone's tossing out


---------33:44----------
psychiatric diagnoses everyone is


---------33:46----------
tossing out psychiatric diagnoses oh


---------33:48----------
it's adhd it's depression it's anxiety


---------33:50----------
this is part of the problem with i think


---------33:52----------
mental health in this country why is


---------33:53----------
mental health getting worse despite the


---------33:55----------
fact that medical science is advancing


---------33:57----------
it's because a lot of our mental health


---------33:58----------
providers have no training in physical


---------34:00----------
medicine


---------34:02----------
think about that for a second right so


---------34:03----------
the average psychologist or social


---------34:05----------
worker gets trained in all kinds of


---------34:07----------
stuff that we actually get less training


---------34:08----------
in they're actually really good at that


---------34:09----------
kind of stuff they actually get more


---------34:10----------
training in psychotherapy than an md


---------34:12----------
does


---------34:13----------
but 48 of people that walk into their


---------34:16----------
office will have one of these conditions


---------34:18----------
and generally speaking when i think


---------34:20----------
about the average therapist i don't


---------34:21----------
think they're writing lab slips


---------34:24----------
right so it's like kind of problematic


---------34:26----------
anyway it's not really their


---------34:27----------
responsibility because you're i you know


---------34:30----------
your primary care physician should be


---------34:31----------
taking care of this stuff for you right


---------34:32----------
so your gp or general practitioner like


---------34:35----------
you're you're just running the build


---------34:37----------
doctor should be evaluating for the


---------34:39----------
stuff


---------34:40----------
but as a psychiatrist i want to say that


---------34:42----------
there's a staggering number of people


---------34:44----------
who walk into my office


---------34:46----------
thinking they have a mental health


---------34:47----------
problem and it turns out to be a


---------34:48----------
physiologic problem


---------34:50----------
and then you just start them on the


---------34:51----------
right medication and it's like they're


---------34:53----------
fine and sometimes it's not even


---------34:54----------
medication right in the case of cpap it


---------34:57----------
can be


---------34:58----------
it's like a machine in the case of type


---------35:00----------
2 diabetes it can be like dietary change


---------35:02----------
and exercise


---------35:03----------
in the case of anemia it can be dietary


---------35:05----------
change so you don't even need medication


---------35:06----------
for this stuff in the case of thyroid


---------35:08----------
hormone usually need you know medication


---------35:10----------
for that


---------35:11----------
but


---------35:13----------
questions


---------35:16----------
is it okay to go to a psychiatrist yeah


---------35:18----------
so a psychiatrist is really the one that


---------35:20----------
you should hold responsible if they miss


---------35:21----------
something like this


---------35:23----------
to be honest because they're the ones


---------35:24----------
who actually get trained in it right


---------35:26----------
so social workers and like psychologists


---------35:29----------
don't do it aren't trained in physical


---------35:31----------
differential diagnosis they're trained


---------35:32----------
in like psychiatric differential


---------35:34----------
diagnosis they're really good at that


---------35:38----------
do you need medication for subclinical


---------35:40----------
hypothyroidism you can that's why you


---------35:42----------
should talk to your doctor about it


---------35:43----------
right


---------35:44----------
so it really depends if you're having


---------35:45----------
symptoms what i would sort of recommend


---------35:47----------
like i'll treat people with subclinical


---------35:50----------
hypothyroidism with medication usually


---------35:52----------
i'll give it a shot if they're having


---------35:53----------
the cl the clinical symptoms and it's


---------35:55----------
like they're like yeah i feel like owned


---------35:57----------
all the time it's like okay let's start


---------35:58----------
you on a super low dose and see if it


---------35:59----------
helps


---------36:00----------
and some of them come in and they say


---------36:02----------
like yeah it's not really helping we can


---------36:03----------
add a little bit more we like recheck


---------36:05----------
their levels and that's like the


---------36:06----------
practice of medicine so you guys should


---------36:07----------
really go it's not just like a legal


---------36:09----------
disclaimer i'm telling y'all that if you


---------36:11----------
guys are suffering from this stuff go


---------36:12----------
and actually see a doctor because they


---------36:14----------
can help you with these things you all


---------36:15----------
don't have to play dark souls on


---------36:17----------
hardcore mode like you just don't have


---------36:19----------
to you shouldn't play life on hardcore


---------36:21----------
mode because you just have one it's a


---------36:22----------
hardcore anyway you only get one shot at


---------36:24----------
it so like you got to play it as best as


---------36:25----------
you can and optimize everything


---------36:30----------
does weight loss help with snoring and


---------36:32----------
sleep apnea absolutely


---------36:36----------
yeah but i'm a gamer so so that's a


---------36:38----------
great point trig etheridge


---------36:43----------
that's literally why we're doing this


---------36:44----------
lecture


---------36:46----------
being a gamer is no longer an excuse you


---------36:48----------
guys deserve better


---------36:51----------
this idea of the degenerate gamer is


---------36:52----------
like the lowest common denominator that


---------36:54----------
i also fall into assuming like


---------36:57----------
the gamers like they're not gonna go


---------36:59----------
like do anything


---------37:00----------
they're gamers there's just energy


---------37:02----------
drinks and being no like go outside like


---------37:05----------
go see a doctor


---------37:07----------
like you deserve better dude


---------37:09----------
you can be a gamer like that's why we're


---------37:10----------
healthy gamer we're not like abstinence


---------37:12----------
from gaming


---------37:13----------
we're like just like go and see a doctor


---------37:15----------
like one day out of the year


---------37:18----------
go and do a one hour appointment with a


---------37:21----------
doctor out of 365 days in the year


---------37:24----------
go get this you spend a second hour like


---------37:26----------
15 20 minutes getting a blood test 15 20


---------37:29----------
minutes talking to your doctor


---------37:31----------
getting a prescription for maybe like


---------37:33----------
hyperthyroidism


---------37:34----------
or hypothyroidism go pick it up take


---------37:36----------
your pill every day and then play lol


---------37:38----------
for eight hours a day


---------37:40----------
that's fine like i'm not saying i'm just


---------37:42----------
saying like use two or three hours over


---------37:44----------
the entire year


---------37:48----------
and then continue being your degenerate


---------37:50----------
gamer self like that's all it takes


---------37:53----------
and then the cool thing is you'll be


---------37:54----------
more motivated so then like it'll be


---------37:56----------
easier to stop playing whatever you're


---------37:58----------
playing


---------38:04----------
yeah so someone's saying i'm in the


---------38:06----------
pre-contemplative stage of seeing a


---------38:07----------
doctor absolutely dude


---------38:09----------
that's why this is awareness raising


---------38:11----------
right


---------38:12----------
so well said someone's paying attention


---------38:14----------
chad


---------38:23----------
yeah encouraging everyday drug use while


---------38:25----------
also maintaining other drugs like


---------38:26----------
cannabis is bad every day absolutely man


---------38:29----------
because i know this is kind of weird so


---------38:31----------
people like oh like he's encouraging


---------38:33----------
drug use and like but this is drugs so i


---------38:35----------
know it's kind of weird but what i'm


---------38:36----------
basing it on is this thing called


---------38:38----------
science


---------38:39----------
right where we can do studies


---------38:41----------
and we can take people who have sleep


---------38:43----------
apnea who are literally for those of you


---------38:45----------
who don't know


---------38:46----------
what i mean i guess there isn't a


---------38:48----------
medication for sleep apnea so maybe it's


---------38:49----------
a bad


---------38:50----------
recommendation a bad choice


---------38:52----------
but like the other thing about a lot of


---------38:54----------
is that you don't need medication for


---------38:56----------
them right but like that's why we use


---------38:57----------
science like we use science to evaluate


---------38:59----------
objectively


---------39:01----------
what is the crap that you're gonna put


---------39:02----------
in your mouth like what is the pill


---------39:04----------
you're gonna take and like what are the


---------39:05----------
benefits and what are the hindrances


---------39:07----------
and so you should absolutely be


---------39:09----------
scientific about it i'm not just


---------39:10----------
advocating it i'm not saying all drugs


---------39:12----------
are created equally i'm not taking


---------39:13----------
telling people to take like chemotherapy


---------39:15----------
out here


---------39:16----------
right because chemotherapy is way more


---------39:18----------
damaging than cannabis


---------39:20----------
and yet it is still sometimes an


---------39:22----------
appropriate recommendation


---------39:24----------
so it's about like understanding science


---------39:26----------
and understanding who you are and


---------39:28----------
instead of like some kind of resistance


---------39:30----------
to like


---------39:31----------
it's a statement of resistance


---------39:33----------
that i can advocate for some drugs and


---------39:35----------
not advocate for others yes that is like


---------39:37----------
literally my job is people come to me


---------39:40----------
and i will advocate for some drugs


---------39:41----------
depending on their situation and say


---------39:43----------
like yeah maybe you shouldn't take that


---------39:46----------
right it's like hmm


---------39:48----------
if someone comes into my office and is


---------39:50----------
hypothyroid i'm not going to recommend


---------39:52----------
that they take birth control


---------39:55----------
right because it's like especially if


---------39:56----------
it's a dude it's like it's not going to


---------39:58----------
help you


---------39:59----------
drugs have their time in their place and


---------40:01----------
cannabis is included we talked about


---------40:02----------
that there's a time and place for


---------40:04----------
cannabis but generally speaking it tends


---------40:06----------
to be used recreationally


---------40:08----------
so


---------40:10----------
do i have to quit smoking cannabis see


---------40:12----------
there is a precontemplative statement do


---------40:14----------
i have to no you don't have to


---------40:17----------
you don't have to


---------40:18----------
like no one's i mean like i don't know


---------40:20----------
what the legal situation is where you


---------40:21----------
live and where you are and what the


---------40:23----------
availability is


---------40:25----------
it's just


---------40:26----------
you don't have to


---------40:28----------
the question is like what's it doing for


---------40:30----------
you


---------40:31----------
and how is it hurting you


---------40:33----------
that's the real way like even when it


---------40:34----------
comes to gaming right it's like


---------40:36----------
we're not saying you should be abstinent


---------40:38----------
from all gaming like we even like i play


---------40:40----------
games on stream


---------40:42----------
but i don't you know


---------40:44----------
today instead of playing dota which i


---------40:45----------
would love to do because by the way


---------40:46----------
there's a new hero new patch so it's


---------40:48----------
very exciting


---------40:49----------
but it's like doing what's important


---------40:51----------
right so like what's more important like


---------40:53----------
teaching chat that 48 of y'all


---------40:56----------
may have one of these problems or like


---------40:58----------
playing one game of dota because the


---------40:59----------
cost is the same it's one hour of my


---------41:01----------
time


---------41:04----------
so no i mean no one has to give up


---------41:06----------
marijuana like i've had patients who are


---------41:08----------
dying of like alcoholic liver disease


---------41:10----------
and they don't want to give up alcohol


---------41:12----------
like that it's your choice right i'm not


---------41:14----------
gonna make you do it i don't think it's


---------41:16----------
the right one


---------41:17----------
you know your kids will miss you but


---------41:18----------
it's ultimately it's like your choice


---------41:20----------
you're the one who has to decide what to


---------41:22----------
put into your body and i've seen this


---------41:24----------
choice on the other end of the spectrum


---------41:25----------
too where like sometimes i'll have


---------41:26----------
patience with schizophrenia


---------41:28----------
and i like prescribed clozapine and boy


---------41:30----------
is that a tough choice it's a tough


---------41:32----------
choice in the opposite direction this is


---------41:34----------
a medication that will cause you to gain


---------41:35----------
80 pounds


---------41:37----------
you will literally start drooling


---------41:39----------
and it will be hard for you to write


---------41:41----------
poetry


---------41:43----------
the upside


---------41:45----------
is that


---------41:46----------
your delusions will stop your


---------41:48----------
hallucinations will stop you'll be able


---------41:50----------
to like wake up at a decent hour on a


---------41:52----------
daily basis and be able to interact with


---------41:55----------
other human beings


---------41:57----------
and i've had some patients who are like


---------41:59----------
yeah like i'd rather i'd rather take the


---------42:01----------
poetry and get hospitalized four times a


---------42:04----------
year and i've had other patients who are


---------42:06----------
like it's really sucks i'm really sad


---------42:08----------
i'm it sucks that i have to take this


---------42:10----------
medication


---------42:11----------
but i think i want to stay out of the


---------42:12----------
hospital and like


---------42:14----------
be able to have a dog because when i go


---------42:16----------
to the hospital there's no one to take


---------42:17----------
care of my dog


---------42:18----------
it's tough


---------42:22----------
it's really tough


---------42:23----------
so i think it's


---------42:26----------
but that's i mean that's medicine and


---------42:27----------
that's life like i don't know that


---------42:28----------
there's ever you know


---------42:31----------
an always good choice the closest thing


---------42:33----------
i can think of


---------42:34----------
in terms of an intervention that works


---------42:36----------
for just about every human being is


---------42:37----------
meditation which is precisely why i


---------42:39----------
teach it at the end of like most streams


---------42:42----------
okay
