---------00:05----------
uh so we're going to try something a


---------00:07----------
little bit different today um on stream


---------00:09----------
what we're going to try to do is


---------00:10----------
actually like do sort of like a


---------00:12----------
psychoanalysis of squid game and then if


---------00:15----------
we have time we'll do we'll review some


---------00:17----------
reddit posts hopefully we'll do that


---------00:20----------
so here's what um


---------00:23----------
so here's what we're gonna do and so


---------00:25----------
we're gonna do something like a


---------00:26----------
psychoanalysis of squid game there are a


---------00:28----------
lot of disclaimers that i have to toss


---------00:29----------
out


---------00:30----------
so the first is that um you know i think


---------00:33----------
it's kind of


---------00:34----------
i think this i'm doing it for fun and


---------00:35----------
it's sort of like more for entertainment


---------00:37----------
and entertainment than education


---------00:39----------
so what we're going to kind of do is


---------00:41----------
like i'm going to give you guys a list


---------00:43----------
of like diagnoses and see if you all can


---------00:45----------
pair up like which character in the game


---------00:48----------
has what diagnosis


---------00:50----------
and so this is like very irresponsible


---------00:52----------
in some ways so like let me just explain


---------00:54----------
a couple of things the first is that to


---------00:56----------
actually obtain a diagnosis is an


---------00:59----------
in-depth and like careful process so


---------01:02----------
when i do a real diagnostic interview


---------01:04----------
with like a human being it takes like 90


---------01:06----------
minutes to two hours i'll ask somewhere


---------01:09----------
between 40 and 100 questions and so


---------01:11----------
there's like a lot of like specificity


---------01:13----------
and carefulness that goes into it so


---------01:15----------
today what we're going to do is just


---------01:16----------
kind of slap diagnosis on people to sort


---------01:18----------
of illustrate certain points because i


---------01:20----------
do think that


---------01:22----------
part of the reason that i wanted to do


---------01:23----------
this in terms of like even though it's


---------01:25----------
you know a little bit irresponsible like


---------01:27----------
people will um


---------01:29----------
but i i do think that there's a value to


---------01:31----------
it because i think there's a big stigma


---------01:34----------
around mental illness and i think that


---------01:36----------
um when po when popular media like


---------01:38----------
portrays mental illness i think it can


---------01:40----------
actually be useful because it


---------01:42----------
illustrates like certain points and


---------01:43----------
helps people like understand or maybe


---------01:45----------
even identify


---------01:47----------
with some of the characters and if you


---------01:49----------
identify with some of the characters or


---------01:50----------
some of the traits sound like they kind


---------01:52----------
of feel like you i would strongly


---------01:54----------
encourage you to go see a licensed


---------01:56----------
mental health professional and like


---------01:57----------
actually get help


---------01:59----------
so the other thing to understand about


---------02:00----------
squid game is that it's like fiction


---------02:02----------
right so not only are we not asking them


---------02:04----------
questions but we're also like


---------02:07----------
it's all like everything is like blown


---------02:09----------
up by like 10 times so things are more


---------02:11----------
extreme it's a very like unrealistic


---------02:14----------
scenario and i think a lot of the


---------02:16----------
portrayals of like mental health and


---------02:18----------
diagnoses are sort of like exacerbated


---------02:20----------
or exaggerated so let's just keep that


---------02:23----------
in mind as well the third thing is that


---------02:25----------
when i use the phrase psychoanalysis


---------02:27----------
we're not talking about um


---------02:29----------
actual psychoanalysis so that's like a


---------02:31----------
deep process that has a lot of different


---------02:33----------
theories basically what we're going to


---------02:34----------
be doing is like kind of hypothesizing


---------02:37----------
about different diagnoses but


---------02:39----------
colloquially when people talk about that


---------02:41----------
they use the term psychoanalysis so


---------02:43----------
we're not actually doing psychoanalysis


---------02:44----------
here it's just


---------02:46----------
that's not what we're doing


---------02:48----------
but overall uh and then the last


---------02:50----------
disclaimer is that you know there's


---------02:52----------
gonna be like huge and massive spoilers


---------02:54----------
for this so if you guys have not seen


---------02:56----------
squid game like don't


---------02:59----------
don't watch this like


---------03:00----------
go do something else and come back and


---------03:02----------
watch it so we're not going to hold back


---------03:04----------
on the spoilers at all i'm going to


---------03:06----------
assume that everyone here has seen it


---------03:08----------
part of the reason i wanted to do it now


---------03:10----------
is because if you guys have seen it


---------03:11----------
you'll like it'll be fresh in your mind


---------03:13----------
so i'm going to talk about particular


---------03:15----------
scenes okay so we we good


---------03:18----------
um yeah if you want to go watch it right


---------03:20----------
now like now is the time


---------03:22----------
so uh


---------03:24----------
so let's get started okay so this is


---------03:26----------
what we're gonna do all right i'm gonna


---------03:28----------
go ahead and start by giving you guys


---------03:30----------
kind of a list of diagnoses


---------03:32----------
or like situ like it's not necessarily


---------03:34----------
diagnoses so what we're going to try to


---------03:36----------
do is pair up some of these like


---------03:37----------
conditions or psychological phenomenon


---------03:40----------
with different


---------03:42----------
fictional characters okay


---------03:44----------
so our our categories are going to be


---------03:46----------
like depression bipolar anxiety


---------03:49----------
addiction and attachment disorder ptsd


---------03:53----------
reaction formation or suppression


---------03:55----------
actually


---------03:57----------
um so these are like defense mechanisms


---------03:59----------
sociopathy and borderline personality


---------04:02----------
disorder okay so if you guys are not


---------04:04----------
familiar with what these are that's


---------04:06----------
actually like perfectly fine it's not


---------04:07----------
that big of a deal


---------04:09----------
for those of you that are a little bit


---------04:11----------
familiar with this uh you know i


---------04:13----------
encourage you to kind of think a little


---------04:14----------
bit about


---------04:15----------
what you know who you think has what


---------04:18----------
okay


---------04:20----------
so let's go ahead and get started


---------04:22----------
so we're gonna start


---------04:24----------
with


---------04:25----------
um so what i'm gonna do is like we're


---------04:27----------
going to start actually at the top so


---------04:29----------
we're going to start with the main


---------04:30----------
character and once again i'm going to


---------04:32----------
butcher these pronunciations so i


---------04:34----------
apologize so this is like the main


---------04:36----------
character of the the show his name is


---------04:38----------
gihon right


---------04:41----------
so let's just talk a little bit about


---------04:43----------
gihon or the you know the english


---------04:45----------
uh


---------04:47----------
you know what whatever that's sort of


---------04:48----------
how they spell his name so this is a guy


---------04:50----------
who's like first of all he's broke right


---------04:52----------
so he doesn't have a whole lot of money


---------04:54----------
and then like the first thing that he


---------04:55----------
like in the first episode what he does


---------04:57----------
is he steals his mom's credit card


---------04:59----------
withdraws cash


---------05:01----------
takes his money to like a horse racing


---------05:04----------
place loses some money


---------05:06----------
bets again and then wins right so then


---------05:08----------
he's thrilled he's got a bunch of cash


---------05:11----------
um he


---------05:12----------
is divorced and like makes big promises


---------05:15----------
to his daughter and like his daughter


---------05:17----------
sort of isn't disappointed when he fails


---------05:19----------
to deliver on his promises right she


---------05:21----------
kind of knows what her dad is like she


---------05:23----------
knows her dad is unreliable she knows


---------05:25----------
that he's gonna like make big promises


---------05:27----------
and not live up to them


---------05:29----------
and so then what happens is gohun like


---------05:30----------
joins the squid game out of like


---------05:32----------
desperation right and then he goes


---------05:34----------
through the squid game and once again


---------05:35----------
huge spoiler alert he wins and so then


---------05:38----------
he gets this huge pile of money in


---------05:40----------
theory all of his problems should be


---------05:42----------
solved and despite the fact that all of


---------05:44----------
his problems are solved he like


---------05:46----------
is a bum for a year drinks booze


---------05:49----------
and then kind of randomly like goes and


---------05:51----------
colors his hair


---------05:52----------
and then doesn't kind of know what to do


---------05:54----------
with himself and he's going to go see


---------05:55----------
his kid he's going to go like live a


---------05:57----------
normal life and on the verge of actually


---------05:59----------
boarding the airplane and like you know


---------06:01----------
going to see his kid and maybe living a


---------06:03----------
regular life


---------06:05----------
he turns around and decides to walk away


---------06:08----------
from the airplane


---------06:12----------
[Music]


---------06:14----------
and the presumption is that he's


---------06:15----------
actually going to join like squid game


---------06:17----------
round two


---------06:18----------
so like the diagnosis here is absolutely


---------06:21----------
like gambling addiction okay so this is


---------06:23----------
a guy that um you know just can't stop


---------06:26----------
so like despite the fact that he you


---------06:28----------
know it seems like he has a regular


---------06:30----------
um


---------06:31----------
kind of like body that he goes and


---------06:33----------
gambles with


---------06:34----------
he's broke probably part of the reason


---------06:36----------
that he's broke is it appears that he's


---------06:38----------
had like several jobs but he can't like


---------06:40----------
store money away it seems like he's you


---------06:42----------
know failed to show up for his daughter


---------06:44----------
like several times and yet we like him


---------06:46----------
right so he's like the protagonist we're


---------06:48----------
kind of rooting for him like we feel


---------06:50----------
sorry for him despite the fact that he's


---------06:52----------
got this like crippling gambling


---------06:53----------
addiction that despite the fact that


---------06:55----------
he's got a bunch of money and can


---------06:56----------
basically like afk for the rest of his


---------06:58----------
life he actually decides that he's gonna


---------07:00----------
go and like play again


---------07:02----------
so a couple of important features of of


---------07:05----------
uh gambling pathologic gambling or


---------07:07----------
behavioral addictions so one of them is


---------07:10----------
impulsivity and the second one we're


---------07:12----------
going to talk about is like future


---------07:13----------
discounting so the brains of people with


---------07:15----------
behavioral addictions tend to be like


---------07:17----------
more impulsive so they have difficulty


---------07:19----------
restraining their impulses and they also


---------07:22----------
have difficulty


---------07:24----------
um sort of planning for the future and


---------07:26----------
they tend to choose


---------07:28----------
short-term gain over like long-term gain


---------07:31----------
so there are experiments that have been


---------07:33----------
done in people who have behavioral


---------07:34----------
addictions


---------07:36----------
and what we've discovered is that if you


---------07:37----------
take someone with a behavioral addiction


---------07:39----------
you're like i'm gonna give you one


---------07:41----------
dollar now or ten dollars tomorrow the


---------07:44----------
person with a behavioral addiction is


---------07:45----------
more likely to choose one dollar now


---------07:49----------
than someone who doesn't have a


---------07:50----------
behavioral addiction who will go for


---------07:51----------
like the long-term gain and we kind of


---------07:53----------
see this in his life right like no


---------07:55----------
matter like what he what his situation


---------07:57----------
is he's going to go for that you know


---------08:00----------
high-yield short-term play like


---------08:02----------
irrespective of the situation


---------08:04----------
i think there are a couple of other


---------08:05----------
things that are really cool that they


---------08:06----------
demonstrate uh in this show and i i


---------08:08----------
really like the way that they portray


---------08:09----------
addiction because a lot of times people


---------08:12----------
with addiction get


---------08:13----------
um they actually get like


---------08:15----------
blamed for their addiction so for many


---------08:18----------
years addiction was kind of viewed as


---------08:20----------
like


---------08:21----------
uh you know a moral deficiency or like


---------08:24----------
it's their fault and people can just get


---------08:27----------
up and like just stop drinking or just


---------08:29----------
stop gambling bro


---------08:30----------
and so it can be it's sort of viewed as


---------08:33----------
a moral disease and i think that if you


---------08:35----------
look at episode six in particular right


---------08:37----------
so like the reason that episode six is


---------08:39----------
so powerful is because we know that


---------08:42----------
giuhun is a good guy like his daughter


---------08:44----------
despite the fact that he's like chain


---------08:46----------
failing his daughter


---------08:48----------
his daughter like still loves him and


---------08:49----------
cares about him and she sort of


---------08:51----------
understands that in a sense it's not his


---------08:52----------
fault and he's like a decent human being


---------08:54----------
he just can't control the gambling and


---------08:56----------
so that's actually what makes uh episode


---------08:58----------
six so powerful is because


---------09:01----------
that's the first time that we see him


---------09:03----------
actually being like morally deficient


---------09:06----------
and that's what makes it so devastating


---------09:08----------
is that this is a good dude who's got


---------09:10----------
like you know a problem that he's got an


---------09:12----------
addiction which sort of like isn't his


---------09:13----------
fault


---------09:15----------
and there are things that he can do kind


---------09:16----------
of better for sure but like in episode


---------09:18----------
six we kind of see like the moral decay


---------09:21----------
that he has and we kind of know that


---------09:23----------
morally he's like a good person and so i


---------09:25----------
think it's sort of a really good


---------09:27----------
portrayal of addiction because people


---------09:28----------
with addictions aren't bad people


---------09:30----------
they're just


---------09:31----------
they're normal people who have these


---------09:33----------
kinds of addictions


---------09:35----------
uh i think the show also does a good job


---------09:37----------
of like demonstrating what it's like to


---------09:40----------
grow up with a parent who has an


---------09:43----------
addiction so we kind of see this in his


---------09:45----------
daughter because like


---------09:46----------
um you know she kind of she kind of


---------09:49----------
knows what to expect and so you we see a


---------09:51----------
lot of like you know impulsive decisions


---------09:53----------
that he makes he gets super frustrated


---------09:56----------
when he loses but he can't kind of stay


---------09:58----------
away and one of the saddest things that


---------10:00----------
i've i've worked with i'm going to use


---------10:02----------
that phrase a lot today but one of the


---------10:04----------
most challenging things or saddest


---------10:06----------
things that i've worked with is like


---------10:07----------
kids of parents who have addictions


---------10:10----------
because the kid kind of knows like that


---------10:12----------
the parent just can't be relied on until


---------10:14----------
the addiction gets under control


---------10:16----------
and so when i work with with parents who


---------10:18----------
have addictions you know fixing the


---------10:20----------
addiction is step one


---------10:23----------
but unfortunately like that's just step


---------10:25----------
one and what we also have to do is


---------10:27----------
repair the relationship with the child


---------10:30----------
so i think kind of in conclusion you


---------10:32----------
know giuhun is someone who's like low on


---------10:34----------
money like has this impulsivity has this


---------10:36----------
like future discounting problem where he


---------10:38----------
can't make like good long-term decisions


---------10:40----------
for himself he'll just randomly like you


---------10:42----------
know dye his hair red


---------10:44----------
and it can be pretty devastating on on


---------10:46----------
the children of people with addictions


---------10:48----------
which is like just a sad truth


---------10:50----------
if you're someone you know who falls


---------10:52----------
into this kind of category where like


---------10:54----------
you can't help but make you know bad


---------10:57----------
decisions that are like short-term gain


---------10:59----------
i strongly strongly encourage you this


---------11:01----------
is something you all are going to hear a


---------11:03----------
lot like if you relate to gihon and you


---------11:05----------
have these kinds of problems i would


---------11:06----------
recommend that you like go and get


---------11:08----------
evaluated or supported by a mental


---------11:10----------
health professional another important


---------11:12----------
thing to remember here is that


---------11:15----------
um just another kind of disclaimer is


---------11:17----------
that


---------11:18----------
you know remember that psychiatric


---------11:19----------
illness is not binary so like people


---------11:21----------
will get a diagnosis and we sort of


---------11:23----------
treat it as binary right either you


---------11:26----------
get diagnosed with an addiction or you


---------11:28----------
don't get diagnosed with an addiction


---------11:29----------
whereas the truth is that like addiction


---------11:32----------
is like a continuous spectrum


---------11:34----------
and when we sort of establish a


---------11:35----------
diagnosis is when it sort of crosses a


---------11:38----------
particular threshold but even if you're


---------11:40----------
someone who doesn't have like as


---------11:42----------
impaired of a life like if an addiction


---------11:44----------
that you have or an addictive behavior


---------11:46----------
you have hasn't screwed over your life


---------11:48----------
as much as giuhun's screwed over his


---------11:50----------
life you can still go get professional


---------11:52----------
help for it right if you're someone


---------11:54----------
who's like highly impulsive and like you


---------11:56----------
can't stay away from a particular thing


---------11:58----------
that's bad for you


---------11:59----------
even if you're able to maintain like


---------12:01----------
this is kind of the idea of a


---------12:02----------
functioning alcoholic


---------12:04----------
um even if you're able to maintain like


---------12:06----------
a decent life and like decent family


---------12:08----------
stuff decent career stuff you should


---------12:11----------
still consider getting help around it


---------12:14----------
so that's


---------12:15----------
and his is is an addiction okay


---------12:18----------
next up we have


---------12:22----------
say bjork


---------12:24----------
[Music]


---------12:26----------
i i don't know how to pronounce this


---------12:28----------
right so she's someone who um as best as


---------12:31----------
i could tell and i'm still not entirely


---------12:33----------
100 sure about this


---------12:34----------
escaped from north korea right tried to


---------12:37----------
like uh reassure her brother so we see


---------12:39----------
like early on that her brother's in an


---------12:42----------
orphanage and she's trying to like


---------12:43----------
figure out a way to get her mom smuggled


---------12:45----------
into north korea i mean out of north


---------12:47----------
korea


---------12:48----------
um so she sort of drops her brother off


---------12:51----------
at the orphanage or her brother is


---------12:52----------
staying at an orphanage and she's trying


---------12:54----------
to make things happen if you kind of


---------12:56----------
like look at her she like doesn't smile


---------12:58----------
much right she doesn't like relate to


---------12:59----------
other people she's kind of a loner she


---------13:02----------
distrusts people


---------13:03----------
um she kind of keeps to herself


---------13:06----------
and uh then what what we'll see like a


---------13:09----------
couple of scenes where like she's kind


---------13:10----------
of quiet and reserved except for a few


---------13:12----------
situations so one really illustrative


---------13:15----------
scene is when she goes to like the i


---------13:17----------
don't know what they're called but like


---------13:19----------
the people who will


---------13:20----------
smuggle people out of north korea and


---------13:22----------
he's kind of like yeah sorry like i


---------13:24----------
wasn't able to help and then she's like


---------13:26----------
like gets very very like there's she


---------13:28----------
becomes kind of unstable and like you


---------13:30----------
know burns him with hot tea and we kind


---------13:33----------
of see that pattern again and again like


---------13:36----------
throughout the show where she's sort of


---------13:38----------
like calm and reserved and she seems


---------13:39----------
like in control of her emotions except


---------13:42----------
when there's like an explosion of


---------13:44----------
emotion and some degree of like


---------13:45----------
emotional instability


---------13:47----------
and that she has a lot of


---------13:49----------
trouble like trusting people


---------13:51----------
so i think she if we kind of go back to


---------13:53----------
our list of you know what our what our


---------13:55----------
diagnoses are i think she bears features


---------13:58----------
of an attachment disorder so this is


---------14:01----------
going to be kind of tricky to understand


---------14:03----------
um but what we're we're going to kind of


---------14:05----------
try our best


---------14:06----------
so


---------14:08----------
what tends to happen when people are


---------14:10----------
traumatized early in life is that the


---------14:12----------
trauma can manifest in different ways


---------14:15----------
so we've done research for example on


---------14:18----------
like cases of like genocide in a


---------14:20----------
particular country right where not


---------14:22----------
everyone who experiences some kind of


---------14:25----------
shared traumatic event necessarily has


---------14:28----------
the diagnosis of ptsd


---------14:31----------
so traumatic experiences or emotional


---------14:33----------
abuse or things like that can manifest


---------14:36----------
later in life in a variety of different


---------14:38----------
ways so for some people it manifests as


---------14:40----------
ptsd but i think say bjork is like a


---------14:42----------
good example of what seems to me like


---------14:45----------
attachment issues


---------14:47----------
so then the question kind of becomes


---------14:48----------
like what what is it what is attached


---------14:51----------
what are attachment issues


---------14:53----------
so


---------14:54----------
uh there have been a group of


---------14:55----------
researchers that


---------14:58----------
you know really looked at something


---------14:59----------
called attachment theory and attachment


---------15:01----------
theory is kind of


---------15:03----------
an exploration of how human beings form


---------15:06----------
connections


---------15:08----------
and so in situations where


---------15:11----------
children grow up with parents who are


---------15:13----------
like emotionally supportive and most


---------15:16----------
importantly like emotionally mirroring


---------15:18----------
they tend to develop healthy attachment


---------15:20----------
styles and so what that sort of means


---------15:22----------
just to give you guys kind of an example


---------15:24----------
is like when i'm growing up and i'm a


---------15:26----------
one-year-old child


---------15:28----------
i don't really understand what i feel


---------15:30----------
right like one-year-olds can't they


---------15:32----------
don't even understand what they feel and


---------15:33----------
they certainly can't articulate their


---------15:35----------
feelings they can barely talk


---------15:36----------
so how does a child understand like make


---------15:39----------
sense of the world and understand like


---------15:41----------
how they feel they do it through


---------15:43----------
mirroring so when a child you know trips


---------15:46----------
and falls down if the parents express


---------15:49----------
concern and support the child learns a


---------15:52----------
couple of important things one is that


---------15:54----------
like the facial expression of the parent


---------15:56----------
tells the child whether they should be


---------15:58----------
worried or not and you guys may have


---------16:00----------
seen this where if a child trips and


---------16:02----------
falls and everyone around them laughs


---------16:04----------
the kid will like get up and laugh too


---------16:06----------
and they'll feel totally fine


---------16:07----------
if the child trips and falls and


---------16:09----------
everyone panics then the child will


---------16:11----------
start crying right so what the child


---------16:13----------
feels is actually determined by


---------16:16----------
um


---------16:17----------
sort of the facial expressions of people


---------16:19----------
around them


---------16:20----------
and so what happens in healthy


---------16:22----------
attachment is that a child grows up and


---------16:24----------
like you know when they get hurt


---------16:27----------
the parents around them will express


---------16:28----------
concern they'll be emotionally


---------16:30----------
supportive so not only does the child


---------16:32----------
understand what they feel they also come


---------16:35----------
to understand that the world is like a


---------16:36----------
safe and secure place because when i


---------16:39----------
trip and fall down and people like treat


---------16:41----------
me with like love and respect and care i


---------16:43----------
begin to see the world is like a place


---------16:45----------
that is going to be supportive of me


---------16:47----------
right and if the place is if the world


---------16:50----------
is going to be supportive of me then i


---------16:51----------
can learn to trust the world and trust


---------16:54----------
people in the world


---------16:56----------
the flip side of that is people who grow


---------16:58----------
up in households where parents are not


---------17:00----------
good at emotional mirroring are not good


---------17:02----------
at support or like traumatic kind of


---------17:04----------
situations


---------17:05----------
in which case the world is not a a safe


---------17:08----------
place


---------17:09----------
you know you're growing up in a pvp zone


---------17:12----------
versus a pve zone and so like the pvp


---------17:15----------
world is like very dangerous because


---------17:17----------
people can attack you right people


---------17:19----------
parents like when kids trip and fall and


---------17:21----------
you've got a parent who yells at the


---------17:23----------
child for being an idiot and being


---------17:25----------
clumsy suddenly like when the child


---------17:27----------
needs emotional support and tlc instead


---------17:30----------
what they're getting is like blame and


---------17:32----------
like anger and frustration


---------17:34----------
from the parent


---------17:36----------
and so that's the kind of stuff that


---------17:37----------
sort of results in attachment disorders


---------17:40----------
and so disorders of attachment kind of


---------17:41----------
have a couple of like key and common


---------17:43----------
features there's a lot of specificity to


---------17:46----------
what i'm saying


---------17:47----------
um but the the key features are like a


---------17:49----------
difficulty like trusting people right a


---------17:52----------
difficulty with like social problems and


---------17:54----------
like a difficulty with like emotional


---------17:56----------
ability so people with attachment uh


---------17:59----------
problems have difficulty forming


---------18:00----------
relationships with other people and like


---------18:02----------
learning how to trust other people so i


---------18:05----------
see this a lot for example in people who


---------18:07----------
have difficulty forming like romantic


---------18:09----------
relationships


---------18:10----------
so some people may be able to like date


---------18:12----------
initially but then they just can't like


---------18:14----------
let their guard down and be vulnerable


---------18:16----------
with another human being they can't


---------18:19----------
trust another human being to like


---------18:22----------
take care of them so instead they have


---------18:24----------
to always have their walls up and can't


---------18:27----------
form real authentic connections and what


---------18:29----------
we see with say bjork is that she's not


---------18:31----------
like a bad person or anything or maybe


---------18:32----------
are you can argue argue that she is but


---------18:35----------
um you know she seems like a decent


---------18:37----------
human being who just grows up or


---------18:40----------
believes that the world is like a


---------18:41----------
distrustful place and where did she kind


---------18:44----------
of learn that she learned that probably


---------18:45----------
like presumably growing up in north


---------18:47----------
korea and like you know people not


---------18:49----------
caring for her and like you know she's


---------18:50----------
like just inherently distrustful and we


---------18:53----------
kind of see this in people who have a


---------18:55----------
problems of disordered attachment


---------18:58----------
and so as a result they have a lot of


---------19:00----------
difficulty like forming relationships


---------19:02----------
with other people so if you're someone


---------19:04----------
who kind of grew up you know in a


---------19:05----------
situation where


---------19:07----------
your parents maybe weren't consistently


---------19:09----------
supportive


---------19:10----------
or you grew up kind of like in in today


---------19:13----------
you sort of think that


---------19:15----------
the world is like an unsafe place like


---------19:18----------
operating in the world gives you a lot


---------19:20----------
of anxiety like you can't trust people


---------19:22----------
you can't count on people


---------19:24----------
you can't


---------19:25----------
form connections with people because you


---------19:27----------
have your guard up that sort of makes me


---------19:29----------
think about attachment related issues


---------19:31----------
there isn't a discrete diagnosis here by


---------19:34----------
the way but i still think that it's


---------19:35----------
worthwhile to kind of go see a licensed


---------19:37----------
mental health professional


---------19:38----------
okay


---------19:40----------
so that's say bjork


---------19:41----------
attachment issues


---------19:43----------
so next what we're going to do


---------19:46----------
is actually


---------19:47----------
talk about


---------19:48----------
a less


---------19:50----------
kind of more of a side character


---------19:56----------
because i think it forms a nice contrast


---------19:59----------
next person that we're going to take a


---------20:00----------
look at


---------20:01----------
is jion


---------20:08----------
so this is a character that once again


---------20:10----------
is like kind of quiet right so she kind


---------20:13----------
of keeps to herself she's not sort of


---------20:16----------
quite as volatile as um say bjork is


---------20:19----------
but she's sort of a loner she doesn't


---------20:21----------
really care about performing connections


---------20:23----------
she's kind of afk


---------20:25----------
um she just sort of joins up when she


---------20:27----------
has to


---------20:28----------
and she's just kind of like afk and kind


---------20:30----------
of chilling right so she doesn't like


---------20:32----------
say a whole lot she doesn't do a whole


---------20:34----------
lot she's not like particularly playful


---------20:36----------
she's not particularly like


---------20:39----------
she's not even like paranoid in the way


---------20:40----------
that sabjak is she's just sort of like


---------20:42----------
afk


---------20:44----------
the one interesting thing is that she


---------20:46----------
kind of um gets super pissed off when


---------20:49----------
she like talks to the religious dude or


---------20:51----------
when the religious dude like talks about


---------20:53----------
religious stuff


---------20:54----------
so if we're kind of looking at what her


---------20:57----------
diagnosis is i think this is a really


---------20:58----------
good example of like ptsd or even


---------21:01----------
complex ptsd


---------21:03----------
so this is a good example of i think the


---------21:05----------
show does a good example does a good job


---------21:07----------
of demonstrating how trauma can manifest


---------21:10----------
in different ways


---------21:12----------
so people with ptsd or complex ptsd tend


---------21:15----------
to feel empty they kind of feel


---------21:17----------
worthless they feel different from other


---------21:20----------
people they feel like nobody understands


---------21:22----------
them and as a result they avoid


---------21:24----------
relationships


---------21:26----------
there's also features of kind of like


---------21:27----------
dissociation when it comes to ptsd


---------21:30----------
and people when they sort of feel empty


---------21:33----------
on the inside and they have trouble like


---------21:36----------
relating to other people and if we kind


---------21:38----------
of look at her story she kind of talks


---------21:39----------
about how her dad was sort of very


---------21:42----------
abusive um it's not really clear in what


---------21:45----------
way her dad is abusive but i kind of got


---------21:48----------
the vibe that he was sexually abusive to


---------21:50----------
her and was like super religious about


---------21:52----------
it


---------21:53----------
um and so she also like lost her mom and


---------21:56----------
things like that and so people who have


---------21:57----------
been traumatized like consistently


---------22:00----------
so this is where complex ptsd the


---------22:03----------
difference between ptsd and complex ptsd


---------22:06----------
is that you can get sort of sexually


---------22:08----------
assaulted once or get you know in a car


---------22:10----------
accident or something like that and you


---------22:12----------
can develop ptsd from a single event


---------22:15----------
what some people have started to


---------22:16----------
discover is that when people get


---------22:18----------
repeatedly traumatized like over and


---------22:20----------
over and over again it manifests


---------22:23----------
slightly differently from like regular


---------22:25----------
ptsd and that's when we sort of explore


---------22:27----------
things like complex ptsd


---------22:29----------
so based on her history it really sounds


---------22:31----------
like she grew up in a repeatedly


---------22:33----------
traumatic environment and i think they


---------22:35----------
actually do a very good job of like


---------22:37----------
showcasing some of the features of


---------22:39----------
complex ptsd


---------22:41----------
and so she kind of feels like you know


---------22:44----------
she can't connect to people she's sort


---------22:45----------
of like dissociative which is sort of


---------22:47----------
what that


---------22:48----------
going afk is right she doesn't feel a


---------22:50----------
whole lot of things and one of the


---------22:52----------
things that she really they do a good


---------22:54----------
job of portraying is like she's kind of


---------22:56----------
afk except when it comes to religious


---------22:58----------
people and so if we kind of look at it


---------23:00----------
you know i think that's a really good


---------23:01----------
example of like a trigger right so she


---------23:03----------
was abused by someone who was hyper


---------23:05----------
religious and so as a result like any


---------23:08----------
time someone is religious around her she


---------23:10----------
like gets really really pissed off and


---------23:12----------
it triggers like a lot of negative


---------23:13----------
feelings


---------23:15----------
another thing to remember about uh


---------23:17----------
trauma is that in my work as a


---------23:18----------
psychiatrist i think about trauma as the


---------23:21----------
great chameleon


---------23:22----------
of psychiatry so it can look like


---------23:24----------
depression it can look like bipolar


---------23:26----------
disorder it can look like just feeling


---------23:28----------
afk or being empty


---------23:31----------
um


---------23:32----------
you know it can feel like people are


---------23:34----------
just like damaged and don't have


---------23:35----------
self-worth so they have and this is kind


---------23:38----------
of important so like when someone gets


---------23:40----------
traumatized at a young age their sense


---------23:43----------
of like their internal sense of self


---------23:45----------
gets like damaged they don't really feel


---------23:48----------
like a person on the inside and that's


---------23:50----------
kind of hard to describe if you feel


---------23:52----------
like a person on the inside that'll be


---------23:54----------
like confusing for you and if you've


---------23:56----------
been traumatized and don't feel like a


---------23:57----------
person on the inside like that may make


---------23:59----------
sense and you may be very confused by


---------24:02----------
people who have this like sense of


---------24:03----------
positive identity


---------24:05----------
and so if you if your sense of


---------24:07----------
self-worth on the inside is damaged and


---------24:09----------
you don't know who you are basically


---------24:11----------
it's hard to have a goal right it's hard


---------24:14----------
to have a purpose because in order to


---------24:15----------
like have a purpose you have to be a


---------24:17----------
main character you have to know what you


---------24:19----------
are on the inside it's also hard to have


---------24:21----------
relationships because a relationship


---------24:23----------
involves like a connection between two


---------24:26----------
people and if you're kind of empty on


---------24:28----------
the inside and you don't know who you


---------24:29----------
are in the inside it's really hard to


---------24:32----------
have a relationship with someone because


---------24:33----------
like you don't really understand who you


---------24:35----------
are


---------24:36----------
um so i think trauma is kind of


---------24:38----------
interesting because it's it really can


---------24:40----------
masquerade as all kinds of different


---------24:42----------
things right they can masquerade as


---------24:44----------
people being checked out or some people


---------24:46----------
may look at gee on and say like oh she's


---------24:48----------
depressed


---------24:49----------
but i really think it's a good kind of


---------24:51----------
media portrayal like a simplistic kind


---------24:54----------
of hyperbolic portrayal of uh


---------24:57----------
cptsd or complex trauma


---------25:01----------
so the last thing that i'll kind of


---------25:02----------
point out is that like so people with


---------25:04----------
complex trauma tend to feel like they're


---------25:06----------
worth less than other people and so she


---------25:09----------
kind of you we even sort of see this


---------25:12----------
where sometimes people with trauma will


---------25:13----------
also have suicidality and she has no


---------25:16----------
problem um


---------25:18----------
you know sacrificing herself


---------25:21----------
for someone else and so this in a show


---------25:24----------
is kind of like very positive right like


---------25:27----------
we feel like oh my god she's like so


---------25:29----------
like she's such a good person unless she


---------25:30----------
like sacrifices herself for her friend


---------25:32----------
and we'll get to that relationship in a


---------25:34----------
second


---------25:35----------
but i think there's unfortunately a


---------25:37----------
sinister undercurrent to this which is


---------25:39----------
and she even sort of says this right


---------25:41----------
she's like your life is like worth more


---------25:44----------
than mine is and the really sad thing is


---------25:46----------
she may say she kind of says like oh i


---------25:49----------
don't have parents anymore and i don't


---------25:50----------
have anyone in life and so you may even


---------25:52----------
objectively like get on the same page


---------25:54----------
with her and say like okay leah she


---------25:56----------
doesn't have someone right like um say


---------25:58----------
bjork has to stay alive for her brother


---------26:00----------
and has to stay alive for her sister but


---------26:02----------
the really kind of there's a really sad


---------26:04----------
undercurrent to this which is like why


---------26:06----------
doesn't she have anyone right


---------26:08----------
and so she's like presumably in her like


---------26:10----------
early 20s i would guess or whatever but


---------26:13----------
because of her trauma because of the way


---------26:15----------
that she was raised she's actually like


---------26:16----------
not able to form connections so she's a


---------26:19----------
loner and it sort of becomes a


---------26:20----------
self-fulfilling prophecy the other


---------26:22----------
interesting thing about trauma is even


---------26:24----------
if she did have people and so this is


---------26:26----------
where you know


---------26:27----------
if we if she was a real person


---------26:29----------
we may actually discover that she does


---------26:31----------
have people in her life maybe she has a


---------26:33----------
boyfriend maybe she has people who care


---------26:35----------
about her maybe she has siblings but


---------26:37----------
people with trauma feel so worthless on


---------26:39----------
the inside that it feels like they don't


---------26:41----------
have anyone because they can't actually


---------26:43----------
connect to anyone because no one really


---------26:45----------
understands them and they don't


---------26:47----------
understand other people


---------26:49----------
so that's jion the next thing that we're


---------26:51----------
going to kind of talk about for a second


---------26:53----------
is broken relationships that form


---------26:56----------
between traumatic people or traumatized


---------26:59----------
people so this is something that i've


---------27:01----------
seen a lot


---------27:02----------
as a psychiatrist so if you look at like


---------27:04----------
two of the people who have trauma


---------27:06----------
they basically band together right so


---------27:08----------
like there's ceb yakuza loner and g on


---------27:11----------
who's a loner and so like they end up


---------27:13----------
kind of pairing up and this is something


---------27:15----------
that is at the same time beautiful and


---------27:18----------
sad i've seen this is so much especially


---------27:20----------
in like residential trauma treatment


---------27:23----------
where people who feel broken like i feel


---------27:26----------
like half of a person


---------27:28----------
and what happens is i tend to gravitate


---------27:30----------
towards other people who are also like


---------27:33----------
broken so i've seen this in in a way


---------27:35----------
it's kind of beautiful that like two


---------27:37----------
people with trauma both feel broken they


---------27:40----------
feel like half of a person so they can


---------27:42----------
sometimes feel whole when they get


---------27:44----------
together


---------27:45----------
and so i've seen a lot of like there's


---------27:46----------
almost like a sense of kindred spirits


---------27:48----------
where when you've been traumatized and


---------27:50----------
you don't really know who you are and


---------27:52----------
you feel like fundamentally broken on


---------27:53----------
the inside


---------27:55----------
the they're like all the normal people


---------27:57----------
that you can't relate to but there are


---------27:59----------
all there are people who are just as


---------28:01----------
broken as you are and like there's a


---------28:03----------
sense of like kindred spirits and


---------28:05----------
there's this idea that two halves make a


---------28:06----------
whole


---------28:08----------
and these these are two people that you


---------28:09----------
know are both confused by like the other


---------28:12----------
people around them right they can't


---------28:13----------
connect with them but there's actually


---------28:15----------
like a connection that can form between


---------28:18----------
two people who've been traumatized


---------28:20----------
unfortunately while these people are


---------28:22----------
drawn to connections with each other i


---------28:25----------
would say that like these relationships


---------28:27----------
tend to be very very difficult because


---------28:29----------
the truth is that two people who have


---------28:31----------
difficulty forming connections


---------28:34----------
even though they're drawn to each other


---------28:35----------
and they can understand each other


---------28:38----------
it's been my experience that a lot of


---------28:40----------
these relationships don't end up working


---------28:42----------
out well


---------28:50----------
and that's just because like both people


---------28:52----------
are like not


---------28:54----------
um


---------28:55----------
you know a lot of times they just like


---------28:56----------
can't connect with each other or there


---------28:58----------
are other kinds of problems that arise


---------29:00----------
where it doesn't seem to work out so you


---------29:02----------
can look at uh you know one study for


---------29:04----------
example that looked at borderline


---------29:06----------
personality disorder which also um


---------29:09----------
oftentimes has a root in trauma and that


---------29:11----------
like one of the treatments for


---------29:12----------
borderline personality disorder is to


---------29:14----------
actually form a stable relationship with


---------29:17----------
like someone else who's healthy and over


---------29:18----------
a period of two years that seems to


---------29:21----------
really help the people with bpd


---------29:23----------
so unfortunately you know the the kind


---------29:26----------
of fact remains or i don't know if it's


---------29:27----------
really a fact i don't really have good


---------29:29----------
statistics around this but


---------29:30----------
um you know what i've kind of seen is


---------29:32----------
that people who get together when


---------29:34----------
psychiatrically hospitalized and that


---------29:36----------
may have nothing to do with the trauma


---------29:37----------
it may have to do more with sort of the


---------29:39----------
fact that they're at their low point and


---------29:41----------
their mental illness is like very very


---------29:43----------
active and bad at that point


---------29:45----------
that's probably a bigger factor


---------29:48----------
when when two feet people feel broken


---------29:50----------
and they kind of connect sometimes it


---------29:52----------
doesn't turn out to be the best


---------29:53----------
relationship


---------29:55----------
i've also seen the flip side of it so


---------29:57----------
this is like a good example in terms of


---------29:58----------
addictions so a lot of people will like


---------30:00----------
fall in love and rehab and that can be


---------30:03----------
really fantastic


---------30:04----------
and i think i've seen a lot of people


---------30:06----------
who are in recovery and can really


---------30:08----------
support each other two people who are in


---------30:09----------
recovery and like working on sobriety


---------30:11----------
together and they start a romantic


---------30:13----------
relationship and they actually end up


---------30:15----------
like getting married and like staying


---------30:16----------
sober and together for like three


---------30:18----------
decades i've seen those kinds of


---------30:20----------
relationships and they can truly be


---------30:21----------
amazing


---------30:23----------
unfortunately most of the relationships


---------30:25----------
that i've seen i'm just talking about


---------30:27----------
anecdotally here as an addiction


---------30:28----------
psychiatrist who does like inpatient and


---------30:31----------
also residential treatment a lot of


---------30:33----------
times those relationships kind of don't


---------30:34----------
work out so if you're someone who's been


---------30:37----------
traumatized


---------30:38----------
you know it sort of makes sense that


---------30:40----------
you'll sometimes be drawn to other


---------30:42----------
people with trauma but just be careful


---------30:44----------
about that relationship you know


---------30:46----------
recognize that that's going to be


---------30:48----------
something that could be hard for you and


---------30:49----------
could be hard for the other person and


---------30:51----------
that it's going to take a lot of like


---------30:52----------
perseverance and compassion for that


---------30:54----------
relationship to really work


---------30:58----------
okay


---------30:59----------
to be fair most relationships in general


---------31:01----------
don't last that's very true right so i


---------31:03----------
think there are a lot of caveats to what


---------31:05----------
i'm saying i just wanted to kind of


---------31:06----------
comment on this phenomenon that i've


---------31:09----------
observed


---------31:10----------
that sometimes people who are broken are


---------31:12----------
attracted to other people who are broken


---------31:14----------
and they can feel like a real and


---------31:16----------
genuine connection in that way whether


---------31:19----------
that's a good thing or a bad thing


---------31:21----------
honestly like i don't know the data i've


---------31:23----------
seen both scenarios when it works out


---------31:25----------
it's actually like really amazing and


---------31:28----------
unfortunately most of the times it seems


---------31:30----------
like it doesn't work out great


---------31:32----------
trauma bond is serious absolutely right


---------31:35----------
so that's where i think it's important


---------31:36----------
to remember that like you can bond with


---------31:39----------
someone who's


---------31:40----------
had a trauma


---------31:42----------
without muddying that relationship with


---------31:45----------
some kind of romance or sexuality right


---------31:47----------
like you can absolutely form a healthy


---------31:49----------
trauma bond and that's what we see in in


---------31:51----------
treatment right people will like get


---------31:53----------
really close to each other in recovery


---------31:55----------
is a good example of like very very


---------31:57----------
powerful bonds that are formed because


---------31:59----------
people are like walking a journey


---------32:01----------
together that's difficult


---------32:03----------
and sometimes they'll screw up that bond


---------32:06----------
by like


---------32:08----------
contaminating it with other


---------32:09----------
relationships like going into business


---------32:11----------
together or romance


---------32:15----------
um


---------32:18----------
okay


---------32:19----------
so let's move on


---------32:21----------
so next up


---------32:22----------
we have


---------32:26----------
um


---------32:28----------
hold on


---------32:29----------
did i yeah


---------32:32----------
so next up we have migno


---------32:42----------
i don't know exactly how to pronounce


---------32:43----------
her name juan migno


---------32:45----------
so she's actually one of my favorite


---------32:47----------
characters in the game


---------32:49----------
in squid game so she's like super


---------32:51----------
friendly right smiles a lot she like


---------32:53----------
figures out what the power dynamic is


---------32:55----------
and goes for the gangster she um her


---------32:59----------
her relationships tend to like turn on a


---------33:01----------
dime so she'll be like super into


---------33:03----------
someone one second and she'll be like


---------33:04----------
not into them the next second she's also


---------33:06----------
like quite manipulative and she's also


---------33:09----------
hypersexual so she's like willing to


---------33:10----------
have sex at the drop of a hat


---------33:13----------
and so i don't know if you guys have a


---------33:15----------
have a guess for this


---------33:17----------
but i think she is unfortunately um the


---------33:20----------
classic media portrayal of a a woman


---------33:23----------
with borderline personality disorder


---------33:25----------
so this is something that i think is


---------33:27----------
actually like really unfortunate in


---------33:29----------
media portrayals but when people like


---------33:32----------
try to demonstrate borderline


---------33:34----------
personality disorder they always make it


---------33:36----------
a woman and there is evidence that women


---------33:38----------
are more likely to be diagnosed with


---------33:40----------
borderline personality disorder than men


---------33:42----------
but i do think basically it's like it's


---------33:45----------
part of it's propagating something that


---------33:47----------
may be statistically true but sometimes


---------33:50----------
i find it to be sort of like a harmful


---------33:51----------
stereotype


---------33:53----------
so a lot of shows will or movies will


---------33:55----------
have like kind of this idea of the crazy


---------33:57----------
ex-girlfriend


---------33:58----------
and that person will have features of


---------34:01----------
borderline personality disorder so bpd


---------34:04----------
is characterized by a pattern of


---------34:05----------
unstable relationships mood fluctuations


---------34:09----------
like somewhat manipulative behavior in


---------34:11----------
the psychological defense mechanism


---------34:13----------
called splitting


---------34:14----------
so we're going to talk about splitting


---------34:16----------
for a second so people with bpd the core


---------34:18----------
problem here is that they their sense of


---------34:21----------
self like other traumatic illnesses so


---------34:24----------
some people who


---------34:25----------
experience trauma early in life will


---------34:28----------
develop something like bpd so you can


---------34:30----------
have kind of attachment issues you can


---------34:31----------
have ptsd you can have complex ptsd you


---------34:34----------
can have bpd you can also have like


---------34:37----------
light versions of all of these things so


---------34:40----------
sometimes as psychiatrists we won't


---------34:42----------
diagnose someone with a disorder but


---------34:44----------
they sort of have


---------34:45----------
what we'll call a borderline personality


---------34:47----------
structure or organization so it's not


---------34:50----------
that this person really has an impaired


---------34:52----------
function like they can function normally


---------34:53----------
in life but they kind of have the


---------34:55----------
psychology psychological vulnerabilities


---------34:58----------
that someone with bpd has


---------35:01----------
so these people


---------35:02----------
to other people they feel very


---------35:04----------
manipulative and what's going on here


---------35:07----------
the core issue with bpd is that


---------35:10----------
these people


---------35:11----------
someone with bpd's identity and i'm


---------35:14----------
oversimplifying here okay so you guys


---------35:15----------
have to take this with a grain of salt


---------35:17----------
who they are is determined by how


---------35:20----------
they're treated so if i'm treated with


---------35:22----------
love and respect i have a lot of self or


---------35:25----------
esteem but if i'm treated like crap i


---------35:28----------
will feel very very worthless and so


---------35:30----------
this may be true to a certain degree of


---------35:32----------
all people right like if i get bullied


---------35:34----------
by my entire school like i'm gonna feel


---------35:36----------
like crap and if i get treated like the


---------35:38----------
best thing since sliced bread by my


---------35:40----------
entire school i will feel really amazing


---------35:43----------
right i'll feel like egotistical and


---------35:44----------
i'll feel great about myself so this is


---------35:46----------
a common element of like human


---------35:48----------
psychology but with bpd people they're


---------35:50----------
very very sensitive to it so you know


---------35:53----------
they will feel amazing one day and and


---------35:56----------
like the next day if people like are


---------35:58----------
slightly like if they don't if someone


---------35:59----------
doesn't answer their texts texts or you


---------36:02----------
know people don't like respond to them


---------36:04----------
the way that they kind of want to be


---------36:05----------
responded to their mood can really


---------36:07----------
really crash so this sort of results in


---------36:09----------
mood fluctuations they're not bipolar


---------36:12----------
like a lot of times people with bpd will


---------36:14----------
like be diagnosed or think that they're


---------36:16----------
bipolar because their mood fluctuates


---------36:18----------
very very rapidly but their mood is


---------36:20----------
heavily influenced by the way that


---------36:22----------
they're treated


---------36:23----------
they also end up being manipulative but


---------36:25----------
i don't think that a lot of this is like


---------36:27----------
conscious manipulation what these people


---------36:29----------
have sort of learned from like the way


---------36:31----------
they've evolved and adapted is that if i


---------36:34----------
feel loved like i'll you know if i can


---------36:37----------
get someone to express


---------36:39----------
love towards me


---------36:40----------
i will feel loved and i will be someone


---------36:43----------
who is worth loving so their identity is


---------36:45----------
determined by the way that people treat


---------36:47----------
them and so what that sort of results in


---------36:49----------
is like a lot of like manipulative


---------36:50----------
behavior so if i'm feeling unloved on a


---------36:53----------
given day


---------36:54----------
i may express thoughts of suicide or i


---------36:57----------
may like express thoughts of like you


---------37:00----------
know i'll do things that will will make


---------37:02----------
people care about me right so i'll kind


---------37:05----------
of like you know i'll do things that


---------37:06----------
kind of evoke in other people like a


---------37:08----------
desire to like take care of me and love


---------37:11----------
me and like treat me with like you know


---------37:13----------
like kid gloves and hug me and protect


---------37:15----------
me and all that kind of stuff so what


---------37:17----------
these people will do is that that


---------37:19----------
um i think a lot of people who are in


---------37:21----------
relationships not necessarily romantic


---------37:22----------
relationships but with people uh with


---------37:25----------
with bpd


---------37:26----------
is they'll feel like


---------37:27----------
stuck and emotionally manipulated into


---------37:31----------
kind of loving someone so we'll also see


---------37:33----------
this with like parent-child


---------37:34----------
relationships where parents who have bpd


---------37:38----------
will like


---------37:39----------
sort of emotionally hold their children


---------37:41----------
hostage so if you're in a relationship


---------37:43----------
with someone with like a borderline


---------37:45----------
organization what that person feels like


---------37:47----------
is what i would call an emotional


---------37:49----------
hostage because if you try to pull away


---------37:51----------
from them if you try to like set


---------37:53----------
boundaries with them if you start to be


---------37:55----------
unavailable to them they'll escalate


---------37:57----------
very rapidly and like force you into


---------38:00----------
caring about them and not leaving and


---------38:02----------
not taking a break we also see this in


---------38:04----------
some unfortunate cases with with


---------38:06----------
treaters


---------38:08----------
who when they go on vacation like the


---------38:10----------
person kind of falls apart or the the


---------38:12----------
psychiatrist or therapist will feel like


---------38:14----------
if i go on vacation this person is going


---------38:16----------
to like get hospitalized or may try to


---------38:18----------
commit suicide so unfortunately people


---------38:20----------
with bpd will sometimes hold people


---------38:22----------
emotionally hostage and that's where


---------38:24----------
that kind of manipulation comes from


---------38:26----------
um there's also a lot of like splitting


---------38:28----------
going on so what this means is that


---------38:31----------
if they're interacting with some people


---------38:33----------
they will love some people and hate some


---------38:35----------
people so we'll see that you know for


---------38:36----------
example the person with borderline


---------38:38----------
personality disorder who's hospitalized


---------38:40----------
so these are people who are at the


---------38:41----------
lowest of their lows so we don't we try


---------38:43----------
not to judge them for this because it's


---------38:45----------
sort of not their fault they're under a


---------38:46----------
lot of stress what they'll do is they'll


---------38:48----------
like either love the doctor and hate the


---------38:50----------
nurse or they'll hate the doctor and


---------38:52----------
love the nurse and so what they tend to


---------38:54----------
do is like create kind of social strife


---------38:57----------
by


---------38:58----------
kind of idealizing some people and


---------39:01----------
really like viewing other people very


---------39:02----------
negatively so we'll also see this in in


---------39:05----------
other social situations where like


---------39:07----------
they'll think that one person is is like


---------39:09----------
you know amazing and perfect and awesome


---------39:11----------
and everyone else is like terrible and


---------39:13----------
crappy or things like that


---------39:16----------
so that's splitting so they basically


---------39:17----------
think very black and white about their


---------39:19----------
relationships


---------39:21----------
and what this kind of results in when


---------39:22----------
you have these high mood fluctuations


---------39:24----------
when you're very like sensitive


---------39:26----------
to


---------39:27----------
other people's opinions of you when you


---------39:29----------
kind of hold people emotionally hostage


---------39:31----------
when you try to manipulate people into


---------39:34----------
treating you a particular way or not


---------39:36----------
abandoning you right so a lot of times


---------39:38----------
people with bpd will have a fear of


---------39:39----------
abandonment and we kind of see that in


---------39:42----------
mino in the way that she works with like


---------39:44----------
the gangster where she's like promise me


---------39:46----------
that you'll never leave me promise me


---------39:47----------
that you'll go through this so people


---------39:49----------
with bpd will oftentimes like try to


---------39:51----------
extract promises of fidelity from other


---------39:53----------
people


---------39:54----------
and they'll kind of like you know try to


---------39:55----------
guilt-trip you because you promised you


---------39:57----------
promised you promised i gave you


---------39:58----------
everything that you wanted please love


---------40:00----------
me please don't ever leave me there's


---------40:02----------
kind of this fear of abandonment and


---------40:04----------
what it does is it it kind of drives


---------40:06----------
people like a little bit crazy so it can


---------40:08----------
be really hard to be on the other end of


---------40:11----------
that relationship


---------40:12----------
and so what that results in is very


---------40:14----------
unstable relationships so people with


---------40:16----------
bpd in unfortunate cases will kind of


---------40:19----------
use sexuality to feel loved um they'll


---------40:23----------
like love and hate very quickly and


---------40:24----------
they'll sort of result in like unstable


---------40:26----------
relationships so she's kind of a good


---------40:29----------
example of sort of the worst


---------40:30----------
characteristics of people with bpd


---------40:33----------
one thing i think it's another important


---------40:35----------
disclaimer to toss out here that she's


---------40:37----------
kind of like


---------40:39----------
um


---------40:40----------
kind of a textbook or a fictional case


---------40:42----------
of like the worst aspects of bpd the


---------40:44----------
good news is that


---------40:46----------
i've also worked with a lot of


---------40:47----------
borderline personality disorder folks


---------40:50----------
i actually really really enjoy working


---------40:52----------
with them it's some of the most


---------40:53----------
gratifying work that i've ever done


---------40:55----------
and i think they respond really really


---------40:57----------
well to some like eastern principles of


---------41:00----------
like discovering who you truly are


---------41:02----------
um the best evidence-based treatment of


---------41:04----------
bpd in my opinion is dialectical


---------41:06----------
behavioral therapy which has a large


---------41:08----------
component of like mindfulness and like


---------41:10----------
discovering who you are


---------41:12----------
um so the good news is that you know if


---------41:14----------
you have bpd in real life you're not


---------41:16----------
you're not like her this is what i think


---------41:17----------
is really unfortunate about media


---------41:19----------
portrayals of bpd is they like make them


---------41:22----------
seem so imp unsympathetic and then if


---------41:24----------
you're like oh my god i'm this kind of


---------41:26----------
person like you're not this kind of


---------41:27----------
person she's like an absolute fictional


---------41:30----------
version of bpd and the real truth is


---------41:33----------
that like people who have a borderline


---------41:35----------
organization or people who have bpd are


---------41:38----------
actually like wonderful awesome people


---------41:40----------
they can be like wonderful people who


---------41:42----------
just have these kinds of vulnerabilities


---------41:44----------
and tendencies


---------41:45----------
but with help and support and patience


---------41:48----------
they can like you know they don't have


---------41:49----------
to give in to those tendencies they can


---------41:51----------
actually conquer it and there are


---------41:53----------
studies that have been done that have


---------41:54----------
shown that essentially like bpd can be


---------41:56----------
like


---------41:57----------
uh you know with good treatment and


---------41:59----------
stable relationships someone who acts


---------42:02----------
this way in a year or two can actually


---------42:05----------
no longer meet criteria for bpd the


---------42:08----------
behaviors kind of go away um you know


---------42:11----------
not necessarily completely but they're


---------42:12----------
like no longer pathologic


---------42:15----------
so that's her


---------42:16----------
next up


---------42:17----------
we have uh


---------42:19----------
doksu


---------42:20----------
[Laughter]


---------42:24----------
who's like our gangster right so he like


---------42:26----------
backstabs people


---------42:28----------
he's a criminal he's dominating like he


---------42:31----------
doesn't really mind killing people


---------42:33----------
um you know he's kind of like the first


---------42:36----------
villain in the show and so if we kind of


---------42:38----------
go to our you know what's his diagnosis


---------42:41----------
hopefully you guys can get this one but


---------42:43----------
it's sociopathy


---------42:45----------
so oh so he's a great example


---------42:48----------
of um


---------42:50----------
what i would call a low functioning


---------42:52----------
sociopath


---------42:53----------
so this is where we got to talk a little


---------42:55----------
bit about sociopathy so sociopathy is


---------42:57----------
sort of characterized by like a lack of


---------43:00----------
empathy


---------43:01----------
for other human beings


---------43:03----------
so what this kind of means is that they


---------43:04----------
don't like you know we have most human


---------43:07----------
beings have sort of this internal moral


---------43:09----------
compass


---------43:10----------
that helps us understand like what is


---------43:12----------
right and what is wrong and people who


---------43:14----------
are on the anti-social personality


---------43:17----------
disorder spectrum um which is also like


---------43:19----------
sociopathy the terms i'm going to use


---------43:21----------
them interchangeably


---------43:23----------
basically like don't have that internal


---------43:26----------
sense or the internal sense is not as


---------43:28----------
strong as as it is in other people so


---------43:31----------
sociopathy is also a spectrum so much


---------43:34----------
like uh bpd you know there are some


---------43:36----------
people who are like very far on the


---------43:38----------
bottom end of the spectrum and are


---------43:39----------
highly sociopathic and then on the other


---------43:41----------
end of the spectrum are people who are


---------43:43----------
very empathic and not sociopathic at all


---------43:46----------
and so people who are kind of like at


---------43:48----------
the bottom end of the spectrum or maybe


---------43:49----------
the high end of the spectrum if you're


---------43:50----------
talking about sociopathy as a positive


---------43:52----------
variable


---------43:53----------
um you know people who are very


---------43:54----------
sociopathic let's put it that way are


---------43:57----------
people who like don't lack empathy and


---------43:58----------
then like will do like cruel things to


---------44:01----------
other people so


---------44:02----------
uh sociopathy in childhood is caught


---------44:05----------
called conduct disorder and like some of


---------44:07----------
the you know more diagnostic features of


---------44:10----------
conduct disorder are things like


---------44:12----------
torturing animals and like setting fire


---------44:14----------
to things so people who are high on the


---------44:16----------
sociopathy spectrum or kids with conduct


---------44:19----------
disorder you know will will sort of not


---------44:21----------
respect property they won't respect


---------44:23----------
other people they'll sometimes inflict


---------44:25----------
harm on other people conduct disorder


---------44:27----------
isn't necessarily sociopathy though a


---------44:29----------
lot of times that also has to do with a


---------44:31----------
traumatic upbringing


---------44:33----------
um but sociopathy is sort of


---------44:35----------
characterized by a lack of empathy and


---------44:37----------
is like generally speaking the


---------44:39----------
traditional villain so most villains in


---------44:42----------
tv shows and movies and things like that


---------44:44----------
tend to be sociopaths there's an


---------44:46----------
important um point to understand about


---------44:49----------
sociopathy research which is that a lot


---------44:51----------
of the sociopathy research comes from


---------44:53----------
prisons so like people who have what i


---------44:56----------
would call low functioning sociopathy


---------44:58----------
tend to wind up being criminals


---------45:00----------
and so i think honestly sociopathy in a


---------45:03----------
weird way kind of gets a bad name


---------45:05----------
because most of the research is not done


---------45:08----------
on normal people who have sociopathic


---------45:10----------
characteristics it's actually done on


---------45:12----------
criminals so when we think about


---------45:14----------
sociopathy we're sort of studying like


---------45:16----------
the worst sociopaths and generalizing


---------45:19----------
things about sociopathy


---------45:21----------
so


---------45:23----------
this is where


---------45:24----------
if you really look at it like there are


---------45:26----------
a lot of


---------45:27----------
professions that


---------45:29----------
where people are like highly functional


---------45:31----------
and can live normal lives


---------45:33----------
and some of these professions will


---------45:35----------
correlate with higher amounts of


---------45:36----------
sociopathy we're not talking like at the


---------45:38----------
super high levels


---------45:40----------
where it really kind of becomes a


---------45:41----------
disorder


---------45:43----------
but if you look at things like


---------45:44----------
executives even if you look at things


---------45:46----------
like uh professions like sometimes


---------45:48----------
surgeons or psychiatrists sometimes they


---------45:51----------
can actually test highly on the


---------45:52----------
sociopathy scale compared to the normal


---------45:54----------
population and the reason for that is


---------45:56----------
that these professions require


---------45:59----------
some amount of like emotional numbness


---------46:01----------
right like if you


---------46:03----------
um are a psychiatrist and like you have


---------46:06----------
patients that are committing suicide


---------46:07----------
because like that's the population you


---------46:09----------
work with right like that sort of what i


---------46:12----------
mean that's just what's going to happen


---------46:13----------
if you're a psychiatrist and you work


---------46:15----------
with like the sickest populations that


---------46:17----------
have the highest chance of suicide then


---------46:20----------
you are going to be dealing emotionally


---------46:21----------
with a lot of suicide as a result you


---------46:24----------
have to learn how to numb your emotions


---------46:26----------
to kind of survive in those sorts of


---------46:28----------
situations


---------46:29----------
ceos kind of also have to do this sort


---------46:31----------
of thing right like if you have to lay


---------46:33----------
off a thousand workers


---------46:35----------
it's protective or adaptive to be like a


---------46:37----------
little bit callous at heart


---------46:40----------
the other thing to remember is that


---------46:41----------
sociopathy is like a part of


---------46:44----------
human evolution right so these people


---------46:45----------
exist and if they exist there must be


---------46:48----------
some kind of adaptive advantage to it


---------46:50----------
and we kind of see that in in in uh


---------46:53----------
squid game because like this person


---------46:55----------
really excels in this competitive


---------46:57----------
cutthroat environment so this is also


---------46:59----------
where you'll see um people with like


---------47:01----------
high sociopathy sort of excel in


---------47:03----------
particular environments so he also you


---------47:05----------
know is isn't worried about killing


---------47:07----------
people he doesn't really demonstrate


---------47:10----------
remorse he forms alliances not out of


---------47:13----------
care or support or anything like that


---------47:15----------
all of his alliances form out of


---------47:17----------
self-gain


---------47:18----------
and so he's also kind of like this


---------47:20----------
classic demonstration of like a male


---------47:22----------
sociopath so this is also where we have


---------47:24----------
to toss in another disclaimer which is


---------47:26----------
like if you get diagnosed with


---------47:28----------
sociopathy it does not mean you are this


---------47:30----------
person right this is a caricature he's a


---------47:32----------
fictional representation he's like socio


---------47:35----------
the worst characteristics of sociopathy


---------47:37----------
like embodied within a fictional


---------47:40----------
character


---------47:41----------
this is also where generally speaking


---------47:44----------
in media portrayals you'll have women


---------47:46----------
who get


---------47:48----------
women's tend to exemplify the worst


---------47:50----------
characteristics of bpd


---------47:52----------
and men tend to exemplify the worst


---------47:54----------
characteristics of sociopathy


---------47:58----------
so next up


---------48:00----------
we've got


---------48:01----------
geon


---------48:03----------
[Music]


---------48:07----------
so this is a dude who's kind of quiet


---------48:09----------
um doesn't really form a whole lot of


---------48:12----------
very close connections he's kind of like


---------48:14----------
he's not quite afk but he's like kind of


---------48:17----------
like neutral he's going to try to win um


---------48:20----------
you know you can kind of see i think


---------48:22----------
they do a really good job of showing and


---------48:23----------
not telling here where like you know the


---------48:26----------
main character gihon is so happy to see


---------48:29----------
um


---------48:31----------
uh


---------48:32----------
sorry this is uh


---------48:35----------
so uh


---------48:37----------
seng wu is is smart he's successful um


---------48:40----------
he's uh


---------48:41----------
you know he's in finance


---------48:43----------
he got into some kind of problem with


---------48:45----------
like fraud and embezzlement he's sort of


---------48:47----------
desperate he's kind of image conscious


---------48:49----------
he winds up being you know i guess the


---------48:52----------
second villain


---------48:53----------
and i think they do a really good job of


---------48:56----------
um


---------48:57----------
catching a lot with his facial


---------48:58----------
expressions whereas like gihon is like


---------49:00----------
very genuine and wants to be friends and


---------49:02----------
like wants to work together and sengwoo


---------49:05----------
is kind of like holding back a little


---------49:06----------
bit right he he works together out of


---------49:09----------
uh he forms alliances also out of self


---------49:12----------
gain


---------49:13----------
and there's the episode where


---------49:15----------
he kind of has the the idea of like the


---------49:17----------
sugar game and like you know what we're


---------49:19----------
gonna have to do


---------49:21----------
um and he's sort of he remembers that in


---------49:23----------
the sugar game like okay like you should


---------49:25----------
have an easy shape right so but instead


---------49:28----------
of like sharing this information with


---------49:30----------
his team he actually goes ahead and like


---------49:32----------
says hey we should split up so he


---------49:34----------
actually subtly tries to sandbag and


---------49:36----------
kind of actually get gehun killed right


---------49:38----------
so he


---------49:39----------
his diagnosis is actually sociopathy as


---------49:42----------
well


---------49:42----------
so he's a good example of what i would


---------49:44----------
call a high functioning sociopath


---------49:47----------
so this is where


---------49:48----------
like i kind of said that if you look in


---------49:50----------
some industries people test highly on


---------49:52----------
the sociopathy scale


---------49:54----------
and so he feels some degree of of


---------49:56----------
empathy right he's not completely like


---------49:58----------
cold hearted and and numb he does some


---------50:01----------
amount of caring but he actually shares


---------50:03----------
a lot of features with the the gangster


---------50:06----------
right he's gonna like kind of throw


---------50:07----------
people under the bus he's gonna go for


---------50:10----------
himself first


---------50:11----------
he's going to try to form alliances for


---------50:14----------
self gain he's very competitive he's


---------50:17----------
sort of immoral and has this ends


---------50:19----------
justifies the means kind of attitude i'm


---------50:22----------
going to do whatever it takes to win um


---------50:25----------
he'll sort of throw people under the bus


---------50:28----------
and frankly i've seen a lot of this in


---------50:30----------
finance so when you work in investment


---------50:32----------
banking and private equity unfortunately


---------50:35----------
there's a lot of like cut throatness to


---------50:37----------
it right some people are kind of


---------50:39----------
cutthroat they're gunners we actually i


---------50:41----------
also see this in medicine and doctors


---------50:43----------
can sometimes test higher on the


---------50:45----------
sociopathy scale than the average person


---------50:50----------
so in medical school you'll have some


---------50:52----------
students who are like gunners like


---------50:53----------
they're going to be number one and if


---------50:55----------
they have to leave a trail of like you


---------50:57----------
know failing medical students behind


---------50:59----------
them they're willing to do that they're


---------51:01----------
the kind of people that will ask for


---------51:03----------
notes but if you ask them they'll be


---------51:05----------
like sorry i don't have them and they'll


---------51:07----------
actually lie to your face they'll also


---------51:09----------
do things like throw people under the


---------51:11----------
bus so we'll see this kind of in in you


---------51:14----------
know different kinds of work


---------51:15----------
environments you may know people


---------51:18----------
at work who will be the first to claim


---------51:20----------
credit but they're like hyper


---------51:22----------
competitive and they'll kind of throw


---------51:23----------
you under the bus if you do something


---------51:24----------
wrong


---------51:25----------
so i think this is a better example of


---------51:27----------
what i call kind of high functioning


---------51:29----------
sociopathy so these are people who are


---------51:31----------
less empathic or kind of highly


---------51:33----------
competitive and we can see how


---------51:34----------
sociopathic characteristics can result


---------51:37----------
in like you know people


---------51:39----------
succeeding in the world


---------51:41----------
right and we can also remember that


---------51:43----------
saying woo despite being the top of his


---------51:45----------
class and the pride of his his like


---------51:48----------
neighborhood


---------51:49----------
went to uh you know nationals


---------51:52----------
uh seoul university or whatever nsu is


---------51:56----------
and then


---------51:56----------
rose in finance was super successful and


---------51:59----------
then got into selling fraud and


---------52:00----------
embezzlement kind of stuff right and so


---------52:02----------
if we look at the industry of finance


---------52:04----------
like no one's that surprised that people


---------52:06----------
in finance are doing like shady stuff


---------52:08----------
right you can look at like the gamestop


---------52:10----------
stuff the gme stuff uh citadel


---------52:13----------
securities and robin hood and like


---------52:14----------
people are just doing shady stuff in


---------52:16----------
finance people did shady stuff in


---------52:18----------
finance and enron they did shady stuff


---------52:20----------
in 2007 2008 and so like a lot of people


---------52:23----------
like there are some industries where


---------52:25----------
these high functioning people who are


---------52:27----------
sort of higher on the sociopathic scale


---------52:29----------
but are actually really smart and don't


---------52:31----------
wind up in jail where you find these


---------52:33----------
people


---------52:34----------
so he's kind of an example of a high


---------52:36----------
functioning sociopath the good news is


---------52:38----------
that they do feel empathy right and


---------52:39----------
sengwu isn't all evil he's not like the


---------52:42----------
gangster and i've also worked with a lot


---------52:44----------
of sociopaths who do feel empathy want


---------52:46----------
to try to be good people and they can


---------52:48----------
actually be like very good people i


---------52:49----------
think he is also a negative portrayal of


---------52:51----------
it where when you kind of when you put


---------52:54----------
him into the pressure


---------52:56----------
of a life and death situation he's going


---------52:58----------
to choose himself first and they do a


---------53:00----------
good job if you watch his like facial


---------53:02----------
expressions of like between the first


---------53:04----------
episode and the last episode his


---------53:06----------
internal struggle and sometimes he helps


---------53:08----------
people and sometimes he doesn't right


---------53:10----------
and so they kind of do a good job of


---------53:12----------
that and if you're even if you're a


---------53:13----------
high-functioning sociopath i've worked


---------53:14----------
with a lot of a lot of them i mean they


---------53:16----------
don't really meet criteria for the


---------53:17----------
illness they're not really don't have


---------53:18----------
the disorder but they kind of have a low


---------53:21----------
empathy sort of enz justifies the means


---------53:23----------
kind of makeup right they're kind of


---------53:25----------
machiavellian


---------53:27----------
the good news is that they can actually


---------53:29----------
be very good people and can like care


---------53:31----------
for other people as well


---------53:34----------
so next up


---------53:35----------
we've got o ilnam


---------53:40----------
so this is the other guy who sort of


---------53:42----------
turns out to be the villain right so


---------53:44----------
he's like he's kind of got this weird


---------53:46----------
situation where


---------53:48----------
he apparently is very financially


---------53:50----------
successful


---------53:51----------
um


---------53:52----------
and he's got a brain tumor and his time


---------53:55----------
is running out


---------53:58----------
and he's a very likable and genuine guy


---------54:01----------
uh


---------54:02----------
you know like we all love him we're


---------54:04----------
rooting for him we feel compassion


---------54:06----------
towards him once again ganbu episode six


---------54:10----------
is like the episode where like


---------54:12----------
you know he gets taken advantage of and


---------54:14----------
it's like the highest amount of feels in


---------54:15----------
the show i think it's clearly like the


---------54:17----------
best episode in the show


---------54:20----------
and so he kind of comments that people


---------54:22----------
without money and tons of money are the


---------54:24----------
ones that like kind of feel empty inside


---------54:26----------
and he's decided to orchestrate the


---------54:28----------
squid game to try to feel alive right


---------54:31----------
which sounds super super screwed up


---------54:34----------
so what's his diagnosis so he certainly


---------54:36----------
has features of sociopathy but this is


---------54:39----------
where i'm gonna actually go ahead oh


---------54:42----------
i'm gonna go ahead and


---------54:44----------
debate y'all a little bit and then i'm


---------54:45----------
gonna add something else


---------54:48----------
so i'm gonna add what i call buddha


---------54:50----------
syndrome


---------54:51----------
and this is what i'd say this guy really


---------54:53----------
exemplifies


---------54:55----------
so buddhist syndrome


---------54:56----------
is something that the reason i call it


---------54:58----------
that is because it was actually


---------54:59----------
characterized like by buddha


---------55:02----------
so buddha was a guy who had everything


---------55:04----------
and ended up feeling empty and unhappy


---------55:07----------
right so he was loved he was respected


---------55:09----------
he was powerful he was wealthy and then


---------55:11----------
he kind of


---------55:12----------
wakes up one day and sort of like feels


---------55:14----------
empty inside and he's like this does not


---------55:16----------
bring me happiness


---------55:18----------
so he sacrifices everything he gives


---------55:20----------
everything up um you know so it takes a


---------55:22----------
slightly different approach from o'il


---------55:24----------
nam who oil nom is like in order to feel


---------55:26----------
alive i'm gonna create the squid game


---------55:28----------
and like you know fight for my life and


---------55:31----------
if you guys even look at like red light


---------55:33----------
green light you can see oil nom really


---------55:35----------
enjoys the games right he longs to feel


---------55:40----------
uh


---------55:41----------
alive in some way and so he like goes


---------55:43----------
back to his childhood and stuff like


---------55:44----------
that to try to recapture some sense of


---------55:46----------
happiness before he became rich and


---------55:48----------
before he became successful and before


---------55:51----------
he started to feel empty


---------55:53----------
and so buddha sort of described this and


---------55:55----------
what would the sort of discovered is


---------55:56----------
that like no amount of money will


---------55:59----------
necessarily buy happiness and i think


---------56:01----------
there are some issues with that but what


---------56:04----------
buddha basically discovered is that like


---------56:06----------
suffering and contentment doesn't have


---------56:08----------
to do with material things now there's


---------56:10----------
some scientific research that kind of


---------56:12----------
opposes this right so if you look at


---------56:14----------
research on happiness for example that


---------56:16----------
like


---------56:17----------
happiness does correlate with material


---------56:20----------
security for sure up to a particular


---------56:22----------
point


---------56:23----------
so my personal take trying to reconcile


---------56:25----------
buddha's approach which i think there's


---------56:26----------
a lot of wisdom to


---------56:28----------
and science is that money is necessary


---------56:31----------
but not sufficient for happiness


---------56:33----------
so money will protect you


---------56:35----------
from um


---------56:37----------
you know feeling despair on some level


---------56:39----------
and feeling insecurity and can protect


---------56:42----------
you from stress


---------56:43----------
but it is not sufficient to be happy


---------56:46----------
and success and being like you know rich


---------56:49----------
in life can actually result in feeling


---------56:51----------
empty and this is something that we see


---------56:54----------
a lot within celebrities right so like


---------56:56----------
we'll see this in twitch streamers we'll


---------56:57----------
see it in celebrities we'll even see it


---------56:59----------
in trust fund babies which is like these


---------57:01----------
people seem to have everything and yet


---------57:03----------
they're not happy


---------57:05----------
and this is where personally i feel like


---------57:07----------
a little bit frustrated because it's


---------57:09----------
been my experience i've had you know


---------57:11----------
rich and privileged patients who commit


---------57:13----------
suicide um and i've had you know poor


---------57:17----------
and and like


---------57:18----------
uh you know persecuted patients commit


---------57:20----------
suicide and the sad truth is that i


---------57:23----------
think somewhere along the way as a


---------57:24----------
society we've stopped being


---------57:27----------
compassionate towards people who have


---------57:29----------
privilege and i think that there are


---------57:31----------
some good reasons for this right like


---------57:32----------
like it's not like we should devote all


---------57:34----------
of our compassion towards people who are


---------57:36----------
lucky or rich or beautiful


---------57:40----------
i do think that we should try to devote


---------57:42----------
you know a lot of our resources in our


---------57:44----------
care and our compassion in a lopsided


---------57:47----------
manner towards people who have it worse


---------57:49----------
off than people who are lucky or rich or


---------57:52----------
successful


---------57:53----------
but i i do think it's like fundamentally


---------57:55----------
wrong that we don't demonstrate


---------57:57----------
compassion towards like people who are


---------57:59----------
suffering in any way shape or form


---------58:02----------
and this is where you know as the


---------58:03----------
internet or as society we tend to have


---------58:06----------
like a very like um


---------58:09----------
love-hate relationship towards people


---------58:11----------
who are celebrities right so like a good


---------58:13----------
example of this is when robin williams


---------58:15----------
commits suicide like the whole world is


---------58:17----------
there for him but when a lot of uh


---------58:20----------
celebrities complain about being


---------58:22----------
depressed


---------58:23----------
like


---------58:24----------
like the internet will jump down their


---------58:25----------
throat they'll be like why are you


---------58:27----------
depressed what do you have to complain


---------58:28----------
of for you're so privileged you're so


---------58:30----------
attractive you're so rich you have


---------58:32----------
nothing to complain about right


---------58:34----------
um


---------58:35----------
you know it's kind of interesting but


---------58:37----------
and i i just personally like i don't


---------58:39----------
agree with that i think that as human


---------58:40----------
beings like we all deserve compassion


---------58:42----------
and is privilege a part of the equation


---------58:45----------
absolutely like i'm not saying that we


---------58:46----------
should you know prioritize everyone the


---------58:49----------
same amount


---------58:50----------
but i do think that it's kind of unfair


---------58:52----------
that like just because someone has


---------58:54----------
privilege that we sort of


---------58:56----------
allow ourselves as a society to actually


---------58:59----------
like attack them it's not just a lack of


---------59:01----------
compassion we don't treat them


---------59:03----------
you know neutrally right like what we


---------59:04----------
actually do is attack them and then it


---------59:06----------
puts them in a very interesting


---------59:08----------
situation unfortunate situation and you


---------59:11----------
guys will have seen this when we talk to


---------59:13----------
streamers is they're not allowed to


---------59:15----------
complain


---------59:16----------
and like i think one of the most


---------59:17----------
devastating things one of the most


---------59:19----------
isolating and lonely things that you can


---------59:21----------
do to someone


---------59:22----------
is not allow them to complain and not


---------59:25----------
allow them to like open themselves up


---------59:27----------
for support from other people and it's


---------59:29----------
super kind of sad and i think this is


---------59:30----------
where actually our community and twitch


---------59:32----------
has been really fantastic where you know


---------59:34----------
there are super privileged people who


---------59:36----------
have come on our stream and have shared


---------59:39----------
with the world that like their life is


---------59:40----------
not perfect and i i really love this


---------59:42----------
community because this community rises


---------59:45----------
above the judgmentalness of the internet


---------59:47----------
and we treat people like the way they


---------59:48----------
deserve to be treated right we look past


---------59:51----------
hatred we look past political


---------59:53----------
differences we look past wealth and


---------59:56----------
power and beauty and we can treat people


---------59:58----------
with compassion and i think if we


---------60:00----------
genuinely want to make the world a


---------60:02----------
better place crapping on people who are


---------60:04----------
lucky is like not the right way to move


---------60:06----------
to move uh do it


---------60:09----------
so he at the end of the day has what i


---------60:11----------
would call buddha syndrome which is that


---------60:13----------
when you're privileged you start to feel


---------60:15----------
empty in life and i much prefer buddha's


---------60:18----------
method of kind of resolving that which


---------60:20----------
is to um you know seek like the true


---------60:23----------
meaning of happiness through like


---------60:25----------
introspection and meditation and


---------60:26----------
exploration as opposed to create a game


---------60:29----------
where people have to kill each other to


---------60:30----------
survive


---------60:31----------
um you know i think there's also a theme


---------60:33----------
that is kind of lived out in saw as well


---------60:36----------
if you guys have seen the saw movies


---------60:38----------
where he's like trying to help people


---------60:40----------
discover life through like


---------60:42----------
you know


---------60:43----------
trying to kill them which i don't think


---------60:45----------
is a good thing to do


---------60:46----------
so we're gonna go ahead and pause for a


---------60:49----------
second um


---------60:50----------
and uh


---------60:52----------
you know so this has been sort of like


---------60:54----------
my exploration of squid game i think


---------60:57----------
it's a wonderful tv show it's super hype


---------61:00----------
um


---------61:01----------
and i think it actually does a really


---------61:03----------
good job of portraying


---------61:05----------
uh


---------61:06----------
you know


---------61:08----------
caricatures of mental illness so i do


---------61:10----------
think that you know if you watch these


---------61:12----------
things like i don't want y'all if you


---------61:13----------
guys don't understand these diagnoses


---------61:15----------
and haven't met people like this i don't


---------61:17----------
want you to walk away from this thinking


---------61:19----------
oh like


---------61:20----------
this is what sociopathy looks like this


---------61:22----------
is what ppd looks like this is what


---------61:23----------
addiction looks like they do a good job


---------61:25----------
of portraying it but remember that real


---------61:27----------
humans who suffer from these problems


---------61:30----------
are very very complex and have like a


---------61:32----------
lot more to them than what the show


---------61:34----------
portrays


---------61:35----------
at the same time i think the show does a


---------61:37----------
good job of showing like how good people


---------61:40----------
and bad people can struggle with like


---------61:41----------
mental health issues i think the show is


---------61:43----------
a beautiful exploration of trauma


---------61:46----------
because it shows like how trauma can


---------61:48----------
manifest in so many different ways and i


---------61:50----------
like it because i think they're doing a


---------61:52----------
good job of like de-stigma hopefully


---------61:54----------
destigmatizing mental illness now you


---------61:56----------
can absolutely make the argument that


---------61:58----------
what they're also doing is stigmatizing


---------62:00----------
mental illness which i think is probably


---------62:01----------
somewhat true especially when it comes


---------62:04----------
to things like bpd and sociopathy


---------62:06----------
so you know i i hope to part of the


---------62:08----------
reason that i'm sort of sharing this


---------62:10----------
with you all is because i thought it was


---------62:11----------
really interesting i think it's cool


---------62:13----------
that


---------62:13----------
um media is starting to really


---------62:15----------
incorporate like aspects of mental


---------62:17----------
illness into into their portrayals of


---------62:19----------
these stories i think that mental


---------62:21----------
illness is on the rise and like 30 to 50


---------62:23----------
percent of people suffer from something


---------62:25----------
or other


---------62:27----------
and um you know i think it's really neat


---------62:29----------
that like they do this


---------62:30----------
one of the things that i'm super curious


---------62:32----------
about is like how they do this like is


---------62:34----------
this something that they consulted like


---------62:36----------
a psychiatrist or a psychologist for or


---------62:39----------
is it just within the consciousness of


---------62:41----------
the people and of society that like


---------62:43----------
people know that this kind of stuff


---------62:45----------
exists and trauma can affect people in


---------62:47----------
these ways which i think would be super


---------62:48----------
cool


---------62:49----------
i did have one teacher um i didn't have


---------62:52----------
like a really close relationship with


---------62:53----------
them but there was one teacher at


---------62:54----------
harvard medical school a psychiatrist


---------62:56----------
who like consulted for tv shows and


---------62:58----------
stuff like that


---------62:59----------
and um so i i do know that that happens


---------63:02----------
so i think it's kind of neat that you


---------63:03----------
know shows are kind of exemplifying this


---------63:07----------
um


---------63:09----------
so


---------63:09----------
questions that y'all have there are a


---------63:11----------
couple of characters that i didn't get


---------63:12----------
to but frankly i'm kind of tired


---------63:20----------
if you guys want to we can do one or two


---------63:22----------
more but


---------63:26----------
yeah so in its defense i think the show


---------63:28----------
is based on a large number of people who


---------63:30----------
have done bad things absolutely so


---------63:31----------
that's a great point so remember that


---------63:33----------
this is a show that's like demonstrating


---------63:35----------
people under huge amounts of stress and


---------63:38----------
the way that i think about you know


---------63:40----------
mental illness and especially


---------63:41----------
personality disorders is that these


---------63:43----------
people can be completely normal


---------63:45----------
but when you put them under periods of


---------63:47----------
high amounts of stress some of these


---------63:49----------
deeper vulnerabilities get exposed


---------63:52----------
right like the internal weaknesses when


---------63:54----------
you're put under pressure is like when


---------63:56----------
you crack and based on your


---------63:58----------
personality organization structure it


---------64:01----------
determines the way in which you crack


---------64:05----------
ah so ali so i wasn't i can talk about


---------64:08----------
ali quickly so this ali is kind of


---------64:10----------
interesting um so the two people that i


---------64:13----------
didn't talk to


---------64:14----------
is the hyper religious guy


---------64:18----------
[Laughter]


---------64:22----------
so i think ali is a good example of what


---------64:25----------
i would call like cultural conditioning


---------64:27----------
so if you look at ali he um


---------64:30----------
has you know he like values himself less


---------64:32----------
than other people so he keeps on


---------64:34----------
addressing other people as sir he


---------64:36----------
doesn't like need respect from other


---------64:38----------
people he kind of like gets bullied by


---------64:41----------
other people right like he kind of like


---------64:43----------
is a doormat


---------64:44----------
and this is kind of interesting but i


---------64:46----------
think this is absolutely like cultural


---------64:48----------
conditioning


---------64:49----------
so the unfortunate truth is that in


---------64:51----------
india and


---------64:53----------
not just india but in india i understand


---------64:55----------
it really well


---------64:56----------
you know there used to be a caste system


---------64:58----------
where there still is a caste system it


---------65:00----------
used to be worse it's gotten better but


---------65:01----------
it's still very present


---------65:03----------
and so like people are taught like the


---------65:05----------
idea that all human beings are equal is


---------65:08----------
not something that


---------65:10----------
the average indian


---------65:12----------
at least 30 years ago grew up with


---------65:14----------
there's like a tier of quality of human


---------65:17----------
right so there's like a


---------65:19----------
a caste system and like some castes are


---------65:21----------
better than others


---------65:22----------
and you'll see this in india where


---------65:23----------
there's like the servant class and then


---------65:25----------
there's like the


---------65:26----------
the wealthy class now those are the


---------65:28----------
biggest things


---------65:30----------
and so you know you'll have one


---------65:31----------
household that has like five people


---------65:34----------
living there and then they'll have like


---------65:36----------
eight to nine servants and the servants


---------65:38----------
get paid you know very very little


---------65:40----------
amounts of money like they don't aspire


---------65:42----------
too much and everyone just sort of


---------65:43----------
accepts that


---------65:45----------
that you know like the servants will eat


---------65:47----------
in a different way i think downton abbey


---------65:49----------
is like another good example of like a


---------65:50----------
class


---------65:51----------
based representation of society right


---------65:54----------
and some people in downton abbey are


---------65:55----------
like uppity and they want to be better


---------65:57----------
than what they're what they are and some


---------66:00----------
people like think that that's really bad


---------66:03----------
so um i think it's it's basically


---------66:05----------
cultural conditioning and he's probably


---------66:07----------
like a low-caste person which is what


---------66:09----------
you tend to see so a lot of these like


---------66:11----------
low-caste people are forced to like


---------66:13----------
leave the country to look for work


---------66:15----------
elsewhere because they don't have good


---------66:17----------
prospects in their home country he's


---------66:19----------
actually not indian i think ali is


---------66:21----------
pakistani so i think in the in the


---------66:23----------
indian subcontinent you'll see in south


---------66:25----------
asia you'll see this i assume in


---------66:27----------
pakistan i just don't have a whole lot


---------66:28----------
of experience which is why i'm talking


---------66:29----------
about india you'll see it in bangladesh


---------66:31----------
too so there's a lot of for example


---------66:34----------
you know


---------66:35----------
workers that will leave the indian


---------66:37----------
subcontinent and will go to the uae


---------66:40----------
we'll go to the mena region we'll


---------66:42----------
emigrate to i guess korea and stuff like


---------66:44----------
that they're basically looking for a


---------66:46----------
better life um it's something that you


---------66:48----------
know my family did so my parents


---------66:50----------
emigrated from india and came to the


---------66:52----------
united states looking for a better life


---------66:55----------
i they were uh generally speaking higher


---------66:57----------
caste people so their ambition and their


---------67:00----------
self-respect like they understood as


---------67:02----------
human beings that they were like sort of


---------67:04----------
entitled to some amount of like success


---------67:07----------
and fair play and i think that was like


---------67:09----------
a big part of like why they emigrated


---------67:11----------
and why they became doctors and stuff


---------67:12----------
like that


---------67:14----------
and it's also where sometimes i think


---------67:16----------
it's a little bit unfortunate that


---------67:18----------
um you know when we try to look at


---------67:20----------
equality we tend to look at race which i


---------67:23----------
don't think necessarily is a bad thing


---------67:24----------
but i think there are shortcomings and i


---------67:27----------
remember uh just sharing one example i'm


---------67:29----------
not saying that we shouldn't try to have


---------67:31----------
racial equality so hopefully this won't


---------67:33----------
taken out get taken out of context but i


---------67:35----------
just want to share one example with


---------67:36----------
y'all


---------67:37----------
so um when you are south asian and you


---------67:41----------
take the medical college admissions test


---------67:44----------
in the united states


---------67:45----------
in order to to be


---------67:47----------
um


---------67:48----------
competitive you basically have to score


---------67:50----------
two points higher or what used to be two


---------67:52----------
points or maybe like 10 to 20 percent


---------67:54----------
higher


---------67:55----------
than the average applicant to have a


---------67:57----------
chance to get in so like you know the


---------67:59----------
deck is actually stacked against you if


---------68:01----------
you're south asian


---------68:03----------
so that i think sort of makes sense


---------68:04----------
because in the united states you know


---------68:07----------
you have like tons of like indian


---------68:08----------
doctors right and like you because the


---------68:11----------
people who emigrated most of the people


---------68:13----------
who came to the united states were


---------68:15----------
successful and prioritize academics so


---------68:18----------
for example like i had certain


---------68:19----------
advantages like my parents could pay for


---------68:22----------
like uh medical college admissions test


---------68:24----------
prep course right so i've got like some


---------68:26----------
systemic advantages which sort of


---------68:28----------
explain why on average like we do better


---------68:31----------
and also like the medical colleges are


---------68:33----------
trying to like not have you know 50


---------68:35----------
classes who are south asian so they sort


---------68:38----------
of like will treat south asians slightly


---------68:39----------
differently


---------68:41----------
i think the downside is that


---------68:43----------
unfortunately medical schools sort of


---------68:45----------
don't


---------68:47----------
recognize or don't have the


---------68:48----------
sophistication to account for like poor


---------68:51----------
indian people


---------68:52----------
so if you think about the indian sub


---------68:54----------
continent most of them are not didn't


---------68:56----------
grow up with the privilege that i grew


---------68:58----------
up with so i was uh basically a mentor


---------69:01----------
to a low caste indian kid a dalit


---------69:05----------
was the cast that they were in


---------69:07----------
from like south india and like


---------69:09----------
he was screwed like he had none of the


---------69:12----------
advantages that i had his parents were


---------69:14----------
poor um his mom and dad were both like


---------69:17----------
cleaning people at a hotel where they


---------69:21----------
worked


---------69:22----------
illegally for less than minimum wage and


---------69:25----------
they were actually like


---------69:27----------
victims of i think a predatory hiring


---------69:29----------
practice of like higher caste indian


---------69:31----------
people so they came to the u.s to give


---------69:34----------
opportunities for their son and they got


---------69:35----------
paid like three dollars a day plus like


---------69:38----------
room and food and and so they were


---------69:40----------
actually victims and like the dulleth


---------69:42----------
kid that i was advising like had none of


---------69:44----------
the advantages that i had but when it


---------69:46----------
comes to medical college admissions like


---------69:48----------
he checks a particular box and when he


---------69:50----------
shows up for an interview he's actually


---------69:52----------
playing with the same disadvantage that


---------69:54----------
i am so i don't actually begrudge the


---------69:57----------
disadvantage that i dealt with because


---------69:59----------
at the end of the day i still got into


---------70:01----------
medical school even though the deck is


---------70:02----------
stacked against me and that's because i


---------70:04----------
think it sort of balances out i think


---------70:06----------
unfortunately the dollar kid i mean that


---------70:09----------
kid was kind of screwed right so he gets


---------70:11----------
judged based on the color of his skin


---------70:13----------
and gets like plays at a disadvantage so


---------70:15----------
i hope that


---------70:17----------
as we really start to move towards like


---------70:20----------
more sophisticated


---------70:22----------
avenues of equality like i would love it


---------70:24----------
if society could give that kid a break


---------70:27----------
that he deserves


---------70:29----------
but going back to ali i think that ali


---------70:31----------
is just a good example of this kind of


---------70:32----------
cultural conditioning of like different


---------70:35----------
castes and different


---------70:36----------
um


---------70:38----------
you know different like a class oriented


---------70:41----------
conditioning


---------70:43----------
so


---------70:45----------
what's wrong with the caste system so


---------70:47----------
i'm not necessarily saying that the


---------70:49----------
whole ca uh


---------70:50----------
i don't know enough about the cast


---------70:52----------
system to say that it's blanketly wrong


---------70:55----------
um but i do believe that it is unfair


---------70:58----------
so i think it's like unfair when some


---------71:00----------
people grow up and are in a situation


---------71:03----------
where they like


---------71:05----------
basically are trapped


---------71:06----------
right they don't have resources they


---------71:08----------
don't have education their parents


---------71:10----------
aren't educated their parents don't


---------71:12----------
emphasize education their parents can't


---------71:14----------
earn money


---------71:15----------
um


---------71:18----------
i think that that's unfair


---------71:20----------
like i think it's unfair that some


---------71:21----------
people


---------71:22----------
are born with so many advantages and


---------71:24----------
like


---------71:25----------
i don't think that it's good for a


---------71:28----------
cultural system


---------71:30----------
to propagate inequality


---------71:33----------
and my understanding of the caste system


---------71:35----------
is that it does propagate inequality now


---------71:38----------
if you say that the cul the caste system


---------71:40----------
does not propagate inequality then i'll


---------71:43----------
accept that because i'm not an expert in


---------71:44----------
the cast system i'm a psychiatrist i'm


---------71:46----------
not a sociologist i didn't grow up in


---------71:48----------
india


---------71:48----------
right so i understand some stuff about


---------71:50----------
caste


---------71:51----------
but that's as a second generation


---------71:53----------
immigrant who grew up in east texas


---------71:56----------
so if people are going to make arguments


---------71:58----------
that the caste system is good like by


---------71:59----------
all means make those arguments and i'm


---------72:01----------
happy to listen i'm not saying i'm right


---------72:03----------
it's just my opinion and it's not


---------72:05----------
something i'm an expert in


---------72:07----------
but i do think it's like


---------72:09----------
i think like how can i say this when i


---------72:11----------
look at the dull and that's why i


---------72:13----------
mentored him right so like i tried to do


---------72:15----------
what i could to like fix it


---------72:17----------
which is gonna be like hey bro like


---------72:19----------
let me help you because


---------72:21----------
i understand this stuff and i was given


---------72:23----------
opportunities to learn


---------72:25----------
so what i think that what i think is


---------72:27----------
unfair is that i mean like we're not you


---------72:29----------
know we're not even playing in the same


---------72:31----------
game like it's like


---------72:32----------
he's playing on ping like a ping of 400


---------72:35----------
and i'm playing on like a ping of 20 and


---------72:37----------
we're competing


---------72:39----------
and you know medical schools are going


---------72:41----------
to look at us


---------72:42----------
not the same because i think medical


---------72:44----------
schools are you know people try they try


---------72:46----------
to not they on the one hand they sort of


---------72:48----------
judge people by the color of the skin


---------72:50----------
but on the other hand they also try to


---------72:51----------
recognize that like their socioeconomic


---------72:53----------
status so i personally think that


---------72:55----------
socioeconomic status is is a better


---------72:58----------
way to try to like balance things i


---------73:00----------
think it's just harder right


---------73:03----------
um but i i do think that i would like a


---------73:06----------
world where


---------73:08----------
the discrepancy between the advantages


---------73:10----------
that i was given and my dull at the


---------73:12----------
mentee were given


---------73:14----------
were less i think i think it's unfair to


---------73:16----------
him and it's my understanding and this


---------73:19----------
could be wrong that a lot of that is


---------73:20----------
propagated by cast


---------73:22----------
and if you say otherwise then by all


---------73:24----------
means


---------73:26----------
you know


---------73:29----------
tell me i'm wrong and explain it to me


---------73:31----------
if someone i would love if someone could


---------73:33----------
post a little bit if you guys think that


---------73:35----------
the cast system is good


---------73:36----------
and is helpful i'd love to see a


---------73:38----------
subreddit post about it


---------73:45----------
um so you said money is necessary but


---------73:47----------
not sufficient for happiness what is


---------73:48----------
sufficient for happiness i think


---------73:50----------
detachment


---------73:52----------
so


---------73:53----------
um devoting yourself to detachment is


---------73:55----------
the key to happiness


---------73:57----------
i think that's what buddha basically


---------73:58----------
discovered is that when people develop


---------74:01----------
detachment from expectations


---------74:05----------
and focus on the present like so it's a


---------74:08----------
present focus


---------74:09----------
devoting yourself to the action in terms


---------74:12----------
as opposed to the outcomes of your


---------74:13----------
actions and detachment i think that's


---------74:15----------
the formula for happiness


---------74:17----------
and i feel really confident about this


---------74:19----------
because i've taken people who are


---------74:20----------
miserable and i've taught them this and


---------74:22----------
they become happier


---------74:25----------
right so i'll get like ceos who are very


---------74:27----------
rich and they'll come to me and they'll


---------74:29----------
say hey


---------74:30----------
i'm unhappy can you help me and i'll say


---------74:32----------
sure


---------74:33----------
they'll say i'm depressed then i'll talk


---------74:35----------
to them i'll do a thorough diagnostic


---------74:37----------
interview where i ask them 60 questions


---------74:40----------
then i'll say you're not depressed


---------74:41----------
you're unhappy


---------74:42----------
they're like wait what what do i do


---------74:44----------
about that i'll be like let me show you


---------74:46----------
indians are in tech and doctors because


---------74:48----------
decades of diligence standing on the


---------74:49----------
shoulders of their parents sacrifices i


---------74:51----------
agree completely


---------74:53----------
right so i stand on the shoulders of my


---------74:55----------
parents everything that i am is due to


---------74:57----------
their sacrifice


---------74:59----------
so i want you guys to understand like


---------75:00----------
people look at me like i'm something


---------75:02----------
amazing i want you all to understand


---------75:04----------
that i grew up in a household with two


---------75:06----------
loving parents and i had the luxury of


---------75:08----------
spending seven years training to become


---------75:10----------
a monk without having to really worry


---------75:12----------
about paying my bills


---------75:13----------
do you guys realize how op of a start


---------75:16----------
that is


---------75:17----------
like it's one of the most op starts you


---------75:20----------
can have


---------75:21----------
and so it's my belief that if you're


---------75:22----------
someone who's born with privilege


---------75:24----------
i can still suffer by the way so i'd


---------75:26----------
appreciate some compassion when time


---------75:28----------
life is rough for me


---------75:30----------
but i believe it is my responsibility to


---------75:33----------
like take my spawn and then like build


---------75:36----------
alliances with other people who had less


---------75:40----------
advantageous spawns


---------75:42----------
right because we're in this game


---------75:43----------
together it's co-op so if i have a


---------75:45----------
really good spawn it's my job to help


---------75:48----------
people who like didn't have as good of a


---------75:49----------
spawn to even things out because that's


---------75:51----------
the only way it's going to work


---------75:53----------
actually that's not necessarily true


---------75:54----------
it's my solution so i tend to focus on


---------75:56----------
helping people directly there are lots


---------75:59----------
of people out there who will propose


---------76:00----------
political solutions passing laws


---------76:03----------
advocacy all of those things are great


---------76:04----------
too it's just not what i specialize in


---------76:07----------
so i don't know how to get a law passed


---------76:10----------
and it's my experience that you know


---------76:12----------
some of those systems like need


---------76:13----------
improvement and like the way the sausage


---------76:16----------
is made is just too complicated so i


---------76:18----------
prefer to just help i'm just going to


---------76:20----------
mentor the bella kid instead of like


---------76:22----------
lobby my congressman


---------76:24----------
not saying it's the right way it's just


---------76:26----------
what i know how to do and it's how it's


---------76:28----------
what i it's my advantage i didn't go to


---------76:30----------
law school i went to med school


---------76:33----------
so simple solution seems to be look at


---------76:35----------
income rather than ethnicity


---------76:38----------
so


---------76:40----------
here's the thing if there was a simple


---------76:42----------
solution i think someone would have


---------76:45----------
figured it out so my experience of


---------76:47----------
solving inequality


---------76:49----------
is that


---------76:50----------
a simple solution is not going to work


---------76:53----------
right like if you really look at for


---------76:55----------
example like becoming healthy


---------76:57----------
is not easy it's a multi-factorial


---------76:59----------
solution it involves exercise it


---------77:02----------
involves diet it involves meditation it


---------77:04----------
may involve coaching it may involve


---------77:06----------
therapy it may involve watching youtube


---------77:08----------
streams it may involve having um


---------77:12----------
you know a yard where you can garden it


---------77:15----------
may involve having a pet


---------77:17----------
right so having a pet correlates with


---------77:19----------
like increased life expectancy and


---------77:21----------
better mental health


---------77:22----------
so to say that


---------77:24----------
the solution to mental health problems


---------77:26----------
is just to send everyone to therapy


---------77:28----------
it may seem like a simple solution


---------77:30----------
because that's the treatment for mental


---------77:31----------
illness so like let's just send everyone


---------77:33----------
to therapy i disagree


---------77:35----------
i think the solution to mental illness


---------77:38----------
may involve therapy but it may also


---------77:39----------
involve like


---------77:41----------
getting people pets if they want one


---------77:44----------
improving social connections helping


---------77:45----------
people get off of social media


---------77:47----------
um helping people exercise helping


---------77:50----------
people like support each other


---------77:52----------
uh doing things like group coaching


---------77:53----------
where like people can learn their value


---------77:55----------
their internal sense of self-worth i


---------77:57----------
think that there's a lot of answers to


---------77:58----------
it


---------78:00----------
why is it not clearly wrong i assume


---------78:02----------
you're talking about the caste system


---------78:03----------
the short answer is i don't know


---------78:05----------
like i'm ignorant of the caste system


---------78:07----------
i'm not an expert in the caste system so


---------78:09----------
i know this sounds kind of weird


---------78:11----------
but i think a lot of people on the


---------78:12----------
internet will judge things that they


---------78:14----------
don't understand


---------78:16----------
like most people will judge things that


---------78:18----------
they don't understand so i've seen this


---------78:20----------
a lot like people will


---------78:22----------
you know this is done in kruger


---------78:24----------
101. that the more ignorant you are of


---------78:27----------
something the more simple it seems and


---------78:29----------
the quicker you are to like have an


---------78:31----------
answer


---------78:33----------
i think honestly if you look at a


---------78:35----------
website like reddit or twitter what most


---------78:37----------
people should say is i don't know like


---------78:39----------
if people were if you were actually if


---------78:42----------
the correlation between opinions and


---------78:44----------
like understanding things


---------78:46----------
was one in one 90 of twitter would be


---------78:48----------
people saying i don't know i don't know


---------78:50----------
i don't know i don't know because most


---------78:51----------
people don't know things


---------78:53----------
we're happy to have opinions about


---------78:54----------
things


---------78:55----------
it's the way our brain is wired our


---------78:57----------
brain is wired to construct the illusion


---------78:59----------
of certainty out of ignorance that's


---------79:01----------
what it does


---------79:03----------
so the reason that i don't think it's


---------79:05----------
clearly wrong is just because i don't


---------79:06----------
understand it like i like i said i think


---------79:08----------
it's wrong


---------79:10----------
but


---------79:10----------
i haven't done a thorough study of the


---------79:12----------
caste system and its advantages we may


---------79:14----------
discover that it has advantages


---------79:17----------
i do think that there's a lot of stuff


---------79:19----------
between eastern and western stuff where


---------79:21----------
western people think that they are right


---------79:24----------
whereas i disagree with that so like a


---------79:25----------
good example of that is that


---------79:28----------
in the west the individual is considered


---------79:30----------
more important than the community


---------79:32----------
so for example like you'll have


---------79:34----------
people advising each other that if you


---------79:37----------
have


---------79:38----------
it's like okay to cut off your parents


---------79:40----------
and never allow them to see your kids


---------79:42----------
because there's no such thing as


---------79:44----------
grandparents rights


---------79:45----------
right and i understand that perspective


---------79:47----------
like i get it


---------79:49----------
but in the east they value the community


---------79:51----------
over the individual and they do think


---------79:53----------
that there are things such as


---------79:54----------
grandparents rights


---------79:55----------
and all of society or at least western


---------79:57----------
society will think that like that is


---------79:59----------
objectively wrong that the parents


---------80:00----------
rights supersede the grandparents rights


---------80:03----------
i think it's just a difference of values


---------80:04----------
i don't think it's objectively wrong


---------80:06----------
it's also the side that i fall on right


---------80:08----------
so i kind of agree with that but i think


---------80:09----------
that's a good example of like


---------80:12----------
you know i don't think that there's an


---------80:13----------
objective right or wrong there i think


---------80:14----------
different societies have different value


---------80:16----------
systems and i try my best to not assume


---------80:19----------
that the value systems that i hold are


---------80:21----------
objectively correct because overwhelming


---------80:24----------
research demonstrates that for example


---------80:27----------
most of the real most of the humans in


---------80:30----------
the history of humanity do not believe


---------80:32----------
their religion after a thorough and


---------80:34----------
critical analysis of all of the


---------80:36----------
religions and then picking one


---------80:38----------
most human beings believe their religion


---------80:40----------
because that's what they were exposed to


---------80:42----------
so human beings also confuse


---------80:47----------
objective correctness with the value


---------80:49----------
system that they grew up in


---------81:00----------
you
