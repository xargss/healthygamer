---------00:00----------
so what are we what are we calling you


---------00:02----------
today buddy how am i how Michael Milo is


---------00:05----------
my name okay so Milo tell me a little


---------00:08----------
bit about what we're talking about today


---------00:11----------
um well I am a huge fan of yours and I


---------00:21----------
just wanted to bounce kind of my ego off


---------00:28----------
of you and see if you have anything to


---------00:30----------
say pretty much as soon as I started


---------00:33----------
like as soon as you popped up in my


---------00:37----------
recommended videos on YouTube you just


---------00:42----------
everything he was saying was really


---------00:43----------
resonating with me and it's really


---------00:46----------
surreal that like it's coming to the


---------00:48----------
point where I'm actually talking with


---------00:49----------
you so I guess we can talk about


---------00:57----------
cannabis addiction and how I'm dealing


---------01:00----------
with that that goes a lot in that's kind


---------01:05----------
of wrapped up with a lot of my other


---------01:09----------
vices and and kind of issues with


---------01:13----------
depression and and mental illness and


---------01:16----------
such sure it's all kind of a big it's a


---------01:19----------
big [ __ ] tangled ball of yeah yeah


---------01:23----------
I'm inside shits do yeah it really is


---------01:26----------
man I'm so sorry that you know you're


---------01:28----------
struggling with a lot of stuff that's


---------01:29----------
the way I see it I mean I think you know


---------01:31----------
if I can just monologue or soapbox for a


---------01:35----------
second I like this is what I see right


---------01:37----------
so and I think this is where psychiatry


---------01:38----------
actually Falls a little bit short


---------01:40----------
because what psychiatry does is it takes


---------01:42----------
a person like you and we give you like


---------01:44----------
half a dozen diagnoses right we'll say


---------01:47----------
that you've got like a DD and you've got


---------01:49----------
anxiety and depression and and cannabis


---------01:52----------
use disorder and and stuff like that but


---------01:54----------
I think then you know the more I work


---------01:57----------
with people like I just don't think that


---------01:58----------
they've got like four separate disease


---------02:00----------
processes random like it's like one it's


---------02:03----------
like one tangled ball of something and


---------02:06----------
then it kind of like likes like I almost


---------02:08----------
think that our psychic psychiatric


---------02:10----------
diagnoses are symptoms they're not


---------02:12----------
actually like


---------02:13----------
diseases I mean not yet of all things


---------02:15----------
but some of them really are disease


---------02:17----------
processes but yeah so I kind of echo


---------02:21----------
what you're saying about it sort of


---------02:23----------
being tangled together so let's try to


---------02:24----------
untangle it well the other thing is you


---------02:27----------
said you wanted to bounce your ego off


---------02:29----------
of me yeah


---------02:33----------
what does that mean oh you cut out a


---------02:36----------
little bit you hear me yeah I mean I


---------02:42----------
just want to have like here's somebody


---------02:47----------
else's especially professionals take on


---------02:55----------
[Music]


---------02:59----------
though hello can you hear me yeah can


---------03:03----------
you hear me yeah did the video cut out


---------03:05----------
for you nope I'm fine okay um I don't


---------03:12----------
know I mean like you know who I am who I


---------03:16----------
think I am was like just a persona okay


---------03:19----------
and it would be interesting to hear


---------03:27----------
somebody else's kind of professional


---------03:31----------
opinion on what I've got going on and


---------03:35----------
I've heard you you know call a lot of


---------03:37----------
other people out are on kind of [ __ ]


---------03:41----------
and like devices like you go I see


---------03:51----------
devices of sort so do you think actually


---------03:53----------
can you hold on a second I'm just gonna


---------03:54----------
shut a door I'll be right back


---------03:56----------
sure


---------03:56----------
[Music]


---------04:07----------
it's like night and day when kids are


---------04:10----------
back from the playground yeah so so okay


---------04:13----------
so I see so it sounds like you maybe


---------04:17----------
suspect that your ego is pretty active


---------04:23----------
yeah oh yes oh yeah so I'm gonna give


---------04:26----------
twitch chat and assignment


---------04:28----------
okay so we're so one of the things that


---------04:30----------
I want to think I want to try to teach


---------04:32----------
you guys is to be like present and pay


---------04:36----------
attention to what you see in other


---------04:38----------
people and what you'd see in yourselves


---------04:40----------
so I'm gonna point some of this stuff


---------04:41----------
out to you Milo but just so that can


---------04:43----------
kind of follow along I want you guys to


---------04:45----------
kind of pay attention to when you think


---------04:47----------
Milo's ego is speaking and when his ego


---------04:51----------
is not speaking so a quick rundown so


---------04:54----------
Milo since you use the word ego it


---------04:56----------
sounds like you've been watching our


---------04:57----------
stuff so what's your understanding of


---------04:59----------
what ego is let's start there it's the


---------05:06----------
thing that isn't your true self and it's


---------05:08----------
your you're kind of biologically and


---------05:14----------
socially cultivated organism that uses


---------05:21----------
survival techniques to stay alive


---------05:24----------
okay so what I want so I'm gonna give


---------05:28----------
you guys a couple of clues to notice


---------05:30----------
when the ego is running Milo's mind okay


---------05:33----------
and the first thing that we're gonna


---------05:35----------
look for is comparisons so when we


---------05:39----------
anytime our mind compares us to someone


---------05:41----------
else that's usually a sign of ego I mean


---------05:44----------
I say usually so you know if if if Milo


---------05:47----------
says something like oh other people are


---------05:50----------
able to do this but I'm not able to do


---------05:52----------
this that's like a comparison so keep an


---------05:54----------
eye out for ego anytime the other thing


---------05:57----------
that the ego tends to do is pump


---------05:59----------
ourselves up and put other people down


---------06:01----------
so I'm not really expecting this from


---------06:02----------
you but if you start to you know talk


---------06:06----------
about how other people are stupid or


---------06:08----------
things like that that's likely to be ego


---------06:10----------
does that make sense


---------06:13----------
mm-hmm okay so let's just kind of keep


---------06:16----------
track and if you guys notice the ego


---------06:18----------
is going on you know just mention it in


---------06:20----------
chat why let's say you know steer clear


---------06:22----------
of chat if you can during the duration


---------06:24----------
of our our talk yeah I'm not watching


---------06:27----------
you know okay awesome so let's let's


---------06:29----------
kind of dive right in


---------06:31----------
so tell me a little bit I mean you want


---------06:32----------
to start with cannabis or you mentioned


---------06:34----------
other vices or like where how do we


---------06:36----------
start to untangle this ball of of the


---------06:39----------
shits - well he started with video games


---------06:44----------
definitely tell me about yeah so like a


---------06:48----------
lot of people you talk to I was a user


---------06:53----------
video games for a really really young


---------06:55----------
age how young and probably like seven


---------07:02----------
okay and what did you play the first


---------07:06----------
game that I haven't really really got


---------07:10----------
into was a game called dungeon siege


---------07:14----------
which was like kind of a Diablo esque


---------07:19----------
top-down like action RPG thing and yeah


---------07:29----------
just kind of evolved there I played a


---------07:30----------
lot of Warcraft 3 throughout the years I


---------07:33----------
still play that one what do you think


---------07:36----------
about remastered it's pretty upsetting


---------07:41----------
yeah pretty dead ok yeah what's up


---------07:52----------
well to be honest like I'm really not


---------07:56----------
super concerned with Blizzard at all


---------08:01----------
anymore just because of how they treated


---------08:03----------
the whole protests in China thing so


---------08:11----------
it's shitty but I could be happy like


---------08:15----------
never hurt just again a blizzard product


---------08:18----------
again yeah yeah but I didn't get reforge


---------08:23----------
because I honestly don't even think my


---------08:25----------
computer could handle it is another


---------08:27----------
thing because I have a really shitty


---------08:29----------
computer but


---------08:31----------
just heard that the servers were


---------08:33----------
crashing all the time and had just a


---------08:36----------
myriad of other issues yeah yeah


---------08:40----------
do you still game now yeah what do you


---------08:44----------
play


---------08:45----------
Warcraft 3 I did work I thought they


---------08:49----------
shut it down the old one you know it's


---------08:52----------
like um yeah it's it still works


---------08:58----------
basically Oh interesting okay what race


---------09:00----------
Steve is just it's just like like a


---------09:03----------
limited it's the same game reforged in


---------09:05----------
the classic one mm-hmm


---------09:08----------
yeah what race or races do you play like


---------09:12----------
you play like regular games where you


---------09:13----------
play custom maps mostly custom maps but


---------09:17----------
when I am playing regular games I


---------09:19----------
usually pick work you know Blademaster


---------09:22----------
or TC awesome and I was a bigger than


---------09:27----------
dead player under the sickest book yeah


---------09:30----------
man I used to love going glitch first


---------09:32----------
but it wasn't very good I just wish I


---------09:35----------
heard enough but yeah cool yeah and I


---------09:39----------
played a lot of dota like back in the


---------09:40----------
day like one or three but the og yeah


---------09:44----------
the original mm-hmm so cool so and and


---------09:49----------
what are you how are you spending your


---------09:51----------
most of your time nowadays um well one


---------09:58----------
thing that's always been a huge passion


---------09:59----------
for me has been music and this kind of


---------10:04----------
so I've been kind of getting my [ __ ]


---------10:06----------
together lately


---------10:07----------
in a positive way um like as of maybe


---------10:12----------
like December or January 2020 and one


---------10:17----------
thing that's come with that is a huge


---------10:18----------
increase in my time spent playing guitar


---------10:25----------
and practicing music which has which has


---------10:27----------
always been like kind of sidelined by a


---------10:31----------
video game addiction and cannabis usage


---------10:36----------
as well sure which I helped me


---------10:39----------
understand what changed in December


---------10:42----------
January why are you getting your ship to


---------10:44----------
No um I read this book called atomic


---------10:49----------
habits mm-hmm I don't remember who it's


---------10:51----------
by


---------10:51----------
but don't ever write here and it just


---------11:00----------
kind of talked about how willpower is


---------11:05----------
overrated and and the real way to let


---------11:11----------
you talk it they broke down the science


---------11:13----------
of building good habits and breaking bad


---------11:18----------
habits and why we naturally build bad


---------11:22----------
habits and and don't stick with good


---------11:24----------
habits yeah and I just kind of took the


---------11:32----------
principles from that book and was able


---------11:34----------
to establish a pretty consistent so I've


---------11:41----------
been doing push-ups every day I've been


---------11:43----------
meditating every day Wow just about this


---------11:47----------
this year yeah and like I also I'm no


---------11:59----------
long I'm not a smoker anymore but that


---------12:05----------
was something that I stopped in about


---------12:07----------
September and I had like wanted to to no


---------12:14----------
longer be a can of a smoker for a long


---------12:19----------
time at that point I felt that it was


---------12:20----------
being really destructive on my life


---------12:22----------
how so I felt like it was just kind of


---------12:30----------
really messing with my mental faculties


---------12:33----------
in what way like have you heard the term


---------12:39----------
the brain fog yeah I fell just I felt


---------12:46----------
just incredibly mentally slow and like


---------12:50----------
dumber than I am and


---------12:56----------
I I try to not like identify this


---------13:00----------
identify with this anymore but my


---------13:06----------
intelligence has always been like a


---------13:08----------
really important part of my life you


---------13:13----------
know and I and I valued being smart or


---------13:16----------
whatever which i think is a school which


---------13:18----------
i think is a silly arbitrary thing at


---------13:19----------
this point but but it was one of the few


---------13:25----------
things that I thought I really had going


---------13:26----------
for me in cannabis was just seriously


---------13:33----------
missing yeah so Milo you're making my


---------13:35----------
job harder man you know why it's like


---------13:39----------
I've noticed this trend recently like I


---------13:41----------
don't know if other people have noticed


---------13:42----------
this but like people are like doing


---------13:45----------
better and and when we started streaming


---------13:49----------
we were getting absolute train wrecks


---------13:51----------
mm-hmm


---------13:52----------
and you talk about the shit's too but


---------13:54----------
here I'm talking about like so I thought


---------13:56----------
we were talking about cannabis addiction


---------13:58----------
sounds like you stop smoking pot like


---------13:59----------
six months ago yeah right and and we're


---------14:04----------
talking about you're talking about


---------14:05----------
atomic habits you're talking about


---------14:06----------
push-ups every day you're talking about


---------14:08----------
playing guitar which is awesome and I


---------14:14----------
love to continue supporting you it's


---------14:16----------
just I'm noticing like a trend and I'm


---------14:18----------
not just sure if it's like a selection


---------14:20----------
bias or what but it sounds like people


---------14:22----------
are actually starting to make changes in


---------14:24----------
their life and it sounds like you mean


---------14:26----------
people in your sphere like people that


---------14:29----------
you were talking to and people and stuff


---------14:31----------
yeah mm-hmm


---------14:33----------
what do you think about that I think


---------14:37----------
maybe you should take that as a sign


---------14:39----------
that you are making a huge impact in


---------14:42----------
people's lives I will I would love to


---------14:44----------
take that as a sign but it also sounds


---------14:46----------
like you started you your your journey


---------14:48----------
started before I ever showed up right


---------14:51----------
yeah certainly right so I'd love to take


---------14:54----------
credit for transforming your life but I


---------14:57----------
think actually at case-in-point for


---------14:59----------
everyone who's watching


---------14:59----------
I don't transform lives right so Milo's


---------15:01----------
been working at it for a while and maybe


---------15:03----------
we can talk a little bit more and


---------15:05----------
understand a little bit


---------15:06----------
but I I'm beginning to notice a slight


---------15:08----------
shift in terms of I'd certainly like to


---------15:11----------
help you I'm happy to but I think I'm


---------15:15----------
noticing that actually Milo you may be


---------15:18----------
able to so it used to be that like you


---------15:22----------
are the person getting healed and I was


---------15:24----------
the healer but I think you've leveled up


---------15:27----------
like you skilled up some healing skills


---------15:28----------
yourself right like because you're


---------15:30----------
already and you can actually help people


---------15:32----------
by telling us and sharing with us like


---------15:36----------
what was different one year ago and like


---------15:38----------
what's different today that I agree with


---------15:41----------
that and I would love to yeah to do that


---------15:43----------
so so let's just kind of keep that in


---------15:45----------
mind I think let's just take let's go


---------15:47----------
back though and try to understand a


---------15:48----------
little bit about more about cannabis but


---------15:52----------
I just wanted to kind of point out that


---------15:54----------
I think things are changing here you


---------15:56----------
know like yeah yeah I'm working on it


---------16:00----------
yeah good for you dude so tell me a


---------16:03----------
little bit about when you started using


---------16:05----------
pot um I think the first time was either


---------16:12----------
the summer of my freshman year of high


---------16:15----------
school or the summer before that I can't


---------16:21----------
remember okay and it was like a lot of


---------16:26----------
people say they don't get high the first


---------16:28----------
time mm-hmm because if your cannabinoid


---------16:30----------
receptors aren't totally awake or


---------16:33----------
something but that was not the case for


---------16:36----------
me and it was a super excellent


---------16:40----------
experience I enjoyed it a lot


---------16:43----------
and as I kind of slowly started to get


---------16:48----------
more into it I would do it maybe like


---------16:51----------
once a month my first couple years of


---------16:54----------
high school and then I increased a


---------16:57----------
little bit after high school and then


---------16:58----------
after I mean in my junior and senior


---------17:01----------
year and then after high school I really


---------17:02----------
started ramping it up but during high


---------17:05----------
school I really saw it as a tool to kind


---------17:12----------
of discover myself because at the time I


---------17:17----------
was really really


---------17:20----------
excuse me I was really wrapped up in


---------17:24----------
another popularity hierarchy sure and I


---------17:30----------
just wanted to like hang out with the


---------17:32----------
cool kids and I was so upset that you


---------17:34----------
know I wasn't like what are these kids


---------17:36----------
have that I don't that that makes them


---------17:38----------
you know cool popular and liked and we


---------17:42----------
not and smoking cannabis kind of helped


---------17:48----------
me like understand that like I'm okay


---------17:53----------
with myself and it's okay to to be to be


---------17:58----------
me and I don't need other people's


---------18:00----------
approval basically and Wow that that


---------18:04----------
helped me kind of in like my senior year


---------18:06----------
really really how does can't just enjoy


---------18:12----------
myself I'm not worrying about that kind


---------18:14----------
of thing how does cannabis help like


---------18:17----------
free you from those worries do you


---------18:19----------
remember that um I think it just it made


---------18:25----------
me super introspective and that


---------18:32----------
introspection brought a lot of insight


---------18:39----------
and I had always until it started like


---------18:44----------
really [ __ ] up my life I had always


---------18:46----------
really thought that cannabis was a very


---------18:50----------
useful tool in that way and I still do


---------18:52----------
think like I think for people who don't


---------18:55----------
have like addictive tendencies I think


---------19:00----------
it can be a very very it can be a tool


---------19:03----------
definitely how do you know if you have


---------19:05----------
addictive tendencies if if your


---------19:13----------
consumption of something is becomes


---------19:17----------
problematic and difficult to stop I


---------19:20----------
would say sure so would you say that you


---------19:22----------
had addictive tendencies in high school


---------19:24----------
not at all no I used it quite


---------19:32----------
infrequently and


---------19:33----------
it was always nothing but positive


---------19:35----------
during that time yeah okay


---------19:43----------
I'm just gonna try to organize things


---------19:46----------
for a second mm-hmm


---------19:49----------
so Milan once again I'm kind of


---------19:51----------
recalibrating a little bit about what


---------19:53----------
this discussion is so a lot of times


---------19:56----------
when people come here my primary goal is


---------19:58----------
to help them and if we're talking about


---------20:00----------
cannabis addiction and you haven't


---------20:02----------
really smoked for six months I'm sort of


---------20:05----------
changing a little bit about what we're


---------20:06----------
talking about right so I'm wondering if


---------20:09----------
what would be better is actually four so


---------20:12----------
I still want to help you we can kind of


---------20:13----------
talk more if there's something I mean is


---------20:15----------
there some kind of challenge or some


---------20:16----------
issue that you have that I can help with


---------20:23----------
well the cannabis addiction I don't know


---------20:30----------
if I said this earlier it completely


---------20:32----------
intertwined with my video game addiction


---------20:35----------
and just internet addiction and so on


---------20:39----------
[Music]


---------20:41----------
yeah and that's something that's like


---------20:43----------
quitting six months ago and like still


---------20:53----------
having a lot of the problems that I


---------20:55----------
thought that I like attributed to


---------20:58----------
cannabis consumption I realized that the


---------21:02----------
bigger problem was video game addiction


---------21:06----------
which was something that was a problem


---------21:08----------
long before I ever smoked for the first


---------21:12----------
time okay


---------21:17----------
all right so we're gonna talk about that


---------21:19----------
we're gonna talk about the rest of the


---------21:21----------
you know ingredients of the shits do and


---------21:24----------
then what I'd like to do maybe a little


---------21:26----------
bit more towards like let's say the end


---------21:28----------
is Milo since you've kind of come a long


---------21:31----------
way what I think could be useful is for


---------21:33----------
us to use some of your experiences is


---------21:38----------
kind of examples for broader principles


---------21:41----------
that are more applicable like more


---------21:45----------
broadly applicable so how can we


---------21:46----------
understand


---------21:47----------
general things about identity and ego


---------21:50----------
and like how cannabis interacts with


---------21:52----------
those for example you say that cannabis


---------21:54----------
made you more introspective when through


---------21:58----------
that introspective you gained insights


---------22:00----------
and through those insights you became


---------22:03----------
less concerned about popularity mm-hmm


---------22:06----------
the other interesting thing is I don't


---------22:07----------
know if people caught this or not but


---------22:08----------
you when you were describing your high


---------22:11----------
school experience that's an ego


---------22:12----------
experience because you asked yourself


---------22:14----------
the question why are those kids popular


---------22:17----------
and I am yeah totally so that's an ego


---------22:20----------
point now the interesting thing is that


---------22:22----------
you attribute your growth in that way


---------22:25----------
through the insight you gained from


---------22:28----------
cannabis I don't think it was actually


---------22:30----------
an insight that you gained from cannabis


---------22:32----------
because I don't know if you guys have


---------22:33----------
figured this out or not you have a lot


---------22:35----------
of insights when you're on cannabis but


---------22:37----------
rarely does your life change from them


---------22:39----------
right anyway your your what do you think


---------22:48----------
well I mean if I had an insight due to


---------22:52----------
the fact that I was on cannabis and it


---------22:54----------
changed my life which it did by making


---------22:58----------
me give less of a [ __ ] about the


---------23:00----------
popularity conflicts wouldn't that mean


---------23:02----------
that it was directly related to it would


---------23:07----------
suggest so but I think actually the


---------23:09----------
important thing is not the insight you


---------23:12----------
had I think the important thing this is


---------23:14----------
exactly what I'm talking about so I


---------23:15----------
think the important thing is that


---------23:16----------
instead of your mind focus on the


---------23:18----------
focusing on the external your mind began


---------23:21----------
focusing on the internal I don't think


---------23:23----------
it was the insight that you had I think


---------23:25----------
it was the introspection the act of


---------23:27----------
introspecting shifts what you're like


---------23:31----------
your mind is focusing on so I want you


---------23:33----------
to think about your mind like a


---------23:35----------
spotlight and when you're in high school


---------23:37----------
and you're comparing yourself to other


---------23:39----------
people you're putting the spotlight on


---------23:41----------
them and how you're not like them and


---------23:44----------
when you introspect you're putting the


---------23:47----------
spotlight on yourself and the more that


---------23:50----------
you put the spotlight on yourself the


---------23:52----------
less comparison naturally happens does


---------23:55----------
that make sense


---------23:56----------
like if I'm on an island and there's


---------23:58----------
nothing for me to compare myself to


---------24:01----------
it's very difficult for my ego to exist


---------24:03----------
because my mind cannot externalize and


---------24:05----------
make comparisons so this is exactly my


---------24:08----------
point is that I think a lot of people


---------24:09----------
believe that it's the insight from the


---------24:12----------
introspection but what I'm really


---------24:15----------
curious about and what I would encourage


---------24:16----------
you to explore is whether it is the


---------24:19----------
insight from introspection or it is the


---------24:21----------
act of introspection in and of itself


---------24:23----------
that reduces ego because if we look at


---------24:33----------
something like atomic habits I think the


---------24:35----------
reason that you're able to change is not


---------24:37----------
because you gain some information but


---------24:39----------
once again the the atomic habits book


---------24:42----------
was a trigger for you to introspect and


---------24:46----------
you may have gained some things through


---------24:48----------
that introspection but I think the key


---------24:50----------
thing here if we look at the common


---------24:51----------
element between how you've changed from


---------24:53----------
atomic habits and how you've changed


---------24:55----------
from cannabis you're gaining different


---------24:58----------
insights fine but the key element here


---------25:00----------
is that your focus is on reflection and


---------25:02----------
introspection and that's where the money


---------25:05----------
is that's my hypothesis that I'm putting


---------25:07----------
forward you're entitled to agree or


---------25:09----------
disagree but I I partially agree I think


---------25:14----------
that the external factor of a book or a


---------25:18----------
drug or whatever can be something to


---------25:22----------
direct that spotlight and I definitely


---------25:26----------
think that there's the potential to to


---------25:32----------
just look inwardly and change I think


---------25:36----------
that's kind of what like meditation


---------25:39----------
leads to but I'm not sure if it's I


---------25:44----------
think it's like like a sprinkler versus


---------25:49----------
a pressure washer way towards ways


---------25:54----------
directing your focus with like a book or


---------25:58----------
something or some kind of frame of


---------26:01----------
thought is more concentrated in a


---------26:04----------
pressure washer as opposed to just


---------26:07----------
sitting with yourself and being


---------26:10----------
introspective and like allowing


---------26:14----------
whatever thoughts to arise I completely


---------26:17----------
agree with you so I completely agree


---------26:19----------
with that you're saying that an external


---------26:22----------
tool can really focus your introspection


---------26:26----------
and allow you to gain greater insights


---------26:28----------
through that focused in introspection


---------26:30----------
that's what you're saying right yeah if


---------26:33----------
you just sit there and you just kind of


---------26:34----------
like listen to your thoughts that's like


---------26:38----------
a sprinkler and you're not gonna get


---------26:39----------
anything done I completely agree with


---------26:41----------
you the question still remains just


---------26:43----------
because it allows you to focus your


---------26:45----------
spotlight is it the drug itself or is it


---------26:48----------
the act of focusing internally which one


---------26:50----------
is responsible so I agree that the drug


---------26:53----------
allows you to focus internally more


---------26:56----------
easily but then the question becomes if


---------26:58----------
it's the focusing internally that's


---------27:00----------
actually important can you train


---------27:02----------
yourself can you take a sprinkler and


---------27:06----------
turn it into a garden hose and then


---------27:08----------
furthermore can you cover a part of the


---------27:10----------
garden hose so you have a high-pressure


---------27:12----------
amount of water right can you actually


---------27:15----------
train yourself to do what the drug does


---------27:17----------
for you I think with immense immense


---------27:27----------
concentration and dedication I


---------27:31----------
completely agree with you there as well


---------27:34----------
like the thing that comes to mind is I


---------27:40----------
think it was with destiny you were


---------27:42----------
talking about the analogy with


---------27:45----------
psychedelics of like taking a helicopter


---------27:48----------
to the top of a mountain rushes you know


---------27:53----------
just trekking up the whole mountain but


---------27:55----------
it's the same thing either way no I I


---------27:59----------
feel like the same analogy applies here


---------28:03----------
in terms of kind of one is without


---------28:08----------
external stimulus and there's a much


---------28:10----------
more long-term slow-moving laborious


---------28:16----------
process absolutely agree few hundred


---------28:20----------
hours that man so just kind of kind of


---------28:24----------
going back to your narrative or your


---------28:26----------
story so


---------28:27----------
sounds like marijuana was actually quite


---------28:29----------
helpful for you in a lot of ways it was


---------28:32----------
a overwhelmingly positive experience you


---------28:35----------
actually used it to free yourself a


---------28:37----------
little bit from your ego it made high


---------28:39----------
school to be like a little bit more


---------28:41----------
comfortable because you were less bogged


---------28:43----------
down and like popularity and stuff when


---------28:45----------
did it become a problem I really started


---------28:54----------
ramping up after senior year of high


---------28:59----------
school started smoking on a weekly basis


---------29:04----------
where before I was smoking you know


---------29:06----------
maybe on a monthly or even like a five


---------29:08----------
monthly basis mm-hmm and I also started


---------29:15----------
taking dabs which it's the so beer is to


---------29:23----------
liquor as like flower bud cannabis is to


---------29:28----------
Deb's


---------29:28----------
so it's a concentrated THC oil that is


---------29:33----------
incredibly like it will just [ __ ] your


---------29:36----------
[ __ ] up it's super powerful what way


---------29:40----------
does it [ __ ] your [ __ ] up so bud is like


---------29:47----------
maybe fifteen to twenty-five or thirty


---------29:51----------
percent THC in like just throughout the


---------29:56----------
nut that's the chemical percentage dads


---------30:01----------
can get up to like 80 percent 90 percent


---------30:04----------
95 even like 99 or 100 percent THC so


---------30:12----------
it's like super super potent and you're


---------30:15----------
also not getting any of the kind of


---------30:18----------
natural even though a lot of this has


---------30:22----------
been kind of bred out in the cannabis


---------30:24----------
industry you're not getting a lot of the


---------30:26----------
kind of CBD or some of the other


---------30:30----------
chemicals that may be kind of balance


---------30:33----------
balance out the eye a little bit so


---------30:39----------
I I don't know if this is what directly


---------30:44----------
led to it but I had a I had a mental


---------30:49----------
breakdown what was diagnosed as a manic


---------30:52----------
episode in college and before that was


---------30:57----------
happening I was basically staying up all


---------31:01----------
night playing video games and just


---------31:03----------
dabbing all day and doing not much else


---------31:07----------
not going to class at all did the people


---------31:11----------
who diagnosed you with the manic episode


---------31:13----------
know what was happening before that did


---------31:17----------
you tell like do they know that you were


---------31:19----------
using dabs very heavily I don't know


---------31:28----------
okay I don't know yeah it could totally


---------31:32----------
be some some cannabis induced psychosis


---------31:38----------
which is which is part of the reason


---------31:40----------
that I sometimes doubt my diagnosis yeah


---------31:43----------
so Milo I'm gonna be very careful with


---------31:50----------
what I say okay so when members of this


---------31:53----------
conversation is to provide general


---------31:54----------
education and not diagnose or treat you


---------31:57----------
with any medical conditions so I'm gonna


---------31:59----------
make some general statements about


---------32:01----------
Diagnostics in some of my experiences


---------32:03----------
with Miss diagnosis so if we see a manic


---------32:08----------
episode like let's say someone gets


---------32:09----------
hospitalized with a manic episode we


---------32:11----------
give them a diagnosis of bipolar


---------32:12----------
disorder often times there are


---------32:15----------
evidence-based treatments for bipolar


---------32:17----------
disorder that include medications and


---------32:20----------
sometimes those medications can have


---------32:23----------
anywhere from no too heavy side effects


---------32:28----------
sometimes we are we oftentimes believe


---------32:31----------
as providers that the side effects of


---------32:34----------
the medications are worth the benefit of


---------32:39----------
preventing another manic episode mm-hmm


---------32:42----------
the really really important thing is


---------32:45----------
that sometimes manic episodes are not


---------32:48----------
caused by by bipolar disorder so bipolar


---------32:51----------
disorder is an


---------32:53----------
illness which involves periods of


---------32:56----------
depression in periods of mania or


---------32:58----------
hypomania


---------32:59----------
so the periods of depression are


---------33:01----------
characterized by weeks to months of


---------33:04----------
feeling super down having low energy


---------33:07----------
having trouble getting out of bed things


---------33:09----------
like that the periods of hypomania or


---------33:13----------
mania so let's start with hypomania are


---------33:15----------
characterized by periods of time of high


---------33:18----------
mental activity often times higher


---------33:20----------
energy often times reduced needs for


---------33:23----------
sleep despite maintaining some


---------33:25----------
relatively high function interesting


---------33:28----------
side point the the prevalence which


---------33:33----------
means how common type to bipolar


---------33:36----------
disorders and type two bipolar disorder


---------33:38----------
means hypomania so the amount of kids


---------33:40----------
who have hypomania at Harvard University


---------33:42----------
is three times the national average what


---------33:46----------
do you think about that I think


---------33:48----------
hypomania can be like very useful if you


---------33:52----------
are living in a productive world


---------33:54----------
my uncle is bp2 and he uses his


---------34:00----------
hypomania in his work and like in his


---------34:06----------
kind of hobbies and in one of his


---------34:08----------
hobbies is to create unmanned electric


---------34:14----------
like RC planes and he has like seven


---------34:18----------
World Records for the fastest and the


---------34:20----------
best things in the world because he gets


---------34:22----------
and there was hypomania and he'll just


---------34:25----------
grind yep so hypomania can feel


---------34:29----------
wonderful unfortunately generally comes


---------34:31----------
at a cost of depression afterward and


---------34:34----------
and and so the reason I'm not giving you


---------34:37----------
medical advice but what I would


---------34:38----------
encourage you to do I haven't asked you


---------34:39----------
if you're on medications or if you're in


---------34:41----------
treatment or anything I actually I'm not


---------34:42----------
interested in learning that stuff


---------34:44----------
because that becomes more of a medical


---------34:45----------
relationship but what I will tell you is


---------34:47----------
that if you are on medication or if you


---------34:51----------
were in treatment it is very important


---------34:53----------
for your providers and this is true of


---------34:54----------
everyone is very important for your


---------34:56----------
providers to know whether you are on


---------34:59----------
substances or not and to what extent you


---------35:02----------
were using substances because that can


---------35:03----------
muddy the diagnosis yeah anytime I have


---------35:07----------
a patient who has any kind of substance


---------35:09----------
use and depression


---------35:11----------
I don't truly know if they have


---------35:13----------
depression or that's the substance


---------35:15----------
that's making them depressed you can't


---------35:17----------
really make a true clean diagnosis of


---------35:20----------
depression or bipolar disorder until you


---------35:22----------
get a clean brain mm-hmm so I would


---------35:28----------
encourage you to if you were still in


---------35:30----------
treatment to share with your providers


---------35:32----------
that detail because I think it's quite


---------35:34----------
important and the reason for that is


---------35:36----------
because I would hate for people to be on


---------35:38----------
medications that they don't need to be


---------35:40----------
on yeah well I they definitely knew I


---------35:46----------
had THC in my system like when I went to


---------35:51----------
the hospital so I'm not sure how and


---------35:56----------
like I went to like three different


---------35:59----------
hospitals over the course of ten days


---------36:01----------
and did outpatient treatment and


---------36:03----------
shitbird inpatient treatment and a


---------36:05----------
little bit of outpatient treatment I'm


---------36:07----------
not sure how like all of the information


---------36:10----------
permeated throughout the entire yep


---------36:13----------
processing throughout the entire medical


---------36:15----------
community so I guess I would assume that


---------36:21----------
there was some awareness yeah so what


---------36:25----------
I'm doing yeah what I'm telling you is


---------36:27----------
that medical information getting passed


---------36:29----------
between different institutions is


---------36:31----------
[ __ ] like it's bad right so like like


---------36:35----------
it's bad so if you if you are very lucky


---------36:39----------
and you have a very thoughtful clinician


---------36:41----------
who is also not like overworked then


---------36:44----------
they may be had the time to look through


---------36:45----------
things but what I'm saying is that this


---------36:48----------
is a danger of our medical system so


---------36:50----------
once something gets slapped into your


---------36:52----------
chart like it takes a lot of effort for


---------36:55----------
someone to like take you from scratch


---------36:58----------
and not be influenced and like not do


---------37:01----------
like a thorough workup from the get-go


---------37:03----------
so they just assume that providers in


---------37:06----------
the past made good judgements which may


---------37:09----------
not be like it's and it's not a bad


---------37:10----------
assumption but you kind of get like what


---------37:13----------
happens to a lot of people especially


---------37:14----------
with mental health diagnoses because we


---------37:16----------
can't test for it right it's not like we


---------37:18----------
can do an x-ray and see if you're


---------37:19----------
bipolar or not


---------37:20----------
yeah and the other the other reason that


---------37:22----------
mental help provider to that it's not


---------37:23----------
necessarily our fault because you know


---------37:25----------
we didn't see you when you were manic so


---------37:28----------
we just have to trust the person before


---------37:30----------
that they're not a dumbass and that they


---------37:32----------
made a right diagnosis and I don't even


---------37:34----------
think that they were necessarily a


---------37:35----------
dumbass I think it can be like


---------37:36----------
presumptive mania and they could have


---------37:39----------
had a question mark the problem is that


---------37:42----------
when they send a bill to your insurance


---------37:44----------
company because they want to get paid


---------37:45----------
they can't leave a question work because


---------37:48----------
an insurance company is not going to pay


---------37:49----------
for anything if they have a plan work so


---------37:52----------
they have to label you with something in


---------37:54----------
order to get compensated and that label


---------37:56----------
sometimes carries forward and can


---------37:59----------
actually negatively impact your care


---------38:00----------
yeah so I would just encourage you if


---------38:04----------
you were still in treatment or enter


---------38:05----------
treatment in the future to you know


---------38:08----------
share this information share the extent


---------38:11----------
of your substance use so that you give


---------38:13----------
your clinician an opportunity to really


---------38:16----------
like get to know the full picture and


---------38:18----------
give you like a diagnosis from scratch


---------38:21----------
mm-hmm yeah okay sorry for that tangent


---------38:28----------
it's just I think that's a really really


---------38:30----------
important no that was helpful for people


---------38:32----------
to know because I I think it's it's


---------38:34----------
unfortunate that we just have a lot of


---------38:36----------
you know it's it's a mix of bad systems


---------38:39----------
it's a mix of like insurance and like


---------38:41----------
the medical documentation is not


---------38:45----------
actually geared towards providing


---------38:46----------
clinical care like I don't know if you


---------38:48----------
guys have ever seen your chart but it's


---------38:50----------
just like this pile of auto-populated


---------38:53----------
copy pasted [ __ ] it's not about like


---------38:57----------
thinking or clinical care it's all about


---------38:59----------
justifying because insurance companies


---------39:02----------
in order to get paid you have to like


---------39:03----------
include all kinds of information that


---------39:05----------
they want you to include so that's what


---------39:07----------
you include and then while you're


---------39:08----------
spending time including all that crap


---------39:11----------
like you don't have time to you know


---------39:14----------
write a page about what you actually


---------39:16----------
think is going on to be put into a box


---------39:20----------
yep and shake it's overlooked yep


---------39:23----------
exactly so I think as as a patient it is


---------39:26----------
very important for you to take


---------39:28----------
responsibility and not assume that you


---------39:32----------
know your providers have gone through


---------39:33----------
your chart and things


---------39:34----------
like that like and you can be respectful


---------39:35----------
about it you shouldn't assume that they


---------39:37----------
haven't you can just ask like it and


---------39:39----------
these are things unfortunately that we


---------39:41----------
don't teach kids right like so a lot of


---------39:43----------
times people get hospitalized like in


---------39:44----------
their late teens or early 20s and no one


---------39:47----------
has taught you how to talk to a provider


---------39:49----------
because you don't have what you don't


---------39:50----------
have any idea what the [ __ ] is going on


---------39:51----------
you get taken to a hospital people come


---------39:54----------
in people come out they're the experts


---------39:56----------
you're like I don't know what to do it's


---------39:58----------
very hard to advocate for yourself


---------39:59----------
because you don't even know what you're


---------40:00----------
supposed to be advocating for no one


---------40:02----------
teaches you this stuff anyway I'm gonna


---------40:06----------
get off my soapbox but you know take


---------40:09----------
care of yourself and all of you guys


---------40:11----------
should talk to your providers and if you


---------40:13----------
have concerns about your diagnosis like


---------40:15----------
it's our job and we have ethical


---------40:17----------
responsibilities we have ethical duties


---------40:19----------
to like not miss diagnose you and like


---------40:22----------
conceptualize you from scratch we owe


---------40:24----------
that to you so you should ask for it if


---------40:26----------
you think that you've been labeled with


---------40:28----------
something that isn't fair or you've been


---------40:29----------
labeled with half a dozen things by half


---------40:31----------
a dozen people chances are some of that


---------40:33----------
[ __ ] is wrong yeah one thing though


---------40:38----------
yeah this is so bad but like I get to be


---------40:46----------
on my own soapbox and complain about the


---------40:49----------
stigma of mental illness now and also


---------40:52----------
like use it hypocritically at the same


---------40:56----------
time as like that crush and there's like


---------40:59----------
an excuse for certain things let's talk


---------41:01----------
about that okay how do you use mental


---------41:05----------
illness as a crutch well it's easy to


---------41:13----------
explain like it's easy to say oh I'm not


---------41:18----------
an [ __ ]


---------41:19----------
I just bipolar yep I have a mental


---------41:24----------
illness you know what does that allow


---------41:25----------
you to do Milo it allows me to make


---------41:30----------
excuses for and not not do that crucial


---------41:36----------
introspection absolutely how does that


---------41:40----------
affect your life


---------41:43----------
I would assume it slows down the


---------41:49----------
emotional and mental maturity maturation


---------41:53----------
mm-hmm what do you think it does for you


---------41:56----------
professionally academically well


---------42:04----------
professionally and academically I'm


---------42:06----------
gonna I'm in a bit of a rut or a pit


---------42:11----------
right now so it's not doing much do you


---------42:17----------
think I don't I don't think it's


---------42:18----------
directly related to to where I'm


---------42:21----------
currently I think that has a lot to do


---------42:23----------
with just my cannabis addiction in my


---------42:28----------
video game addiction and you're making


---------42:30----------
poor decisions in college so what I'm


---------42:34----------
hearing from that statement is that you


---------42:36----------
accept responsibility for where you are


---------42:38----------
professionally and academically based on


---------42:41----------
your addictive behaviors instead of


---------42:43----------
using bipolar as an excuse yeah is that


---------42:47----------
fair to say


---------42:48----------
yeah so yeah I'm not like oh I can't get


---------42:52----------
a job because of this diagnosis it's not


---------42:55----------
like that what have you used the


---------42:56----------
diagnosis is that crutch for can you


---------42:59----------
give us an example let's see like the


---------43:08----------
main thing that comes I I wouldn't use


---------43:10----------
it for anything like seriously I don't


---------43:18----------
know drastic or dramatic like I said I


---------43:21----------
just it's mostly the only times I've


---------43:24----------
like kind of like cheesed it was


---------43:30----------
beautiful word usage taste it thank you


---------43:33----------
I have only cheesed it in like social


---------43:39----------
situations basically to like maybe like


---------43:45----------
shut somebody up who's like using


---------43:48----------
bipolar in a derogatory manner which it


---------43:50----------
is sometimes used like people say like


---------43:53----------
oh I'm so bipolar I was happy yesterday


---------43:55----------
and I'm sad


---------43:56----------
hey inside a really good way to shut


---------44:01----------
somebody up like that I think them I


---------44:06----------
think the most I use it is as an excuse


---------44:12----------
towards myself and for myself like


---------44:16----------
having this label you know it finds me


---------44:21----------
and it limits me and all these things


---------44:24----------
and and when you use it as an excuse for


---------44:27----------
yourself what do you let yourself get


---------44:28----------
away with not doing [ __ ]


---------44:38----------
like what for the most part hmm I don't


---------44:48----------
know maybe just not mentally pushing


---------44:52----------
myself or trying in in certain certain


---------44:58----------
circumstances it really so like the only


---------45:04----------
experience I've ever had that would lead


---------45:06----------
me to kind of that would seem to


---------45:12----------
substantiate the diagnosis was this one


---------45:15----------
episode which was super bad super


---------45:17----------
traumatic and a [ __ ] ton of depression


---------45:21----------
for the last like you know maybe eight


---------45:27----------
or nine years okay pretty constant over


---------45:32----------
those eight or nine years or would


---------45:33----------
fluctuate um it would it fluctuated in


---------45:41----------
like an upward trend upward being more


---------45:46----------
motion more depression so yeah


---------45:48----------
progressively got worse over eight or


---------45:51----------
nine years yeah kind of as I started


---------45:55----------
having more responsibility in life


---------45:57----------
started doing generally worse in school


---------46:02----------
started to feel lonelier and have less


---------46:05----------
friends yeah


---------46:09----------
sand at a certain point along there like


---------46:12----------
when were you diagnosed with Bipolar in


---------46:15----------
that eight or nine years stretch when


---------46:17----------
freshman year of college


---------46:19----------
and the eight or nine-year stretch that


---------46:21----------
you're describing is from when to when


---------46:24----------
I'm 23 now so like 14 or 15 okay


---------46:30----------
to to now and like three years ago


---------46:34----------
almost three years ago I think was okay


---------46:36----------
was the episode what was I saying you


---------46:41----------
were just talking about how the


---------46:42----------
depression was getting worse and worse


---------46:44----------
gradually yeah and and at some point in


---------46:47----------
that upward trend the cannabis smoking


---------46:54----------
stopped becoming like this cool fun


---------46:59----------
spiritual tool and started becoming like


---------47:01----------
a numbing agent analgesic is that the


---------47:07----------
word that is the word okay yeah yeah by


---------47:12----------
the way before we let you go remind me


---------47:14----------
to talk to you about intelligence about


---------47:17----------
what Intel that has intelligence okay


---------47:23----------
well what were you numbing what were you


---------47:25----------
using to what was it what was it numbing


---------47:30----------
I think kind of anxiety towards the


---------47:34----------
future and anxiety about


---------47:36----------
responsibilities towards the future I


---------47:44----------
had and have a very fortunate upbringing


---------47:49----------
and tons of opportunity to be a


---------47:53----------
successful person and I feel that I've


---------47:58----------
squandered a lot of that and that feels


---------48:04----------
bad man so I don't like what what do you


---------48:09----------
known that what does that mean right so


---------48:12----------
I understand that everyone who's


---------48:13----------
watching them understands that it feels


---------48:16----------
bad and they know exactly what you're


---------48:18----------
talking about but let's work


---------48:20----------
to it okay um I feel so I'm a really


---------48:27----------
kind of philosophical person and I'm


---------48:29----------
like thinking really big and really deep


---------48:33----------
and a lot of the times I feel like like


---------48:40----------
every decision made by all of my


---------48:46----------
thousands of ancestors and your


---------48:48----------
thousands of ancestors you know all the


---------48:51----------
decisions all the wars and everything


---------48:52----------
fought has led to like this moment we


---------48:56----------
are the latest addition we are like the


---------48:59----------
you know the newest model of human and


---------49:05----------
with that I feel comes a lot of


---------49:08----------
responsibility especially like I said


---------49:10----------
coming from you know a very financially


---------49:13----------
stable background where I never had to


---------49:15----------
worry about you know where the next meal


---------49:19----------
would come from or anything like that


---------49:21----------
and yeah it just feels like squandering


---------49:28----------
that is squander like the opportunities


---------49:35----------
that have been cultivated and do you


---------49:40----------
think your opportunities that you've


---------49:42----------
been given in life make your life easier


---------49:44----------
or harder you cut out there I mean where


---------49:47----------
do you feel like the opportunities


---------49:49----------
you've been given in life make it easier


---------49:51----------
or harder


---------49:53----------
um that's an interesting question


---------49:58----------
like like somebody who is who has to


---------50:05----------
struggle to survive every day is


---------50:08----------
obviously gonna have a lot of difficulty


---------50:10----------
but they're gonna have like a mental


---------50:14----------
fortitude that someone like myself is


---------50:19----------
probably not going to really have and I


---------50:21----------
think that's a very useful trait like


---------50:27----------
like there's there's kind of a downside


---------50:31----------
to security because


---------50:33----------
it makes you not really deeply


---------50:41----------
subconsciously concerned about a lot of


---------50:47----------
like survival aspects that a lot of


---------50:49----------
other people are mm-hmm


---------50:50----------
so we're gonna just dig into this a


---------50:52----------
little bit more okay so so it sounds


---------50:55----------
like you view opportunities as


---------50:57----------
advantages that you've squandered you


---------51:00----------
don't view them as handicaps what do you


---------51:05----------
mean right so like it sounds like you


---------51:07----------
feel somewhat ashamed or maybe guilty or


---------51:11----------
something like that that you have all of


---------51:13----------
this privilege and that you haven't done


---------51:15----------
something with it yeah so it sounds like


---------51:19----------
you view an opportunity as an advantage


---------51:24----------
[Music]


---------51:26----------
because we don't talk about it yeah I


---------51:29----------
suppose so


---------51:30----------
right so until we had this discussion so


---------51:32----------
if we if I say I've squandered an


---------51:34----------
opportunity like that's clearly an


---------51:36----------
advantage it's like you know we're about


---------51:39----------
to do some Game of Thrones spoilers here


---------51:41----------
so if you guys want to mute yourselves


---------51:43----------
go for it


---------51:43----------
but one of the best things that I saw at


---------51:45----------
the end of if you seen Game Thrones yeah


---------51:47----------
okay so if you one of the best the


---------51:49----------
funniest comments I heard was you know


---------51:51----------
at the end of season seven when Daenerys


---------51:54----------
has three dragons we're about to see


---------51:56----------
like how Daenerys squanders a three


---------51:59----------
dragon lead in a war right she's gonna


---------52:01----------
throw really really hard yeah so we


---------52:04----------
don't when we the word squander implies


---------52:06----------
advantage yeah so when you like beat


---------52:11----------
yourself up for squandering your


---------52:14----------
opportunities you're like oh I'm such a


---------52:15----------
[ __ ] cuz all these people like they


---------52:17----------
don't even have like the opportunities


---------52:18----------
that I have whether they be financial


---------52:21----------
whether they be an uncle who's like


---------52:22----------
actually motivated to like build cool


---------52:24----------
stuff and like win contests it sounds


---------52:27----------
like you have people in your life it's


---------52:28----------
not just financial capital it may be


---------52:30----------
some amount of like family support or


---------52:32----------
role battles or things like that so you


---------52:36----------
have a lot of opportunities and then you


---------52:38----------
blame yourself for not taking advantage


---------52:40----------
of them right so therefore opportunities


---------52:43----------
are advantages yeah duh


---------52:47----------
now the interesting thing is that when I


---------52:50----------
asked you our opportunities advantages


---------52:52----------
you kind of changed your tune a little


---------52:54----------
bit so what do I have to think about it


---------52:59----------
yes that's the point right so I want you


---------53:04----------
so like let's just let's just look at


---------53:05----------
that for a second when you say that


---------53:06----------
struggles lead to mental fortitude I


---------53:08----------
think that that's true but I think that


---------53:12----------
it's not necessarily that they lead to


---------53:15----------
mental fortitude I think struggles so


---------53:19----------
operat when you have kind of like


---------53:22----------
advantages in life I think what they


---------53:25----------
really lead to is complacency yes and


---------53:29----------
and so I think the interesting thing


---------53:32----------
about you know our people


---------53:33----------
Milo which is like twitch at and gamers


---------53:36----------
and Gen Z is that our people struggle


---------53:39----------
with motivation but if you have


---------53:42----------
struggles in life motivation


---------53:45----------
you don't need motivation because the


---------53:47----------
world is going to demand that you do


---------53:49----------
something so we think about


---------53:52----------
procrastination like you know if you


---------53:56----------
look at it like if I have 10 days to


---------53:57----------
work on an assignment where I have one


---------53:59----------
day to work on an assignment we view 10


---------54:02----------
days to work on an assignment as an


---------54:04----------
advantage as an opportunity you have so


---------54:06----------
much time you can make such a good like


---------54:10----------
you can make such a good in-depth


---------54:11----------
assignment you can do a wonderful job


---------54:13----------
but if we actually look at it the


---------54:17----------
struggle situation the person on the


---------54:19----------
struggle bus with just one day in some


---------54:21----------
ways that person's life is easier now


---------54:25----------
I'm not saying that it's easier from an


---------54:27----------
absolute sense what I'm saying is that


---------54:29----------
if we actually judge and look within


---------54:32----------
ourselves we're gonna discover some


---------54:34----------
paradoxical stuff and that external


---------54:38----------
motivator external pressures are


---------54:40----------
generally speaking what we need to


---------54:43----------
succeed and in a bizarre way if you're


---------54:46----------
given opportunities and you have


---------54:48----------
advantages in a weird way like that's


---------54:51----------
actually like more difficult because you


---------54:54----------
have to rely more on internal motivation


---------54:57----------
as opposed to external motivation


---------54:59----------
and external motivation is harder for


---------55:02----------
easier is easier for our generation than


---------55:05----------
internal motivation mm-hmm what is that


---------55:09----------
if we what do you think about all that


---------55:13----------
yeah that resonates with me that seems


---------55:16----------
accurate


---------55:17----------
I think resonate motivation maybe


---------55:23----------
shouldn't be the the goal or the like


---------55:27----------
operating factor because motivation is


---------55:33----------
something that is like fleeting


---------55:37----------
I feel like internal motivation is


---------55:40----------
discipline okay so we can more valuable


---------55:46----------
yeah so okay I'm gonna do a video about


---------55:53----------
what's motivation what's discipline and


---------55:55----------
what's willpower okay and how do those


---------55:58----------
things affect our behavior but so what


---------56:02----------
does this mean for your self judgment in


---------56:08----------
terms of the like do you feel like


---------56:09----------
you've like so you view yourself as like


---------56:11----------
having squandered opportunities right


---------56:14----------
yeah opportunities are actually like


---------56:17----------
they may not actually are having


---------56:20----------
advantages you know so I just encourage


---------56:22----------
you to rethink that and for people who


---------56:25----------
are watching also really rethink because


---------56:28----------
other people look at your life and they


---------56:30----------
see oh he's so lucky


---------56:32----------
mm-hm right and weak and and they kind


---------56:35----------
of a part of it that's a big part of it


---------56:37----------
tell me about that like that just adds


---------56:44----------
to the kind of pressure you know of of


---------56:52----------
feeling responsible I guess you know


---------56:55----------
like if you're going to if you're gonna


---------56:59----------
have all this life in these


---------57:03----------
opportunities then you should make


---------57:08----------
something out of it mmm-hmm so let me


---------57:11----------
ask you something


---------57:12----------
Wow hello um so I want to talk to you a


---------57:18----------
little bit about potential because what


---------57:19----------
I'm hearing from here is potential I


---------57:21----------
think sense to you yes like Milo you've


---------57:25----------
got so much potential man you're a smart


---------57:27----------
kid


---------57:28----------
you've got financial resources you have


---------57:31----------
you know it sounds like family that's


---------57:32----------
supportive you've got so much potential


---------57:35----------
by the way don't forget you wanted to


---------57:37----------
talk about intelligence yep


---------57:40----------
so that goes into this right cuz you're


---------57:43----------
so smart Milo you have so much potential


---------57:47----------
have people told you that yeah how does


---------57:51----------
that feel


---------58:03----------
I think it used to feel a lot different


---------58:06----------
than it does now how I did it used to


---------58:08----------
feel because I heard that when I was


---------58:09----------
little yeah and maybe that's part of


---------58:17----------
what led to like Carol coasting by and


---------58:22----------
not putting in the effort because it's


---------58:24----------
like oh I I have this advantage I don't


---------58:27----------
need to try as hard as elders you know


---------58:30----------
have you seen me smart so one of the


---------58:32----------
first youtube videos that i uploaded was


---------58:35----------
about how intelligence leads to


---------58:36----------
avoidance have you watched that yes okay


---------58:39----------
yeah if you guys haven't I think that's


---------58:42----------
probably the first video that really


---------58:44----------
resonated with a lot of people and


---------58:46----------
changed the way that they kind of looked


---------58:49----------
at themselves so I'd encourage you guys


---------58:50----------
to check that out but let's kind of come


---------58:52----------
back to you so you said that potential


---------58:54----------
used to feel different so how did it


---------58:55----------
generally feel to you when people told


---------58:57----------
you have so much potential I felt like I


---------59:02----------
was special mm-hmm and special in what


---------59:06----------
way in that I had good things coming for


---------59:14----------
me potential felt like an advantage or


---------59:17----------
promise of the future or what um I guess


---------59:22----------
I kind of looked at it like a promise


---------59:25----------
and something that was just set in stone


---------59:26----------
you know and I wouldn't have to do [ __ ]


---------59:28----------
about who would just fall into my lap


---------59:30----------
yep and looking at it that way is


---------59:33----------
probably what now makes you know after


---------59:38----------
I've become disillusioned looking at it


---------59:42----------
now is what makes me kind of almost like


---------59:47----------
reject that term and feel kind of weird


---------59:52----------
and uncomfortable when when I hear it so


---------59:56----------
let's talk about that what do you mean


---------59:58----------
by weird and uncomfortable when people


---------60:01----------
talk about your potential now what do


---------60:03----------
you feel a juxtaposition Zayn


---------60:11----------
between like what could have been and


---------60:15----------
what is like how does that make it by it


---------60:22----------
pretty disappointed sometimes kind of


---------60:25----------
hopeless okay are you lagging am i


---------60:29----------
lagging is it me


---------60:32----------
hello did stream cut out folks


---------60:38----------
oh noes okay


---------60:49----------
let's see if he comes back all right


---------60:53----------
are you guys is this useful can we just


---------60:57----------
check in with y'all wait am i lagging or


---------61:04----------
is it him lagging wait who who is


---------61:11----------
lagging yes to both were all lagging


---------61:19----------
okay [ __ ] oh we're back can you hear me


---------61:25----------
yeah see you alright okay so alright so


---------61:35----------
I was asking you cuz I'm I'm so have you


---------61:37----------
seen the video on alexithymia we may not


---------61:42----------
actually have one now that I think about


---------61:44----------
it maybe in my head I know I've talked


---------61:47----------
about it I don't think so okay oh no no


---------61:52----------
it's it's in a set of content that we


---------61:53----------
haven't uploaded yet so the other thing


---------61:56----------
is I'm digging for your feelings because


---------61:57----------
you're giving me lots of cognitive


---------61:59----------
answers mm-hmm but how does potential


---------62:02----------
feel to you now what's the feeling you


---------62:06----------
said a little bit disappointed and a


---------62:07----------
little bit hopeless what are you


---------62:09----------
disappointed in my track record I guess


---------62:15----------
yeah and and this is gonna sound kind of


---------62:20----------
weird so I'm gonna try to make a couple


---------62:23----------
points Miley you gotta let me know if


---------62:25----------
I'm being clear or not okay I'm gonna


---------62:29----------
rely on Ben so the first thing is that


---------62:32----------
you said that xpect you used to have


---------62:34----------
expectations that you could coast and


---------62:36----------
now you are disillusioned mm-hmm first


---------62:40----------
thing to understand is let's look at the


---------62:42----------
word disillusioned so in order to be


---------62:45----------
disillusioned at some point you must


---------62:46----------
have been illusioned mm-hmm does that


---------62:49----------
make sense yeah right so illusion that I


---------62:52----------
could coast yeah so like disillusion is


---------62:55----------
like the loss of an expectation and and


---------62:59----------
it's kind of like Minh interesting word


---------63:03----------
because illusion implies that it's


---------63:04----------
something false to begin with right and


---------63:07----------
if we look at sort of your situation I


---------63:09----------
think that disillusioned is a great word


---------63:11----------
because I think you had [ __ ]


---------63:12----------
so we losing you okay there we go I


---------63:15----------
think you had a false expectation about


---------63:18----------
what your life was gonna be like because


---------63:19----------
it was fed oh [ __ ] okay


---------63:24----------
your videos like strobing yeah I don't


---------63:28----------
know anyway so I think you had kind of


---------63:31----------
this illusion of what your life was


---------63:33----------
gonna be like that was based on false


---------63:35----------
expectation and so that's only going to


---------63:37----------
lead to disappointment


---------63:38----------
you guys got understands I mean I've


---------63:40----------
talked about this a thousand times right


---------63:42----------
like if you if everyone tells you that a


---------63:44----------
movie is gonna be super awesome and then


---------63:45----------
you go and you watch it what's gonna


---------63:47----------
happen like how are you gonna enjoy the


---------63:49----------
movie like what do you think your


---------63:53----------
experience is gonna be diminished


---------63:54----------
absolutely there's to live up to those


---------63:56----------
expectations so when you describe eight


---------63:59----------
to nine years of depression I don't know


---------64:03----------
that you actually have a biological


---------64:04----------
depression because that tends to be


---------64:06----------
episodic in nature what I hear from that


---------64:09----------
is actually like a further and further


---------64:11----------
disillusionment about your life that's


---------64:15----------
what I think has been going on that you


---------64:17----------
started to have expectations about what


---------64:19----------
your life was gonna look like and it was


---------64:21----------
kind of vague you just know it was gonna


---------64:23----------
be good and because Milo you're such a


---------64:25----------
smart boy oh he's such a smart boy you


---------64:28----------
know he's so clever and then life


---------64:31----------
started to like get hard for you and you


---------64:33----------
kind of didn't know how to handle that


---------64:35----------
you didn't have the mental fortitude


---------64:37----------
because things were easy for you early


---------64:39----------
on yeah you became more and more


---------64:42----------
disillusioned in life became harder and


---------64:44----------
harder and once again you were given all


---------64:46----------
these promises about how you're so smart


---------64:48----------
and you have so much potential so now we


---------64:51----------
get to the next point which is if I had


---------64:54----------
if I gave you a blueprint for a Shack


---------64:57----------
and I gave you a blueprint for a mansion


---------65:00----------
which one has more potential


---------65:09----------
I mean the the seemingly obvious answer


---------65:17----------
is the mansion is I don't ask trick


---------65:19----------
questions man I'm not trying to trick


---------65:20----------
anyone okay it's the mansion now here's


---------65:23----------
the next important question which one is


---------65:26----------
harder to build the mansion absolutely


---------65:32----------
so this is the biggest mistake that


---------65:34----------
people make about potential they think


---------65:37----------
that potential because potential is a


---------65:38----------
mansion right that's what potential is


---------65:40----------
like that very definition is a blueprint


---------65:43----------
of what you could be in life the biggest


---------65:46----------
mistake that people make is that they


---------65:48----------
think that potential makes their life


---------65:50----------
easy when in fact it makes your life


---------65:52----------
hard potential is a burden it is a


---------65:55----------
burden for greatness and it is a burden


---------65:57----------
of success but it requires so much more


---------66:01----------
effort than having low potential so if I


---------66:07----------
take someone who has cerebral palsy or


---------66:09----------
Down syndrome or has had like a


---------66:11----------
neurological injury if they add like


---------66:13----------
hypoxia during childbirth which means


---------66:16----------
that they didn't get enough air to the


---------66:17----------
brain is something like that how much


---------66:20----------
potential do I have do they have in the


---------66:27----------
traditional sense of the word probably


---------66:29----------
not very much exactly right so it's very


---------66:32----------
good that you said in the traditional


---------66:34----------
sense so if we think about what they're


---------66:36----------
cognitively capable of they can still


---------66:38----------
accomplish great things because it's not


---------66:40----------
just about your raw IQ but generally


---------66:43----------
speaking when we think about you know


---------66:45----------
what someone is capable of and we think


---------66:46----------
about IQ is like you know the bar by


---------66:49----------
which we measure and there are lots of


---------66:50----------
other bars to measure things by and you


---------66:53----------
know we think of them as quote unquote


---------66:54----------
low potential and we think about smart


---------66:57----------
quit kids as quote unquote high


---------66:58----------
potential but I want you and everyone


---------67:00----------
else to understand this the higher your


---------67:02----------
potential is the harder your road is or


---------67:06----------
not maybe harder isn't the right word


---------67:08----------
maybe longer your road is the more


---------67:10----------
you're going to have to invest in


---------67:13----------
realizing that potential right if I take


---------67:16----------
one acre of land and I say I'm gonna


---------67:18----------
build a farm


---------67:20----------
and I take a hundred acres of land and I


---------67:21----------
say I'm gonna build a farm one has way


---------67:24----------
more potential but the heart and the


---------67:26----------
more potential you have this is the


---------67:27----------
mistake you made you thought that that


---------67:29----------
means potential equals less work


---------67:32----------
intelligence equals less work if you


---------67:36----------
really study it it means the exact


---------67:38----------
opposite you have you have a great great


---------67:42----------
burden on your shoulders Milo because I


---------67:45----------
believe you you are capable of greatness


---------67:48----------
I really do yeah but I think that that


---------67:52----------
thought should not make your life easy I


---------67:54----------
think that thought should [ __ ]


---------67:55----------
terrify you mm-hmm because the prospect


---------67:59----------
of failure is like catastrophic that if


---------68:04----------
you have a hundred acres of land and


---------68:06----------
that you're supposed to build a farm


---------68:08----------
with that that if you [ __ ] up they're


---------68:11----------
going to be a hundred times as many


---------68:13----------
people who go hungry then if you have


---------68:15----------
low potential mm-hmm that capability and


---------68:19----------
responsibility are one in the same this


---------68:23----------
is the law of karma right to whom much


---------68:26----------
is expected much is given much is


---------68:28----------
expected because that's the only way it


---------68:29----------
works it is silly to expect someone if


---------68:33----------
you have ten loaves of bread you can


---------68:35----------
feed ten people if you have one loaf of


---------68:37----------
bread unless you're Jesus


---------68:38----------
you can only feed one person and so Milo


---------68:43----------
if I had one kind of bit of advice for


---------68:45----------
you it's to re-examine how you view


---------68:48----------
yourself re-examine what your


---------68:50----------
opportunities are and re-examine your


---------68:53----------
sense of disillusion and disillusionment


---------68:55----------
or disappointment I need to I think


---------68:59----------
you've got to completely reformulate


---------69:01----------
this and think a little bit about


---------69:02----------
potential as a burden think a little bit


---------69:05----------
about you know the reason that you


---------69:07----------
failed is not because and this also is


---------69:10----------
kind of where ego comes in and what like


---------69:12----------
you compare yourself to other people and


---------69:13----------
people tell you that you're intelligent


---------69:15----------
and all that kind of stuff is that in


---------69:17----------
order for you to achieve you're looking


---------69:20----------
at 100 acres of land and what you're


---------69:22----------
doing is you're saying I was unable to


---------69:24----------
cultivate these 100 acres and you're


---------69:27----------
sometimes kind of saying that it should


---------69:28----------
be just as easy as someone who has one


---------69:30----------
acre of land some in some weird way I


---------69:32----------
don't know how else to


---------69:33----------
playing that but I think your mind is


---------69:35----------
I'm actually making an unfair comparison


---------69:36----------
I think that you should cut yourself


---------69:40----------
some slack because if you are smart and


---------69:42----------
if you do have resources you know that's


---------69:45----------
actually gonna require a lot more work


---------69:47----------
for you to like bring that to fruition


---------69:51----------
mm-hmm and I think maybe the comparison


---------69:53----------
that you're making is you're saying that


---------69:55----------
okay like cultivating one acre of land


---------69:57----------
should be easy if I have a hundred acres


---------69:59----------
and so maybe you're making you're making


---------70:01----------
some weird comparison which I think at


---------70:02----------
the end of the day is unfair and I think


---------70:06----------
what you should do is is really


---------70:07----------
understand that like you're trying to


---------70:09----------
build a mansion and if you have more


---------70:11----------
resources that mansion is even bigger


---------70:13----------
and let that sort of you know let that


---------70:16----------
be a struggle instead of an opportunity


---------70:19----------
and the odd thing is that if it becomes


---------70:22----------
a struggle I think that that's going to


---------70:25----------
lead to the mental fortitude that you're


---------70:27----------
talking about that's gonna lead to


---------70:29----------
realistic expectations of what you're


---------70:31----------
capable of and realistic expectations of


---------70:33----------
how far you need to go and hopefully


---------70:36----------
it'll start to address your


---------70:37----------
disillusionment because the


---------70:39----------
disillusionment comes from the idea that


---------70:41----------
a hundred acres of land is is like


---------70:43----------
easier to cultivate than one acre of


---------70:45----------
land mm-hmm thoughts questions


---------70:59----------
yeah that makes sense


---------71:04----------
like I think do a certain extent I don't


---------71:10----------
know like I don't you just cut out sorry


---------71:19----------
can you hear me yeah yeah I totally


---------71:22----------
understand what you're saying about like


---------71:25----------
just needing a shift in the way I view


---------71:30----------
myself sometimes I imagine if like like


---------71:36----------
Terry Crews or somebody just like


---------71:41----------
possessed me and entered my body like


---------71:44----------
obviously my life would be a lot


---------71:49----------
different than it is now if they were to


---------71:50----------
just start being me in my body so it's


---------71:54----------
clearly just a matter of like mental


---------72:00----------
expectation and a certain level well


---------72:07----------
where does that train of thought leave


---------72:08----------
you how do you feel about yourself when


---------72:11----------
you think about that like I mean this is


---------72:17----------
something that I kind of intellectually


---------72:19----------
understand but maybe something haven't


---------72:21----------
really embodied including a lot of what


---------72:23----------
you've been saying which is just that


---------72:27----------
you know a shift in perspective will can


---------72:33----------
lead to a lot of hold on oh don't get


---------72:38----------
away from my question how does it make


---------72:40----------
you feel about yourself when you think


---------72:43----------
about the Terry Crews inhabiting your


---------72:45----------
body Oh dad like like I'm not the same


---------72:57----------
thing with like kind of squandering what


---------73:01----------
I have you know that that same real


---------73:03----------
house of like you know not not utilizing


---------73:10----------
what I have and what


---------73:12----------
I've been given yep so the hardest


---------73:20----------
battles that we fight are the ones that


---------73:22----------
we fight against ourselves mm-hmm and


---------73:25----------
the reason is because like we're always


---------73:28----------
the winner and we're always the loser


---------73:30----------
yeah and I think you really need to


---------73:33----------
recalibrate how hard a mental shift is


---------73:38----------
fixing something in the external world


---------73:41----------
is way easier than fixing something in


---------73:43----------
the internal world and I don't think


---------73:45----------
that most people and are most of us


---------73:49----------
right and I'm talking about twitch chat


---------73:51----------
and and Gen Z or whatever we don't


---------73:55----------
really understand that or accept that we


---------73:58----------
don't accept we don't we do not


---------74:01----------
acknowledge for ourselves that changing


---------74:04----------
yourself is actually like really hard we


---------74:07----------
think that a mental shift because it


---------74:09----------
sounds easy and it looks easy should be


---------74:12----------
easy because we look at someone like


---------74:14----------
Terry Crews and he makes it look so easy


---------74:17----------
yeah and we look at ourselves and we say


---------74:20----------
we are not like him man it's so easy he


---------74:22----------
just gets up every day like all you got


---------74:23----------
to do is just do it I just need to get


---------74:26----------
up every day mm-hmm right but it's hard


---------74:29----------
and we don't we don't forgive ourselves


---------74:32----------
and we don't practice any amount of self


---------74:35----------
compassion for failing to do what is


---------74:38----------
difficult we have a perception that it's


---------74:43----------
easy but I'm telling you guys so just to


---------74:45----------
give you an example when I tried to


---------74:48----------
become a monk at the age of 21 my


---------74:51----------
teachers told me that I had to finish


---------74:53----------
school so they said we'd love to have


---------74:55----------
you but come back when you're 30 and I


---------74:57----------
was a little bit disappointed and they


---------74:58----------
said you have to finish school and then


---------75:00----------
you have to go get a doctoral degree and


---------75:03----------
then I was kind of confused I was like


---------75:05----------
what do I do I have to become like a


---------75:07----------
doctor of some kind so I had like two or


---------75:09----------
three mentors one of them was a


---------75:10----------
neuroscientist trained at Cal Tech the


---------75:13----------
other one was a quantum physicist and


---------75:14----------
these were my two spiritual teachers and


---------75:18----------
I was like why do I need to get like


---------75:19----------
they're like you need to go get a PhD or


---------75:21----------
MD or JD or something and then come back


---------75:23----------
when you're 30 and I was like why


---------75:26----------
and they said that anything that you do


---------75:27----------
in the in the material world is gonna be


---------75:31----------
one-tenth as difficult as what you do in


---------75:33----------
the spiritual world any external


---------75:37----------
accomplishment that you set your mind to


---------75:39----------
is gonna be infinitely easier than any


---------75:42----------
internal accomplishment that you set


---------75:44----------
your mind to internal growth is actually


---------75:46----------
the most difficult thing that's why


---------75:50----------
self-actualization is at the top of


---------75:52----------
Maslow's hierarchy of needs it's the


---------75:55----------
hardest to achieve it's not actually the


---------75:57----------
easiest and we don't understand that so


---------75:59----------
I set a goal to myself that I was gonna


---------76:01----------
become the best physician I possibly


---------76:03----------
could and I set that goal not because I


---------76:07----------
wanted to become the best possible


---------76:08----------
physic air about being a good physician


---------76:10----------
I just realized unless I can become a


---------76:12----------
really really good physician I'm gonna


---------76:14----------
fail at what my real goal is becoming a


---------76:17----------
physician is about is training for me


---------76:20----------
it's not the end and I decided I wanted


---------76:23----------
to become a monk and sure enough I did a


---------76:26----------
good job so you know ended up as a


---------76:28----------
Harvard Andy and I will still tell you


---------76:31----------
guys I know this is gonna be so hard to


---------76:33----------
hear but I think accomplishing what I


---------76:35----------
did in the material world is still a


---------76:37----------
fraction of the difficulty is like the


---------76:41----------
internal change that I had to accomplish


---------76:44----------
right so when we look at someone who's


---------76:46----------
materialistically successful we look at


---------76:49----------
that as hard but I want you guys to just


---------76:51----------
think about this for a second for Milo


---------76:55----------
for you to become a harvard-trained


---------76:57----------
physician is that gonna be what do you


---------77:00----------
have to change something on the outside


---------77:01----------
world or something on the inside world


---------77:07----------
both absolutely which one do you think


---------77:10----------
is gonna be harder internal absolution


---------77:15----------
but do you treat yourself that way


---------77:25----------
maybe I mean because it's the it's the


---------77:29----------
internal kind of personality that I have


---------77:34----------
that gets the most [ __ ] from like my


---------77:40----------
Egon stuff that's the one who's saying


---------77:42----------
like oh you've squandered these


---------77:43----------
opportunities yep you know you're yeah


---------77:46----------
yeah so you probably also have a some


---------77:49----------
scar there which if we if we have a


---------77:52----------
chance to talk again I think it's worth


---------77:54----------
exploring where the origin of your


---------77:56----------
you're you're kind of complex around


---------77:59----------
squandering opportunity comes from


---------78:02----------
mmm-hmm does that make sense yeah I


---------78:06----------
don't think that's that's not really you


---------78:08----------
that's like an emotional trauma that you


---------78:11----------
have that says Milos a [ __ ] who


---------78:13----------
squanders opportunities do you think


---------78:16----------
that's potentially from a past life ABS


---------78:18----------
past life I have no idea that's why I'm


---------78:21----------
saying it requires a conversation for us


---------78:24----------
to dig into yeah right but but I'm


---------78:28----------
sensing within you like almost like in


---------78:31----------
in the round table of your mind one of


---------78:35----------
the nights at the table is this complex


---------78:37----------
of squandering opportunity yes that is a


---------78:43----------
funny image yeah so you've got like a


---------78:46----------
bunch of Milo's who are trying to get


---------78:48----------
[ __ ] done and then there's just one guy


---------78:49----------
who's just like [ __ ] you guys you


---------78:51----------
squandered all your opportunities and


---------78:54----------
then sometimes he just dominates the


---------78:56----------
table he's played by Danny DeVito


---------79:00----------
absolutely so good he's so physically


---------79:08----------
small but fills up the room so so we're


---------79:11----------
so profoundly yeah oh that's a good one


---------79:17----------
yeah that's five had kind of stuff


---------79:21----------
anyway thoughts questions are you


---------79:28----------
talking like wrap up questions or


---------79:30----------
questions of what we just how is he lost


---------79:33----------
okay


---------79:36----------
let me first ask me where do you think


---------79:38----------
we are in terms of the you know this the


---------79:41----------
conversation so look we're like do you


---------79:44----------
feel like you want to go for a while or


---------79:45----------
do you feel like we've kind of covered


---------79:47----------
some good stuff like where do you feel


---------79:49----------
like where are we between zero and and a


---------79:51----------
hundred percent this has all been very


---------79:56----------
useful and nourishing for me mentally I


---------79:59----------
could totally stop here I do have a


---------80:04----------
couple things that I would like to


---------80:07----------
address and those could like potentially


---------80:12----------
keep us going for a while sure because


---------80:16----------
they're kind of very tangential to okay


---------80:19----------
what we've been talking about so the


---------80:23----------
first is about you you went to like an


---------80:29----------
ashram and you your Dharma right now is


---------80:37----------
to just be an incredible position and to


---------80:41----------
do AoE healing for as many people as


---------80:46----------
possible


---------80:47----------
correct not really but sure so I don't


---------80:51----------
think that my Dharma is to be an


---------80:53----------
incredible physician right so your


---------80:55----------
Dharma is not being about an incredible


---------80:57----------
anything so first of all right so


---------81:00----------
incredible has to do with the outcome


---------81:02----------
it's not about action right so like like


---------81:07----------
let's just think about that for a second


---------81:09----------
so my Dharma is simply to try to help I


---------81:11----------
think you guys more so than even be a


---------81:13----------
physician I think my my physician


---------81:16----------
training has been has been training for


---------81:19----------
the final boss of my Dharma which is to


---------81:22----------
help you all my autonomous impo it is to


---------81:26----------
help you okay is there like is there


---------81:33----------
something that that is building up to


---------81:36----------
like do you think you're gonna go at any


---------81:39----------
point and and go back to the ashram and


---------81:43----------
and read about yourself yeah like is


---------81:48----------
there is there kind of


---------81:50----------
more of an endgame that you have yes so


---------81:52----------
I think when my Dharma is complete then


---------81:55----------
I will go back to the ash tree so my


---------81:58----------
Dharma being complete is gonna happen in


---------82:00----------
a couple of ways one is that if


---------82:02----------
something catastrophic happens and I


---------82:05----------
lose my wife and my two kids I'm gonna


---------82:08----------
become a monk if I feel like you guys


---------82:12----------
are doing okay or people arise who can


---------82:16----------
do the work that I am doing so that I


---------82:18----------
don't have to worry about doing it


---------82:19----------
myself then I could go in that direction


---------82:22----------
I have multiple Donna's right so I have


---------82:23----------
kids so I can't disappear because I'm


---------82:26----------
responsible for their upbringing and


---------82:28----------
financial security and things like that


---------82:29----------
I would love it if so in my heart of


---------82:34----------
hearts I would love to go back to


---------82:36----------
studying and learning myself but I feel


---------82:38----------
like I don't have time for that so the


---------82:42----------
other thing to understand is that when


---------82:43----------
we think about tottemo we think about


---------82:45----------
finding your tarma as if it's like one


---------82:47----------
parma so the Dharma evolved over time


---------82:49----------
mm-hmm so this is only my Dharma for now


---------82:52----------
and for people who are looking for their


---------82:53----------
Dharma it's not like you have to find


---------82:55----------
the one thing that is your Dharma so


---------82:57----------
what is your Dharma today


---------82:58----------
what is your daughter my now so I think


---------83:01----------
like your and I think the majority of


---------83:03----------
you guys are in something called


---------83:04----------
brahmacari ashram so I gotta make a


---------83:07----------
video about these which is that you guys


---------83:12----------
are in the training phase you guys are


---------83:14----------
in the learning phase because you're


---------83:16----------
you're not prepared to do [ __ ] like you


---------83:20----------
guys have to understand that in order


---------83:22----------
for me to do this Dharma I had to train


---------83:24----------
for 15 years and during those 15 years


---------83:27----------
like I thought I was gonna be a lot of


---------83:28----------
things that I was not originally it was


---------83:30----------
a monk then it was a doctor and then


---------83:32----------
before was a doctor was originally I was


---------83:34----------
gonna be an oncologist and you know save


---------83:36----------
lives and then I had to go through the


---------83:38----------
struggle of quote-unquote not being a


---------83:39----------
real doctor by being a psychiatrist


---------83:41----------
because psychiatrists aren't real


---------83:43----------
doctors and I might you know had to deal


---------83:44----------
with ORS and things like that and then I


---------83:46----------
was gonna be a psychiatrist and now I


---------83:47----------
realized actually like psychiatrist is


---------83:49----------
not I mean that's just my background


---------83:51----------
mm-hm but what I want to do is this yeah


---------83:57----------
well you're very good at it


---------83:59----------
thank you


---------84:04----------
does that answer your question


---------84:07----------
yes it does


---------84:09----------
question 2 I read this book about Kriya


---------84:16----------
yoga okay and I wonder if you have any


---------84:20----------
thoughts on specifically Kriya yoga what


---------84:25----------
is your understand why don't we why


---------84:26----------
don't we start by explaining what Kriya


---------84:28----------
Yoga is so I am confuzzled about like a


---------84:38----------
Korea is like a repetition okay that


---------84:42----------
right


---------84:42----------
sure so Korea has one root in the word


---------84:46----------
action yes and and the the like it's


---------84:55----------
kind of separate from hatha yoga hmm


---------84:59----------
which is like the kind of westernized


---------85:03----------
version of yoga truth or the one that


---------85:06----------
the West is kind of adopted rather very


---------85:08----------
good good and like it seems to be


---------85:16----------
primarily about like it is very chakra


---------85:22----------
focused and very breath focused mm-hmm


---------85:27----------
and it's been a difficult book to kind


---------85:33----------
of digest there's a ton of like there's


---------85:38----------
a glossary in the back of all the like


---------85:41----------
Sanskrit words yeah and like half of the


---------85:45----------
actual words in the book are in the


---------85:47----------
glossary like half of the light weirdest


---------85:49----------
yeah words so but I there's a there's a


---------85:56----------
YouTube channel that I watch for


---------85:59----------
spirituality a lot called actualize that


---------86:01----------
board and he talked about Kriya yoga as


---------86:06----------
being kind of the like basically the


---------86:10----------
most direct no [ __ ] kind of


---------86:15----------
enlighten


---------86:17----------
path trip for yoga and that's something


---------86:23----------
I'm very much attracted to is the


---------86:27----------
concept of spiritual enlightenment okay


---------86:32----------
Kundalini


---------86:33----------
so let's okay so I don't know exactly


---------86:39----------
what your question is but my guess is


---------86:41----------
that you just want general elucidation


---------86:43----------
about all of that yes right okay so so


---------86:49----------
this is good okay so what I'm making a


---------86:52----------
list of like videos I need to make so


---------86:54----------
let me try to answer your question let's


---------86:55----------
start with basics okay so Korea I think


---------86:58----------
has it's unscrew through tin the word


---------87:00----------
action and really uh is the systematic


---------87:04----------
process of refining and improving your


---------87:06----------
consciousness so we have this thing


---------87:09----------
called consciousness and what is


---------87:13----------
consciousness so I I don't know how to


---------87:15----------
put this but you know there are times in


---------87:17----------
your experience where you're able to


---------87:20----------
wrap your head around an understanding


---------87:23----------
right like you like it's like the light


---------87:25----------
bulb going off or you fully understand


---------87:27----------
something or you have this brilliant


---------87:29----------
idea or you connect a couple of things


---------87:31----------
and there are other times where you sort


---------87:34----------
of like remember sort of what you


---------87:36----------
understood but you don't quite


---------87:37----------
understand it now does that make sense


---------87:40----------
mm-hm and and so even today like you've


---------87:44----------
said that intellectually you're


---------87:46----------
beginning to understand how maybe like


---------87:48----------
potential is a burden instead of an


---------87:50----------
advantage and maybe you haven't really


---------87:52----------
squandered things and it's been hard for


---------87:53----------
you but your consciousness has not


---------87:56----------
wrapped its head around that concept you


---------87:59----------
can understand it intellectually but you


---------88:01----------
don't sort of understand that like you


---------88:05----------
use the word is body yeah use the word


---------88:08----------
embodied so you have an embodied to that


---------88:10----------
concept but you understand it


---------88:12----------
intellectually so the first thing to


---------88:14----------
understand is that consciousness is not


---------88:16----------
the intellect consciousness is that


---------88:18----------
thing which allows you to embody that


---------88:21----------
knowledge it's allowed it allowed a


---------88:25----------
higher state of consciousness allows you


---------88:27----------
to quote-unquote get it


---------88:30----------
if you think about how people change


---------88:33----------
people who get it start to change their


---------88:36----------
behavior and people who don't get it


---------88:38----------
start to not change their behavior or


---------88:41----------
don't change their behavior right when


---------88:43----------
you think about Terry Crews embodying


---------88:44----------
you and taking control of you what


---------88:48----------
you're essentially saying is that


---------88:49----------
someone who gets it is gonna start


---------88:51----------
taking control of me and I don't get it


---------88:53----------
so it's hard for me to change mm-hmm so


---------88:55----------
the hard thing about this whole process


---------88:57----------
is that I can share with you guys


---------89:00----------
information but I can't make you get it


---------89:02----------
you can lead a horse to water yeah you


---------89:05----------
can't make them drink so part of what I


---------89:07----------
try to do is like help people get it


---------89:10----------
because that's where change comes from


---------89:12----------
and sometimes what I basically try to do


---------89:15----------
is cultivate like a certain kind of


---------89:17----------
consciousness and those are the


---------89:18----------
quote-unquote breakthroughs that you


---------89:20----------
guys see on stream right and everyone


---------89:23----------
like longs for that because when they


---------89:25----------
look at that they see like okay this


---------89:26----------
something has changed in this person you


---------89:29----------
guys can look at someone and you can say


---------89:30----------
like something has changed in this


---------89:32----------
person is that happen to you yet on


---------89:34----------
stream today I mean I haven't had like a


---------89:39----------
mystical experience like like that guy


---------89:43----------
who was the insel quote-unquote yeah


---------89:46----------
that was a [ __ ] wire broke down and


---------89:47----------
he was like sobbing and laughing at the


---------89:50----------
same time that was like very very


---------89:52----------
beautiful yeah so hasn't happened for


---------89:55----------
you right I think we'd all be able so


---------89:57----------
it's not I've had this kind of like


---------89:59----------
building energy this whole time like it


---------90:05----------
almost feels like the sensation of like


---------90:08----------
nervousness or excitement it's like it


---------90:14----------
it's like a dispersed diffused version


---------90:18----------
of that nothing of the so you were in


---------90:22----------
the process of coalescing right as it


---------90:26----------
builds you're coalescing and


---------90:28----------
concentrating we're not there yet I


---------90:29----------
don't think we're gonna get there today


---------90:30----------
which is fine so let's just first


---------90:33----------
understand that this is what


---------90:34----------
consciousness is so Kriya yoga is in a


---------90:39----------
sense it's a direct path because the


---------90:41----------
focus is not on something else the focus


---------90:43----------
is on


---------90:44----------
what are the practices that refine our


---------90:46----------
consciousness what are the practices


---------90:48----------
that enhance our consciousness that's


---------90:49----------
what Kriya Yoga is about so in some ways


---------90:52----------
it is a very direct path but I want you


---------90:55----------
guys to understand that you know saying


---------90:56----------
one path of yoga is more direct than


---------90:59----------
another path of yoga isn't of itself a


---------91:01----------
comparison and therefore false there is


---------91:03----------
no better path of yoga than they're just


---------91:06----------
different kinds of yoga just like there


---------91:07----------
are different kinds of people it's kind


---------91:09----------
of like saying which job is the best


---------91:11----------
it's like there isn't a best job it


---------91:13----------
depends on the person so Kriya yoga is


---------91:17----------
just kind of a systematic process of


---------91:19----------
refining one's consciousness and I think


---------91:21----------
it is a relatively speaking a direct


---------91:23----------
path it is also relatively speaking very


---------91:25----------
difficult yeah cuz you're directly


---------91:28----------
engaging with the stuff it's kind of


---------91:30----------
like you know it there's a certain


---------91:34----------
purity of it which makes it more potent


---------91:37----------
but that purity also makes it more


---------91:39----------
difficult like you can't it's kind of


---------91:42----------
like saying you know rock climbing is a


---------91:46----------
more direct workout than climbing stairs


---------91:49----------
like you're gonna like you're gonna get


---------91:51----------
more in shape by rock climbing than you


---------91:54----------
will by climbing stairs yeah but it's


---------91:56----------
also way [ __ ] harder to do and it


---------91:58----------
doesn't mean that it's actually the best


---------92:00----------
path because climbing stairs is like


---------92:02----------
pretty doable and we can start low and


---------92:04----------
go slow and you can kind of get there in


---------92:06----------
the end


---------92:06----------
yeah so is rock climbing better or is


---------92:09----------
using a stair stepper like better


---------92:12----------
there's just two different exactly so is


---------92:15----------
one more correct yes but it also means


---------92:17----------
that it's more difficult yeah so let's


---------92:20----------
talk for a second about hatha yoga so


---------92:22----------
Hut or Hut is translated the Sun script


---------92:26----------
word for adamantite right so like it


---------92:29----------
yeah right so Hut is is about severity


---------92:34----------
Hut is about directness


---------92:37----------
it's about steadiness and it's kind of


---------92:41----------
like physical so hearty Yoga is also


---------92:42----------
pretty badass


---------92:43----------
Hachi Yoga is the idea that you can just


---------92:46----------
use your [ __ ] body to get enlightened


---------92:48----------
all this [ __ ] consciousness [ __ ]


---------92:51----------
and this thinking and contemplation and


---------92:53----------
enlightenment and coalescing of energies


---------92:55----------
and chakras and OH


---------92:57----------
and be in touch with yourself in


---------92:59----------
essential oils hotter yoga's like [ __ ]


---------93:02----------
that we are gonna train your body until


---------93:04----------
you become enlightened and that's enough


---------93:07----------
just body body body body body the reason


---------93:11----------
that it's expanded so easily in the West


---------93:14----------
is because Kriya Yoga is hard to do and


---------93:16----------
we are so spiritually starved is a


---------93:19----------
population that hot to yoga gives us


---------93:22----------
like it's a very easy sequence of things


---------93:24----------
that you can start doing that helps


---------93:26----------
people like feel better in weird ways


---------93:28----------
that they don't even understand so hot


---------93:30----------
yoga is very accessible I don't think of


---------93:33----------
it as inferior I used to but I've come


---------93:36----------
to realize that that's just [ __ ]


---------93:37----------
arrogance and ego and that there is a 26


---------93:41----------
year old woman named Stephanie who is


---------93:43----------
just as likely at becoming enlightened


---------93:46----------
by going to a yoga studio five days a


---------93:48----------
week as I am despite all of my extensive


---------93:51----------
hardcore going to India [ __ ] right she


---------93:54----------
can just do yoga and not understand what


---------93:56----------
the [ __ ] she's doing she can still get


---------93:58----------
enlightened not any better or worse than


---------94:00----------
I am


---------94:00----------
so hot yoga is good because it's


---------94:03----------
accessible it's easy you don't have to


---------94:04----------
you know and it you can still go


---------94:06----------
hardcore because like that's where all


---------94:08----------
the human pretzel stuff comes in right


---------94:11----------
so to do the Basia for an hour I'll show


---------94:13----------
you guys a particular posture like


---------94:14----------
towards the end of stream right which


---------94:16----------
you guys can try that's gonna be our


---------94:17----------
meditative practice for the day so you


---------94:19----------
guys can try to do the traditional


---------94:21----------
tapasya which means penance posture


---------94:24----------
which is a yoga posture or meditative


---------94:27----------
posture which has to do with the


---------94:28----------
accumulation of spiritual energy teach


---------94:31----------
you a relatively direct version of that


---------94:33----------
okay so that's what hatha yoga is so you


---------94:37----------
understand what Kriya Yoga is and what


---------94:39----------
hatha yoga is yeah any questions about


---------94:41----------
that so far


---------94:43----------
um I I don't I think it was you who said


---------94:48----------
this in a previous video or stream but


---------94:51----------
you said that Yoga is like preparation


---------94:54----------
for meditation does that sound familiar


---------94:57----------
yep so what that so yoga does not


---------94:59----------
actually mean yeah so Yoga is not what


---------95:03----------
is not Hutta yoga right so a Sun which


---------95:06----------
is postures physical postures so when


---------95:08----------
you go to a yoga studio you're not doing


---------95:10----------
yoga what you're


---------95:11----------
doing is a senora sauna mm-hmm we just


---------95:14----------
translate that as yoga but that's not


---------95:17----------
really what yoga is the root word of


---------95:19----------
yoga's video what is yoga the root word


---------95:27----------
of yoga is huge which means union or


---------95:30----------
yoke so this is kind of what I love


---------95:33----------
about Sun script is like you know a lot


---------95:34----------
of the stuff a lot of realizations are


---------95:36----------
kind of paradoxical like when you really


---------95:39----------
understand something it's sort of


---------95:40----------
paradoxical yeah like potential is not


---------95:43----------
really an advantage it's a burden which


---------95:46----------
is kind of paradoxical and I think the


---------95:48----------
closer that you get to truly


---------95:49----------
understanding something the more


---------95:51----------
paradoxical it kind of becomes even


---------95:53----------
though you understand it so what is yoga


---------95:57----------
so yoga is who comes from the Sanskrit


---------95:59----------
word huge which means union or yoke and


---------96:02----------
that's kind of weird because yoke is not


---------96:04----------
y ou LK it's y ou ke do you know what a


---------96:07----------
yoke is like a yoke that pulls a wagon


---------96:14----------
or exactly exactly so it's y ou ke like


---------96:17----------
so a yoke is something that binds the


---------96:21----------
wagon to like the cow or the buffalo or


---------96:23----------
the bull or the horse right it's yoked


---------96:26----------
it's bound so yoga is and it also means


---------96:31----------
Union which is sort of bound or unbound


---------96:34----------
any what what that means is is that Yoga


---------96:37----------
is the process of becoming one with the


---------96:40----------
infinite so there's this idea and yoga


---------96:42----------
that we have an individual soul and that


---------96:44----------
the individual soul is a piece of


---------96:46----------
something called Barham admin which is


---------96:48----------
the universal soul so that the basic


---------96:50----------
unit of existence is consciousness and


---------96:52----------
that we sort of separate from the cosmic


---------96:55----------
consciousness to become an individual


---------96:57----------
unit of consciousness which is like a


---------96:59----------
self and the goal of yoga is to rejoin


---------97:02----------
with like a droplet that gets pulled out


---------97:04----------
of the ocean


---------97:05----------
- like rejoin with the ocean you know if


---------97:07----------
we kind of think about it like when a


---------97:09----------
droplet separates so are there droplets


---------97:12----------
in the ocean yeah really I I mean


---------97:21----------
I guess a droplet is defined by by its


---------97:25----------
distinction it's barriers excellent


---------97:27----------
right yeah so that is a moment of


---------97:31----------
consciousness right so you repeat it and


---------97:33----------
then you stopped and you thought and


---------97:35----------
you've learned something so the droplet


---------97:37----------
only exists outside of the ocean and


---------97:40----------
when a droplet goes back into the ocean


---------97:42----------
what happens to the droplet non-duality


---------97:47----------
what does that mean speak plainly it is


---------97:53----------
reabsorbed into itself which is its


---------97:57----------
natural form yes so if I pull a droplet


---------98:02----------
out of the ocean again is it the same as


---------98:04----------
the droplet before no is it different


---------98:09----------
from the droplet before the individual


---------98:15----------
molecules possibly are possibly right so


---------98:20----------
the short answer is possibly so what is


---------98:23----------
the relation between two droplets maybe


---------98:25----------
there's something the same maybe there's


---------98:27----------
something different so this is what they


---------98:29----------
mean by Atman and Paramatma


---------98:31----------
so you were an individual person and


---------98:34----------
you've kind of separated from something


---------98:36----------
and yoga is the process of rejoining


---------98:39----------
that thing that's the true self okay and


---------98:43----------
that's why I like in any way hard to


---------98:45----------
understand this stuff you really have to


---------98:46----------
experience it so yoga is the process of


---------98:49----------
rejoining that thing that's what it


---------98:50----------
means by Union and at the same time it


---------98:53----------
is also the process of unyoke injure


---------98:55----------
self so it's the process of B becoming


---------98:59----------
unbound to this person that you are in


---------99:03----------
this life so when we think about the


---------99:05----------
identity and the ego generally speaking


---------99:07----------
we become happier as we become unbound


---------99:10----------
from ourselves when you get caught up in


---------99:13----------
being popular in high school you're very


---------99:15----------
bound to your identity you're trapped by


---------99:18----------
it and it [ __ ] sucks


---------99:19----------
as you become unbound from your identity


---------99:22----------
or your ego you start to chill out and


---------99:24----------
you start to enjoy things more so Yoga


---------99:27----------
is the process of becoming unbound and


---------99:30----------
at the same time becoming joined with


---------99:33----------
something else


---------99:35----------
so it's kind of like binding and bun


---------99:37----------
unbinding at the same time mm-hmm okay


---------99:40----------
so there are many paths to get to Yoga


---------99:42----------
Kriya Yoga is one hot - Yoga is another


---------99:45----------
and you just have to figure out what's


---------99:48----------
kind of right for you mm-hmm now chakras


---------99:51----------
involve more Kundalini Yoga so Kundalini


---------99:54----------
Yoga is sort of the the path of so you


---------99:59----------
can think about it this way there are a


---------100:00----------
thousand like how how many ways are


---------100:02----------
there for a droplet to get back in the


---------100:03----------
ocean basically right so you can become


---------100:08----------
rain you can become river you can become


---------100:10----------
mist you can you know there are all


---------100:12----------
kinds of ways you can be carried people


---------100:13----------
can dump you in the ocean there are a


---------100:15----------
lot of different ways to rejoin and


---------100:17----------
that's what the different paths of yoga


---------100:18----------
is reine better than the river no it's a


---------100:25----------
dumb question different yeah it's like


---------100:26----------
just it doesn't even compute right so is


---------100:29----------
Kriya yoga better than hot yoga not


---------100:31----------
necessarily it's just you have to figure


---------100:32----------
out what it is it sounds to me like


---------100:34----------
you're not ready for Kriya yoga yet so


---------100:37----------
Kriya Yoga is an advanced practice and I


---------100:39----------
would say that people should start with


---------100:41----------
basic practices even if you guys want to


---------100:43----------
get to the hardcore [ __ ] which I'm with


---------100:45----------
you a hundred percent because I love the


---------100:46----------
hardcore [ __ ] I have in like I mean now


---------100:49----------
less so but for a long time I had kind


---------100:51----------
of this ego thing where I want to do


---------100:52----------
like hardcore spirituality and go to an


---------100:54----------
ashram instead of go to a yoga studio


---------100:57----------
where like Stephanie and Michelle are


---------100:59----------
doing their Osun and then getting like


---------101:00----------
their bleach blonde hair dye hair right


---------101:03----------
yeah that's like part of the paradox


---------101:04----------
isn't it yeah all of it is the entire


---------101:07----------
pursuit is ego even the pursuit of like


---------101:11----------
you know removing your ego and yes


---------101:15----------
returning - yes


---------101:17----------
so so I would say that for you Milo


---------101:22----------
you're your biggest step is actually


---------101:24----------
probably going to a humdrum yoga class


---------101:27----------
go into what you could humdrum yoga


---------101:29----------
class okay right so I think you need to


---------101:33----------
go there you need to do those practices


---------101:35----------
not only will it help you but you'll


---------101:37----------
have to grapple with your ego and you'll


---------101:39----------
have to admit that you have to go the


---------101:41----------
slow route just the same as everyone


---------101:42----------
else instead of ordering that secret


---------101:45----------
power book


---------101:48----------
the secret power that like that will


---------101:50----------
accelerate a [ __ ] no man I'm all for


---------101:53----------
forbidden knowledge and all that good


---------101:54----------
stuff I love that kind of stuff but you


---------101:57----------
know just start low and go slow and I'll


---------101:59----------
teach you a practice today if you want


---------102:00----------
to go hardcore okay does that answer


---------102:03----------
your questions yeah 100%


---------102:06----------
okay all right so shall we transition to


---------102:10----------
practice sure okay so I'm gonna teach


---------102:14----------
you guys the bus yeah okay so this is


---------102:20----------
gonna be hard to explain and I can't


---------102:21----------
hear you now okay


---------102:47----------
yeah so your your can you hear me


---------102:53----------
not oh you have headphones okay so your


---------102:55----------
heel and leg should be above your knee


---------102:58----------
on your inner thigh good


---------103:04----------
all right so practice that and then you


---------103:06----------
can go to the other side


---------103:28----------
yeah so you guys should try this at home


---------103:32----------
give it a shot so breathe my little


---------103:39----------
breathe it'll make it easier deep breath


---------103:40----------
in and deep breath out there you go just


---------103:45----------
make sure you keep breathing stability


---------103:49----------
comes from breath look at that all you


---------103:52----------
have to do is breathe [ __ ] weird but


---------103:54----------
just keep doing it you guys see that let


---------103:58----------
go of the tension focus on your breath


---------104:00----------
and see what your body is capable of


---------104:05----------
beautiful


---------104:13----------
if you're having difficulty just focus


---------104:15----------
on your breath


---------104:16----------
hold the position go ahead and switch


---------104:21----------
over to the other side right so no


---------104:25----------
preparatory practice for us today no


---------104:28----------
basic asana and breathe if you want to


---------104:37----------
make it easier on yourself you can open


---------104:39----------
your eyes because your your brain has


---------104:41----------
three different circuits that regulate


---------104:44----------
balance


---------104:46----------
eyes will help eyes open will help you


---------104:49----------
balance continue breathing and now relax


---------104:57----------
close your eyes let your arms come down


---------105:00----------
leg come down and just feel your body


---------105:21----------
just sit in the space of your mind


---------105:25----------
notice what your Brock is doing


---------105:48----------
go ahead and come back hardcore enough


---------106:03----------
for you yeah that'll do how was it a


---------106:09----------
hardcore hardcore part is like doing


---------106:13----------
that every [ __ ] day doing anything


---------106:15----------
every pick [ __ ] day I think it's the


---------106:17----------
really tricky aspect so the Basia is


---------106:21----------
good because it is hard so I think this


---------106:25----------
is a very good practice to train


---------106:27----------
yourself to do something every day I


---------106:29----------
don't know how else do I feel like the


---------106:31----------
Basia makes it the amount of focus that


---------106:35----------
you gained from doing that the bus your


---------106:37----------
practice what you really are doing is it


---------106:40----------
requires like a full forced


---------106:42----------
concentration of the mind and that kind


---------106:45----------
of XP gain like levels up your ability


---------106:47----------
to like stick with something does that


---------106:51----------
make sense it's like a psycho somatic


---------106:55----------
spiritual practice that I think like


---------106:58----------
literally boosts your like willpower so


---------107:01----------
it's like it's a powerful technique that


---------107:03----------
is designed to accumulate energy like


---------107:06----------
spiritual energy and then the more


---------107:07----------
spiritual energy you accumulate the


---------107:09----------
easier it is to manifest things in the


---------107:11----------
real world and if we think about doing


---------107:13----------
something every day like those those


---------107:16----------
things that are that are manifest when


---------107:18----------
something when your intentions become a


---------107:20----------
reality that requires where you smiling


---------107:25----------
know what don't worry well okay when you


---------107:30----------
think about manifesting a reality it


---------107:33----------
requires like focus every day so the


---------107:36----------
bossiest sort of directly allows you to


---------107:38----------
like gets you closer to manifestation


---------107:42----------
okay questions before we wrap up for the


---------107:45----------
day


---------107:48----------
all right one more so I meditate every


---------107:53----------
day I've meditated before stream man I


---------107:56----------
am like all I do is just sit and try and


---------108:03----------
focus on my breath to the point where


---------108:06----------
like I have no thoughts I used to like I


---------108:14----------
used to kind of be in that space be able


---------108:16----------
to kind of be in like a um


---------108:21----------
a mindful I think my bliss is better


---------108:23----------
worth and mindful but a mindless a


---------108:26----------
mindless state for like like three to


---------108:30----------
five seconds at a time maybe when I when


---------108:33----------
I really have my routine going in


---------108:36----------
college and lately I'm not sure if it


---------108:43----------
has anything to do with like the


---------108:44----------
medication I'm taking or anything but


---------108:46----------
it's almost impossible to I mean I've


---------108:50----------
been meditating every day for like three


---------108:52----------
months and it's almost impossible to


---------108:54----------
kind of return to that space yeah so


---------108:58----------
what was your experience what was your


---------109:00----------
mind doing what was happening within you


---------109:02----------
during that the Bastia practice during


---------109:06----------
what we I don't know so I hang tension


---------109:14----------
yeah so think about that for a second


---------109:17----------
right when when are you not aware of


---------109:20----------
what you're when can you not remember


---------109:22----------
what your mind is doing when can you not


---------109:29----------
remember what your mind is doing yeah


---------109:31----------
when can you not remember what your mind


---------109:33----------
was doing let's put it that way to be


---------109:36----------
more precise uh when you weren't


---------109:40----------
conscious absent the time right so when


---------109:44----------
your mind was not active or was not


---------109:47----------
awake so I think that that the focusing


---------109:52----------
on the breath practice is too simple for


---------109:53----------
you like you can continue doing it if


---------109:56----------
you want but if you're interested in


---------109:57----------
Kriya yoga you need more intensive


---------109:59----------
meditation practices that


---------110:01----------
force the focus of your car the


---------110:04----------
concentration of your mind and I think


---------110:06----------
you were concentrating very very heavily


---------110:08----------
with very little mental activity during


---------110:10----------
that the bus your practice which is why


---------110:12----------
you don't really remember thinking about


---------110:14----------
stuff right you weren't like thinking


---------110:16----------
about the weather or whatever your sly


---------110:18----------
smile a few seconds ago were like those


---------110:20----------
are all false you weren't doing that it


---------110:21----------
was just a struggle and like your mind


---------110:24----------
was the position of your body was


---------110:28----------
demanding the focus of your mind it's


---------110:30----------
like we don't have time to think about


---------110:31----------
anything we're trying to just keep it


---------110:34----------
together and then you may have sent like


---------110:37----------
a direction to your mind you could say


---------110:38----------
okay breathe and then as you breathe


---------110:40----------
things calm down but like that's exactly


---------110:43----------
what you need you need a meditative


---------110:44----------
practice that demands the attention of


---------110:47----------
your consciousness and your focus yeah


---------110:49----------
and it's not


---------110:50----------
you shouldn't have to struggle to do it


---------110:52----------
like it's not a struggle because it you


---------110:54----------
just you can't [ __ ] if I were to tell


---------110:56----------
you so get up again do that the bus your


---------111:01----------
practice


---------111:13----------
okay so like your mind is pretty active


---------111:15----------
right now so close your eye never you


---------111:17----------
need to to hold it focus on breathing


---------111:22----------
and now tell me about the last match of


---------111:26----------
war three you played when tauren


---------111:34----------
chieftain with head honors what's


---------111:37----------
happening to you failing to balance good


---------111:42----------
so let your balance return whatever you


---------111:52----------
need to good


---------111:57----------
what was the enemy hero in that match


---------112:04----------
how did the match go I lost


---------112:11----------
tell me about over the the history of


---------112:15----------
warfare have you had a favorite patch


---------112:27----------
okay so what is your mind what do you


---------112:31----------
notice within yourself as I'm asking you


---------112:33----------
these questions a lot of tension my body


---------112:36----------
okay so I would imagine that there are


---------112:40----------
periods of intense focus that it's


---------112:43----------
almost like like what you're doing is


---------112:46----------
throwing a ball up in the air and trying


---------112:48----------
to do something like when I ask you a


---------112:50----------
question it's like you're throwing a


---------112:51----------
ball up in the air and you're trying to


---------112:53----------
answer it before your attention returns


---------112:55----------
to the body does that make sense yeah


---------113:02----------
yep so come back down so it's


---------113:07----------
interesting right like that try as you


---------113:11----------
might to activate your mind your answers


---------113:13----------
were [ __ ] slow like you were saying


---------113:16----------
like one or two words and if I ask you


---------113:21----------
about like your experiences in War three


---------113:23----------
now I'm sure you would be fluent in it


---------113:24----------
but your mind is like you're trying to


---------113:26----------
like jumpstart your mom


---------113:27----------
but the practice is like no [ __ ] we


---------113:29----------
don't have time for your mind right now


---------113:31----------
so that's what a meditative practice


---------113:33----------
should be the purpose of asana and this


---------113:35----------
is why Austen is so good is because it


---------113:37----------
automatically you don't have a choice it


---------113:39----------
makes it easy for you to concentrate and


---------113:42----------
then like the second your mind starts


---------113:44----------
thinking it's like you start wobbling


---------113:47----------
and you were getting better at it


---------113:48----------
because you were getting better at


---------113:49----------
almost throwing it up okay I'm gonna


---------113:51----------
have a thought and then back to focus


---------113:52----------
I'm gonna have a thought and back to


---------113:54----------
focus and if you think about a


---------113:56----------
mindfulness practice it's the opposite


---------113:58----------
it's lots and lots of lots of thoughts a


---------114:00----------
little bit of focus lots and lots and


---------114:02----------
lots of lots of thoughts a little bit of


---------114:03----------
focus yeah and so meditation is not


---------114:07----------
supposed to be hard like if you


---------114:10----------
understand meditation and so I think the


---------114:12----------
biggest problem with meditation is that


---------114:14----------
people learned a certain kind of


---------114:16----------
meditation and we're taught by gurus who


---------114:18----------
understood meditation and then they


---------114:20----------
became certified teachers and started


---------114:23----------
teaching the protocol and they lost the


---------114:26----------
knowledge of how to teach meditation


---------114:27----------
because we care about certifications and


---------114:30----------
if you get if you take this eight-week


---------114:32----------
course then you are a meditation teacher


---------114:33----------
and you can go and teach others and they


---------114:35----------
all teach the same technique the same


---------114:37----------
techniques they inject the same


---------114:38----------
techniques because and that's what


---------114:40----------
mindfulness is mindfulness is like one


---------114:42----------
of the thousand different techniques of


---------114:43----------
meditation and if you learn the right


---------114:47----------
technique of meditation you can [ __ ]


---------114:49----------
try to start your mind and it's gonna


---------114:50----------
stop it's not gonna work it's like your


---------114:53----------
battery is dead so do the bus yeah all


---------115:00----------
right okay


---------115:02----------
questions thoughts I love you love you


---------115:08----------
too man


---------115:08----------
good luck well you're most welcome


---------115:12----------
we're rooting for you come back and be a


---------115:14----------
success story for us keep going oh thank


---------115:17----------
you


---------115:18----------
also last thing I was just I was


---------115:20----------
supposed to talk to you about


---------115:21----------
intelligence I think you are intelligent


---------115:22----------
I think you just need to understand that


---------115:25----------
you're it doesn't have to do with the


---------115:26----------
ego I think you're very smart


---------115:28----------
but that's separate it's just a tool


---------115:31----------
it's like one of the stats on your


---------115:32----------
character sheet you know you don't have


---------115:34----------
to get egotistical about it but you also


---------115:35----------
don't need to think of yourself as not


---------115:37----------
intelligent because that too is


---------115:39----------
egotistical


---------115:40----------
Yeah right so like your intelligence is


---------115:43----------
what it is in the same way that your


---------115:44----------
height is what it is and that your you


---------115:46----------
know your eyes are the color that they


---------115:47----------
are it is just one attribute of you it


---------115:49----------
is just a fact it does not need to be


---------115:52----------
exciting nor does it need to be


---------115:54----------
disappointing neither of those things


---------115:56----------
yeah I just wish it wasn't such a


---------115:58----------
worshipped quality beautifully put what


---------116:03----------
do you mean by that can you explain that


---------116:07----------
it's just like a dick swinging contest


---------116:13----------
basically sometimes just trying to seem


---------116:17----------
smarter than someone else and it's a


---------116:18----------
waste of energy I think the reason that


---------116:20----------
it's worshipped is actually a little bit


---------116:22----------
of a mistake because I think we use


---------116:26----------
intelligence is an umbrella term for all


---------116:29----------
kinds of capabilities that different


---------116:32----------
people have but really what we're saying


---------116:34----------
is capable and we just call it an


---------116:36----------
intelligent but it's all kinds of things


---------116:38----------
it's hard work it's willpower its


---------116:40----------
humility its practice its intelligence


---------116:43----------
but we just call them oh he's so smart


---------116:45----------
what that really means is good at


---------116:46----------
something mm-hmm but anyway you know


---------116:50----------
when you look at someone who's fluent in


---------116:51----------
a language they you say oh that person


---------116:53----------
is so smart you don't see the thousands


---------116:54----------
of hours that they put in it's not that


---------116:56----------
they're smart yeah I practice one quote


---------116:59----------
from this cria book see if I can find it


---------117:08----------
it was something like the dedicated


---------117:14----------
person of average intelligence is


---------117:17----------
capable of much more than the lazy or


---------117:19----------
erratic genius absolutely right and


---------117:23----------
twitch at could have told you that


---------117:24----------
because we're all erratic Eunice's and


---------117:26----------
no one none of us have ever [ __ ]


---------117:28----------
anywhere sure real yeah so we'll stop on


---------117:32----------
that sentiment thanks for coming on Milo


---------117:34----------
just working and keep doing what you're


---------117:36----------
doing I think you're on a good path just


---------117:38----------
keep trucking all right thank you so


---------117:40----------
much doctor take care
