---------00:00----------
you have a muscle that you can use to


---------00:04----------
have your penis flop up and down you all


---------00:06----------
know what i'm talking about


---------00:09----------
penis-flopping muscle


---------00:13----------
yeah so this is a meditation someone


---------00:14----------
someone's asking a meditation that helps


---------00:16----------
with no fat this is this will do that


---------00:18----------
okay


---------00:18----------
so what i'm going to teach y'all is a


---------00:20----------
mulat chakra meditation


---------00:23----------
so the muladhara chakra is the root


---------00:25----------
chakra and remember that in the like the


---------00:27----------
kundalini system


---------00:30----------
there's this idea that we have these


---------00:31----------
seven major chakras which are like


---------00:34----------
energy hubs


---------00:36----------
and that each chakra governs a


---------00:38----------
particular like attribute hormonal


---------00:41----------
psychological spiritual whatever


---------00:43----------
so for example um


---------00:45----------
[Music]


---------00:46----------
i do third eye or agna chakra


---------00:48----------
meditations i've been doing them for


---------00:50----------
about 17 years i have like a consistent


---------00:52----------
practice that i do and i believe it


---------00:53----------
helps me become a good psychiatrist so


---------00:56----------
my intuition so the agna chakra governs


---------00:58----------
intuition and understanding so my


---------01:00----------
intuition is pretty good and i lean on


---------01:02----------
that pretty heavily when i'm talking to


---------01:03----------
other human beings now do i think that


---------01:05----------
this is some kind of like mystical like


---------01:08----------
life hack or like spiritual hack


---------01:09----------
universe kind of stuff maybe i don't


---------01:11----------
really know but i think that what's


---------01:13----------
plausible and we have good evidence of


---------01:15----------
this is that different meditation


---------01:17----------
techniques


---------01:18----------
actually create different changes in the


---------01:21----------
brain so we know that different


---------01:22----------
meditation techniques will have


---------01:24----------
different eeg


---------01:26----------
readings so the electrical activity


---------01:29----------
is actually specific to the kind of


---------01:31----------
meditation technique that you do we also


---------01:33----------
have functional mri studies which looks


---------01:35----------
at blood flow to the brain and we know


---------01:37----------
from those studies that doing different


---------01:39----------
kinds of techniques will actually send


---------01:41----------
blood flow to different parts of our


---------01:42----------
brain


---------01:44----------
so my understanding as a scientist


---------01:46----------
is that essentially what people sort of


---------01:48----------
figured out is that like if you meditate


---------01:50----------
in a particular way it probably


---------01:52----------
stimulates a particular part of your


---------01:55----------
brain and


---------01:56----------
in some way so that's the best example


---------01:58----------
that's the best scientific hypothesis i


---------02:00----------
can come up with there actually is not


---------02:01----------
any evidence to that it's just


---------02:04----------
a hypothesis okay


---------02:06----------
so that being said we'll talk about i'll


---------02:07----------
give you guys just a couple of examples


---------02:09----------
so we do third eye practices like


---------02:10----------
charging the laser beam and then if you


---------02:12----------
guys have emotional digestion issues you


---------02:15----------
can do money board practices navel


---------02:17----------
chakra or agni oriented practices agni


---------02:21----------
is our metabolic fire so it takes things


---------02:23----------
it digests stuff


---------02:25----------
so for people who are who have trauma


---------02:27----------
and are trying to like digest their


---------02:29----------
trauma and move on i'll teach them navel


---------02:32----------
chakra or manipura chakra practices and


---------02:34----------
they seem to work really well i will not


---------02:36----------
teach them mindfulness mindfulness bad


---------02:38----------
idea for people with trauma and so now


---------02:40----------
what i'm going to teach you guys is some


---------02:42----------
muladhara root chakra practices


---------02:45----------
and the goal of these practices is that


---------02:47----------
the root chakra governs our impulsive


---------02:49----------
behavior and our animalistic instincts


---------02:52----------
it also um


---------02:54----------
governs like sexual impulsive like


---------02:56----------
sexual behavior and lustful thoughts


---------02:59----------
so we do know uh actually like so


---------03:01----------
there's actually good evidence of what


---------03:03----------
i'm about to share this is not what i


---------03:04----------
would recommend there's a particular


---------03:06----------
asan or or posture that i like to call


---------03:09----------
the nut buster asan


---------03:11----------
which is one where you press your heel


---------03:14----------
into the space between your so you sit


---------03:18----------
cross-legged but you kind of press your


---------03:19----------
heel


---------03:20----------
into the space between your scrotum and


---------03:23----------
your anus the taint and the interesting


---------03:25----------
thing is that you meditate in that


---------03:27----------
posture and what that's supposed to do


---------03:29----------
is like


---------03:30----------
take care of your muladhara chakra so


---------03:32----------
there's an interesting physiologic


---------03:33----------
reason for that is that the blood supply


---------03:35----------
to your gonads if you're male


---------03:39----------
is actually goes through the taint so


---------03:41----------
it's kind of like in the bottom so when


---------03:44----------
you press your heel there and you sit in


---------03:46----------
that posture what it actually probably


---------03:48----------
does physiologically is com restricts


---------03:50----------
the blood flow to your your testes and


---------03:53----------
then reduces


---------03:55----------
like it's almost like a temporary slight


---------03:57----------
like castration kind of effect right so


---------03:59----------
these are practices that you should


---------04:00----------
absolutely not do i'm just using it to


---------04:03----------
illustrate that there is some


---------04:04----------
physiologic evidence


---------04:06----------
that these kinds of practices do appear


---------04:09----------
to affect like lustfulness right so


---------04:11----------
that's not the one that we're gonna do


---------04:12----------
self vasectomy absolutely not vasectomy


---------04:15----------
is a completely different part of the


---------04:17----------
body


---------04:18----------
completely different


---------04:20----------
so there does seem to be some


---------04:21----------
physiologic evidence to support the


---------04:23----------
theories that the yogis did so we're not


---------04:25----------
gonna do that when i don't recommend it


---------04:27----------
so instead of what we're gonna do is a


---------04:28----------
very simple one which is uh essentially


---------04:31----------
it's gonna be hard to describe but


---------04:33----------
if you're a man


---------04:35----------
you have a muscle that you can use to


---------04:39----------
have your penis flop up and down you all


---------04:41----------
know what i'm talking about


---------04:43----------
penis-flopping muscle


---------04:48----------
okay


---------04:50----------
yep


---------04:52----------
so kegels pelvic floor exercises for


---------04:54----------
women


---------04:55----------
so what we're going to do is just


---------04:57----------
flex that muscle so what we're going to


---------05:00----------
do is breathe in and kind of flex it


---------05:02----------
contract hold


---------05:04----------
and then relax


---------05:06----------
okay so we'll do rounds of that kegels


---------05:08----------
so what you'll also notice is that it's


---------05:10----------
usually combined with the same muscle


---------05:13----------
that contracts the anus so you'll sort


---------05:15----------
of notice a universal tightening there


---------05:18----------
um and then the uh the muscle is also


---------05:20----------
used to prevent or stop the flow of


---------05:23----------
urine once it flows


---------05:25----------
okay


---------05:29----------
i know look chat so this is i know that


---------05:31----------
things are mimicked you guys understand


---------05:33----------
that like we're actually trying to teach


---------05:35----------
y'all something right like


---------05:36----------
like i i don't know how else to say this


---------05:38----------
i'm not trying to be obscene and if you


---------05:40----------
know if we get banned for this i'll


---------05:41----------
learn my lesson but


---------05:43----------
like


---------05:44----------
like so i'm a medical doctor and one of


---------05:46----------
the things that you learn as a medical


---------05:47----------
doctor is like we have a human body


---------05:49----------
right and like the penis vagina scrotum


---------05:53----------
are all


---------05:56----------
parts of our body


---------05:57----------
they're just parts of our body just like


---------05:59----------
our fingers and toes and eyes and nose


---------06:02----------
and so there are practices that involve


---------06:04----------
those parts of body just like our


---------06:05----------
stomach and like we don't have to be


---------06:07----------
like you know kindergarteners but


---------06:10----------
penis


---------06:12----------
i mean i i sort of i mean i personally


---------06:15----------
find it funny too so i get where you all


---------06:16----------
are coming from but like let's try to do


---------06:17----------
the practice a little bit seriously okay


---------06:21----------
so


---------06:26----------
oh my god what have i done


---------06:29----------
chad oh my god


---------06:31----------
i just had a realization of what the


---------06:33----------
stream has been like


---------06:35----------
okay whatever let's just focus


---------06:37----------
let's focus on our penis push-ups chat


---------06:40----------
okay so for women there's contraction


---------06:43----------
you can also kind of think a little bit


---------06:44----------
about


---------06:45----------
what you would do when you are trying to


---------06:47----------
stop the flow of urine through your


---------06:49----------
urethra and so you'll kind of have


---------06:52----------
a contraction there


---------06:54----------
if you know how to do kegel exercises


---------06:56----------
it's basically like the moonlit practice


---------06:58----------
so what i tend to find is that


---------07:00----------
so if you guys know the muscle we're


---------07:02----------
going to contract it so we're going to


---------07:03----------
breathe in and we're going to contract


---------07:05----------
at the same time


---------07:06----------
and what i want you all to kind of


---------07:07----------
imagine is like when you contract you'll


---------07:10----------
feel


---------07:11----------
it's like you're squeezing like the


---------07:12----------
bottom of like you know


---------07:15----------
some like a bag of fluid and then like


---------07:16----------
the fluid is going to go up right so


---------07:18----------
what i want you guys to imagine is


---------07:20----------
you're sending like the energy you're


---------07:22----------
going to feel that tension and energy


---------07:24----------
down there you're going to send it up


---------07:26----------
okay


---------07:27----------
so we're going to breathe in contract


---------07:29----------
and then exhale and relax


---------07:31----------
breathe in contract exhale and relax


---------07:34----------
breathe in contract exhale and relax


---------07:36----------
okay so we'll go ahead and do nine


---------07:38----------
rounds with our eyes closed


---------07:41----------
so go ahead and


---------07:43----------
close your eyes


---------07:44----------
take a deep breath in


---------07:47----------
contract


---------07:49----------
and exhale


---------07:52----------
[Music]


---------07:54----------
in


---------07:59----------
and relax


---------08:01----------
so contract with the exhalation that's


---------08:03----------
round two we're gonna do seven more in


---------08:13----------
going for four


---------08:24----------
round five


---------08:28----------
now


---------08:34----------
round six


---------08:38----------
and out


---------08:44----------
round


---------08:52----------
seven eight


---------08:57----------
and out


---------09:01----------
last round


---------09:09----------
now we're just going to relax


---------09:13----------
spend about 60 seconds


---------09:17----------
you can go into a different meditation


---------09:19----------
practice if you want to


---------09:22----------
or just observe your breath chant a


---------09:24----------
mantra charge your laser beam


---------09:28----------
you can do another kind of breathing


---------09:29----------
practice if you'd like


---------09:32----------
but take a moment to just notice the


---------09:33----------
relaxation


---------09:36----------
of your pelvic and genital area


---------09:43----------
will meditate silently for about 60 to


---------09:46----------
90 more seconds


---------10:30----------
me


---------11:09----------
now go ahead and


---------11:11----------
come on back


---------11:21----------
that sounds kind of weird but


---------11:24----------
in all seriousness maybe


---------11:26----------
trucker practices are what we're going


---------11:27----------
to need to protect ourselves from the


---------11:29----------
waifu revolution


---------11:31----------
because don't get me wrong chat there's


---------11:32----------
someone out there i was about to use the


---------11:34----------
word degenerate


---------11:36----------
it was dreaming up how to make the waifu


---------11:38----------
experience more real


---------11:43----------
but instead of degenerate maybe we will


---------11:45----------
say visionary one day


---------11:50----------
right because there's something about


---------11:53----------
hostess clubs only fans


---------11:58----------
waifu video games virtual reality haptic


---------12:01----------
feedback


---------12:03----------
some of that


---------12:04----------
is gonna come together


---------12:08----------
gotta be careful
